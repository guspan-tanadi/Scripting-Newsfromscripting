    "text": "I am subscribed to 470 feeds. You can view <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner\">my feed list</a> as a feed reader, because of a feature I added late in the development process. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU9yE_axytQ\">wedge next to each feed</a> expands the feed to show the most recent five items from the feed. With the <i>When</i> column selected, the feed list is in reverse chronologic order. This was not planned, I just put the sorting titles in because it made sense (it's a feature in most file systems). But when it started updating I realized this was something unique and powerful. A feed list that is also great for reading feeds. They update pretty frequently, so there probably should be a feature that disables automatic updating temporarily. There is such a feature in the Settings dialog, but it's hard to remember that you've set it. ",
