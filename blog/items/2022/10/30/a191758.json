Warning what would happen if a Republican bought Twitter. Has anyone heard Musk say he's trying to protect American democracy? A realist would have to say at this point that American democracy is not a good bet. I think it's pretty much already gone folks. Musk has opened his channel with Putin, and the two are going to exchange favors. Musk is in a stronger position than Trump was, probably even when Trump was president. He has all this money Trump never had. And now he has a platform more powerful than all the newspapers in the world. ",
