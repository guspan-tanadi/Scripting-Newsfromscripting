Most people who do podcasting don't know why they can do it without Apple's approval, or Google's or Spotify. Yet RSS gets no credit for it. And that hurts other efforts to create open architecture for the web. People don't see the benefit, but it is there. ",

With the Tools For Thought market getting so much investment now, many millions of dollars, how that market evolves, whether it's a bunch of silos, or an open ecosystem, is up for grabs. I love outliners, been making them all my life, but again, when it comes to promoting open formats and interop, I'm pretty much out there on my own. I've more or less given up on this one, at least for now. But it's a huge deal for the future. ",
