    "text": "There's a great movie, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday\">Any Given Sunday</a>, just about this. I re-watched it yesterday. There's so much truth in it. Young people, men especially, want to be the hero and ignore that winning requires that people work together, and that the real joy of being human comes not from being the great conqueror (as young men imagine), but having 12 people in a huddle fighting for something worth fighting for, together -- as a team. I don't want to be Don Quixote, but if the tech world doesn't want to collaborate, I'm not going to stop being creative, or stop hoping that someday other techies see things <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/07/26/listeningRespectAndTeamwor.html\">the way I do</a>. Working together is where it's at. BTW, that's really the point of <a href=\"http://this.how/standards/\">Rules for Standards-Makers</a>, in case that wasn't obvious.",
