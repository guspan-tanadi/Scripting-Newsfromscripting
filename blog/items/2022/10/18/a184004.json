All the rest goodbye, including Morning Joe, Ari Melber, Chris Hayes, the Republican who's on before Melber, the <a href=\"https://www.democraticunderground.com/12512333229\">idiot</a> who punted on this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1582406586126827521\">interview</a> with Speaker Pelosi, and if Chuck Todd is still involved, please put him out to pasture. I'd also give an hour to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Mystal\">Elie Mystal</a>, it'd be fun to see who he chooses as guests. And completely get rid of the standard guests. They are so freaking tired. They need a rest. And with Olbermann on top again, well at least it would be interesting bullshit, not the normal self-important leftover bullshitty bullshit.  ",
