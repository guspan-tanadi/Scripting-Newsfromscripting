    "text": "Substack has a sadistic kind of paywall. You start reading a piece, get into it, enough to wonder where it‘s going and boom, it’s time to subscribe or get out of here. Leaves a humiliation that’s hard to describe. This is the <a href=\"https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-4151-why-goal-cascades-are-harmful\">page</a> that triggered the paywall, it's not doing it now -- I have no idea why. This is the second time I've seen this paywall. Anyway, I clicked on the link because I thought I might learn something, instead I have a pain in the gut. Trains you to never read anything on Substack again, and, like all other paywalls, it does not make me want to subscribe. If you have a comment, here's the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1577618434220777473\">original tweet</a>. ",
