    "text": "I added a new feature to \"FeedLand\" today. There's now a white-on-orange XML icon in the upper right corner of each news product. <a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1686843/194099839-d458927b-8b0b-46d8-af83-f27c00f81764.png\">Screen shot</a> and <a href=\"http://nbariver.com/\">example</a>. The icon links to the OPML subscription list for the feeds on the page. This came from a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1268027417\">question</a> on the thread, basically asking \"Where are the feeds.\" I love those kinds of questions, they help direct the development of a product. My perspective is so muddled, I've been living with this product for nine months already. I can't see what it looks like to someone seeing it for the first time. ",
