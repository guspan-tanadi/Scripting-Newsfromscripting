    "text": "One thing I've noticed with FeedLand testers is that the newest ones probably aren't reading the docs because they're not connecting with the community of people who are already using the product. That's what's unique about FeedLand -- it's about feeds, news and people. And the people are the ones who give the product its utility. It's a platform for feed-collecting people. And the rest of us get the benefit because we can look at what they subscribe to and pick off the feeds we like for our own lists. So when you look at this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/20/feedListScreenShot.png\">screen shot</a>, focus on the checkboxes that aren't checked. These are feeds you might like. And all you have to do is click the checkbox and they're in your list too. And that's the point. Everyone else can be your feed sherpa, and you can be ours. Use us. That's what we're here for. ",
