    "text": "BTW, I get emails from people wanting to know how to get on FeedLand. We have only got about 20 people using the product now and that's the way I want it. I've stopped giving in to users who feel entitled to get everything all at once and then just run off to do the same with some other product. I wasted a lot of time with such people with Drummer. I want to work with people for whom there is a chance they'll be long-term users of the product. So we're going slow. I want 100% great users, people who understand there are good people here, and you have to put in some effort yourself, if you want help. And I want you to know something about the product <i>before</i> you use it. ",
