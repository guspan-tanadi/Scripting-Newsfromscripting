    "text": "For decades I've used BofA to pay bills, but I was never satisfied with the service. They don’t keep records, so I can’t see all the checks I’ve sent to an account. And lately their website is broken. I contacted them to get them to fix the site, but as I expected, they made me jump through hoops to prove I had tried everything. I tolerated that once, but then they passed me over to another department, and I could see all the hoop-jumping was going to happen again. I give up. So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1587046918085132289\">on Twitter</a> I asked for recommendations of banks that do a decent job of bill-pay. And I'm getting some good tips. Have a look, and if you have good or bad experience, please chime in. ",
