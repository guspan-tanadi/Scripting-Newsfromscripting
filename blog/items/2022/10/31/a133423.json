I have many mottos, one that has served me well in circumstances like this -- Don't slam the door on the way out. It's powerless and manipulative. If you have to go, just go. Quietly. Anyway, it's bullshit to leave Twitter just because the current owner is a prick. We use the platform for lots of stuff, and it's still useful. Until there's a place to reassemble (yes, I've heard of Mastodon), Twitter is what we got. ",
