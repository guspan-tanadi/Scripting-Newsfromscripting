This page has basic info about the feed, when it was added and who added it. It says when it was last checked, last updated (a new item appeared in the feed), how many items we've retrieved from the feed, how long it took to read the feed (an indication of how healthy its server is) and most important, who is subscribed to the feed.  When you click on a user's name, you're taken to their feed list (<a href=\"http://feedland.org/?username=gwthompson\">example</a>), where you may find other feeds to subscribe to. This is what we mean about FeedLand being made of people (and feeds and news too, of course). ",

The River view is different because it presents just the items from one feed, not a set of feeds. The full text of the item is not displayed by default, but you can see it by clicking on the down arrow in the lower right corner of each item, if it has text that is hidden. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/arrowscreen.png\">Screen shot</a>.",
