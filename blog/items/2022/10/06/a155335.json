    "text": "Now that I have \"FeedLand\" running reliably, I am reading more of the few bloggers I've found that are blogging regularly. That includes <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/\">Manton Reece</a>, who I know from early \"Frontier\" days. One of our best developers, and a steady fellow, which was much appreciated. I know he's a sports fan too, living in Texas he follows the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs\">San Antonio Spurs</a>, which is of course a legendary team. I am, as you know, a Knicks fan. But I have to say, until the Mets are finished, and probably a few weeks after that, I'm focused only on baseball. I'm very modal with my sports. I'm either in or not. I can't love two teams at the same time. It's just who I am. Anyway, Manton has written a <a href=\"https://book.micro.blog/\">book about microblogging</a> and he runs a service called <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a> which hosts blogs, running his software. I feel that his blog and my new reading software have brought us closer. And I look forward to reading his book. ",
