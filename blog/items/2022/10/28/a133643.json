Sure it's dirty and smells bad, but it's how you get places.\" From this certain people concluded that I was in favor of Musk buying Twitter. Geez I hope you don't write code with that logic. I was having a Twitter conversation with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/semaforben\">Ben Smith</a>, editor in chief of Semafor, and he volunteered he was staying with Twitter, \"going down with the ship,\" he said. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior\">Sarah Kendzior</a>, a pundit and brilliant, creative thinker, said she lives in Missouri, and if she can handle that (it's the state that sent <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-josh-hawley-fled-capitol-january-6-after-raising-fist-2022-7\">Josh Hawley</a> to the Senate), she can handle Twitter no matter how awful its management. I'm with Smith and Kendzior. Also, having started on Twitter in 2006, and having contributed its foundational ideas, and as one of the shareholders Musk bought out, I'm anxious to see how this goes. I didn't quit when <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar\">Dick Costolo</a> was CEO, it's hard to imagine that Musk could be any worse. ",
