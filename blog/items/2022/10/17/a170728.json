    "text": "Right now my favorite song in creation is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz5mI6tqm_Q\">Can't You Hear Me Knocking</a>. It's got everything, but most important, a driving bass and drums and a steady beat. It's always in my Peloton playlist, every time -- it's when I drive the bike fastest and steadiest, with a huge grin on my face. And it's two songs in one. First it's the hit as conceived by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger\">Jagger</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Richards\">Richards</a>. But then it just goes into a jam, not part of the song, but they loved it so much they kept it. It's got a Santana sound. I never seem to get tired of it. The lead on the second half is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor\">Mick Taylor</a> not Keef. ",
