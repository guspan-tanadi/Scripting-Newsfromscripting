    "text": "Tonight's final game between the Yankees and Guardians was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34819494/guardians-yankees-alds-game-5-moved-tuesday-afternoon\">rain-delayed</a>, but while they were waiting to see if the game would be played, they had a panel of four baseball experts talking for a long time about absolutely nothing because there was nothing to say. It's raining at Yankee Stadium. How many ways can you say that. I felt sorry for them, but they were kind of people who even when they had the normal amount of time to fill said nothing but platitudes. That's their job. I did a bit of channel switching, looked in on MSNBC and CNN, and they had the usual panels, just like the one for the rain-delayed baseball game. I finally landed on a lovely sweet <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/juno\">movie</a> I had seen before, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(film)\">Juno</a>, and was reminded that humans can tell powerful, funny, touching stories using this medium. It doesn't all have to be sad, mindless, soulless bullshit. I think that's why we're all so unhappy with our lives and each other. We're addicted to watching the same actors saying the same old boring bullshit day after day, and we're angry about that, and have to blame someone, anyone but ourselves, for putting up with it. ",
