    "text": "About <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/01/05.html#a163044\">open storage systems</a>, there are lots of them out there. I <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver\">wrote one</a> myself, the one that's in use in Drummer, built on Twitter identity. But it's not enough to have the functionality, it has to be an obvious choice for users. That's why Amazon is perfect, so many people have accounts there and are comfortable using it, and they have a great <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">storage system</a> already, it's just a matter of linking the two. There must be a reason they don't do it, it's so obvious. Maybe they don't want all the hassle YouTube has to go through with copyright. ",
