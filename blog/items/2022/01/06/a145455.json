Not just once, but two or three times. Then stare at the problem. Try changing something and see what happens. Maybe the docs say one thing but you're observing something else. What did I do wrong? You have to ask that question first. We all make mistakes, there's no shame in it, but it's not good to show no effort before sounding an alarm. Esp when the person you're asking for help from is doing it as a volunteer. ",

We're now months into the shipment of the software, and I was pretty sure this part worked. I depended on it myself. The user gave me no information other than he thought the software was broken. I closed the issue and moved on. I can't work with people who aren't at least a little humble. And nothing is so urgent that I should stop everything I'm doing and help a panicked user who won't even do a little work to try to figure out whether they misunderstood or made a mistake. ",
