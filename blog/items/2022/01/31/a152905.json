As I do more searching on each of these problems what's implicated in both cases is a problem of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=com.apple.screencapture.plist&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=com.apple.screencapture.plist&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61.1759j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#cobssid=s\">corrupt</a> plists. I don't know very much about these files, but I do understand what they're for. It's possible I did something that blew out some of these files.
