I'm figuring things out at a whole new level, in the difference between who the Beatles were as people and how the Beatles were part of my personal foundation. I watched the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show. When I was in the hospital recovering from a ruptured appendix, She Loves You was #1 and played all the time on the hospital PA. And on and on.
