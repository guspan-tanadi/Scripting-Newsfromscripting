    "text": "My mind, when it comes to Beatles songs, is like one of those old computer monitors that's been sitting in a clerical office for 20 years, and the default prompt is burned into the screen so you can read it clearly even if the monitor is turned off. I never listen to the actual words of Beatles songs. When I first heard them, I'm sure I had no idea what they were talking about, and I played the songs so many times, as a child, and all through my life. It's like the Beatles are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS\">ROM BIOS</a> of my music brain OS. Now that I've been reading about them as songs with meaning and connected to the musician's lives when they were writing them, the words all of a sudden are there. Fantastic. ",
