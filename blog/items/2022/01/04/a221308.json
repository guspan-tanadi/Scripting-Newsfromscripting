How I miss <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Donald%20McNeil&collection=scriptingnews\">Donald McNeil</a> who used to tell it like it is. Too bad he said the n-word when talking about the n-word instead of saying literally n-word he said the word the n-word is standing in for. How tired is that. Think of all the things we have to fight for to just get back to where we were and this wasn't one of them. Such fools at the NY Times.",
