    "text": "I love getting emails from PR people who offer to send me products based on what I write here. Not sarcastic. I got an message from a publicist at the <a href=\"http://knopfdoubleday.com/imprint/pantheon/\">Pantheon</a>, which publishes the <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/239452/station-eleven-television-tie-in-by-emily-st-john-mandel/\">book</a> that the Station Eleven HBO series is based on. I thanked her for the offer. I read the book when it came out, still have it, and realize I may want to re-read it after seeing the series. But at first I was confused, I thought she was offering to send me the graphic novel (ie comic book) that's at the center of the story, Dr. Eleven, but that doesn't exist. I think it would be immensely popular if it did, that is of course if it was good. :boom:",
