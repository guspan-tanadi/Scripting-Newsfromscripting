It's similar to  when RSS 0.90 came out when I already had <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scriptingnews%20format&collection=scriptingnews\">scriptingNews format</a>. You have a choice at that point, you can have interop right now, or you can wait for a consensus that may never come. In the first case you have the chance to <i>create</i> the consensus, in the latter, you have to wait for others to agree. It's why I've noted in the past that the person who goes second has all the power. So I chose in this case to go second. ",

LogSeq meets all those requirements. They are committed to being open. It's not just a thing they say, it's how they've built their product.",

I need people to know that I have a financial interest in the success of the company. But I also wanted to send a signal to them, to the users of our products, to the Tools For Thought category, to developers and others -- that we can compete and still see our success as beneficial to each other. This space is so large and under-developed that we can work for many years building on each others' strengths. ",
