    "text": "Starting a little tune-up work on <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&collection=scriptingnews\">Daytona</a>. First couple of changes, both for Scripting News only. 1. Fixed broken links to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2010/01/20/theSafeFutureOfRadioAndMan.html\">radio.weblogs.com</a> images. We lost control of the domain when Verisign sold weblogs.com. 2. Apply my glossary to the text, so references to special links and images now work, for example <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=%22curly%22&collection=scriptingnews\">references</a> to the <i>curly</i> image. I also want to fix up references to the <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tagging&collection=scriptingnews\">tagging</a> feature I implemented which was superceded by Daytona. And a few other things while I'm in there. ",
