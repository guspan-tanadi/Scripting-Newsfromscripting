Lots of hyperbole, the characters and their stories are pretty thin. I'd like one that stops and talks about the songs, and how they were written (if it's known) and what they're really about. ",

I know it's obvious, he's just a person, but the Beatle John Lennon was a huge figure in our culture, and in my own life. No one actually is that large. The cultural icon is another story. That's why the individual Beatles talked about <i>The Beatles</i> so often, as this thing separate from themselves. It was. And I suppose if you want to know why they <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/04/11/357087772.html?pageNumber=20\">broke up in 1970</a>, that's probably the cause -- to become something approaching <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html\">human-size</a> again. I think it's fair to say they never achieved it. ",

He's listened to all their songs recently, and told me he was blown away by the sheer number of great songs. He said some bands have one or two hits, but the Beatles had hundreds of great songs. I don't think there's much doubt the Beatles are historic. ",
