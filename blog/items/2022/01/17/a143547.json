I've decided to make the Mac work like Windows and Ubuntu, swapping the Ctrl and Cmd keys, but for some reason my Bluetooth keyboard is not showing up in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/17/modifierKeyboardDialog.png\">list of keyboards</a> whose modifier keys you can change. The list is empty. I tried disconnecting the keyboard and reconnecting, no luck. I guess I should try rebooting the machine. If you have an idea, reply to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1483084855818784771\">this tweet</a>. <i>Thanks!</i>",
