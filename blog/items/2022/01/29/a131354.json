    "text": "Yesterday I got a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092QRLTZ3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">new Macally keyboard</a>. It's their answer to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S92QBCJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Logitech MX</a>, which I also have. I love the MX, it has a very nice feel and most important the keys are backlit. I like working in a dark room, so it's important for me to be able to see the keys, esp as my eyesight weakens as I get older. I got the new keyboard because I was unable to switch the <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Ctrl%20and%20Cmd&collection=scriptingnews\">Ctrl and Cmd</a> keys, so I could also use Windows and Linux on the same machine without breaking my brain. For some reason when I do the switch using the Control Panel or Karabiner, the mapping doesn't stick. I thought maybe the problem was with the keyboard, so it was worth $50 to find out. Sadly there's something wrong with the computer, this new keyboard has the same problem. If you have any ideas on what might be going wrong, or what I might try next, please send me a tweet or an email. In the meantime, I also got a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072M4YLN6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1\">new mouse</a>, an upgrade from the cheap-feeling Microsoft mouse I got because I decided to try using a scroll wheel mouse and liked it.
