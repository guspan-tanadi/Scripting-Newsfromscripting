That said, it wouldn't surprise me if <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scott%20love&collection=scriptingnews\">Scott Love</a> wasn't the first, I didn't stay in touch with most of the people who worked there. But Scott was certainly the first of those who I did. I wrote about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html\">his passing</a> in November, but I didn't have any pictures of him from Living Videotext. My brother sent me a couple, so here they are.
