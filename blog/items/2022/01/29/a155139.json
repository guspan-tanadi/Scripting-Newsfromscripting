    "text": "I realize that in a sense this whole blog, all 27-plus years, has been about coming to terms with being creative in public, and how hard it is to be true to yourself while doing that. Nothing can prepare you for it. I've known quite a few people who dealt with this in tech and know very few who were happy about it. Before you're rich and famous you think it'll all be great, but once you're in it, it just spins you around and you struggle to try to stay human, but if your fame gets big enough everyone wants to own you, some even tell you to your face they want to own you, but they don't need <i>you</i> if you get what I mean. I have walked away from the adventure a couple of times myself. But learning about the Beatles, and I still have a lot to learn, has opened my eyes wider than anything, because before this investigation started, all I knew about the Beatles was the one that the public owns.
