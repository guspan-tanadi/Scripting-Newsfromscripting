    "text": "There's something really interesting about <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew.rss\">this feed</a> from Mastodon. I look at it and I see that even though I've never met them, somehow their feed ended up looking a lot like the feeds I make now, <i>20 years later.</i> It's like there was this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers\">game of Telephone</a>, and you'd expect by now, after passing through so many hands, esp people who were <i>trying</i> to break the chain, what came out the other end is correct. Thanks due in part to <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/\">Manton Reece</a> who persuaded the Masto folk that feed items are not required to have titles. Finally we have a massive maker of feeds who I hope will force all feed readers to support this feature that has been <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt\">in RSS</a> since v0.91. Item titles are optional. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/21/specshot.png?nodialog\">It's in the spec</a>. In fact it's so important that I said it twice in two different ways in case anyone was confused. I think this is just a matter of programmers looking for an easy way out and most of them not being writers. :boom:",
