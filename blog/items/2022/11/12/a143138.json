    "text": "There are a couple of new features in FeedLand, <a href=\"http://data.feedland.org/changenotes/2022/11/11/205211.html?title=newButtonsOnNewsItems\">documented here</a>. With the first, the Document icon on each news item (<a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/11/twoNewIconsScreen.png\">screen shot</a>), you can now link to individual items from a news page on FeedLand, and can of course share that link with others. They will not need to log in. I realized we needed this the other day when I wanted to point to an episode of a podcast, not the podcast feed. We didn't have that ability, now we do. And, a bonus is that we can point to long-form feed items in a comfortable to read format instead of in the middle of all the other items. I found this very useful reading stuff this morning on my iPad. Here's an <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?item=427416\">example</a> of a story from The Atlantic. And an <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?item=435534\">untitled post</a> from today's Scripting News. I have to say, I feel so much more powerful now that I can improve my reading environment so easily.  ",
