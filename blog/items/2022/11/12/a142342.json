    "text": "Why we need Twitter. Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591313397362352130\">nails it</a>. \"FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter.\" Exactly. If we depended on professional journalists for this story they;'d be so confused all that we'd hear is mush. But the insiders are on Twitter, and the story that's coming out at least has some truth behind it. Journalism always tells the same bullshit story. (Which varies a little from time to time, the only consistent thread is how much you, little person, depend on us for all the truth we think you can handle, limited by our pathetic understanding of the facts.)
