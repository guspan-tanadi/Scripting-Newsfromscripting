If Twitter turned us off for some reason you’d still be able to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/11/17/122301.html\">read your news</a> while we worked around the outage. But so far there have been no problems that I’m aware of, and rushing to change tested software is a sure way to break things. That said we're making good progress on hooking up to Mastodon. Planning to show off a new way to do news products with FeedLand, and I want to write Mastodon threads in \"Drummer\". Those will be the first steps. ☘️",
