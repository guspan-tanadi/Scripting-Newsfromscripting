    "text": "I have very vague but strong memories of the JFK assassination. I was 8, in second grade, my teacher, Miss Ruffino, rushed out of the classroom in tears, no idea why. My mom picked me up to walk me home, we lived a couple of blocks from the school, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7548979,-73.8742838,3a,75y,1.49h,103.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stH-FAYMIFIYDPVFnFvREhg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DtH-FAYMIFIYDPVFnFvREhg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D46.733856%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192\">PS 149 Queens</a>. I understood Kennedy was President, but he was the only president I had known. The idea of someone other than Kennedy being president didn’t make any sense. I asked my mom, what now. Someone named Johnson would be president. It didn’t make any sense to me. Kennedy was president.",
