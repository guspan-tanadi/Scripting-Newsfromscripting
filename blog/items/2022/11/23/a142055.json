    "text": "I can't tell you how convenient it is that Mastodon has the same name as my first real internet presence on CompuServe in the early 80s, also Mastodon. I have a whole language already designed to go with that name. Mastodoctor, for example. For a while we were all adding \"bunny\" to our names, so I became Mastobunny and then Mastobun for short. Most of these names are available, so I'm tempted, but so far I've resisted. I have bought a couple though. Like most domain names I buy, I'll probably never use them. But it's nice they're there. I keep hoping someday to come up with a service that deserves the name <a href=\"http://ou.rs/\">ou.rs</a> which I've been renewing for many years. ",
