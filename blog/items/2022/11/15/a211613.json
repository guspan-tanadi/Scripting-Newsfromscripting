In the Holocaust they came to kill all the Jews, whole families, neighborhoods. Everyone who was wearing a yellow star. They would line us up in front of ditches and shoot everyone. Then bring in another group and shoot them so their bodies fell on the bodies that were already there. This <i>actually happened</i> to people of our parents' generation. This wasn't some plot to fool you. It fucking happened. It was only luck that kept them from dying this way, kept them alive so they could be our parents. And to warn us of things happening that are exactly what you are doing. We aren't stupid and we haven't forgotten. We know where you are taking us.",
