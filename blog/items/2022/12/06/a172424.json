    "text": "The most interesting episode so far in the <a href=\"https://500songs.com/\">500 songs</a> series is the one about <a href=\"https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-147-hey-joe-by-the-jimi-hendrix-experience/\">Hey Joe</a> as performed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix\">Jimi Hendrix</a>. I'm not listening to them in any particular order. I felt kind of bad about it, but I got over it. One idea he talks about was there was an idea of white drugs and black drugs. I can vouch for that. I was blown away a few years ago to find out <i>everyone</i> smokes weed. I thought it was just a white boomer thing. Everyone does it. The sound of eyes opening. I asked Alexa to play me some Hendrix music. First she played Hey Joe which I'd been bingeing on. Then came his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TgbWOy6Buk\">opening</a> at Woodstock. And then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY\">All Along the Watchtower</a>. It was really emotional for me. It's already been a heavy duty emotional day. Let's go deeper! After that he asks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZHGJxv3qQ\">Are You Experienced?</a> Hey for such a young man, he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix#Death,_post-mortem,_and_burial\">died</a> at 27, he was very self-aware and surroundings-aware.
