    "text": "Also on their <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com/\">site</a> they say \"it's like podcasts -- but for reading.\" That's brilliant. Probably leaves a bunch of people scratching their heads. But this is where we're going. Making the world of text work as smoothly as the world of audio. Next step is to work on interop. So I can copy a full-featured <a href=\"http://textcasting.org/\">textcast</a> item from an app that doesn't support all the features (like Twitter or Mastodon) and paste it into one that does (like NetNewsWire or FeedLand), and voila -- everything is there. It's a simple change that would make it impossible for any participant in the network to lock you in. Your ideas would be free to move instead of being locked up. Feeds get us most of the way there, but there's a little more to do. ",
