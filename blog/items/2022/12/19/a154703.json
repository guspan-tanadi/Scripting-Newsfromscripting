We're in a moment where we might be able to straighten out this huge problem with the web, that limits how we can integrate systems that support short and long posts. We've been divided since Twitter gave up on their RSS feeds, a long time ago. Mastodon required some convincing to stick to no titles in their feeds, rather than give in. And WordPress stepping up to make this transition means we have more reasons for other feed displayers to do so. So this is totally a win for RSS, and I see that as a win for me because <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop\">my product is interop</a>. I made that switch a long time ago. I make products too but interop comes first. ",
