    "text": "I have \"Drummer\" and Mastodon hooked up. You can create a thread in the outline structure in Drummer and then click an icon in the left margin to shoot it over to Mastodon. Here's an example of such a thread, in <a href=\"https://social.masto.land/@dave/109518506487530508\">Mastodon</a> and a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/15/outlineStructureForMastoThreadScreen.png\">screen shot</a> of the outline that came from in Drummer. It's been a while since I added a feature to Drummer, and it seemed the new Mastodon capability in my toolbox seemed like a good opportunity to do that. I'll write up a howto for this shortly.",
