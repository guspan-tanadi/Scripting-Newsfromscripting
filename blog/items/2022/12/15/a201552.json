    "text": "Something that was forgotten from the old days of blogging. We don't blog to make money, rather we blog as part of what we do to make money. Important difference. Since I switched back to full blogging in 2017 and not writing for social media, after some time building tools, and re-learning how to ship stuff from my blog, I used it to launch FeedLand earlier this year, and the results have been outstanding. People are using it. That was the goal. Blogging makes bigger things possible. It's how I organize my work and work with the people who use the product of my work. We observed this in 2004 and beyond as we launched podcasting. It happened a lot faster than with blogging, because we had blogs to promote podcasting. This stuff builds. When we get interop the power tends to expand as a multiple, not linearly. ",
