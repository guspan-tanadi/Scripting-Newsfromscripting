    "text": "I need help testing a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedToMasto\">new important app</a> -- it's the first one that hooks RSS directly up to Mastodon via the <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/oauth-scopes/\">Mastodon API</a>. I am reluctant to promote it until it's had been validated. So if you know how to run a Node app, and have a few minutes to help out, please give it a try, and let me know, <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedToMasto/issues/1\">in this thread</a>, whether it worked. A link to one of the Mastodon messages it created would be helpful too. <i>Thanks!</i> ",
