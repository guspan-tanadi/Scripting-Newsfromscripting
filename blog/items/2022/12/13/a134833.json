    "text": "BTW, yesterday we paused new signons to \"FeedLand\". There were a lot of reasons for this. First, I didn't want a lot of users. I think of FeedLand as a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22\">fractional horsepower</a> global feed management system. Not wanting in any way to compete with the huge systems, to create yet another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1602663488157089795\">monster</a> like Twitter. I felt that we already had too many users for my liking. At some point the load on the server is going to be a problem, I wanted to stop well before we got to that point. Also, I want to do some development that would be harder with new users coming online. Remember this is not a corporate site. I am the only person working on the software and I'm responsible for keeping the service running at a technical level, and dealing with trolls, spammers and abusers, which thankfully have not been a problem yet, but I know from experience that it's just a matter of time.
