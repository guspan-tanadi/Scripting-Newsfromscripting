    "text": "There's this great line in Sleeper where the character played by Woody Allen was asleep for 100 years and when he woke wanted to know how the world was destroyed. They said a guy named Albert Shanker got a nuclear weapon. That's a 1970s NYC joke. If you knew Albert Shanker, you'd get it. If they were remaking the movie now instead of Albert Shanker it'd be Elon Musk and instead of a nuke it'd be Twitter and instead of being science fiction it'd be true. Now that's still an Albert Shanker joke, but soon there will be plenty of Elon Musk jokes. Lots of them. I'm never wrong about things like this btw. ;-)",
