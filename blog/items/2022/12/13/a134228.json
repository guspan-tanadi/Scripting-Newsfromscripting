I have <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/163100.html?title=starlinkSetup\">Starlink</a> installed as a backup, and it wasn't working very well last time I tried it, presumably because it didn't have a good view of the sky. I thought this might change in the winter when all the leaves are gone, and I'm happy to report that it did.
