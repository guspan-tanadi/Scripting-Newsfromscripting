I say come play with us on Mastodon. The difference is I can make software for you that plugs in beautifully on Mastodon, without limits, it's a \"platform with no platform vendor.\" I will never be able to make software for you that works in LinkedIn. Lots of analogies. And I am as usual far too long-winded. ",
