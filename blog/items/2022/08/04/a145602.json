    "text": "I am generally critical of the substance and format of cable news, but — the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bezgeMocFPU&t=270s\">opening segment</a> on Joy Reid’s show last night about women and abortion after Kansas was outstanding, deep, emotionally evocative, inspiring. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization\">Dobbs decision</a>, however awful, enslaving and life-endangering of American citizens, has a silver lining. It can stir us to act in care of each other, across all supposed divisions, find the American within each of us. We are still unitable if you push us hard enough.",
