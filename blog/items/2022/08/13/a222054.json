Almost everyone is already dead, so that rules them out. Is anything remotely like a happy ending available to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Goodman\">Jimmy</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Wexler\">Kim</a>? But it has to be one of the most creative endings ever considering how crazy creative the show has been up to now. ",
