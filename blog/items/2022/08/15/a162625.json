    "text": "I was always taught the basics of a good story are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws\">who, what, when, where and why</a>. With Trump and his stolen top secret US government documents, we don't know who he was selling the secrets to. The what part -- we don't know either. They say nuclear secrets, but what if they got you access to world's banking system. That could be considerably more valuable. Why? With Trump there's only ever one reason -- if it makes him richer he's in. If not why bother. Our journalism repeats the same old bullshit over and over. ",
