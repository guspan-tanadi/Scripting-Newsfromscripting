    "text": "President Biden gave a speech about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1563225299378003968\">Maga Republicans</a>. Interesting idea. It'll work if you start to hear pundits use the term. Intuitively -- I think the truth is there are no Maga Repubs. If anyone has voted with the Republican Party through the 2020 election, and there were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election\">74 million</a> of them, they are not separable. Muddying this up doesn't seem to serve any purpose other than calming Biden's supposed friendship with remaining fence-sitters such as <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-national-abortion-ban-possible-roe-v-wade_n_62772e80e4b0b7c8f0851155\">Moscow Mitch</a>. That's really who the term seems to be a gift to. Through the ongoing Trump crime spree, he's still campaigning for the Republican candidates. The other term I don't like is \"semi-fascist.\" Another dream -- somehow there are two kinds of fascists, ones who are on the way to being fascists and the real fascists. Again anyone who voted for Trump in 2020 qualifies as 100 percent American grown Nazi Party fascists, imho -- that is. :smile:",
