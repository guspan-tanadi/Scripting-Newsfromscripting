My two cents. OK with me. But tune up your pricing so it lets your product grow like a weed. The tragedy of Heroku, which I was building my software base on, is that they made the product diseconomic for its natural niche -- quick scripts that need to run on the net 24-by-7 but are very low bandwidth. I run dozens of those. It makes no sense to pay $7 a month to run each of them when they can all run together on a $5 a month server at Digital Ocean. It took me years to reimplement Heroku but I did. The shame of it is that lots of other people did it too. One of the responsibilities of a company that makes a product as useful as Heroku is to not get too much in the way of its destiny. Salesforce really fucked that up.",
