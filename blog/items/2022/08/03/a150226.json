    "text": "The other day I read that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Scobleizer/status/1552379565603000322\">Scoble thinks</a> Tesla's way of playing music from an iPhone is as good as CarPlay or Android Auto. At first I couldn't think why that was wrong, but I just went down to the car (a Model Y) to set it up to work with the new Pixel 6 Pro I got yesterday, and remembered. When you're playing music on a phone in a Tesla, you have to use the UI of the phone to control the music. With CarPlay it's integrated with the display of the car, and it's simplified to be like a car control. And it's easy to switch apps, again using the UI of the CarPlay software, integrated into the car. It's so dangerous to do the same with the Tesla system that <i>I never do it unless the car is stopped.</i> The difference is integration. I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/03/141929.html?title=teslasMissingAppEcosystem\">wrote about this</a> when I was first transitioning from CarPlay to Telsa, and it's a serious problem for Tesla that they don't have an app <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_ecosystem\">ecosystem</a>, and unless they do a deal with Apple and Google, they probably aren't going to have one. It's no small thing to build one of those, they might have done it when they had the electric car business to themselves, but that's already past. ",
