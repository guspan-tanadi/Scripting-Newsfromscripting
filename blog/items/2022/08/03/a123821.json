    "text": "I have a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6\">Android phone</a> this morning. One of the first things I did was transfer some music to the phone. I have to say it worked much better than transferring to my iPhone. From a Mac, which didn't work at all. I even bought a new Mac just for that purpose. Still couldn't get it to work. What's wrong with this picture? On the other hand, how do you play music on this Android wonder? All the apps begin with Google followed by three dots. Hmm. Which one plays music? I can't tell. Didn't they user-test this stuff at all?? I found an app that opens data files and when I opened one of the MP3's it figured it out and launched something that would play it. Now I wonder how that's going to work on my Tesla? We'll find out!",
