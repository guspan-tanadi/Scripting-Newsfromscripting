    "text": "What made me think of this was a random experience while waiting for my order this morning at <a href=\"https://www.utopiabagelsny.com/\">Utopia Bagels</a> in Whitestone, NY. It's in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Queens,+NY+11358/Utopia+Bagels,+Utopia+Parkway,+Queens,+NY/@40.7747863,-73.7984347,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a61da3d0acd:0xe857931aa5334a2a!2m2!1d-73.7937332!2d40.7802255!3e1\">neighborhood</a> I grew up in. The people behind the counter looked nothing like the people I grew up with, coming from the current working population of Queens, one of the most diverse places in the world. The night before I had gone to see the <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/edwin-diaz-gets-6-out-save-as-mets-beat-braves\">Mets beat the Atlanta Braves</a>. This year's Mets are unusually competent. Anyway there was a man there, in the crowded bagel store, probably in his early 80s, wearing a rent-a-cop uniform. I thought he was one of the few people remaining from my time there. He looked like a drinker and smoker. He could have been one of my childhood friends' fathers. He picked me out and asked if I knew what he thought. I said nothing. He said \"America matters, that's all.\" I mumbled quietly well we can agree to disagree. After that I avoided him, looked around, he and I were among the oldest people there. This, I thought, is the new Queens, we are part of the old (and I am long-gone, just back for the Mets game and the bagels). On the way out, on an impulse, I tapped his shoulder and said in a voice that I was sure he could hear, but not too loudly -- Black lives matter. I don't know why I said it, it probably only meant pain for this man. He is a human vestige. So old and obviously tired, but he still had to do a job probably no one else wanted. I think what he was really saying to me was hey brother, you look a bit like me, maybe we agree us white people matter. But he couldn't say it that plainly. ",
