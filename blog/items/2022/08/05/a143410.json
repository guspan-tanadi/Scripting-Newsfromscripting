    "text": "I got a Lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel at Utopia Bagels and ate it on the drive home. It was heaven. I will remember that bagel as long as I live. Also the store gets its name from the street it's on, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway_(Queens)\">Utopia Parkway</a>. It's just an avenue, not a major thoroughfare, not what in NY you'd call a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkway\">parkway</a>. It winds north-south through this part of Queens. I always felt privileged to live near Utopia. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway_(Queens)#History_and_naming\">Wikipedia says</a> where the name came from, an attempt to create a utopian community in Queens. There's no mention of Utopia Bagels in the Wikipedia article, but there should be. :smile:",
