    "text": "Turns out I did have something to say. I'm watching a great HBO series called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Friend_(TV_series)\">My Brilliant Friend</a>. It got the highest <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/my-brilliant-friend\">rating</a> on Metacritic, and it is deserved. Almost like watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> (who I love) in her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone\">first movie</a>, and realizing there's going to be a lot more of this and being happy to be around to see all of it. There are three seasons, I'm only on episode 4 of season 1. I'm sure there will be a lot more to say about this.  In the meantime I'm just enjoying a beautiful film as a TV series about two children growing up in Naples in the 1950s. ",
