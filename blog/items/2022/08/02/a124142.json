Because I had the office, I was able to get an experienced radio team (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_(radio_show)\">Lydon and McGrath</a>) to work with me on this idea I had for audio blogging (which became podcasting) and one of my colleagues suggested that blogging would work well with politics, which got the bootstrap of political blogging going just in time for the 2004 presidential election. So -- having an office and using it is good. In my experience, things get created that way that otherwise wouldn't.",
