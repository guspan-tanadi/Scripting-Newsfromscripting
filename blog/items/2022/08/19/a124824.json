    "text": "I use <a href=\"http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">xmlviewer.scripting.com</a> to link to feeds because browsers make a mess of displaying feeds. Suggestion to browser devs: treat viewing a feed as lifting the hood on a car or viewing the source of an HTML page. When you do that, you don't see another car interior, or another rendering of the HTML. You see a lot of technical stuff. Trust people who don't want to know how the web works will quickly hit the Back button to get back to the comfort of the user interface. ",
