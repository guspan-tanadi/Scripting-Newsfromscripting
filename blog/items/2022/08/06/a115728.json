But I think when you listen to Olbermann you'll realize as I did that Maddow wasn't cutting it. She stepped back because she lost her edge, she must've known it. I also think the MSNBC management must have been forcing her to not say the whole truth. Olbermann for now at least is unchained. But his show is owned by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia\">big corporation</a> so he'll probably eventually go stale too. But for now -- he's got it.  ",
