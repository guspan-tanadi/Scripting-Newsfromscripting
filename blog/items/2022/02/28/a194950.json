    "text": "You really should listen to this week's <a href=\"https://radioopensource.org/russian-invasion/\">Radio Open Source</a> for a unique view of what Russia's invasion of Ukraine means. Remarkable agreement among the academics. Whatever you think of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin\">Putin</a>, Russia <i>has</i> been provoked. At some point we all decided that Russia's nukes no longer made it a superpower. We never asked Russia what they thought about that conclusion. What a show of power in the 2016 election. I have no doubt had Russia not interfered HRC would have won. It never occurred to me until today that we (ie President Biden) could have negotiated with him on that. Stand down and we'll do X for you. Sorry Ukraine, no to NATO but you get something even better, a US government that isn't owned by Putin. Sure Putin is a short, ugly, and by our standards a mean person. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Badenov\">Boris Badenov</a> without the charm. But underneath that fa√ßade, he's actually been pretty patient.  ",
