For a few hours last night the UPS report went back to saying there was an emergency that supposedly prevented the delivery. But this morning it's back on the truck. I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1491938203296751616\">posted</a> about it on Twitter after yesterday's no-show, the fifth such day, and got a response from Apple support. I gave them the order number via DM. They wanted lots of details but what did I need to say beyond \"I paid the money, I want the phone, or refund the money.\" For a company of Apple's size this shouldn't be hard unless it's a common occurrence.
