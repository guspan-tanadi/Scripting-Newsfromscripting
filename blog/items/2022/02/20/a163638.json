    "text": "I've started bingeing <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/raised-by-wolves/season-1\">Raised By Wolves</a> on HBO. I like it so far into 3 episodes, and I hear it gets better. I have no idea why it's called Raised By Wolves, there are no wolves in the show (so far). The human kids are raised by androids. Here's something good/.interesting. It was liked by one person on <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fraised-by-wolves\">Bingeworthy</a>, Jake Savin, who is also considered the best match with me on BW. Jake said it was the Best. Aha I know I'm in the right place. :smile:",
