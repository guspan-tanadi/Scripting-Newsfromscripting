It's hard to imagine why it wouldn't. The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/10/upsTeaser.png\">UPS site now says</a> it's on the truck, not yet \"out for delivery\" but that's next step. I'm optimistic. The site also says it will be here by 7PM. The weather is very nice and has been for the last few days so there's no ice or snow to deal with. Power is on. But I've yet to see evidence the phone actually exists. If it does arrive here, I'm not letting it go. I could use a nice new phone. That's why I ordered and paid for one, so long ago. :apple:",
