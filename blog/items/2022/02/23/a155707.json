    "text": "I was just looking over the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040102121830/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/\">home blog</a> at Harvard in 2003, a blog which I had the privilege of editing. I was looking for a snapshot of the \"What is a weblog\" page. A lot of work went into defining what it meant, because there was some confusion about this in the 2003 blogosphere. And then it turns out the page in question is <a href=\"http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html\">still there</a> on the Harvard site. Good thing it was preserved. And in case that page ever disappears, it's <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160729162359/http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html\">also on archive.org</a>.",
