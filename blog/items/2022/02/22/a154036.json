    "text": "If <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/02/21/224554.html?title=twitterArticles\">Twitter Articles</a> is what it appears to be, Twitter is about to become a much more important part of the open web, assuming it's all accessible through the API in both directions (apps can post articles, as well as read them) and if it supports linking. It's very late, but better late than never, and in the future it'll mean that blogging tools such as the one I offer <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml\">in Drummer</a>, will be able to peer with Twitter without hacks. Yes, we'll probably have to give up some features, and if the API isn't there then that would kind of render the whole thing null and void, but all <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html\">we've been asking for</a> from Twitter et al is there in the screen shot. And if they need RSS support I'll be ready to provide it. ",
