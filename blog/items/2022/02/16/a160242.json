You didn't solve the problem, you just made it more complicated. The thing to do, imho, is to factor out the need for the callback, if you can. Pop up a level and ask why other languages don't have the mess, and then find out how they solved the problem. They do async stuff, it's just invivisble to the HLL programmer. They did the callback hell stuff once and buried it. There's a name for this process: <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/09/07/154126.html?title=factoring\">factoring</a>. That's the answer.
