    "text": "Three Beatles songs I'm rediscovering in a whole new way: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10\">I Am The Walrus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8\">Strawberry Fields</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naoknj1ebqI\">Lucy In The Sky</a>. I'm probably going to re-do my sound system just to hear these songs fully. And who knows what's next. This excursion into the Beatles is one of the best things I've ever done. It's had an impact on how I write my software, believe it or not. Sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun. If the sun don't come you get a tan from standing in the English rain.",
