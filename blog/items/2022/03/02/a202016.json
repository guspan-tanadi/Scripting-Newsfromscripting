    "text": "I cruised through the first season of <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=raised%20by%20wolves&collection=scriptingnews\">Raised By Wolves</a>, and the first four episodes of Season 2. But then I caught up and I'm waiting a week for every new episode, and this show doesn't work well that way. It's too complicated, so many characters, and they keep adding new ones, there's too much to remember, and I never got caught up with the story before the last episode was over. They're making different kinds of shows now, and the one episode per week style of distribution often doesn't work. For a show like Rick & Morty, fine. I don't even know if there's any continuity between episodes. The characters talk about the season, the fourth wall is often permeable in that show, but I don't care. The shows stand alone too. Some series, like the fantastic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)\">Counterpart</a> are completely unwatchable except by watching one season immediately after the other. I found the second season impossible to follow after the hiatus. Also if the show had a great runner in the first season don't bother with another season unless the same runner is still doing it. <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=killing%20eve&collection=scriptingnews\">Killing Eve</a> is the example. The third season was crap. There's a fourth one out now. Not planning on watching it. ",
