But... Watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury\">Freddie Mercury</a> perform <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0omja1ivpx0\">Radio Ga-Ga</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbvyNnw8Qjg\">Bohemian Rhapsody</a> at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid\">Live Aid</a>, you can see that it is possible to live a greater than a human-size life. Here I am watching this event that took place 37 years ago, electrified, emotionally touched, and FM is long-gone. So it is also possible to achieve some amount of immortality. Mercury has the experience that few of us get to have -- he can make love with many thousands of people at once, over decades. ",
