I wondered, when exactly did we conquer Covid? How did we do it? Spoiler: We didn't. It's very much still out there. Maybe the infection rates are low but they're not zero. I'm in the habit of wearing a mask, and I was far from the only one at the market today. I think I'm going to keep doing it. I see it as a way of saying to my fellow citizens that I care about your health. ",
