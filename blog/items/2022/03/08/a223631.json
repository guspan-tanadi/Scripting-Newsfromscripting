She said something I forgot about, that Hayes didn't respond to, and he should have. We are actually obligated at least morally to defend Ukraine because of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances\">agreement</a> we entered in with them when they gave up their nuclear weapons after the break-up of the USSR. They were the third largest nuclear power. Had they kept their nukes, Russia attacking them would have been a far riskier move for Putin. It would be the exact thing we're all worried about if the US and Russia engage militarily. The doctrine of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction#:~:text=Mutual%20assured%20destruction%20(MAD)%20is,nuclear%20strike%20and%20second%20strike).\">Mutual Assured Destruction</a> kicks in. We said we will protect Ukraine because they gave up their nukes. Oddly so did Russia, btw. Why didn't Hayes acknowledge this? Instead he rushed her off. He should've cancelled the rest of his program and asked his experts what they think of that. Doesn't bode well for Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, or Poland, Moldova, Rumania, Hungary, et al.",
