    "text": "Today was a internet outage day. I have a generator but the internet goes down when <a href=\"https://www.cenhud.com/en/outages/\">Central Hudson</a> power goes down, I guess they feel they're entitled to a day off, whatever. I hate it when the internet goes down. And I thought \"Electric Drummer\" would be fine without the net, but I guess not. I had this long excellent post written, but when I tried to move things around well it turns out it wasn't saving it. I wish I hadn't lost it. It was a lovely post. Score one for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit_happens\">Shit Happens</a> crowd. ",
