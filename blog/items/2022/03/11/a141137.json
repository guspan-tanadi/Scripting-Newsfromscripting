    "text": "I heard a plausible theory why <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland\">Garland</a> et al haven't indicted Trump. They think it'll give him a new platform, a new cause. He'll fundraise like crazy. Something to campaign on in November and in 2024. But I see a silver lining. Let him campaign in 2022, and make the issue about whether the US wants to go where Russia is. Do we want a Putinite running the US? If so, vote for Trump. Let's have an election about what it's really about for a change. Straight out, do you want to be ruled by an autocrat or do you want to keep trying to have the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution#To_form_a_more_perfect_Union\">more perfect union</a>? I think a very compelling campaign could be had. And if, in the end, the people want to be ruled by an autocrat, then that's where we're going next. I don't think it'll last very long, when Americans find out what it really means. There's a good chance it all falls apart when the Supreme Court overturns Roe.",
