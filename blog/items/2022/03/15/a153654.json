    "text": "At one point in the ride I was shuffling podcasts and thinking this is too dangerous and then I remembered I'm driving a car that theoretically can drive itself. So I clicked the right stick down twice to activate the driving functionality and took my hands off the steering wheel. I talked to the car as if it were a 17-year-old learning to drive, giving it encouragement and preparing to take over when it started to drive off the road. Something weird happened, it started flashing red, and then really started flashing red, which I interpreted as \"I can't handle this, you take over, Mr Human.\" Which I did. But I was driving on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_209\">US 209</a>, basically a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9641439,-74.0222502,3a,75y,200.84h,80.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D284.48877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192\">freeway</a>, two lanes in each direction, divided, lots of room everywhere, good weather, well marked lanes. If it couldn't handle this, what could it handle? This was the first time I tried letting it drive itself. Not sure what went wrong. ",
