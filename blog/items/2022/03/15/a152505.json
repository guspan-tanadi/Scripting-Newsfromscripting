    "text": "So I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how I have really good friends for a long time who have never used an outliner, and somehow must think they understand me at some level, when they just can't. Imagine for example you had a friend who was a guitar player. Not the most famous or best ever, but still someone who had devoted their life to creating music with guitars. And then imagine not only had you not listened to your friend playing the guitar, but you hadn't listened to <i>anyone</i> play a guitar. You didn't know what a guitar was. You sent them a link to a story about someone humming while driving and asked if it was like that. That's been my experience. I live with it. But I've never liked it. My software actually isn't hard to learn, at least not compared to other software like Twitter, Facebook, a word processor, an ATM. It's a low-grade source of frustration. Most days I write stuff on this blog and hear back nothing. But it seems some people read it. I just write for myself. I think I'm going to go back to doing that with software too. 2021 was an exceptional year, I decided to devote the whole year to creating a real end-user piece of softwaare -- \"Drummer\". I never hear anything nice about it. Mostly from people who refuse to read the docs complaining that they don't know how to do something that's covered in the docs. This isn't what I had in mind when I spent all of last year building the product and writing excellent docs. ",
