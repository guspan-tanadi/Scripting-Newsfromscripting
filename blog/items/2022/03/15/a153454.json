Chris Lydon talks to all the most interesting academics, and it's clear they really like and respect him. If you watch MSNBC, skip Rachel Maddow one night every week and listen to Chris and his guests. I think they should put him on TV with exactly the same guests as he has now, and let him cover exactly what he covers. It's much higher quality than anything you get from any other source. Swear to god. It's for adults, smart ones. It's not a bedtime story (and that's a good thing).",
