    "text": "Another example. I probably spent in total a whole month doing the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2022/01/23/153755.html?title=howToUseTreechartFromDrummer\">Tree Chart</a> app. Two comments. One saying they wanted more features, and another from a semi-famous person who said he missed MORE, so I pointed him to Drummer. He complained that the tree chart part of Drummer wasn't as good as MORE's and that's it. Nothing beyond that. I wonder if people know how much effort it takes to create something like this (obviously they don't) or are willing to invest anything at all in helping? Obviously not that either. So I think the only way to go is to create software for a market of one -- me -- and leave it at that. Maybe I'll share some of it, maybe I won't. It's a lot of extra work to share it, and from my point of view, the work is an utter waste of time. Basically most people are selfish assholes. I think the Beatles felt this way about their fans too. I've been learning so much about them this year. But at least we all listened to their music, even if we had no idea who they were, and how they created the music. ",
