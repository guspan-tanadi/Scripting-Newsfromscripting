    "text": "Something I learned from reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811\">Elie Mystal's book</a>. The Second Amendmentâ€™s original <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-slave-owners-dictated-the-language-of-the-2nd-amendment\">purpose</a> was to enable slavers in Virginia to put down a slave rebellion without depending on the federal government. It wasn't put in the Constitution so people could protect themselves against robbers, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and if appropriate there could be laws that allow it specifically. But it isn't really a Constitutional right. ",
