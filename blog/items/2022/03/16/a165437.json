It’s not just that he wins championships, it’s that he leaves behind wrecks. Fans don’t want to win as much as we want to love. I’m glad he never chose the Knicks. I can’t imagine another team accepting LeBron unless he swears he will leave the team in better condition than he found it. That would be something worth giving a try. Go to Orlando, for example, and don’t bring any stars with you, just work. And do it for a dollar a year. Then there will be at least some goodwill for you going forward. ",
