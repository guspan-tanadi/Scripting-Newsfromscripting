    "text": "I wrote something the other day that bears repeating. \"When you read something, you're not in touch with the author's emotions, not when they wrote it, and esp not now, long after they wrote it. Emotions are fluid things, and unless you're very careful, it's unlikely that the emotions you are feeling, as you read the piece, are the author's. It would be a remarkable coincidence if they were. They're your feelings.\" It <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/03/09/145728.html?title=writingReadingAndProjection\">goes on</a> from there.",
