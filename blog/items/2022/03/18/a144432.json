    "text": "My two cents: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1504807644963479562\">The NYT Editorial Board is correct</a>. We all <a href=\"https://www.memeorandum.com/220318/p17#a220318p17\">filter</a> what we say to avoid all kinds of <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsuris\">tsuris</a>. Sometimes it's cops at your house in SWAT gear, guns drawn, responding to a call there's been a murder. Or a knock on the door from a stranger, saying they just wanted to know if this is where you live. It could be a small thing, or it could drive you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape\">out of business</a>. The key point is people hold back what they think because they don't want the drama or danger that would come from expressing the idea. The rebuttals are stale. Heard them for decades. It doesn't change the fact that there's important ideas not being exchanged. And we need the best minds, with the freshest ideas to deal with the issues of the day.  And btw this kind of suppression is just as effective as what the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/florida-senate-approves-dont-say-gay-bill-00015120\">Repubs are doing</a> in Florida, for example. Think about that, and look in the mirror. You aren't that different from them. ",
