They're your feelings.",

Because writing is different, transcribing thoughts and feelings I had long ago. Writing feels very different. Usually I'm laughing out loud if I'm writing something that I really like. Writing is like riding a roller coaster. Often it's an exercise in frustration, but when you get it right, it's a wonderful feeling, it's a joyful act, paradoxically, even when you're writing about something that is far from joyful. ",
