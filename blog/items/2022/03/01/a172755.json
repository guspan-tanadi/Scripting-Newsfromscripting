Makes you wonder what some products would be like if the devs really focused on Bookmarks. A product that desperately needs bookmarks is Amazon S3. Count the number of steps it takes to get to a folder you need to get to all the time. A simple bookmark facility could reduce that to one step. Amazon if you'd like help with the design, I've learned a lot about it. My rates are reasonable. :smile:",
