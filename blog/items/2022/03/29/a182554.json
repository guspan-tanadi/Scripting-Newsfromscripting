There was one place where the Thruway narrowed to one lane, and it freaked out because it couldn't tell if it was driving off the road or what. So I took over. It's like having a teenage driver helping out, and you just have to be ready to take the wheel to get it through difficult situations. ",

I couldn't figure out what it thought it saw. Just guessing that the software, confused, decided better to be safe. I love it for trying to #savemylife, but it really wasn't necessary. ;-)",

I tend to be a nervous passenger, much prefer to be the driver. That's changing now. ",
