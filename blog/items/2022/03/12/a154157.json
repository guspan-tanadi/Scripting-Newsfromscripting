I'm guessing most people who read that piece have no idea what I'm talking about, because most don't think about online systems as defining a base of content they can move around. Think of it this way. Imagine if you couldn't fly into one city, you had to take a train, but to another city you had to fly, there was no train. The obvious thing would be to build a train route to the city without one, and do the same for air. ",

I see Twitter is advertising that they're going to open up. Then this is going to be a problem they have to deal with too. I also believe it can be solved. I've been using a reader that handles both kinds of posts since the advent of RSS, there to be copied by anyone who dared to look. ",
