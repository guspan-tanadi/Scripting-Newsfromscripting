    "text": "Update: This is how Substack's reader deals with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/10/substackTitlelessPosts.png\">title-less posts</a>. They generate a title from the permalink of the post. I don't think this is necessary, I think designers of readers have to pick a different starting point if they want to work with the way writing in the web works today. I know they don't pay any attention to me, which is really weird, because I do know a thing or two about this. ",
