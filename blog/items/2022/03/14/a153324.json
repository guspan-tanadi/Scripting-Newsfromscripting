A <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/14/fatRussianMcDonaldsFan.png\">fat</a> Russian man named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikas_Safronov\">Nikas Safronov</a> chains himself to a closed Moscow McDonald's, fighting for his right to a cheeseburger. “They don’t have the right to close down!” On Wikipedia he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikas_Safronov#/media/File:Nikas_Safronov_13.03.10-022.jpg\">looks</a> like a rock star. Seriously. If this is what we did to Russia, well I understand now what we're looking at. That could be Lincoln, Nebraska -- if they lost their Wendy's or Boston if they cut off the internet. We need to turn our attention to the people of Ukraine, and observe the difference. The future demands our determination. We are failing the test. Putin, Trump, Boris Johnson, they're all the same disease. To break free and get our species on track, we need to face ourselves. So much of what I hear as criticism of Russia applies equally to the US. ",
