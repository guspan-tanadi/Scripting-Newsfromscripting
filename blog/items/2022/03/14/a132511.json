    "text": "This subject comes up in <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Ben Thompson's latest newsletter</a>, which he has kindly given me a free subscription to. He discusses <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack's</a> business model. The occasion is their releasing an iOS version of their \"RSS\" reader. Since Substack is VC-funded, I am suspicious of their support for RSS. I expect there's lock-in in there. But I don't have the time or actual interest to dig in and find out what they did. I know they require you to use their editor to publish through their channel. When they came out I was looking for a way to distribute this blog via email, so I asked if they supported inbound RSS. No. You have to use their editor. Well I had been through that with Facebook and Medium and was fed up with software turning me into a typist. As with most writers, I have a writing setup that I'm happy with, and I'm not going to change all that just to get an email delivery system. I wrote my own <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">emailer</a>. I wish we had a good way to offer that to everyone, but that takes time that I don't have. And frankly some users aren't adult enough to deal well with gifts. So writers who want to distribute via email are getting locked in. So it goes. ",
