    "text": "The point of yesterday's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/03/23/135414.html?title=aPhilosophicalQuestion\">philosophical question</a> was this. The Constitution says the government may not search you unless there's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20probable%20cause,or%20was%20committing%20a%20crime.\">probable cause</a>. That doesn't mean that people you invite to enter your house should be allowed to go through your private stuff. It may not be illegal, but we still recognize it as wrong. In the same way, you have \"free speech\" in America, even when it isn't the government restricting your speech, when it's your employer, school, family or friends. No law prohibits them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1357/\">point</a>, but being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans of all persuasions, wrong, un-American.
