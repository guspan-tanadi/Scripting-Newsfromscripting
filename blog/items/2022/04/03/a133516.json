    "text": "I am soooo glad that <a href=\"https://nintendoswitchsports.nintendo.com/?cid=N1101-01:ch=pdpd\">sports</a> are coming to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch\">Nintendo Switch</a>. Now I will use mine. I thought they would, of course, have ported <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports\">Wii Sports</a> to the Switch as the first thing. Kind of like MacWrite and MacPaint. I never bought any other software for my Wii. The fact that I could play tennis in my living room, or golf or go bowling -- that's all I ever wanted. I imagine the new Sports will do a bunch of things the original couldn't, they've had fourteen years to work on it. ",
