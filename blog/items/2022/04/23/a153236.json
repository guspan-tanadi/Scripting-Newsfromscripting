    "text": "Two new season 2's I'm going to watch. First, Russian Doll. I thought the first season was <i>way</i> <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/russian-doll/season-1\">overrated</a>, but I liked the scenes from NYC, and I like the star, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Lyonne\">Natasha Lyonne</a> from OITNB, so I'll give it another chance. And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)\">Gentleman Jack</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gentleman-jack\">first season</a> I absolutely <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=gentleman%20jack&collection=scriptingnews\">adored</a>. I'm rewatching season one so I'll be ready when the new season starts on HBO on April 25. It's already <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gentleman-jack/season-2\">started</a> on BBC. And in just six days the new version of <a href=\"https://nintendoswitchsports.nintendo.com/en/\">Wii Sports</a> arrives for the Switch, so you know what I'll be doing in May, June, July and so on.
