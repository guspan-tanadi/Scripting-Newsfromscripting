    "text": "I'd love to see some publication do a comparison of legal cannabis in various different states. How does the quality compare, prices? What states have public places like bars and coffee shops where it's legal to hang out and consume as in Amsterdam (where it's not legal, I know, but tolerated). New Jersey just opened yesterday, and I was interested in seeing how prices compare to those in Massachusetts. Too early to draw any conclusions. But I can tell you that it's way more expensive than in Washington or Oregon. ",
