    "text": "I'm working my way through Paul McCartney's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)\">first solo album</a>. It was as big an event in 1970 as Elon Musk tweeting that he wanted to acquire Twitter in 2022. The album amounted to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Press_release_and_the_Beatles'_break-up\">announcement</a> that the Beatles were broken up. In fact, Lennon had already quit the group, but hadn't announced it publicly. But it's a <i>good</i> album. I listened the hell out of it when I was a teen and in my 20s, but never really <i>listened</i> to it if you know what I mean. Like try <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCppWWmIGQ\">this song</a> out. Or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY\">this</a>. So much to listen to. And he did the album, in secret, and on really low tech hardware with no mixing board. Just four tracks straight to tape. Much more lightly produced than Beatles songs, no grand George Martin productions, just McCartney and that's worth something.",
