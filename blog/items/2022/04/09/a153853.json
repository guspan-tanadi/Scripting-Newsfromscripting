Now I will add it to the official archive on GitHub and add it to the daytona.scripting.com index. (Unfortunately each of the OPML files has the same title, so we've lost the titles of the pieces. They could be reconstructed from the web archive, but that would be very tedious. I'm going to try to figure out how this collection was created.)",
