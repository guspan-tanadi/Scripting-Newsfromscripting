    "text": "I found the archive of all the DaveNet stories going back from 1994 to 2004 in OPML, the format that the Daytona database uses, including the titles and publication dates. I'm going to spend a little time gettomg it in shape, and then upload the database and all the OPML text to the GitHub repo. A bit of restoration work. I love this, there's a lot of good stuff here. I started a <a href=\"http://this.how/davenetInOpml/\">this.how page</a> for this project. ",
