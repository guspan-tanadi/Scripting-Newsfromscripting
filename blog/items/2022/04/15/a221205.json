    "text": "Like many fans of the Grateful Dead I thought Bertha was about a fan in the Dead office named Bertha, <a href=\"https://www.dead.net/features/greatest-stories-ever-told/greatest-stories-ever-told-bertha\">but</a> it's the other way around, the fan was given the name of the song. On the other hand, the Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXawa90YU2s\">Martha My Dear</a> <i>is</i> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_My_Dear\">about</a> Paul McCartney's Old English Sheepdog <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=martha+mccartney\">Martha</a>. Speaking of McCartney, I learned recently that he co-wrote the fantastic Elvis Costello song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-rF4COOd9c\">Veronica</a>. It's definitely got the McCartney feel to it, another spin perhaps on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y\">Eleanor Rigby</a>, which is <i>not</i> a good song to Peloton to, btw, imho.
