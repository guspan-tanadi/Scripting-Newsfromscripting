    "text": "One more thing -- the NBA Playoffs are here! And while my Knicks are not in contention this year, it does have the feel of an unusually good year. One reason it's so cool, no <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2022/04/06/lakers-eliminated-from-playoff-contention-suns-loss\">LeBron James</a>! Hopefully at some point he'll stop trying to form superteams and finish his career with humility and grace, away from contention. I am rooting for teams with stars who have never won a championship, notably the Phoenix Suns and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul\">Chris Paul</a>. I'm also glad to see the Warriors are back in the mix with the same big three and no Kevin Durant, who I will be rooting <i>against</i> every time he takes the court. I hope Boston blows the Nets out so that embarassment for the great city of New York is over for another year. Maybe they want him back in Oklahoma? I'm interested to see if James Harden can get it together to have a good long run, and while he has never won a championship, hmmm, I don't know. He played on the Nets this year, and for that reason I question his motivations. I do not like artificially created superteams designed to win championships. And of course they rarely do. So hopefully that chapter of the NBA will be over. One thing for sure <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/07/09/1363.html\">sports is not arithmetic</a>, esp not basketball.",
