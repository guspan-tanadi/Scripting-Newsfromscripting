    "text": "Because the weather has been delightful here the last few days, I'm afraid I got no work done this week. I basically gave up today and spent time in the sun, reading, listening to music, went for a walk, did some shopping, took a long nap in the afternoon. I guess I was overdue for some downtime. It is a wonderful time of year, winter truly is over. We will still get some coldish weather, no doubt, but the glory of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains\">Catskills</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE\">summer</a> is coming soon. It's the <i>best</i> place to be in the summer. ",
