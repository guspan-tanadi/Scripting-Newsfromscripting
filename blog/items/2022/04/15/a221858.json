I'm sure there's better search software out there, but no one else has the sheer quantity of blog-writing over so much time in a searchable index. There are bits missing here and there, and I'm determined to fill those bits in -- but the archive goes from October 7, 1994 at 11:27AM to the present day. A lot of stuff happened in that time, and some of it happened right <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">here</a>. I hope someday it proves to be a useful resource to people studying this period, with the usual caveat, assuming the human species survives. :smile:",
