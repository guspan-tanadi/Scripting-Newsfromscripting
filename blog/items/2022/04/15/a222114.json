    "text": "I love all the Beatles songs, but get the most, these days, out of John Lennon's songs. I learned that Lennon only partially completed his songs, leaving a lot of the work to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin\">George Martin</a>. Keep that in mind when you listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10\">I Am The Walrus</a> (my favorite Beatles song) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8\">Strawberry Fields</a>, as examples. The orchestral bits are pure Martin. ",
