If a Musk company can do that, yeah I think they can give users more control over the bullshit they have to deal with on Twitter. The thing is Twitter has been stuck since 2006 when it started. They hired people to make the system run reliably, which is fantastic, hat's off, but it needs a few more things to be able to realizae its potential as a world-scale notification system for all kinds of networked writing.
