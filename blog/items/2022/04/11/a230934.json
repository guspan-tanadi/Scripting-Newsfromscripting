    "text": "BTW, I have experienced momentous and bad things, and have never had this kind of super conscious awareness preview. My 18-year-old uncle driving his car at 60 mph on city streets in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmhurst,_Queens\">Queens</a>, going through a stop sign. A car coming the other way smashes into ours. No seatbelts. Our car spins around, my head crashes into the window, breaks it. I get out of the car and run around a few times and then pass out. Broken collarbone. I don't remember any of this, I didn't experience it, consciously. I was told this is what happened and what I did. There was no fear, presumably because fear wouldn't have helped me survive?",
