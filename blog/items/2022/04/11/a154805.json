Here's a <a href=\"http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/DaveNet/1997.opml\">link</a> that opens the 1997 DaveNets. You just have to change the number in the URL to open a different year. I picked 1997 because that was a big year for innovation. The basic ideas of blogging were starting to become pretty obvious. And it's all there in the archive. ",
