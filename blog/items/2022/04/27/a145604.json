It's a really interesting album because they're all Beatles songs. He wrote them to do with the Beatles. But they had already broken up. At the time no one knew. So he bought a tape deck and recorded them all on his own. He has a beautiful voice. And they're not big productions, though they would've been if they had been done by the Beatles. This is like blogging or punk rock, but it's McC. What's not to like? It's Paul McCartney man. Get over yourself. ",
