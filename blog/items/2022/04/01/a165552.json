    "text": "I hate April 1 on the web and esp in news orgs, whose <i>business</i> is posting stuff that's true. I tend to take things literally as I read them, and puzzle my way through strange news, until it hits that I've been burned. I waste a fair amount of time on April 1 wading through this nonsense. The only thing you can do is let people know in advance that if they troll you with one of these things, if it's on a system where I can block you, that's what I do. If it's a news org, I try to remember never to trust anything they write, because they clearly have no respect for their own mission. So I posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1729710617236336?comment_id=1729845797222818\">message</a> on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/fbwarningaboutapril1garbage.png\">FB</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1509848417098518534\">Twitter</a> establishing this rule, and wouldn't you know it, some people actually post \"jokes\" there. Mostly it's harrassment. Bitterness I guess. They don't like life, so they drop little turds on message threads to get attention. Yes I block them. Yes, it's tiresome. There is a certain amount of overhead to maintaining one's integrity. If you say you're going to block someone, you have to actually do it. Kind of like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGfvV3Syud8\">second to last scene</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men_(film)\">No Country for Old Men</a>, if you remember it.  I got here the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/gotHereTheSameWayTheCoinDid.png\">same way</a> the coin did. Gotta do what I gotta do. ",
