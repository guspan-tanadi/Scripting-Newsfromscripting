There's a fair amount of angst about this but he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1511341423198670857\">might</a> be really good for it. He's actually made software, himself -- and presumably knows how to write a bug report. And he uses the product. I don't imagine too many of the other board members at Twitter really use it. Leadership from users, what a concept.",
