    "text": "So much stupid analysis by journalists about Elon Musk buying Twitter. The thought that a billionaire is automatically not qualified to run Twitter. The opposite is true. This billionaire has a track record of making companies much like Twitter work well for users and profitably for shareholders. And what they do is probably even harder than writing software to moderate tweets. Even better give users more tools to do their own moderation. With a little creativity I think these problems have efficient solutions. Who else are you going to get to run something like Twitter? Do we know anything about the guy they chose to run it after Jack Dorsey's departure? More journalists should get training in the scientific method, and at the same time, think a just a little before making fools of themselves. I'm thinking of the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/15/elon-musk-demonstrates-how-little-he-understands-about-content-moderation/\">Masnick piece</a> that's getting top billing on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Techmeme/status/1515379804228313090\">Techmeme</a>. It's riddled with quick judgment and assumptions and arrogance. ",
