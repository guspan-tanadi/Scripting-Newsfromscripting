As a user, once it's set up, you're just using wifi. I ordered it as a backup for my land-based net connection from Spectrum, which sometimes goes out where I live in the mountains in upstate NY. StarLink is made by <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/\">SpaceX</a>, which like Tesla, is a company run by Elon Musk. Anyway, I read how simple it was to set up, so I opened the box and put it together myself and it worked. These are my notes from the setup.</i>",
