    "text": "I'm going to continue to wear a mask when I go out in public. My face feels naked without it. The other day I went into the supermarket without a mask and had to go back out to the car to get one. In that moment I got to think about why I wear a mask even when others aren't. It's because I want to send a message to my fellow shoppers that I care about their health. I was raised to be a considerate person. So many people were raised to be self-centered and pissy. I never want to see myself that way. Anyway it was really annoying how quickly the airlines took down their mask requirements. I suggest if you want to make your feelings known to them, stop flying until they bring the mandates back.",
