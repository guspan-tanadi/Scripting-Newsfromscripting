    "text": "Also worth mentioning, because I have signed up for <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org\">Tweets-in-JSON</a>, I now have all <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/04.json\">my tweets from April</a> automatically archived in a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner\">collection</a> of JSON files on GitHub. If you're a geekish person and you use Twitter, you should sign up too, even if you don't know how you'll use the archive today, you might be enticed at some time in the future, and will like to have this archive around ready to play with. BTW it understands threads and preserves the structure. Here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/04.json#L997\">link</a> to an example in my archive. I bet if you're clever you could figure out how to display that thread just from the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/04.json#L997\">link</a>? :smile:",
