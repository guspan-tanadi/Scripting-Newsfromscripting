    "text": "My mother died in 2018. Ever since, I imagine conversations we didn't have, about who we are, and what she really wanted from and for me. Those conversations never happened. I try not to be too hard on myself because she had an impenetrable wall around her. She had a defense against every truth. I wasn't with her when she died, and I wonder if in that moment she wanted to speak the truth just once, but there was no one there to hear it. She meant well. She wanted to be loved, but didn't know how to accept it. She felt powerless but if you knew her, if you weren't her son, you would never have known that. She did a lot of good in her life. She did the best she could. She was my mother and I loved her and I still to this day want her love. ",
