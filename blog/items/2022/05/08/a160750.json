I'm trading my Model 3 for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y\">Model Y</a> this week. The Y's were hard to get when I decided it was time to get a Tesla. The way values have been going, I'm paying very little to make this switch for cars of comparable value. The mileage on the 3 is low. And the cars are still very much in demand, it's a seller's market. I want the Y because I am tall, and getting in and out of the 3 is a pain. The Y, which has a different seating arrangement, is easier. ",
