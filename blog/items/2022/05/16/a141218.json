    "text": "Interesting results from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1525839800183431174\">yesterday's poll</a> about when life begins. Clearly the poll got spammed by right-to-lifers, many hours after the poll went up, the proportion who said life begins at conception shot up from 10 percent to over 35. A poll like this of course only means what you personally take from it, it has no mathematical significance. It's as if I asked a group of people in a subway car what they think, but the car was only going to my neighborhood. ",
