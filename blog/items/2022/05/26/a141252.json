You could say something ridiculous, intending it to be humorous, but I won't get it. I take things at face value. That's why I find April Fools so disturbing. But if you do it a lot I'll be tuned in, and you'll never get me again. I think it's a good thing to be irony-deficient btw. The universe is amazing and amazing things actually happen all the time. Being ID just means you have an open mind. ",
