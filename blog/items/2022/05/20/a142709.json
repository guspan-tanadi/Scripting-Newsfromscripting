    "text": "It's amazing that senators like Susan Collins expect an extrordinary level of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1527656326142345216\">service</a> when they have given their (necessary!) approval to four SC justices who they had to know were part of the open-but-deniable plot to dismantle the Constitution, starting with voting rights, and foreign money in our elections, and the latest offense the overturn of Roe. Collins plays on our assumption that grandmothers who appear kindly are more likely to be fooled than shifty. She milks that for all it's worth. Obviously if someone rises to her level of the Republican Party, a multi-term senator from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states\">blue state</a>, her reliable vote for Republican atrocities gets her a lot of deference, and we know it.
