McLuhan says to the professor: \"You know nothing of my work. How you ever got to teach to teach a course in anything is totally amazing.\" Allen looks at the camera: \"Boy if life were only like this.\" Well anyway, on Twitter, I am regularly pulled out from behind a poster to support someone who thinks \"RSS\" is doing fine. I'm supposed to play the role of McLuhan. I would enjoy that once, but not all the time for decades. :boom:",
