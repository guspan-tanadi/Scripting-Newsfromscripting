I haven't seen him in a few years, and at this time in our respective lives people's appearances can change dramatically. He looked good but old, like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=colonel+sanders\">Colonel Sanders</a>. I think he got a stylist and I'm guessing the Colonel Sanders look is deliberate? I'm sure he'll tell me. Anyway <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/11/nerd.png\">the nerd</a> is going on and on, and if that really is Doc, I can't imagine he knows what he's talking about, and why the hell should he. The guy was talking very fast about problems that I thought would have been solved long ago. This is 2022 after all. I guess that's just nature of computer stuff, we're always re-inventing things. I do it too. ",
