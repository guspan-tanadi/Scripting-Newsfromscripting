    "text": "I was out driving the new Model Y with a fresh pizza on the passenger seat, rounded a corner and there was a fat turkey waddling across the road. Slammed the brakes.

Where the Model 3 had the new car smell even six months after getting it, this car smells of pizza. Hey at least it was good pizza. Heh.",
