    "text": "We now have a list of <a href=\"http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml\">OPML-compatible apps</a>. It's a beginning, there are a bunch of apps that are not on the list. It's not just for editors, you can use OPML to pass outlines to apps that render outlines, for example, as a blog (that's Old School). There will be more of those.  BTW, of course the <a href=\"http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml\">list</a> is an outline, and the <a href=\"http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml?format=opml\">OPML version</a> is public, so you should be able to open it in any of the apps on the list.
