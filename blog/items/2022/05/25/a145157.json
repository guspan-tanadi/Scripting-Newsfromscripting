From Spotify to Tidal to Qobuz to Apple. Do a comparison — all shit.\" I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1529431623774752768\">wrote</a> in response: \"I’m a newcomer to music apps, but got a free six months with Amazon Music, and it works pretty well, just wish I had more control over offline mode because where I live there’s no cell coverage. Haven’t tried the others.\" Here's what I want in case anyone knows how to do it. They have a station that just plays music they think I'll like. And after six months, they have a pretty good idea, and the stuff they recommend often is stuff I really want to hear.  I want to tell it to download a couple of hours of this stuff. Or maybe always have a couple of hours downloaded. So when I'm out and about, maybe on my bike or driving around, I can listen to music uninterrupted. My iPhone has huge amounts of available memory, can't think of a better use of that space than music that's just for me. I hope there's a setting for this. It could just be a checkbox. Or even better, a preference that says how much memory it can use to cache stuff. ",
