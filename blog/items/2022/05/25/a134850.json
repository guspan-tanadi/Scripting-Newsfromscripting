    "text": "I finished <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-South-Won-Civil-War/dp/0190900903\">How the South Won the Civil War</a>, and it was somewhat of a disappointment. Obviously it's a college textbook, because it recites facts, names and dates, ad nauseum, things that are probably required by curricula (just guessing)m., and there isn't much in the book that I didn't already know. I was expecting something that truly lived up to the title, that explained why were still living with slavery today, but that isn't what the book is about. I think it's a provocative title for a pretty ordinary American history book. My next book is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson-ebook/dp/B084FLWDQG\">Caste</a> (*) and so far am getting a lot out of it. Will report. ",
