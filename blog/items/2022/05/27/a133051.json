I started with the source for a Unix line-oriented editor called YALOE and added dive and surface commands (left and right square brackets) for navigating the hierarchy, and commands to restructure the outline. I'm not sure this app even had a name. It had a language parser built in, so it could take bits of code and turn it into an outline structure. ",

The result was High Files, which also had a simple tabular database. Outlines could be cells in a database table, and tables could be contained within outlines. When I had that running, I moved from Madison to Mountain View, and did a deal with Personal Software for the outliner. It was hard to fit that app into 64K on an Apple II, but eventually we did, by then they had a big hit in VisiCalc, and they gave me back the product, and a settlement, and I spent the next few years doing online bulletin-board software. I was totally fascinated with using computer as networking tools. ",

It was also available on Windows, not sure if that version still works, probably like the Mac version, it does, only if you have an older version of Windows around.",
