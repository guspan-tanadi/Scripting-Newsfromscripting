    "text": "It's fascinating to watch the <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32116877\">discussion</a> at Hacker News re \"XML-RPC\". They got some things right. The protocol was designed in a couple of weeks by four people, two at Microsoft and two of us not. The Microsoft people were from their networking group. They wanted a cross-platform protocol to do what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model\">DCOM</a> does. It was and is a brilliant idea. I wanted it as a way of designing APIs for scriptable blogging systems. We were in the process of shipping a new Windows version of \"Frontier\", we already had a Mac version, and I wanted the two Frontiers to work beautifully together on LANs and on the net. I wrote a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html\">blog post</a> about it, when I figured out that it would be done with XML and HTTP. I then got an email from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft asking if I wanted to work with them on this. I always admired Bob and people like him at Microsoft, they had an excellent engineering culture imho, so of course I said yes. What followed was one of the most productive collaborations of my career. And as a result not only did Frontier get great cross-platform compatibility, all the early blogging systems has compatible APIs. To the Hacker News folks, that's what matters in a protocol, what kind of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop\">interop</a> did it enable. See my <a href=\"http://this.how/standards/\">Rules for standards-makers</a> for more on this.",
