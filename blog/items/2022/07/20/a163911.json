Mostly about how exciting it is to work with people on RSS again, but at the end I talk about a misbelief that I advocate that people should run their own webservers. Even in my most positive days about making the web easy I didn't think that. But I do think we need alternatives to the VC-backed \"free\" web hosting companies like Medium and Substack. We keep learning this lesson, and at some point we should get it together to provide really free hosting for writing, <i>with no business model attached</i>, supported by foundations and contributions. It just doesn't cost that much to do the hosting of text files. A Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1549825882763714572\">thread</a> expands on this idea. ",
