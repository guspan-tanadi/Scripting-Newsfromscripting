    "text": "Dear <a href=\"http://tv.youtube.com/\">YouTubeTV</a> which is constantly nagging me to reactivate their service. There's no way as far as I know to talk to them (they sure talk a lot to me) other than posting this publicly. So -- I would absolutely switch to your service if you had <a href=\"https://www.msgnetworks.com/\">MSG</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sny.tv/\">SNY</a>. I need to be able to watch Knicks and Mets games. That's all that keeps me with Spectrum whose software is nowhere near as good as Google's.",
