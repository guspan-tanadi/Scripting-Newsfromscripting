    "text": "NPR this morning did the ultimate unforgivable \"both sides\" horse-race bs -- they labeled people who support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade\">Roe v Wade</a> as extremists and wondered if such extremism will cause the Democrats to lose in November. Journalism will let the center go where ever the Repubs want to put it. Now Roe is extreme, last month it was the settled law, according to all but one of the Supreme Court justices (publicly, privately they were ready to destroy it). The problem isn't Repubs, they're just taking what we're letting them have. The problem is journalism and the Democratic Party, but even more broadly the problem is we don't put a stop to this and tell the Dems clearly that they have to get real, or we won't re-elect them.
