That, of course is exactly the challenge. To create tools that suit each type of data people push through feeds and make it visible and useful to people who want it. There's a wide variety from linkblogs like Hacker News, to description-only feeds from the NYT to full text from WordPress sites. And podcasts. And the totally possible Twitter feeds. And who know what else will be possible. We haven't been creative here for many, many, many years. ",

We had a big computer facility in New Jersey and I worked in Manhattan. We leased our customers teletypes where they would type queries and we're send back data. They could also program in BASIC. My job was to write tools for them so they would run them and use them for hours and of course very hour was money to my company, so I was incentivized to come up with things they'd use a lot.",
