I ask this question because up to this last week I felt that Christianity was other people’s problem, not mine. But they’ve captured the Supreme Court, and they’re using it to force their religion on the rest of us. So it’s no longer something that I can be neutral about. It seems that eventually, maybe very soon, we will come to hate Christianity.",
