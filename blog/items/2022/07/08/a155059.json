I mean how could he know. If he asked 80-year-olds there's a pretty good chance they lie to him, I expect. I wouldn't trust them. Here's what I think, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1545431247417139200\">this</a> is what you'll regret at 80 -- that you aren't 20. Heh. And btw it's because sex is great at 20. So if you're 20 you should do a lot of that. At least it'll make you smile when you're 80 (I imagine).",
