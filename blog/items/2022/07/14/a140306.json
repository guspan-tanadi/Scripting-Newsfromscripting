When reading a feed with items which have guids that are not permalinks, there was a serious bug where the guid that was there would be replaced with <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_undefined.asp\">undefined</a>. If the guid was a permalink that would mask the problem. I finally encountered a feed that had guids that were not permalinks. The fix is to add a new <i>permalink</i> sub-item. I know that not many people are following this, but I'm pretty sure you will, eventually. :boom:",
