    "text": "You can invent and evolve a new sport if you have all the elements. If you've got enough players, a venue, journalists, fans. If you want to change the rules, you don't need to get anyone's approval, you just need a vision, and you have to do the work. That's how I got blogging going, for example. I had tools for writing, and reading, and I generated feeds myself because I am a writer. I don't have to wait to find a writer who will try out my latest ideas. Or get a feed reader to support the feature, or have editing tools so that other people can do it. With RSS 2.0, I was intimidated when big companies and VCs got in the way. In the future I'll keep cruising because I know I have a better sense of what's needed than they do because  they just hire bored employees to work on my ideas. None of them have the guts, curiousity or frankly enough intelligence to work with the person who put it all together. Learned that lesson after twenty years of stagnation in RSS-Land. No more of that. ",
