    "text": "Programming note: September 18 is the 20th anniversary of RSS 2.0. After 20 years, there's a <i>lot</i> of new stuff that wasn't there when RSS 2.0 was rolled out, that because RSS has been stagnating, hasn't been added to the mix. I never should have stopped working on it, but the environment then was crazy. Anyway, I decided, at the beginning of 2022, that I'd spend the whole year building a new RSS toolkit. A top to bottom review. Only constraint is everything must be compatible with what's out there. With lots of room for innovation and refinement. Anyway -- today is a big day in the process. A lot of stuff is working, very little of it is visible. But a bunch of stuff that will make your brain explode, a little, is now available. If you care about RSS, please set aside a little time to focus on what's here in the blog for today. It's not complicated, but it is new. :smile:",
