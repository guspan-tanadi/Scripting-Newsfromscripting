And I'm using a traditional feed reader to browse their top stories. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1547962792585506817/photo/1\">mailbox</a>-style reader. Here's a <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.nytimes.com%2Fservices%2Fxml%2Frss%2Fnyt%2FHomePage.xml\">link</a> to just that. Why can't I have the full text of the article in the right panel of the reader? Remember, I'm a paid-up subscriber, so I'm not trying to pirate their content, I'd just like to read it along with the other pubs I care about without a lot of ads and other stuff.  I suppose I'd have to pay more for it?",
