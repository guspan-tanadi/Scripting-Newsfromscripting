    "text": "I don't like it when people I follow, who are smart and funny and make a contribution, RT their abusive replies. Puts me in a tough position, I can't tell them to stop and I don't want to unfollow them. Really the <i>only</i> thing to do with people who sent abusive tweets is to downvote them (a new Twitter feature) and then block them. The <i>last</i> thing you want to do is promote them. That will just get you more abuse and it stinks up everyone else's timeline. ",
