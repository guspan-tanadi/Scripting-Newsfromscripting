I thought of subscribing to it, but only found a link to an email service. Which led me to another question, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1573362670379716608\">wonder</a> if other tech companies might have \"RSS\" feeds for their corporate announcements. Maybe Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netscape, Spotify. I've become inquisitive about this again. PS: I was able to create a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts/feeds/16275940053249417217/456631927723350186\">feed</a> for this via Google Alerts. :smile:",
