You can get them to say anything you want. Russia doesn't even control the territory they're claiming as part of Russia! BTW, I finished the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/09/21.html#a152255\">Ken Burns</a> special on the Holocaust and the US. The Nazis did something similar with the press. If the US did something to help Jews, they'd run press releases saying \"See, the Jews really do run the world, just like we said!\" So the US didn't help Jews. And apparently that's not the whole story. There were Nazis in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breckinridge_Long#FDR_administration_and_World_War_II\">State Department</a>, at high levels. We also let Nazis emigrate to the US after the war, and turned away Jews -- because the Nazis were anti-Communist. I think we should consider giving back the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty\">Statue of Liberty</a>. ",
