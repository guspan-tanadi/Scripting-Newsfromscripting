    "text": "I'm glad the Knicks passed on <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/donovan-mitchell-went-screaming-around-120114890.html\">Donovan Mitchell</a>. Instead they'll groom their own superstars. There are so many good young prospects already playing for the Knicks. Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, RJ, Sims. This is team, the one they already have, is worth being patient for. And the current Knicks management, by hanging tough, remains a powerhouse for future deals and there will be more deals. Mitchell is a fine player, but far from the only one. ",
