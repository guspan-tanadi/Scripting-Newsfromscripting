    "text": "I went to sleep early last night, gave up on the Mets, they were down 4-0 and it felt like they were going to lose this game. I was kind of sad, because as usual Atlanta was winning. They are just one game behind the Mets in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=nl+east+standings\">NL East</a>, and that would have put them in a tie for first place. I should've had more faith. The Mets won. First Pete Alonso, the slugger, hit a three-run home run and then Francisco Lindor hit a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/09/20/francisco-lindors-grand-slam-propels-mets-to-comeback-win/\">grand slam</a>, and the Mets won! It's that kind of year.",
