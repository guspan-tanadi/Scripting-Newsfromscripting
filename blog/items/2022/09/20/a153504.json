    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/09/20/itDoesntMatterWhy.m4a\">Podcast</a>. I've been watching a lot of Mets baseball. The Mets are breaking a lot of records this year, including being <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/hit-by-pitch\">hit by pitches</a> more than any other team ever (almost). This taught me something important, along with watching the <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-us-and-the-holocaust\">Ken Burns documentary</a> about the Holocaust and the US (must-watch). I see Trump in Hitler now. Pretty revealing perspective. Now I wonder how my ancestors got here at all, given the antisemitism in the US then, which I can attest to (and provide proof of). You're wasting time watching MSNBC, much better off watching baseball and Ken Burns.",
