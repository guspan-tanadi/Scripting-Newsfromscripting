What? Unreal. Then it came to me, this is normal. It’s why even when the temperature in California is over 100 in lots  of  places,  we're  still pumping carbon into the atmosphere. Pakistan is drowning, and  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Powell#21st_century_drought\">Lake Powell</a> is drying up. Business as  usual. What was abnormal was the brief period when many made sacrifices to fight Covid.  Now we just  shrug  it  off, I guess?",
