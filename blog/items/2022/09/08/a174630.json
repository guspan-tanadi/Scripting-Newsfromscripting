Right now it's only in Node. It makes reading feeds of all flavors easy to just drop into an application. It lives up to its name, it's a simplification of RSS (and Atom and RDF) behind a single JSON interface. So you can put feed reading support into anything without taking on a huge project. Tools are so important.",
