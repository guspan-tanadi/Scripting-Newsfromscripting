I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1570424640647974913\">explain</a>. \"I manage the music myself. It's okay I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/07/28.html#a195031\">got</a> a nice new Android <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6\">phone</a>, and they let me use the Finder to copy music onto the phone, and I'm happy -- I'm gradually weaning myself off Apple. And <i>simple</i> does not equal 'breaking users and forcing them to use services they never asked for, for good reasons.' If I got in my car and tried to go somewhere and it said sorry we don't go there any longer, well since I drive a Tesla I do expect that day to come.\"",
