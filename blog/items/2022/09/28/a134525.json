    "text": "Believe it or not <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanweisman/status/1574561803295608832\">this</a> was written by a NYT reporter: \"Please Twitter, leave [<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=maggie+haberman\">Maggie Haberman</a>] alone. Trump lost the election, for God's sake. If Maggie had told you a little bit more before the election (she told you <i>a lot,</i> btw), what, you think Trump would have lost ... twice?\" Where do they find these people. It's amazing to me that the NYT doesn't fire both of them. I took a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/28/screenshot.png\">screen shot</a> in case he deletes the tweet. I wrote this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/09/27.html#a170831\">post</a> yesterday about Haberman.",
