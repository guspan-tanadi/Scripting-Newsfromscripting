    "text": "I connected with people on Twitter's developer relations team today. They had a conference call that I dialed into, and the conversation turned to my big wish for the Twitter API, that we organize the API so that from a browser-based app you can communicate directly with twitter.com, without having to run a server app as an intermediary. This has always been a big opportunity, but now there's communication. I've been developing apps using the Twitter API since 2006. There's lots of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/07/07/comparingApis.html\">potential</a> here, and their back-end is an incredible network resource. Lots to do here. Here's my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1532382742851244034\">followup thread</a> posted earlier today. ",
