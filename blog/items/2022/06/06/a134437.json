I had been saying all along that namespaces will be added to RSS when the spec is ready to be frozen, so growth can continue, after there is agreement on a common core of functionality. I felt that adding namespaces too early would encourage people to go their own ways, with different ways to do the same thing, which isn't good for interop. I wanted to encourage people to seek adoption from other developers. Otherwise what's the point of having a standard? Since RSS 2.0 was going to be frozen when it was published, that was the time to open the door for extensions. It's a way of saying \"this is done\" but it's not the end. :smile:",
