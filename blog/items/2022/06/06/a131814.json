I was taking notes on the process that led to RSS 2.0 on 9/18/02. There was a lot of discourse, ideas contributed, some implemented and others not. There were requests to deprecate elements, and people who thought the project should go in a completely different direction. At first the project was called RSS 0.94, but after a while, listening to other developers, I changed it to 2.0. It's a long messy story, and by calling it 2.0 we said enough of the messy story. All we want is a feed syndication format that works, and that's exactly what RSS 2.0 was. It worked. We got support from all the major news organizations, we already had the support of the NY Times, and in the process of designing RSS 2.0, the BBC released its feeds. And on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2002/09.html#When:10:25:22AM\">9/18/02</a>, the spec was published. From there a small revolution happened, leading to the social media world we enjoy today. ",
