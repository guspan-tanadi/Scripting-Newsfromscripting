    "text": "May I suggest listening to yesterday's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/06/25/dontWasteAGoodCrisis.m4a\">podcast</a>. It's full of timely stories, and reason to hope that now we will do what we've been putting off since the end of the Civil War. In the podcast I reference Bruce Sterling's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html\">talk</a> in Copenhagen in 2009 and Elie Mystal's book about the Constitution which I strongly urge you to get and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811\">read</a> or (preferred) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/B09TCGZSDN/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">listen to</a>.",
