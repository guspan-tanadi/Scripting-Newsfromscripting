For example, <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffallows.substack.com%2Ffeed\">feeds from Substack</a> are good for mailbox readers because their items are titled essays and the full text is in the feed. But <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnytimes.com%2Ftimeswire%2Ffeeds%2F\">NYT feeds look terrible</a>, as <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml\">does Scripting News</a>. The mailbox reader, which was popularized by Google Reader, is designed for titled full-text feeds. The NYT has titles on its feed items, but just a synopsis. There's so much <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/22/wastedSpace.png\">wasted space</a> in the display and it looks and feels unbalanced. I like whitespace, but that's not what this is. The NYT and Scripting work much better in a river-style display, which is the pattern that Twitter and Facebook use, for example. BTW, in my feed, some posts have titles, but the majority don't. A mailbox reader can't deal with untitled posts, I've given up on trying to make it work, it just doesn't.",
