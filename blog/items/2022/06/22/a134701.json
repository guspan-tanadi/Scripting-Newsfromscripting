    "text": "I had broken the mailbox template for the feeder app. It's back. Here's a <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadamsinger.substack.com%2Ffeed\">demo</a>. I'm also making sure that we don't break urls as we go along and I change things. For example, this is a <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmailbox?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">request</a> that changed in two ways. It should still work, getting us a mailbox view of the feed for this blog. I'm probably the only person who cares about this. :smile:",
