You shouldn't get to self-declare yourself the 3rd coming of something as hugely significant as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web\">world wide web</a>. I don't think we should have used the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0\">Web 2.0</a>, but don't blame me for that one.",
