    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin\">George Martin</a> was a Beatle and should be credited as such. Ever since <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back\">Get Back</a> came out, I've been seeking out Beatles experiences, and there's a huge difference between the music of John, Paul, George and Ringo before and after the breakup, and the biggest difference imho is what Martin added. There's a depth and beauty to Beatles music that none of the Fab Four had after the break. Listen to a Lennon song on Abbey Road, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45cYwDMibGo\">Come Together</a>, and compare it to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8\">Imagine</a>. Both are great songs, some of the best music ever created. But there's a depth to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Together\">Come Together</a> that just isn't there in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)\">Imagine</a>. That's Martin.",
