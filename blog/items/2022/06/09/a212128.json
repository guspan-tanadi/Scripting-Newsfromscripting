    "text": "I like Amazon Music. I tried Spotify, but I don't like how they're taking the word <i>podcast</i> and trying to turn it into nothing, the usual thing about big shitty tech companies, they consume good things and leave a wreck behind like Google did to \"RSS\" and is trying to do to the web), so I'm sticking with Amazon (they're doing it too, but for some reason it doesn't bother me as much, I know it makes no sense). It just struck me that these music services are <i>better</i> than <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=napster&collection=scriptingnews\">Napster</a>, a lot better, and I found Napster to be one of the most empowering software products ever. In 2000, I was 45 years old, and had spent my life up to then unable to program music for myself. I couldn't afford to buy all the music I wanted, there was no software I could command to get me the song I wanted to listen to now. I knew I was cheating with Napster, but the music industry wasn't selling this product, and the music meant so much to me, I had to find out what that was. Now, 22 years later, they have managed to give me <i>more</i> than what I wanted in 2000, at a reasonable price. Just wanted to say that I'm glad this loop is closed. I feel sad for people who never got to experience programming their own music. But I'm glad that I did. :boom:",
