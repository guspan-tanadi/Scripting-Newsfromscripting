There's one point in the episode when a white man <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6jL8hXUfa0\">explains slavery</a> from the point of view of today's blacks, and you realize as it makes sense, the words were probably from a black writer. The power of being able to have the ideas you want white people to understand come from the mouth of a white actor. They get to insert their truth into the script the way Woody Allen inserts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRcMsqCbzWk\">Marshall McLuhan</a> into the script of Annie Hall. ",
