    "text": "The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/sports/basketball/boston-celtics-golden-state-nba-finals-game-1.html\">first game</a> of the NBA Finals totally lived up to the promise of this series. The first part of the game was dominated by the team with championship experience, but the newcomers eventually sorted it all out, and proved that the experienced team would not coast to victory on their existing skills. They're going to have to develop some new ones to make it through this contest. The second game is Sunday night. I'm rooting for the newcomers, but not by a lot. I love both teams, they both have a lot to recommend them, and they are teams that were formed out of the draft, so there's continuity, and a victory in either case will have meaning to the the fans of both.
