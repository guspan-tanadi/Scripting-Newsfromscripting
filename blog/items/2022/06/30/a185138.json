I can't imagine where he could possibly go. Maybe somewhere in the midwest like Denver or Dallas. Maybe <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-kevin-durant-requests-trade-from-nets-185500155.html\">Phoenix</a> to try to fill the shoes of the great Chris Paul. Maybe he and Russell Westbrook and James Harden could get back together somewhere to finish up their careers. Or maybe the Clippers. I'd like the Knicks to please turn the other way. No he's not welcome in NY. Thank you. I bet he thinks he's going to Boston. That would be a huge mistake imho. Maybe he can play in Europe or China. <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&collection=scriptingnews\">Durant</a>, no matter how good he is choked twice. He didn't fit in Golden State, and what a fiasco in Brooklyn which anyone could see coming. Maybe he could take a sabbatical or a gap year to see the world. I think he'll be boo'd in every NBA city. I guess I could be wrong about that. Cleveland or Miami might want him.",
