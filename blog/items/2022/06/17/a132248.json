    "text": "Elon Musk half-endorsed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis\">Ron DeSantis</a> for president in 2024. DeSantis is a younger, more attractive, ambitious and not quite so openly hostile to non-whites version of Trump. Asked to comment, DeSantis makes a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3525627-desantis-on-musk-tweet-i-welcome-support-from-african-americans/\">Musk-like joke</a>, he welcomes African-American support (Musk is from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/world/africa/elon-musk-south-africa.html\">South Africa</a>). If this is what Musk means by free speech, well we're free to walk away from a Musk-owned Twitter. Where will we go? Probably nowhere. It's not possible for a service to take Twitter's place, it was formed a long time ago, and morphed into what it is now. I don't think any system will show up where there's a consensus that <i>this</i> is the new Twitter. ",
