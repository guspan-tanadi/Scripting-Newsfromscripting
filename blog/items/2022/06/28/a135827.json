    "text": "My blogging ethos came from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog\">Whole Earth Catalog</a>. They moved from technical howto-type stuff to whatever was on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand\">SB's</a> mind. If the ideas come from the same mind, and the pub is a product of that person's mind, it's perfect. I remember reading it at my uncle's house in Florida, totally off the grid little geodesic he made himself. I loved the Whole Earth book because it seemed like my uncle. an engineer and hippie. He was another big influence in my path to eclectic, jumping where my mind wanted to go, even if it took years.",
