So I went to their <a href=\"https://www.web3.yslbeauty.com/\">glorious web3 adventure</a> only to find -- <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/15/web3DaresYou.png\">ooops</a>. If it had worked I am told that I might get a YSL Beauty NFT. \"Acting as a recognition token of the community engagement, those 10K YSL Beauty Golden Blocks (ERC721 minted on Polygon with the Arianee Protocol) will unlock utilities throughout the year including a premiere launch, whitelisting for NFT drops and much more.\" I'm making a note of this here on my decidedly old school tech blog. We have so much to learn from their brave and daring experiment.    ",
