    "text": "Why work on \"Radio3\" now? I've had it on my list for a long time. It's long overdue for an overhaul. I wrote it when I was new to JavaScript and didn't really understand the rules, it's a weird language and the browser is a very weird runtime environment. But I always seem to find something sexier and more speculative to work on. Programmers notoriously hate to clean up their messes. I'm no different. Then I had a <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=come-to-Jesus%20moment\">Come to Jesus</a> moment. I use Radio3 all day every day. I use it on my iPad and iPhone as well as my desktop. It does a lot of my Twitter posts, it's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=links\">Links tab</a> on scripting.com, and the links section of the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">nightly email</a>. It's an important piece of software. Staring me right in the face. Improving it could make everything better. And making it easier to work on the code means I could add improvements in the future. ",
