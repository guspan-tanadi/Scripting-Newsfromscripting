    "text": "Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1277329886080905219\">Gruber</a>, there's renewed interest in \"Little Outliner\". I'd love to have an excuse to work more on its evolution. I have a series of steps in mind, but not enough of a user base to do it with. Gruber would be an excellent user to help drive development. Note that I did a fair amount of <a href=\"http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1580502471000\">work</a> on it earlier this year, adding a <a href=\"http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1582640454000\">feature</a> that I use every day, to grab all my tweets from the previous day. It's turned Twitter into a blogging tool for me, believe it or not. Pretty cool. ",
