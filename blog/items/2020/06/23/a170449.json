It was a long enough drive that I had to stop to use the facilities. I dreaded going into the <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/livemap/directions/united-states/new-york/new-baltimore/rest-area-i-87-mile-127-new-baltimore-service-area?place=w.187564456.1875579027.457925&utm_expid=.K6QI8s_pTz6FfRdYRPpI3A.0\">rest stop</a>. Happy to report that everyone, without exception, was wearing a mask. I had another thought, watching a woman walk her dog in the special area set aside for that. I thought geez if the dog can pee outside.",
