    "text": "In programming there's a moment when the code you're working on first does what you're trying to make it do. It's only barely doing it. But it just went from doing nothing to doing The Thing. I call this the moment when <i>the first blade of grass pops through the surface of the earth. </i>Later there will be a nice lawn here. You hope it'll be thick and green. But for now it's just the one blade of grass. It's nice moment. The code is no longer just an idea, it's now a thing. ",
