    "text": "A friend asks what would be the point? A few answers. Sometimes there is no point, or sometimes the point is sadism or being a sociopath. I remember that kids like to kill ants in creative ways. Or as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0\">The Joker said</a> in The Dark Knight, sometimes people just \"do things.\" Working inside large organizations I was often impressed with how often they do things for personally selfish reasons. I remember reading about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto\">Warsaw Ghetto</a> during WW II. A quote stayed with me, from one of the Jews imprisoned there (paraphrasing). \"We make money for the Nazis, so why should they kill us?\" They figured as long as they were useful they'd be kept alive, as if there was reason to the way things are. Sometimes reason has nothing to do with it. ",
