I had less than no interest. I couldn't even leave it on while I nerded around on my iPad. It was stealing energy from me. I don't like what happened there, in Brooklyn, nor in the NBA at large. It isn't a league of teams, it's a league of superstars and a weird form of narcissism. I lost the tune of the NBA. Maybe I'll get it back. It does come and go. ",
