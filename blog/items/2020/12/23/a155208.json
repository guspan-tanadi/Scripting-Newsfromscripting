He was always looking stuff up in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please\">Information Please almanac</a>. The idea of having all the information in the world in his pocket is something he could have imagined, as a voracious science fiction reader, but I don't think he would have seen it as coming so soon. He was born in 1945, would have been 75 now if he lived, but he died in 2003 at the age of 57.",
