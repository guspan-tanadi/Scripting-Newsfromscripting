They had to do something like this to compete with Medium who <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/13-ways-of-looking-at-medium-the-new-bloggingsharingdiscovery-platform-from-ev-and-obvious/\">sells discovery</a> as their big thing. 2. It's <i>good</i> that they built on a standard, RSS, instead of creating a closed system. 3. You can <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/16/subscribeScreenshot.png\">subscribe</a> to my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rssNightly.xml\">nightly email feed</a> in Substack's reader. I checked, it works. :rocket:",
