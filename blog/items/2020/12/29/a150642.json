He has a simple and clear delivery style that reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=John+Dickerson&i=audible&ref=nb_sb_noss\">John Dickerson</a> who did the <a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/whistlestop\">Whistlestop podcast</a>, which I listened to regularly before Trump and the romance of past presidents was gone for me. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">Osnos bio</a> is short, and good reading as the Biden presidency is about to begin. ",
