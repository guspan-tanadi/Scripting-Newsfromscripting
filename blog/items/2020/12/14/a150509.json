    "text": "BTW, a disclaimer. Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton\">Nick Denton</a>, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story. And Apple, btw is the perfect example of a tech company that should <i>never</i> have a say in what stories get told. ",
