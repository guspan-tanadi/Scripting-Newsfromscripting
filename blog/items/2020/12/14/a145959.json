The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html\">biggest media buyouts</a> in history (at the time). I wanted to know when he/she was going to write about it. Never. That opened my eyes to something I should have been able to see much earlier. We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us. Yet they feel transparent to us, the mere conveyors of information, or so they would have you believe. We need <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory\">triangulation</a> here. A source of news that is <i>totally disconnected</i> from the media industry.",
