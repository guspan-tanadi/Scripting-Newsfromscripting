    "text": "I was having a talk with a friend about tech stuff and mentioned a few things worth looking at. 1. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html\">Fat Web Pages</a>, which were a way of distributing script bits via the web in the 90s. 2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle\">Postel's Robustness Principle</a>, a cornerstone of web interop. 3. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/simpleCrossNetworkScript.html\">Simple Cross-Network Scripting</a>, another development project in the 90s, that made it almost as easy to call a procedure over the net as it was to call one on your own machine. I really should write a book with some of these projects and the philosophy behind them. ",
