    "text": "I used to put Donald Trump's image in the right margin of this blog quite frequently, but I've stopped. He's a vampire we've managed to lock in a crypt, and I worry that just showing his image here might wake him up. He's now got the smell of loser on him, like an old version of Sarah Palin. She was pretty charismatic too, in her day. And about as talented as the lame duck. Better to let him fade away. Think of him as a dead relative. Maybe he was an asshole, it's hard to remember, it's been so long.",
