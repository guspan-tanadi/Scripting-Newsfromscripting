    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean_2004_presidential_campaign\">The Dean campaign</a> in 2002-04 was on the verge of turning a campaign into a social network. I was there. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html\">Here are my notes</a> from the last night of the campaign, the Iowa Caucus in 2004. I was at Dean HQ in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont\">Burlington</a>. I was blogging on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html\">Scripting News</a> and on the main Dean weblog. We also rolled out <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html\">Channel Dean</a> that day, basically a linkblog managed by campaign people, linking to articles and blog posts their community would find interesting. These were all precursors to the social nets of today.",
