    "text": "One of the nice things about using an [%search: outliner%] to edit my blog is that I can move things around quickly, but sometimes things get moved to the wrong place. That happened yesterday. I was writing about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv\">my new TV</a> and all of a sudden there's a paragraph about how screwed up journalism is. And then there was a post that I thought I had deleted and didn't. Oy! That was pretty disturbing. I left it there, but edited it a bit so it made more sense. Yesterday was a good day in general, but a <i>bad</i> day on the blog. Anyway, I've corrected it <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html\">on the web</a>. Ooops. I'll try to do better in the future. :smile: ",
