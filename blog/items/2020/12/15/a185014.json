The nice thing is how the mom and her three daughters have open affection for each other, it's their baseline. They get pissed off, mostly the kids with the mom, but they quickly get back to hugging and being motherly to each other, across generations. It's sweet. Nothing at all even remotely like the environment I grew up in btw, just sayin. Anyway, I'd kind of like to see Donald Trump as a guest on the show. They would listen to his sad stories, and try to help him. I think there could be some good jokes in there.  ",
