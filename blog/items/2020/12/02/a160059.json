    "text": "I rearranged my office a few weeks ago so now I have room for a second monitor on my desk, something I had gotten accustomed to when I lived in Manhattan. But when I set up the second monitor, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">BenQ</a>, it was depressingly ugly. The text was fuzzy, the color was impossible to get right. On Cyber Monday, on Amazon, I spotted a deal for an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0199W9UMS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">HP montitor</a>, the same size, 27 inch, for $170. It arrived yesterday and I set it up this morning, and what a difference! It's a pleasure to look over to the left and see the readout windows I leave over there. Night and day difference. ",
