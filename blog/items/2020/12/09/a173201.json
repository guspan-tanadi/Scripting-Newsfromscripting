Not quite a RT, that would have been amazing, but in Silicon Valley I bet it's a funding event. People used to say that about [%search: John Doerr%]. If you ran into him at <a href=\"https://www.robertsmarket.com/\">Robert's</a> or <a href=\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/blogs/p/2020/08/03/bucks-will-never-die-after-29-years-owner-passes-longtime-woodside-favorite-to-his-sons\">Buck's</a>, people would talk about it. It was a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1336423955826143235\">good tweet</a> for Jack to call attention to. ",
