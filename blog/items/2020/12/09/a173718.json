As I said then, it's a big chicken and egg thing. Once the pubs sign on, they will be gold, we need Scroll to succeed. Well they scored with a big publisher. Good for them, and maybe good for us (people who want to be able to read everything on the web, without subscribing to every publication with a paywall, which is obviously not possible). ",
