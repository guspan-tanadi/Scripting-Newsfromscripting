    "text": "I like watching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maddow\">Maddow</a>, but every once in a while, usually when she talks about Facebook, I am reminded that she can be as mean-spirited and dishonest as any Fox host, Hannity, Carlson or Ingraham. An example from last night. Trump recorded an unhinged video that they distributed via Facebook. Something anyone can do. You can, I can, anyone. This feature has been used in some amazing ways. A woman recorded her boyfriend being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile\">murdered by police</a> in Minneapolis using Facebook's live video. It was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/07/10/1368.html\">remarkable</a> and I think even a journalist Facebook-hater would have to admit, revolutionary. The whole point of <i>everything</i> on Facebook is that <i>anyone</i> can do it. What Maddow said: \"Facebook would run it.\" Technically true, but irresponsibly misleading. She repeated it as she often does, with pauses and a look that was withering in contempt for Facebook. Her implication was that Fox wouldn't run it, Newsmax wouldn't run it, but Facebook, super slime that they are, would. There's an honest way to explore this, the way she does with other things she isn't expert on, have a discussion one night the tradeoffs of allowing anyone to post live video. But -- I what I really resent is that Maddow, who I want to believe is doing the best she can, in this case is misusing that trust and it makes me doubt the stuff she reports where I don't know enough to see through the bullshit.
