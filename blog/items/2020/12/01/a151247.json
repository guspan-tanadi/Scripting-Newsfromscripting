    "text": "I want to delete all the episodes downloaded by Apple's Podcasts app. I've done it before so I know it's possible. Any clues much appreciated. [On Twitter, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obelixtwit/status/1333791755230035970\">best advice</a>, which I used, was to delete the app and re-install. It saves the subscriptions but throws out the data. I had 31GB of downloaded podcasts. I needed none of them. Podcasts aren't like music, if you don't listen to one after a week (say) the app should just delete it.]",
