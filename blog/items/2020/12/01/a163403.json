    "text": "OK, here's a free idea. I just read an audiobook written by a living author. I loved the book, and think he's a great writer. The author of the book could say what three books he recommends reading after his book and why they would be good choices. Having just read the book, I have an idea of what I'd like to learn about next. And the author's opinion would have a lot of value. I'd just spent a bit of time reading what they wrote. And of course the author could update the list, change which three books they recommend, and why.  ",
