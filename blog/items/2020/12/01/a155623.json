I've never used Asana -- I don't qualify, but apparently it's used for managing projects the way I described. I have used Trello. What I described apparently is \"Agile\" -- which, to me, means paying attention to how your product is used and making it better based on what you learn. Scrum is where you apply what you learned when being agile. I've always done this, made software for myself first, paid attention as it was used by myself and then others, and devised methods to get users to tell me more about their experience. Interestingly the BTQ itself is a form of agile, I'm trying to learn how to evolve <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/\">my outliner</a> to make it better for people doing this kind of work, and to make its advantage more obvious.",
