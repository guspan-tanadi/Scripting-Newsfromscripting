    "text": "Listening to <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-facebook-owns-future\">On The Media</a> about Google and Facebook. Such hype and propaganda. When you hear \"news\" talk about something you understand better than they do, you can hear how evil they are. And they are very evil at NPR. For example, they talk about how Facebook is used by white supremacists to organize so they can kill protestors. They interview the girlfriend of one of the dead protestors. What they leave out is that it's also used to plan charity events in my hometown, and every hometown in the world. It's like saying the telephone is used to plan terrorism. Yes, it is, but most people would know that's bullshit. Unfortunately they are so good at sliming Facebook in journalism, and it is still relatively new, that they mislead a lot of people who could benefit from using it. I know because I hear the bullshit coming back through them. They're scared of it, that's for sure. They should let some people use their air to explain how NPR exploits <i>their</i> users. Yeah I don't see that happening anytime soon. :rocket:",
