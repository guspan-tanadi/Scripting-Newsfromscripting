    "text": "Meanwhile <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">Google</a> <i>are</i> screwing us. If the people at NPR understand how, why aren't they reporting that. Both are choking the open protocols of the web, and keep competition from rising up to exploit their weakness. This is something that probably sounds \"technical\" to them. Most journalists are intimidated, for now at least, by the technology of the internet. To our detriment. Maybe over the years that will ease as the old folk move on and young people who grew up with the tech replace them. But I'm not really that hopeful about that. The young folk seem to have inherited the blindness and hypocrisy of previous generations of journalism.  ",
