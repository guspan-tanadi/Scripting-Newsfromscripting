    "text": "I turned on <a href=\"https://watch.nba.com/streaming-subscriptions?cid=nba:leaguepass:institutional:nbacom:domsites:nbatv:rd\">NBA TV</a> last night and watched a bit of the Knicks v 76ers. A message appeared after a while saying that the game was blacked out where I live. Presumably because they want me to pay for something that provides a way to watch the game on local TV. Except since i cut the cord with Spectrum earlier this year, and went with YouTube TV for local stations, I can't get <a href=\"https://www.msg.com/\">MSG</a> which broadcasts the Knicks locally. I can swith to <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/lp/preview/?page_slug=msg&title=Is%20this%20service%20worth%20$65%20a%20month%20just%20to%20watch%20the%20Knicks%20lose?\">Fubo</a>, which has MSG, but it's the same price as YouTube TV, and I have no idea what it is. So where I'm at now is paying $65 a month for YTTV and only watching MSNBC and CNN there. Seems pretty steep. Also if I get NBA League Pass, which I'm considering, I'm pretty sure they'd black out access for me for Knicks games too, even though I'd be paying $200 for the season. I remember when watching local sports was free, Not that long ago. What might be the smartest move, pay Spectrum, become a wire-splicer. What a mess.",
