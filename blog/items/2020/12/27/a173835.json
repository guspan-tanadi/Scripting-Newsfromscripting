    "text": "I saw Soul. I say meh. What a mess. I paid close attention because Pixar produces good movies. But this one was not good. I know lots of other people say they love it, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/movies/soul-review-pixar.html\">AO Scott</a> at the NYT. It got a <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/soul\">85 on Metacritic</a>, very high must-see.  One thing I did like is how they portrayed NYC. That was a technical achievement. Maybe they should do movies like that. Star a real-life place. Have normal people just doing stuff there. More mundane. Boy meets girl, perhaps. Pixar movies these days seem to have to bite off so much. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story\">Toy Story</a> was nice. I liked the story of the old man, a kid, a dog and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)\">balloon</a>, and the one about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E\">robot</a> who has to deal with post-apocalyptic Earth. Those are simpler themes. Trying to make a story about the before-life and after-life? Hmm. That requires a bit less Hallmark and more math, imho. ",
