    "text": "When you write an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline\">outline</a> on paper, if you feel the need to reorganize, you have to write the whole thing over. This makes the initial structure something you resist deciding on, so you never get started. Doing an <a href=\"http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/\">outline on a computer</a> is different.
