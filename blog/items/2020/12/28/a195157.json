    "text": "I've been hearing Serious Things about my writing here, and that's a bit intimidating. Now when I read over what I've published, I see all the mis-capitalized proper nouns, missing words, chopped out accidentally in rushed edits. Please note the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/evenWorse.png\">caveat</a> at the top of every page on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">this blog</a>: It's even worse than it appears. That means what it appears to mean. However it is lovely to hear from people who read this stuff. I esp like to hear what time you read it. In Europe they read it with their breakfast it seems and in California, before retiring for the night. I tend to read it in the middle of the night, around 2AM or so. Yes, weird as it seems, I do read my own blog. :rocket:",
