    "text": "What's the difference between a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/world/asia/china-Zhang-Zhan-covid-convicted.html\">citizen journalist</a> and a journalist? It's not a useful term. A distinction without a difference. Are journalists who work for AP or the Washington Post not citizens? I like to walk. That doesn't make me a citizen walker. Putting an adjective in front of it is a priesthood thing. Condescending. Do they think somehow it's acceptable for the Chinese government to jail a citizen journalist, but it would be a problem if they jailed a real journalist?",
