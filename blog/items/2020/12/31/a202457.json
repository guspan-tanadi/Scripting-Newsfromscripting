    "text": "As Trump's long fade-away proceeds, a sad thought, going back to 2018 and 2019 when it seemed we might get past Trump without an international catastrophe like 9/11, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the financial meltdown of 2008, the Iran Hostage Crisis, because of course he couldn't handle it. It seemed every presidency had one or two of these, but it was looking like we might not pay the big price for having a child-man with a bad temper in the White House. Well, it's almost hindsight now and worth observing that we did not get away with it. The pandemic is still building, could still explode, and Trump is still playing Pretend President. We're not out of the woods yet. ",
