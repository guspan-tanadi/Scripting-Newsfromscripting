    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/12/12/lifeIsCrazy.m4a\">Podcast</a>. Spoilers, so beware. Two of my favorite movies: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)\">Amadeus</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets\">As Good As It Gets</a>. Why? Because I identify with almost all the characters in some way. Such incredible story-telling. So much truth about our failure to understand our own struggles and beauty, try as hard as we can, and to accept the beauty in others. Also a short interruption as I got a spam call that I answered. I leave this kind of stuff in my podcasts. :rocket:",
