I'd register with (for example) Google, and ask it to notify me when the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adams+Fairacre+Farms/@41.9766612,-73.9882775,246m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x59f95f28dad1a9b2!8m2!3d41.9767848!4d-73.9881112\">parking lot</a> of my <a href=\"https://adamsfarms.com/\">favorite market</a> is mostly empty. I'd also like to know how long ago <a href=\"https://www.breadalone.com/about-us\">Bread Alone</a> delivered. I'd rather go when the store isn't packed full, and when my <a href=\"https://www.breadalone.com/peasant-bread\">favorite bread</a> is likely to be on the shelf. This would have saved me a trip earlier today, when literally every spot was taken. Not a good time to go shopping, esp during a pandemic. I did not even go in. ",
