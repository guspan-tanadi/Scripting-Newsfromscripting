    "text": "I read a lot of audiobooks. Sometimes the narrator is so excellent, it's worth calling out. I just got through <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/One-Flew-Over-the-Cuckoos-Nest-Audiobook/B008N1TVDU\">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>, narrated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly\">John C. Reilly</a>. The book is wonderful, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey\">Kesey</a> is a great writer, it's funny, warm, a great story beautifully told. Reilly does all the voices. Usually male narrators have trouble pulling off the female characters and vice versa. Somehow Reilly does it. Highly recommended. If you know of audiobooks that are great because of narration, let me know. I'm always looking for a good read. My next book is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">Biden biography</a> by Evan Osnos. Also the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Software-Rudy-Rucker-audiobook/dp/B00RBZFYF8/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">first book</a> by Rudy Rucker. ",
