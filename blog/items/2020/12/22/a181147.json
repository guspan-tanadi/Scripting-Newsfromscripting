    "text": "We should be supporting Americans during the pandemic. A country that won't come together in a crisis like this isn't imho a country. We support rich people who don't need help -- and let people wait out the pandemic with no money for food or rent and no hope of getting out of debt, people who may have been middle class before Covid, who are now broke. The importance of health care is something everyone can understand now, even young people. We are a stupid country. We waste so much, yet we don't take care of our basic needs. A small number live so extravagantly, when there is only so much a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html\">human</a> can use. This is about to come home in a huge way. This isn't working, hasn't for a long time, but it's getting worse, and about to get much worse. :boom:",
