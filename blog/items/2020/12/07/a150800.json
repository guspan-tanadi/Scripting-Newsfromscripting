Mostly people I’ve never heard of, so I don’t care if they got fat or are too skinny. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yudel/status/1335888263266115584\">Apparently</a> they don’t \"offer the micro targeting that sometimes brings interesting niche ads to Facebook.\" (Most of the ads on FB interest me, because they're watching me look at products on Amazon and elsewhere.)",
