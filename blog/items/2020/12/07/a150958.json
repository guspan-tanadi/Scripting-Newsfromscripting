She also deserves kudos for being an insightful media analyst, observing in an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/trumps-farcical-inept-and-deadly-serious-coup-attempt/617309/\">Atlantic piece</a>: \"Punditry can tend to focus too much on decorum and terminology, like the overachieving students so many of us once were.\" That explains concisely what is wrong with the way our pundits analyze cataclysm. The world is burning and they're debating whether it's the fire or the lack of oxygen that's destroying civilization. They're not getting to the central problem, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/163322.html?title=weHaveToWorkTogether\">which is this</a> -- the crazies have figured out how to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation\">dominate online media</a> and thus they swamp old school media by forcing them to cover the crazy stuff they carry. No matter where you turn, it's mostly this garbage. Conclusion: we need to reinvent media, soon, or we're going down the toilet. ",
