    "text": "The day after Election Day in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/11/\">2016</a>, I went for a walk around midtown Manhattan. It looked just like it did the day before. Nothing changed about the city. But I felt like people looked at each other differently. Did this person vote for Trump? Do they think I voted for Trump? I wanted to wear a button that said \"I voted for HRC.\" Or better, I'm on the other side. I came up with the [%search: MLK button%]. I bought a thousand of them, and gave them away. I still wear it some days when I'm out in public. It was a more general \"Black Lives Matter\". It said people are sacred and differences should be celebrated. And we're scared, so let's be there for each other. Today almost four years later, I suspect if you walk around Manhattan things are visibly different, and it's at least indirectly because Trump has been president for four years. Four more years? Hard to imagine how transformed this country will be then.",
