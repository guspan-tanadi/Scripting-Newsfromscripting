    "text": "Had a great chat on \"Clubhouse\" last night. One takeaway, I understand why there's no connection to the web at this time, I would probably do it that way too. Feel the pain of the missing feature, and then take a careful first step after gaining experience. I've learned over the years that you can't take features away from users, without a lot of pain. So you have to add features carefully. That said, I'd love to post a followup to that chat, in writing, but there's no way to do it. Creating a connection between my Clubhouse world and my blog world would be interesting. For that they'll need an API. :rocket:",
