    "text": "This election should be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)\">blowout</a>. Americans are dying, the economy is a wreck, the country is careening and this time the casualties are at home. In a sane society, Trump would be in jail, Pence would be president and Biden would be preparing to take office in January.  There should be a permanent people's campaign, all day every day, every year, whether or not there's an election. Clearly waiting for the politicians and journalists to do this isn't working. And the current tech networks are mired, trying to serve everyone. Politics has moved online. So far it's been chaotic. But we could envision something that's orderly and productive and still preserve the energy. The idealistic vision of the early web wasn't entirely wrong, imho. :-)",
