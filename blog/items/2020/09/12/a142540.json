    "text": "In JavaScript you can initialize an array with [] or <i>new Array ().</i> I generally use the latter, because it's easier on my old eyes. It's hard to see the difference between {} and [], however it's very easy to see the difference between new Object () and new Array (). I consider ease for the programmer to be very very very important. I hardly ever use the word <i>very, </i>btw. :-)",
