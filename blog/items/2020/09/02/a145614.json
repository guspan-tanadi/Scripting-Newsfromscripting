And when it is proven again (as it has been many times) we forget that and keep snapping back to believing it hasn't yet been proven. If you watch the news with a scientist's notebook, you'd see that happens often, sometimes within one installment of The Situation Room or even the esteemed Rachel Maddow. ",

That's what the great United States is to the humiliatingly small Russa. The only advantage they have is the will to use our open system to control us. We might have done that to them first, they were weak enough, when George W Bush was president, even at the beginning of the Obama Administration, but we had the hubris to believe we had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/opinion/cold-war-american-soviet-victory.html\">won</a> the Cold War.
