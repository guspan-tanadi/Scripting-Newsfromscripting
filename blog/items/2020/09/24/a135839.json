    "text": "About the Back button in Facebook. When you hit the Back button you're taken to a random place. You have to remember to look for a link to the previous comment, or the post, and usually you forget. No other website works like this. And once you erroneously hit the Back button the Forward button doesn't work either. The place you were at is lost. This is pretty bad for software that's ten years old, and the bug persists even in the new version of the software, suggesting it's a deep flaw in the design, or worse, it's deliberate.",
