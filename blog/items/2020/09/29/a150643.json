    "text": "Today's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/podcasts/the-daily/donald-trump-taxes-investigation.html\">Daily podcast</a> about the Trump tax returns had a fair amount of info, but overall was disappointing. Barbaro never came to grips with a key idea: Trump is not a rich guy evading taxes. He's broke. He's a loser. That's his usual state, even though he's had two huge windfalls of cash, first from his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump\">father</a> and then from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)\">The Apprentice</a>. Each time he's invested in marginal businesses and his management turned them into failures. Then he borrowed, failed to pay back his debt, went bankrupt. He's about to go bankrupt again with the $400 million that comes due in the term he's running for now. But we don't know who he owes the money to, but we can take a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_mafia\">good guess</a>. The big takeaway from the tax returns is <i>Trump is a loser. </i>It's a shame they don't have a whole podcast series about what's in the returns. We've spent so much time speculating about the truth of Trump, now we have a huge load of data. Podcasts are the best medium for revealing it. Sadly only the NYT has this story, so it's not getting a deep dive. ",
