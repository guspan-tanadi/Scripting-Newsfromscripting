    "text": "It's true that in 2016 Trump said he wouldn't honor the vote if he lost, but there is a big difference between then and now. Now he's the president, and he lives in the White House and is commander in chief of the armed forces. There's a lot of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Time Trump can really fuck things up for us, beyond how fucked up they already are. Everyone thinks Trump is going to lose but refuse to leave. I think he has another plan. When I was playing a board game with my little brother when we were kids, if he didn't like how it was going, well you know what little brothers do. That's Trump. A snotty ass little brother if there ever was one. :smile:",
