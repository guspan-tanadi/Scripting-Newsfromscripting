He's been working on a new version of \"rssCloud\" for Node to go with the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc\">XML-RPC for JavaScript</a> package I wrote. We talked about lots of stuff, esp philosophy of maintaining networks of software. We both agree <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation\">deprecation</a> is a bad idea. I didnâ€™t know that there have been <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=2020+riots+in+Madison%2C+WI\">riots</a> in Madison. We talked about Kenosha in that context. We need better news folks, too much repetition and they're leaving out important information. Riots in Madison? That is for sure news for this lifetime <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Badger\">Badger</a>. ",
