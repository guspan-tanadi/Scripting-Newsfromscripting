    "text": "I use Frontier to manage my source code, which no longer runs on the newest version of the Mac OS. I desperately want it to run on Linux so I can get out of this situation. In the meantime, I bought a new iPhone, and just updated it and got <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/18/softwareUpdateDialog.png\">this awful dialog</a> when I plugged it into my Mac. I clicked on Learn More hoping to find out which version of the OS it wants to install, but it <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208831\">doesn't say</a>. I am running High Sierra, 10.13.8. I'm not going to update the Mac. I guess that means I'll be relying on the new Pixel 4a more and more, because I can't give up my ability to run Frontier on my desktop. Not a good situation, but as they say it is what it is. ",
