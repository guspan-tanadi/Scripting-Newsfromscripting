The snotty look on his face when he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/politics/donald-trump-wildfires-briefing-climate-change/index.html\">said</a> science is bullshit. You can tell he's never had to deal with a health emergency, or he wasn't paying attention when it happened. If he doesn't die of an instant heart attack or stroke, he's going to learn to respect science, at some point. ",
