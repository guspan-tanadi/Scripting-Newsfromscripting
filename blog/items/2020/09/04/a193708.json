Guest is Republican strategist and <a href=\"https://lincolnproject.us/\">Lincoln Project</a> founder <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Stevens\">Stuart Stevens</a>. Great to hear the A-B comparison now they're both on the same side, with Biden. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi\">Trippi</a> is a fantastic interviewer, I always wonder why he doesn't run for office himself. :rocket:",
