    "text": "Someone on the NYT op-ed page has to call <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs\">Woodward</a> out. But journalism always covers up the sins of journalism. Please let me know if you see journalism <i>not</i> doing this, I'll give them an award. It never happens. If only Rachel, Chris, Al, Joy, Wolf, Erin, Jake, Brian or Anderson looked at the Woodward case, and broadcast a message loud and clear, <b>if any other reporter does this, we're going to crucify them.</b> They do it regularly for Facebook. Someone has to do it for them. We pay too high a price for their inability to admit the most costly errors. They've all set a terrible precedent by remaining silent. ",
