Since people in news orgs must read other pubs, they must know it too. We need a meter on our browsers, a set of prefs we easily control, a max budget, a special offer to subscribe when it makes economic sense. Create an <i>easy path to subscribing, </i>not the brutal wall that interrupts you at exactly the wrong moment. We can <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled\">bootstrap</a> a rational system for news that grows. The web should be a fantastic way to get news, not the repetive junky stuff we get now, but news with real nutrient value. We're stuck and don't need to be. ",
