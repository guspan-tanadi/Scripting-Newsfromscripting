    "text": "Today would have been my uncle, [%search: Ken Kiesler%]'s, 75th birthday. He didn't even make it <a href=\"http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler\">to 60</a>. I'm sure he's happy on his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie\">hippie</a> beach in the sky. See you soon <a href=\"http://greatvavavoom.com/\">Uncle Vava</a>. BTW, people may not know that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/04/28/212326.html?title=uncleKenAndAuntDorothy\">Ken</a> was an early blogger. He, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor\">Dan Gillmor</a>, were the first two users of \"Manila\", outside of UserLand. In 1998 or 1999. He was my mother's brother, and nephew of German novelist, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt\">Arno Schmidt</a>. He was the first member of my family born in the US. I was the second. He was only 10 years older than me, and was as much a brother as an uncle. It seems so weird that he could ever be as old as 75, but it's even more weird that he's been gone so long already. He died in Jamaica, in 2003, a few weeks before the first BloggerCon. ",
