I followed their directions, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bullmancuso/status/1316064421844865024\">published a thread</a>, based on a post <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/10/12.html#a144048\">here</a>. The post also <a href=\"https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2020/10/13/where-is-your-soul/\">exists</a> on WordPress.com, so it elminates the need for a separate app that turns a thread into a post. Makes me wonder if Substack and Medium are going to add this feature. Also does WordPress support email bulletins?",
