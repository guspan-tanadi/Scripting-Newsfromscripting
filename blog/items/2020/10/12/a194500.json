I wasn't finding conversations that interested me, and when I started them myself, usually <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/09/02/173236.html?title=clubhouseAfterAMonth#a174138\">nothing</a> happened. Then came the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation\">anti</a>-<a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/clubhouse-app-anti-semitism\">Semitism</a> <a href=\"https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/09/30/elite-tech-app-clubhouse-under-fire-for-hosting-antisemitic-discussion-on-black-jewish-relations/\">meltdown</a>.  It was depressing to find out that fighting for equality, to the extent that it works, would not end the hatred for my people. After that I looked at every conversation there differently. Never spoke again. I still have the app, am still a member, so this all could change, but I thought it was good to update. ",
