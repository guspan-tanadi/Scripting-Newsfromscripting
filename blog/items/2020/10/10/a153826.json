In a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingDesktop.png\">desktop browser</a> it's in the right margin. It was tricky on a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingOnPhone.png\">phone</a>, so I just had the ad overlay the page, at .5 opacity. You can still read the text underneath it, but it's better if you scroll it out of the way. A blog version of a lawn sign. :boom:",
