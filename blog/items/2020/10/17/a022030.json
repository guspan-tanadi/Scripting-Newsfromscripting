I’ve seen it before and read the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818\">book</a>, but it’s good to get a refresher. Everything, not just baseball, needs a fresh look, because we’ve been doing so much the same way we always have, without thought, not questioning out-of-date assumptions.",
