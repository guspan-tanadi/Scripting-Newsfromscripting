    "text": "Yesterday I put out a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/10/29.html#a210605\">call</a> for programs to binge. I got an overwhelming response. But nothing obvious emerged. Some were programs I had already tried, but didn't get far enough into to rate in my BingeWorthy <a href=\"http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/\">profile</a>. Others were comedies, and I'm just not into them now. Examples of shows I didn't have the energy to watch recently: <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fschitts-creek\">Schitt's Creek</a> and <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-good-place\">The Good Place</a>, both of which are very good for what they are, but I'm just not in the mood now. I'm thinking I may just re-watch something from the past that I liked and think might be worth a second look. In the meantime, the lists, one on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1321921170938204167\">Twitter</a> and one on <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/192\">GitHub</a> are there for everyone to reference. I also want to add a recommendation algorithm to <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/\">BingeWorthy</a>, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet. ",
