    "text": "Thanks to <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/10/13/a-new-way-to-publish-your-blog-posts-simultaneously-as-twitter-threads/amp/\">WordPress</a> for shipping their twitter-threader tool. It gives me something to compare my software to. I wrote [%search: Little Pork Chop%] back in 2014. It was the one of the first Node-based web apps I shipped. A little thing I whipped up in a few days and finished while I was traveling in Europe. It was a lot of fun. After a while spammers found out about it, and used it to spray messages through accounts with no real followers, to influence some algorithm, presumably. Kind of humiliating. Now I'm ready to make it useful for people and not useful for spamming. I think. Also considering making it a personal tool for people to deploy on Glitch. I'm looking for something to put into that pot. :boom:",
