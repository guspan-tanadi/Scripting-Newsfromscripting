    "text": "Also, I tried listening to <a href=\"https://alfranken.com/listen\">Al Franken's podcast</a>. He has a long ad at the beginning, and I don't do that. He should find a different revenue model. He's got a long road ahead to come back. The podcast should be instrumental in that, but the advertising disgusted me, and I won't listen to it. Too many people with something to say do this. Shame. Podcasting wires you directly into people's brains when they have the attention to really listen. Don't waste that selling some cheesy house ornament or utility. ",
