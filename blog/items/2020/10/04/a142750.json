    "text": "I saw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken\">Al Franken</a> on MSNBC yesterday. He talked for several minutes uninterrupted. Riveting. No doubt he's the best communicator the Dems have. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez\">AOC</a> is great too, as is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi\">Joe Trippi</a> (he should run for something). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a> excels, esp the last few weeks. But Franken is tops.",
