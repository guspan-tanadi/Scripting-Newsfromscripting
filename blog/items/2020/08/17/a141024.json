It is one of a small number of shows in the running for Best Series Ever. The others: <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-wire\">The Wire</a> (of course) and a show that a lot of people gave up on too soon: <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fmr-robot\">Mr Robot</a>. Its final season was beautiful heart-filling drama. As much a vision as a story. ",
