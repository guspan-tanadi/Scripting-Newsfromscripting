    "text": "I’m watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schitt%27s_Creek\">Schitt’s Creek</a>. It’s really funny. I was expecting it to be cringe-inducing, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm\">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, but it's not. Starring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O%27Hara\">Catherine O'Hara</a> who was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice\">Beetlejuice</a>, one of the best movies ever made. And the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Elliott\">geeky guy</a> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)\">Groundhog Day</a>, the other best movie ever made. Schitt's Creek, like its name, is both profane and wholesome.",
