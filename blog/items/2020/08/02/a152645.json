    "text": "I also listened to a bit of <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/fight-over-cop-misconduct-records-continues\">On The Media</a> this morning. They said something that really irked me: The police is the only public institution that isn't properly overseen (I'm paraphrasing). But journalism is even less overseen. I think the op-ed page in the major papers should be run by non-journalists and should be all about the failings of journalism. They say it so many times in so many ways. Democracy dies in darkness. Journalism has always been dark. Never examined. Considered to be above reproach by mortals. And that's garbage. It's just resulted in an arrogance that's had enormous consequences. ",
