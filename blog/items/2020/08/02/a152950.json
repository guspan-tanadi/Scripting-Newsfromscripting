    "text": "Ken Smith has been indulging me, <a href=\"http://instantoutliner.com/ki\">commenting</a> on stuff, blog-style, using \"LO2\", even though LO2 is not (at this time) a proper blogging tool. Yesterday he commented on my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/08/01.html#a143905\">process</a> for archiving content on Scripting News. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/02/kenSmithPost.png\">screen shot</a> of Ken's post. I don't yet have a proper way to point to it. I know a lot about this. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/10/futuresafeArchives.html\">Future-safe archives</a>. An organization has to have a strong <i>and lasting</i> commitment to creating a record, because there are so many ways to lose it. My <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog\">backup to GitHub</a> is actually an offline archive. In case GitHub survives and the web does not. I try to keep the URLs working on scripting.com, if not other domains I've created. My focus is on scripting.com. Even so, I've broken a fair number of links over the years. a big source was in the switch to S3. A very rational thing to do, no regrets, but their server is case-sensitive, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSTAR\">server</a> I had been using previously was not. It's too bad something like that was not mentioned in the founding documents of the web. I try to fix broken links when I find them. But keeping even one site unbroken is an impossible job. You do the best you can.",
