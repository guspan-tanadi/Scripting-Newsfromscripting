This was the convention for all Americans who want to fight the virus and keep the Constitution. We know for a fact that progressives want this. We have to appeal to people who may be on the fence. <i>The DNC was a commercial. </i>Marketing. It wasn't there to make you feel heard. Personally I think to fight the virus we'll need to have single payer soon after Biden takes office. There may never be a moment where you hear from everyone that you were right. You'll have to find the glory within yourself. ",
