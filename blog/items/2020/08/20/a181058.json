Look at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4\">eulogy</a> Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Maybe they'll create such an event tonight for the presidential nominee. I went to Obama's acceptance speech in Denver in 2008 in a football stadium. Quite an event. ",
