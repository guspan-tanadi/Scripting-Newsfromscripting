    "text": "BTW, then as now the government lied about the disease. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson\">Woodrow Wilson</a> who has since had his reputation somewhat cleaned up, was apparently not a very great president. Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted <a href=\"https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video\">scientist</a>, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu. He theorizes that the terrible deal that Germany got was due to Wilson's flu, and if he had not gotten ill, maybe Germany wouldn't have gone fascist? The same story <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/woodrow-wilsons-case-of-the-flu-and-how-pandemics-change-history\">appeared</a> in the New Yorker earlier this year. He also says the flu resulted in Wilson's stroke and disability. Perhaps a cautionary fact for our current president. Also interesting that there is no mention of \"influenza\" on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson\">Wikipedia page</a> for Wilson! Amazing. I wonder how Trump's epitaph will read? I expect Covid-19 will be prominent. ",
