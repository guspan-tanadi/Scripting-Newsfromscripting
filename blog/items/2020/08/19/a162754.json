    "text": "Today's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/podcasts/the-daily/dejoy-postal-service-trump.html\">Daily podcast</a> is about Trump and the USPS. They present something as theory that I'm pretty sure is fact, that Trump is trying to and quite possibly succeeding at making the postal service incapable of doing its part in the November 3 election. Also, they got an important fact wrong, if this <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/trump-mailboxes-sorters-usps-2020-election-louis-dejoy-20200816.html\">Philadelphia Inquirer story</a> is to be believed. The author of the NYT story, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater\">Luke Broadwater</a>, said that disabling by-mail voting would not hurt Democrats more than Republicans. On the other hand, according to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png\">Inquirer story</a>, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. <b>Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. </b>So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction. ",
