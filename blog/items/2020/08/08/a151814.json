    "text": "Briefly discussed WordPress on Twitter last night with Don Park, long-time friend, ex-Automattician. I said I don't think they understand blogging there. Don says \"members of WordPress community and employees of the company behind it use blogs all the time.\" I don't doubt it, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1291868787218710528\">yet I could never do</a> what I do with Wordpress. Far too clumsy. Not fluid. Not designed for writers. Really weak product. ",
