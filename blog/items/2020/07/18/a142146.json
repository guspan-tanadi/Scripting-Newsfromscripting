There's an even bigger risk. Twitter itself could be bought for 1/2 of $28 billion, the company's valuation according to the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/\">stock</a> price. That's a fraction of the net worth of a number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2020\">billionaires</a>. And you could probably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout\">finance</a> the acquisition, so you would need much less than $14 billion to pull it off. Basically Twitter itself, legally, is very insecure. We're depending on something a bad actor could take over, legally. I've been writing about this for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html\">years</a>. I hope other people tune into it before it actually happens.
