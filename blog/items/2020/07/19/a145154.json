    "text": "I went back to <a href=\"https://www.wisc.edu/\">UW-Madison</a> for a visit a few years ago and got a tour of a <a href=\"https://discovery.wisc.edu/\">new building</a> created to generate <a href=\"https://news.wisc.edu/tag/patents/\">patents</a>. But it didn't appear it was used for much. Extravagant and luxurious. Very unlike a typical utilitarian campus building at a large state school. I learned they built it to recruit a professor who generated billions from patents, and I guess they felt was likely to continue to do so. The money apparently flows to the university, but the professor gets to work in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal\">Taj Mahal</a> of campus buildings. Not sure. But it was <i>very</i> impressive, and surprising. ",
