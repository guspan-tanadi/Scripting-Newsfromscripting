    "text": "Earlier, Jillian York on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilliancyork/status/1286554054731141120\">said</a> she is tired of having her ideas stolen. Rebecca MacKinnon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmack/status/1286593320924348419\">says</a> that's the way it is. I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1286607323687981058\">agreed</a>, having had many ideas used, which is okay but sometimes against itself. Example: the <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+unconference&t=hk&ia=web\">unconference</a>. Our conception of it, the original, was usurped by a format that we were opposing. This shit happens. I hit a particularly ugly form of this later, when I was trying to find a reference to <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Bring+The+War+Home%22&t=hk&ia=shopping\">Bring The War Home</a>, as a Vietnam War protest slogan. It's been usurped by the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bring-War-Home-Movement-Paramilitary/dp/0674286073\">White Power</a> movement. Oy. See how ideas flip. Some ideas stick, others get absorbed, and others are perverted. ",
