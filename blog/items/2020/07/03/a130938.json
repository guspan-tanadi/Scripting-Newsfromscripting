    "text": "Another peeve. I was watching a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle\">Dave Chappelle</a> show on Netflix. He is really funny. Great comic. But he uses the N-word a lot. And get this -- he uses it to talk about white people. Like this: You my &lt;N-word>. I've been told, not by Chappelle, that it's a term of endearment. To me, that's ridiculous -- it's a threat. Because if I use that term of endearment, a 10-ton weight comes down on my head. I don't like it. We're also told this is a word African-Americans use among themselves, and we wouldn't understand what it means. But many of the people in Chappelle's audience are white. We're his N-words. I'm watching it, and reminded every time I hear the world, and he says it a lot, that this is something I'm not allowed to like. The more I listen to him use the N-word, my inner voice, constantly yapping about nothing, repeats what he says, and I'm concerned that will eventually come out of my mouth, without thought because that actually happens in real life. It's a painful word, not just for African-Americans. I saw <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb\">Jelani Cobb</a> write <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jelani9/status/1278607474921267200\">on Twitter</a> the other day about the possible capitalization of the word <i>black</i> when used to talk about people of African descent. \"Does anyone feel strongly about upper-casing the B in black? Iâ€™m generally opposed to this because it turns race, a nonexistent category, into a proper noun.\" Maybe we should use words everyone can say, and try to stick to words that have meaning, and preferrably <i>one</i> obvious meaning, so we all can understand wtf you're talking about. :smile:",
