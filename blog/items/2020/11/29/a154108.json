    "text": "<a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/top/\">A new BingeWorthy page</a> shows the 100 top-rated programs. No log-in. Has its own metadata, so when you see it on Twitter or Facebook, it announces itself in a reasonable way. This came up yesterday when a friend asked what they should binge next. I had my <a href=\"http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/\">own</a> recommendations ready to go, but I didn't have one for the whole community. You can help build BingeWorthy by helping spread the word about <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/top/\">this page</a>. Thanks! :-)",
