    "text": "OK we just had an election in the US, and we're doing the same thing we do after every election. Trying to figure out how 70 million people could (this time) vote for Trump after seeing him in action for four years. I had a lot of trouble understanding why people gave <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election\">Bush</a> a second term, that was a stop-everything moment for me. I did a <a href=\"http://static.podcatch.com/manila/gems/un/cnNov3.mp3\">podcast</a> about it <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/11/03.html\">that day</a>, to preserve the moment. But this time I think maybe we're asking the wrong question. Why are so many people depressed? I think you have to be pretty sad to vote for Trump. I think that's what it's an expression of, sadness. What could we do to make living more fun? I know it's a weird question, but maybe someone has an idea. :boom:",
