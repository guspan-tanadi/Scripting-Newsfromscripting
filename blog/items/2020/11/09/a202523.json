    "text": "I've been raving about the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Micro-Bluetooth-Speaker-Waterproof/dp/B07VSPPQXC\">Tribit Stormbox</a> Bluetooth speaker to friends. The sound is great and large, but the package is small, sturdy, nice to hold the way an iPhone is. I have it strapped to the handlebar of my bike which I've been riding the last four days because the weather is so good. One more day, tomorrow, then it's going to cool off again. Definitely not November weather in the mountains. ",
