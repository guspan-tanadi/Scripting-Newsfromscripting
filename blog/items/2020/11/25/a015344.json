This doesn't sound very Hallmark, but I don't care. When I'm actually dead you can forget about me. I'm a software developer. I make software that people use to work better together. That's what I care about. It drives me crazy to be told people think of me in the past tense. I'm very much in the present. Thanks for listening. :rocket:",
