Still, it had HBO production values, acting, that part they do so well. I don't know what it is but HBO has a look and feel and the artists know how to be part of it. The story was utterly unbelievably lame. They copied an interesting Law & Order plot, it actually <i>was</i> the plot of an episode of L&O, and stretched it out to six fucking hours. There was one interesting plot twist, no spoilers. Also if they had cut the last episode off before it got ridiculous, I might have had a kind word for it. I've rated it a :fire: over on BingeWorthy. Only the second such show. Somehow they got me to watch to the end. I guess it was kind of relaxing. ",
