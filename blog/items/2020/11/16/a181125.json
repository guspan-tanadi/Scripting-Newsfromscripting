    "text": "Another question. Why don't the Democrats make an issue out of everyone voting. We learned in the aftermath of the Nov 3 election that the Republican Secretaries of State are honorable people. If the Dems put that idea out there -- that the Repubs are abusing the rest of us by trying to stop us from voiting, well it's an American value that everyone gets to vote, it doesn't matter what race they are or how much money they have (an appeal to white voters, btw). Everyone has a say. That's American as apple pie. Why don't the Repubs get on board with that?  A nice way to push a wedge into the Repub voting block. <i>If poor whites start voting against Repubs, you better believe they're going to disenfranchise your ass. </i>",
