    "text": "In a way it's a shame the vaccines are coming, because if they weren't, we would have to learn to trust and work together, all of us, without exception. The virus would be like AIDS, which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_HIV/AIDS\">transformed sexuality</a> in the 80s and 90s. There wasn't much of a \"safe sex\" concept before AIDS. Back then, if we were as crazy as we are now, people would say \"it's my right not to wear a condom. You're infringing on my civil liberties!\" A condom to protect against STDs is fairly analogous to wearing a mask to protect against Covid. There is no vaccine for AIDS, roughly 40 years later. So we had to transform and learn new societal norms. We apparently will not have to do that for Covid-19. Shame. Because we really do need to learn how to work each other, for many other reasons. This is not the last crisis we're going to be facing collectively, and a new understanding of what our rights are is called for. ",
