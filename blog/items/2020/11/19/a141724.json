    "text": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi\">Joe Trippi</a> taught me something about politics. I said we, the people of the US, should buy ads in Georgia, asking the voters there to save our lives and vote for the Democratic candidates on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_special_election_in_Georgia\">Jan 5</a>. I was <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/11/12.html#a215410\">very passionate</a> about it, but was only looking at it from my perspective. Here's what Trippi said: \"The South generally doesn't take well to people from 'outside' trying to influence them.\" That was generous, because <i>no one</i> takes well to that. It may be why <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/us/maine-susan-collins.html\">Susan Collins</a> was re-elected in Maine even though Democrats from the rest of the country poured huge money into defeating her. It's also why <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/26/jim-clyburn-endorses-joe-biden-117667\">James Clyburn</a> single-handedly got the nomination for President-elect Biden -- people in South Carolina listen to and trust him. It's also why <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-remarkable-effectiveness-of-pete-buttigieg-on-fox-news\">Pete Buttigieg</a> is a huge hit on Fox. They like a nice young <i>white</i> man even if what he says would be seen as socialism if it came from an outsider (ie person of color). You can't blame people for bonding with people who look like they do. It's part of who we are, not just Americans, not just whites, but everyone. It's also true that, as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/13/elissa-slotkin-braces-for-a-democratic-civil-war-436301\">Elissa Slotkin</a> pointed out, you can't win when you appear to be talking down to people, and an outsider automatically appears that way.
