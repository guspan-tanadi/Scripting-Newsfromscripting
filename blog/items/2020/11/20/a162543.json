    "text": "<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdwardNorton/status/1329728889296355328\">Edward Norton</a> on Twitter on what Trump is really doing. I agree, and very well put. Short version. Trump is repeatedly stinking up the room, hoping to negotiate a deal where he is able to walk away, rich and with his head held high (in his own <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini\">Trumpolini</a> style), to live to fight another day. Norton says to call his bluff. Let him do his schtick and then say, no deal. BTW, every business and industry has one person who behaves so badly that they invariably get their way, because eventually no one wants to go as low as they are willing to go. I'm not going to name names, except Trump is the best at \"stinking up the room.\" He keeps doing it until you give up. McConnell is pretty good too. Stinking up the room is a super advanced form of trolling. ",
