    "text": "I'm in the middle of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing_(miniseries)\">The Undoing</a>, an HBO miniseries. It's not terrible. After the second episode I wondered if it was worth it, so I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1332490159955308555\">asked on Twitter</a> and was told other people felt the same. But there's a quality to HBO dramas that you don't see elsewhere. The stars, acting, music, everything is first-rate, even the writing, even if the plot is just so-so. The series finale is tomorrow night. I expect there will be a surprise in the end, if not, the time won't have been totally wasted. Nicole Kidman is fun to watch, and Donald Sutherland, who plays her father, is still Donald Sutherland. I have a theory about who really dunnit, but no spoilers. :rocket:",
