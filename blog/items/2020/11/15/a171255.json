    "text": "Has any news org written a story about what would happen if January 20 comes and Trump refuses to leave the White House. Not speculation, ie not whether it will or will not happen, but attempt to gather facts about it. Request an interview with the head of the Secret Service, for example. Seems to me this at least rises to the level of the famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUKW0fL-OqY\">\"I'm in control here\"</a> press conference with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Haig\">Alexander Haig</a> in the Reagan administration. There was a West Wing <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745639/\">episode</a> about this, btw, when the president is shot. Danny wants to know who was in charge then. CJ can't figure it out. Anyway what happens on January 21 when parts of the government are still responding to orders from Trump. Get ready because that's a possibility. That should be on the op-ed pages of every news org, now.",
