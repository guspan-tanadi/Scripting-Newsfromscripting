    "text": "A friend told me the other day that <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/\">outliners</a> are not good for planning software development work because they are \"linear.\" I have no idea what that means. For me, the function of an outliner is to let me record ideas and events to flow to different places over time. Flow is the big word. It's the <i>fluidity</i> of the outliner that makes the difference. I think of it as <a href=\"http://textonrails.com/\">text on rails</a>. Paper and whiteboards are not so flexible because of limited space. Outlines have unlimited space. I can always add a note and the software automatically makes room. And I can move something without erasing it (a weakness of paper). Fluidity. Are outlines linear? Not in any obvious way, to me at least. A linear tool would force everything to be on one line, at one level. The point of an outline is that you can go infinitely deep. The work has <i>structure.</i> A line is unstructured. ",
