    "text": "I listened to yesterday's <a href=\"http://this.how/cuomo/\">Cuomo briefing</a>. Highly recommend it. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/cuomo/rss.xml\">RSS feed</a>. A story he tells: On TV companies are advertising Thanksgiving the normal way with people getting together for parties and big dinners. Lots of hugs. No masks or social distancing. This sends a message that we're back to normal. I know it's illogical, but with no one contradicting the message in as powerful a way (one or two news interviews with Dr Fauci isn't that powerful) people are relieved. But the density of virus now is very high. You might've gotten away with traveling in the summer when the virus was scarce, but now, it's everywhere, and the result is likely to be dramatic, awful, and the growth of the virus will make even more people get infected in December and January.",
