They overlook the flaws that make the machine unusable. And all the gushing over what? A new CPU? Please. I can't tell what CPU any machine is running, and neither can you, unless you open the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/24/macAboutSystem.png\">system About box</a>. My main concern about the new Macs with the new CPU is if VMWare runs on them, and if I can run \"Frontier\" in there. Otherwise forget it. I'll stick with my Intel iMac Pro I bought in 2017.",
