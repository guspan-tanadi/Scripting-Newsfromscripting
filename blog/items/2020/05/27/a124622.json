    "text": "Old TV shows had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track\">laugh track</a> that simulated audience applause and laughter. This was before they started recorded sitcoms in front of a live audience. As a little kid, I thought they must have little microphones in the TVs, maybe only some of them (not mine of course) and they could pick up the sounds made by people at home. The laugh track and other audience sounds were real, little Dave imagined. So you gotta wonder why they don't do actually that for <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/05/27/sports-poll-fans-prefer-natural-sound-in-telecasts/\">live sports events</a> in the upcoming seasons for basketball, baseball, hockey, football, etc -- when there won't be any fans in the stadiums and arenas. You could even pipe the audience sounds into the venue so the players can experience them. The technology is totally up to it. Why not have some fun with it?",
