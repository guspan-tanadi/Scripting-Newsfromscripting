I couldn’t possibly pay for most of them, too many subs to manage, and I don’t read enough of any individual pub to justify subscribing. I do subscribe to NYT and Washington Post. But I don’t get enough value from either, honestly. This continues to be a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews\">lousy situation</a>. The pubs only talk about how news is broken from their point of view, but the readers point of view matters as much, if not more.",
