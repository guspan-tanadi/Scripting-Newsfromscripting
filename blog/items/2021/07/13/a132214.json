    "text": "Something very scary just happened. There's a bug in \"Drummer\" that it sometimes updates the wrong outline when an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines\">I/O</a> update comes in. This can result in <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=sarcasm\">hilarity</a> when somehow the updates overwrite the file for \"Scripting News\", and it seems there is no backup. It's a bug. And bugs hurt! I looked everywhere and kicked myself virtually for not maintaining a backup of this vital file. Every time I publish there should be a copy preserved. Well, it turns out that <i>was</i> happening. I post the outline to the instantOutlines <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/outlines/scripting.opml\">repo</a>, and thanks to the power and elegance of GitHub, there's a snapshot of <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main/outlines/scripting.opml\">every update</a>, going back to when I <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main?after=8131158da2d286bb63af971a89c286e1e6f6c217+349&branch=main&path%5B%5D=outlines&path%5B%5D=scripting.opml\">started</a> doing <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/845ff95bfb4be0f23decf8293c87bd1265f2e6a3#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc\">this</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/3786362d531109220bafe8f62b9689692f03f92b#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc\">June 17</a>. Catastrophe averted. Whew. And wow GitHub is starting to turn into a very nice network file system. ",
