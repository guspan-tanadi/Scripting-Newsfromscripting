    "text": "We're finding that the \"logseq\" people and I have the same values re software and users. In yesterday's Twitter thread, they asked what would be the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1414588756389023744\">perfect storage system</a>. I said: \"my answer, for now, is <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver\">daveappserver</a>. But it isn't perfect, it's what we can do now that meets the criteria for now and the near future (the vision, the direction I want to go in). I think we share that. We want users to be as independent as possible, and to empower all levels of technical interest. I don't want the responsibility of keeping the world's ideas online. I want that distributed with rock-solid interop.\" I think that's about as concise a definition of why I do things the way I do them. As I was sure they would, the Logseq folk agreed. ",
