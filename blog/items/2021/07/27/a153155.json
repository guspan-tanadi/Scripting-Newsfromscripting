    "text": "I recently saw a video of a very early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee-wee_Herman\">Pee-wee Herman</a> standup act. I remember the first time I saw him on TV, it was a bit after this, but I couldn't figure out if he was for real or playing a role. That's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBEipABTws8\">how good</a> he was. Too bad he got cancelled for doing a very natural human thing to do, I can't see how anyone was hurt. [[Pee-wee Herman]] is a comedian who gets so intertwined with the role, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson\">Rowan Atkinson</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kaufman\">Andy Kaufman</a>, that you can't really tell if they're for real. We always assumed [[Robin Williams]] was an act too, but it's become apparent that the wild riffing comedian was who he really was, and it was part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body_dementias\">disease</a> he died from.
