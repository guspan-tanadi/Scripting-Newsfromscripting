    "text": "In [[Denmark]] they have a children's show about a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillermand\">man with a huge penis</a> that he uses to help people. At first it's a little shocking to this American, but why shouldn't we think of a [[penis]] as something friendly and useful. I was brought up to think of my penis as something shameful, dirty, to hide, to apologize for. I can't imagine how I got those ideas, but they were and are there in my infant brain. Eventually we learn to have fun with our penises. Hopefully. Why not start as a kid? Thanks to [[John Oliver]] for his incredible little <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A51mJjFyG_w\">tutorial</a>.  ",
