I had never heard that idea before seeing a quick interview today with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/07/20/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-launch-cooper-intv-sot-vpx.cnn\">Anderson Cooper</a> of CNN and the two Bezos brothers, who look very much alike. The rich one is the guy in the dorky cowboy hat. He says some industries that use up too much of the earth's resources would be better in space. I started to think about what he might have in mind. Server farms run on solar energy, and cooled by the vacuum of space. Perfect. On the other hand, who would regulate his businesses in space? No OSHA, no unions, no taxes or laws. I bet they're all thinking about this, and I kick myself for not having thought of it myself. ",
