Why? I have a hunch. Giannis is kind of like Melo was when things worked without him at the Knicks in 2012. Nothing cool could happen on the Knicks, <a href=\"https://clutchpoints.com/carmelo-anthony-jeremy-lin-story-did-melo-force-linsanity-out-of-new-york/\">said Melo</a> (in my imagination) without it going through me, said Melo.",

It's a free timeout for their opponent. If Lopez can do what Giannis does, without the foul shot liability, who needs Giannis?",
