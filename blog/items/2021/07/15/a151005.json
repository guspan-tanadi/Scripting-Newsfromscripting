We need new leadership, and it's not the [[Lincoln Project]]. Their war is within the Republican Party, which is not the war we're fighting. Our war is whether we go back to [[slavery]], or do we live up to the promise of the country post-Civil War and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society\">Great Society</a>. We need black leadership. We need to respond to the slavers very clearly, no, we will not discuss what you want to do. Your only choice is whether you will change or you will crawl back into the hole you came out of. There is no other choice. And we need to expel from Congress every traitor to the Constitution, and there are many of them. No half-steps. Nothing that makes people feel like everything is okay, that our war is winnable with stark advertising.",
