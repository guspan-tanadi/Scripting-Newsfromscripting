Here's his Apple Podcasts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827\">preview</a> page. Usually if you give that URL to the <a href=\"https://getrssfeed.com/\">GetRSSFeed</a> app, it returns with the address of the [[RSS]] podcast feed. This is <a href=\"https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377\">where</a> it took me. I <a href=\"http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377\">viewed the XML</a>, and it shows me an HTML page? If anyone can figure out the URL of his podcast feed, please let me know. Thanks.",
