    "text": "Now that I can see [[tagging]] in action, I changed how tags are displayed. A tag appears as a single-square-bracketed term, in blue. When you hover over it, it's underlined. This is more consistent with the way links work. And single-square-brackets are less intrusive than double, but still convey the idea that where you're going is different from a normal link. Feedback is <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/218\">welcome</a>. I'm also finding bugs in the tag server. Of course, and that's good. ",
