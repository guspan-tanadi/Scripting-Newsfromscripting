    "text": "My <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1414945524101287938\">tweet about GitHub</a> yesterday got a fair amount of attention. I'm glad, because the idea is powerful and works. Further if GitHub/Microsoft made this a business priority, it could be streamlined for end-users, and be a revenue source, and an incredible developer platform, beyond what it already does. I would love to begin a conversation with MS, privately if they want, to figure out what's possible here. ",
