    "text": "Good morning sports fans! The \"NBA\" finals resume tonight, I'm actually going to miss basketball when it's over. But then the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics\">Olympics</a> start, and after that my attention will finally turn to the Mets. I've got the rest of the year planned out. But the weather. Oy does it suck. I know there <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/07/none-of-the-old-rules-still-apply-when-the-driest-city-in-the-us-faces-a-catastrophic-drought/\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1013446314/amid-a-mega-drought-a-water-shortage-will-be-declared-along-the-colorado-river\">droughts</a> and <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html\">heat domes</a> elsewhere, but here we're living in a constant state of deluge. I take my bike ride every day, rain or shine. I used to skip rainy days but this summer that's not an option because it rains every damned day, and not just drizzle, hours of downpour. And the thunder last night. Who could sleep through that. Not this sports fan. I just want some beautiful warm summer weather. On the other hand the new rose bush I planted really seems to like all the wetness. ",
