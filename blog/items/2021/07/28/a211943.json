    "text": "I heard from a friend of [[Gary Sevitsky]], a colleague of mine in the late 70s at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He and I were both smokers and grad students in Computer Science, so we'd go out for smoking breaks together while working at the Unix lab on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/1210+W+Dayton+St,+Madison,+WI+53706/@43.0711993,-89.4087568,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8807accf34599401:0xcbdcc82ca4309b0f!8m2!3d43.0711993!4d-89.4065681\">West Dayton St</a>. It was in one of our hallway smoking conversations that he told me about Lisp editors that understood structure. I loved the idea, but I was programming in C, so I decided to build an editor for that language, with the same idea. That started me down a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html\">path</a> that to this day I'm still working on. The combination of outline structures and programming, it's a big deal. I never spoke with him after leaving [[Madison]], and after the [[Guy Kawasaki]] <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827?i=1000528857811\">podcast</a> I heard from a friend of his who said that <a href=\"https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/stamfordadvocate/name/gary-sevitsky-obituary?pid=190783474\">Gary had died</a> at age 57, in 2013. He was a kind, brilliant man, and a friend from one of the best times of my life. ",
