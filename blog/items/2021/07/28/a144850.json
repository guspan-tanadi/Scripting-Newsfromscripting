    "text": "[[White Lotus]] on [[HBO]] got really <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-white-lotus/season-1\">good reviews</a>, so I gave it a try. It <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-white-lotus%2Fseason-1\">sucks</a>. Often overwhelmingly cringe-worthy. However I have watched the first three episodes and I can see that I'm probably going all the way. I also tried [[Manifest]] on [[Netflix]], a former NBC series that got <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/manifest\">mixed reviews</a>. I knew from the start that it was <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fmanifest\">junk</a>, but I watched anyway because sometimes [[Junk TV]] is just right for the moment. You don't have to pay close attention to what's going on. They were trying to make another Lost, which was okay, but they didn't get there. It's just plain garbage. But it was #1 on Netflix last week. I haven't watched a series on Netflix in a long time, I wonder why I pay for it.  ",
