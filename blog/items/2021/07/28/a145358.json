    "text": "I'm still trying to figure out how to use [[tagging]]. The goal is to create an index, like the index in the back of a book. Maybe when I have enough tags I will be able to create a book from my writing here? It approximates the way we did the index in the back of software manuals at [[Living Videotext]]. Hmm. Maybe tagging would work well for the [[Drummer]] docs? Also my apologies to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email\">email</a> readers, for some reason the tags don't show up in emails. I have to figure out why, but I'm not working near there at this time.",
