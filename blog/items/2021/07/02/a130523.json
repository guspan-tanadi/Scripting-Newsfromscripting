    "text": "I haven't been to NYC in two years, even though I live just two hours north of the city by car. The last couple of days my friend <a href=\"https://www.sanforddickert.com/\">Sanford Dickert</a>, who now lives in London, has been walking around the city with his iPhone on a stick, broadcasting his travels <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sanford/videos/975431809884849\">over Facebook</a>, conversing with people who speak to him in the comments. I tune in when I can when he does it in London, but this week I've been feeling homesick for NYC. It's still there, but also quite empty. I hadn't counted on that. Those streets are just begging for me to ride on them by bike. Hotel <a href=\"https://www.kayak.com/hotels/New-York,NY-c15830/2021-07-07/2021-07-10/1adults?sort=rank_a;map\">rooms</a> are still pretty cheap, a nice hotel goes for about $150 a night. I probably should go down for a few days before the summer is over. I do miss the city, which is surprising to me. I no longer have family there, maybe that's why I'm staying away?  ",
