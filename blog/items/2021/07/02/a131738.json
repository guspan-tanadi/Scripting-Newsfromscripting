    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment#Season_4\">Season 4</a> of In Treatment became unwatchable. I skipped the last two episodes with Colin. I came close to skipping the other patients, and the two episodes about the therapist and her boyfriend and drinking were most unwatchable, but since one of them was the <a href=\"https://tvline.com/2021/06/28/in-treatment-recap-season-4-finale-brooke-eladio-colin-laila/\">finale</a>, I watched it, and hated it. The season started off so good and the actors, esp <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzo_Aduba\">Uzo Aduba</a> are fantastic. I don't know who the writers are, but the characters they created are just foils for speeches on social issues. I don't mind, if there's some art to it. Something to think about. But they're at the level of decade-old Twitter rants, I've heard it all so many times before. At least with Twitter I have a mute button. The concept of the show is very good when there's suspension of disbelief. While this season started out great, in the end the story was bleh, and the telling of it cringe-worthy.",
