    "text": "The name of the scripting language in Drummer is Drumkit. I have reserved a <a href=\"http://drumkit.org/\">domain</a> for it. There's nothing there at this time but a placeholder. <a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/\">Gary Teter</a> came up with the name in a <a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/2021/10/30/060526.html?title=moreDrummerThingsIpadEdition\">blog post</a>. When I read the post, I was pretty sure this was the name. I love how it connects to the name of the product, and it conveys the utility of having a language in a product such as Drummer. It also reflects the duality of the product. You can beat the drum in Drummer by writing, if you're a poet, and if you're a plumber, there's Drumkit. It's also nice because it leaves open the option of the language existing outside of Drummer, but no one will miss that the language <i>came from</i> Drummer. That's important I've found. I left similar clues in RSS and in podcasting. I think naming a product is a community thing, the best names don't come from one person's mind. Gary understands a lot about what I'm trying to do with the language, how else could he have devised such a perfect name. He can be proud, much as <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html\">Dannie Gregoire</a> can be proud of coming up with the name we eventually used for what we were calling audio blogging, even though there's a British journalist who falsely claims to have coined the term. Already the Drummer community has made a great contribution to Drummer. Many thanks! ü•Å",
