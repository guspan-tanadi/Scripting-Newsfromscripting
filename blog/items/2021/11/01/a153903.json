Apparently the software is a Gatsby plugin. Gatsby is <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gatsby-e828\">also</a> a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/\">company</a>, based in Berkeley, they have raised $46.8 million. I'm looking for an quick tutorial. I have literally never used it, so i would like to at least be able to talk about it, explain what it is and what this connection means. BTW, our goal is to connect everything with everything with \"Drummer\". Outlines in the middle. We rock! ðŸ˜€",
