    "text": "I didn't give up on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back\">Beatles on Disney</a>. It is totally worth watching. The Beatles were falling apart, but all they needed was a little help. A manager. Someone to keep the assholes away. So many jerks were wasting their time and talent. And someone to make sure that George Harrison felt loved, and they were focusing on the music, which is what they were so incredibly great at. At one point, John Lennon is getting briefed on some bullshit plan for a concert, it's all nonsense, and in the background Paul McCartney is working out the music and lyrics for one of the greatest songs of all time -- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYfEBY9NM4\">Let It Be</a>. I always wondered what their collaboration was like, they really did like each other. Such a shame. They had something incredible, and they just needed a little help. ",
