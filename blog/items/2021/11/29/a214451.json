    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey\">Jack Dorsey</a> is leaving Twitter again. All kinds of paranoid thoughts go through my head. Meanwhile, he posted his announcement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720\">as a tweet</a>, not in text but as a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/29/jackDorseyEmail.png\">screen shot</a> because Twitter <i>still</i> doesn't support text in a reasonable manner, even though they support video, images, <a href=\"https://www.clubhouse.com/\">Clubhouse</a>-style conferences, and email newsletters. This is insane. Twitter is an important platform. Not supporting text is a religious thing, as if they didn't have water fountains in The Vatican. (I just came up with that randomly.) I hope the first thing the new CEO does is fix this situation. Let's move outlines over Twitter. Whatever. Text isn't a new innovation, the blogger said ironically.",
