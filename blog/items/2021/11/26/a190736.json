I'm well into Season 2. It's a pseudo-history dramedy in the spirit of <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fsuccession\">Succession</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Stalin\">The Death of Stalin</a>. It's about a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great\">Russian empress</a> who overthrows her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_III_of_Russia\">husband</a> the emperor. As they say, hilarity ensues. :smile:",
