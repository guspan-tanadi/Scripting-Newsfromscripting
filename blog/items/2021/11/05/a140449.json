    "text": "I was on a drive yesterday on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike\">Masspike</a> and stopped in at a truckstop and bought a <a href=\"http://subway.com/\">Subway</a> sandwich, paid cash, went to the bathroom, noted that most of the truckers weren't wearing masks and continued my trip back to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway\">NY State Thruway</a>. I used to eat Subways a lot when I was driving cross-country back in the <a href=\"http://morningcoffeenotes.com/\">early days of podcasting</a>, doing my road trip casts. Well here's the funny thing. I got an email today from Subway saying how they're running a special. And I saw an ad for Subway on Facebook. Hello. Did I get made even though I paid cash? Did they have a face recognition camera in the truckstop? Oy. Living in the future kind of sucks. ",
