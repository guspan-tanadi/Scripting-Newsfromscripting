    "text": "I just started <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back\">Get Back</a>, the first few minutes of the first episode, enough to know that it's going to be a heavy emotional experience for me. As a kid I had so much invested in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles\">the Beatles</a>. Each period of their existence marked some big period or event in my life, things that I've mostly buried, but come right to the surface with (for example) Paul and George <a href=\"https://youtu.be/b-VAxGJdJeQ?t=131\">flopping their heads</a> in the chorus to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_and_Shout\">Twist and Shout</a>. To see the Beatles, alive and young and at the peak of their creativity, in a way we couldn't see them at the time, that's like reading a letter from a long-dead relative. The people are gone, the experiences were seminal, and recoverable. ",
