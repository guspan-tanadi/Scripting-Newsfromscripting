It's weird, the site seems broken -- when I try to log in it just sends me back to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/25/wirecutterSaysFuckOffNYTSubscriber.png\">the page</a> that says I have run out of free articles. It could be they want more money for WC, if so, the answer is no. I don't read a lot of NYT articles as it is. I have a very bad feeling about them, and it gets worse every year. That took a lot of work on their part because I was raised on the NYT. ",
