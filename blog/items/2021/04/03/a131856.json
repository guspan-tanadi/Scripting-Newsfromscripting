    "text": "I've thought more about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613\">Making of Sgt Pepper</a>. It's amazing to hear the Beatles' perspective on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band\">album</a>, I had never really thought how it was created, yet as a creative person myself, I’m often surprised and even offended that people don’t consider my point of view about the things I created. But at one time, Sgt Pepper was their thing, their secret. That's why the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/04/01.html#a155654\">final quote</a> was so strong for me. \"You just wait,\" says McCartney -- echoing the feeling in 1967 when he knew he had something great, that was going to shake the world (as it did) and no one but he and a few others knew what it was. And the lesson of the Making of Sgt Pepper is that you and I will never know Sgt Pepper the way McCartney does. And one more thought, if only John Lennon could have been there, what would we have learned. ",
