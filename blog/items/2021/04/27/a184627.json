That way we can see how they deviate from fairness. Give journalism a means to compare. Help people understand gerrymandering.  Another possibility -- maybe someone like Nate Silver could put together fair redistricting maps for all the states. It'd be an interesting idea to approach it as a non-partisan thing, using the best information and data tools we have.
