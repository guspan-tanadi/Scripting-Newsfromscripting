    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky\">Dan Kaminsky</a>, a security researcher, died today at 42. I didn't know him, but I followed him on Twitter. One of his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dakami/status/1214041947406393349\">tweets</a> is getting a lot of circulation now, and it's worth repeating. \"If somebody helped you — always feel free to let them know. They may not.  Really. There is no statute of limitations on being thankful. Years, decades, doesn’t matter. Now is always a good time.\"",
