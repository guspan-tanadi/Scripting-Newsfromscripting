Right now I'm listening to <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Roots-Audiobook/B002V8H174\">Roots</a>, narrated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brooks\">Avery Brooks</a>. It's a beautifully crafted story, and the narration is among the best I've heard. I'm still at the beginning, but I love it, I'm even listening when I'm not out getting my exercise. ",
