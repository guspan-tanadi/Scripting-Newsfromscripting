Once I went to visit, on vacation from my Silicon Valley startup. When I arrived at his little off-grid geodesic cottage in the woods, he showed me they had pinned up an article in Business Week with a picture of me, which labeled me as <i>President</i> Dave Winer of Living Videotext. My uncle who claimed he had changed my diapers when I was an infant, thought this was insanely funny. He told me they started calling each other President Ken, or President Dorothy, or President Pumpkin (one of their dogs) or President Dump Kitty (one of the cats). I didn't object because in my mind I had a terrible case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">impostor syndrome</a>. No one in California dared make fun of it, but here in the woods with my dear uncle and friends, it seemed fine.  ",
