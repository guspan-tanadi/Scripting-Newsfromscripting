    "text": "BTW, if it's a summit, you don't have to say it's a summit. The conference with FDR, Stalin and Churchill was simply called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference\">Yalta Conference</a>. My father once told me that a university doesn't have to say it's a university if they really are one. You don't see car window decals for proud parents that say Harvard <i>University</i> or Stanford <i>University. </i>Just Harvard and Stanford will do. He was putting down the window decal I got him for my <a href=\"https://tulane.edu/\">school</a>, which did proclaim itself a university. Even worse, they called themselves <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/602l8x/the_harvard_of_the_south/\">The Harvard of the South</a>. Oy! That's not a good sign. I wonder if they still do that. And doing a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22harvard+of+the+south%22\">search</a> today I learn that Duke, Rice, Emory and Vanderbilt also consider themselves THOTS. Maybe they should forget it and just try to love their students more.",
