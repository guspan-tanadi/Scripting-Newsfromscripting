I have always been bothered by conferences that call themselves summits. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/18/summit.png\">picture</a> of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference\">summit</a>. At the end of WWII, FDR sat down with Stalin. That's an actual summit. BTW, not sure why Churchill is there. :-)",
