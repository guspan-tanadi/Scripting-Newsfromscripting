    "text": "BTW, it's not <i>exactly</i> true that no outliner I've shipped has had a Bookmarks menu. \"Electric Outliner\" has one. But I haven't exactly promoted it. I use it to write my blog, in fact I'm using it right now to write <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/04/17.html#a133713\">this</a>. It has had a Bookmarks menu for years, and I've been able to manage lots of complex projects more easily because of it. EO is an Electron-based outliner that runs on the desktop. There will be a desktop version of Drummer, using lots of what's in EO, hopefully. It's possible we did a bookmarks feature for Frontier too. And <a href=\"http://scripting.com/autowebdocs/menusharingwalkthru_148.html\">menu sharing</a> is something like Bookmarks. My memory sucks. Sorry.",
