It's a great book, but already dated. The missions he talks about for the future have already happened. Our understanding of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn\">Saturn</a>, for example, has greatly increased since 1994. Now that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens\">Cassini</a> has visited, so much <a href=\"https://stfc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/features/10-things-we-ve-learned-from-cassini-huygens/\">more</a> is known. Sagan of course is not alive to do this for us. But it seems someone should. Next up I'm going to re-read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage\">Cosmos</a>. ",
