    "text": "I've been reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family\">Roots</a> while I've been waiting for this stomach thing to pass. Maybe not the best choice for reading material when you're feeling sick, but it's a gripping story, very well told. It's long. And the slaves the stories are about didn't have the luxury of switching to a different entertainment medium. Now I find as I poke around on the net and read what people say about prejudice and racism, I think no -- that's doesn't begin to cover it. I <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/550179-almost-half-of-republicans-say-chauvin-jury-reached-wrong-verdict-poll\">read</a> that 46% of Republicans polled feel the verdict in the Chauvin trial was wrong. The only universe that it was the wrong verdict was when black people, like George Floyd were slaves, and the only crime Chauvin would be guilty of was destroying another person's property. I wrote in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1386499946795393030\">tweet</a>: \"We were taught in school that slavery was over in the US but for millions of Americans it wasn’t and isn’t.\" So far no one has objected to that interpretation.
