    "text": "One reason <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1380510762515509249\">Manchin</a> might want to vote to cancel the filibuster is that it would maintain his power to veto non-budget Democratic legislation. With the filibuster in place the only power he has is to keep the filibuster. If he sticks with that he might as well switch parties now. However, if Biden and the Dems sold the voting plan that the Repubs will certainly block, if 90 percent of West Virginians supported the reforms, I would imagine that Manchin <i>could</i> change his mind. It all comes back to the same thing. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/04/07/142155.html?title=theCampaignNeverStops\">The campaign never stops</a>.",
