    "text": "I just found a 1991 piece by Steven Levy at MacWorld about Frontier, which was still in development at the time. Really interesting read because now, only 30 years later (heh), I'm doing a smaller version of the same idea, not on the Mac but on the open web, once again using standard protocols to connect apps. It starts on page 51 of <a href=\"https://vintageapple.org/macworld/pdf/MacWorld_9108_August_1991.pdf\">this PDF</a> of the August 1991 MacWorld. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/page51.png\">screen shot</a> of the first page. ",
