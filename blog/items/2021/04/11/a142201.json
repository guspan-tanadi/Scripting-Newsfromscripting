    "text": "Embarrassing mistake. Yesterday, in a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/04/10/142746.html?title=shouldNetflixHaveASchedule\">longish piece</a> about bingewatching, I gave Kazuo Ishiguro credit for writing the novel Howardâ€™s End.  He actually wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day\">Remains of the Day</a>. There is a connection. Both were made into movies starring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson\">Emma Thompson</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins\">Anthony Hopkins</a>. I corrected the piece, but here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/theError.png\">screen shot</a> of the error. BTW, interestingly, I received an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/netflixemail.png\">email from Netflix</a> last night suggesting I watch Howard's End. Is it a coincidence, or does their algorithm read my blog? That would be amazing if it did. (I'm sure it doesn't but it's an incredible source about my interests.)",
