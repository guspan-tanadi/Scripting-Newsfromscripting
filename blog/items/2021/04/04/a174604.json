Before the web, there was a deep market for software writing tools, all kinds of word processors, text editors, desktop publishing tools, even spreadsheets and database software were used to write. Yet few of those tools transitioned to the web. ",

Why don't we do it now?",

We never worked together but we worked with people who worked together. He did several products you might be familiar with. Lotus Symphony which was the height of the \"integrated software\" period in the mid-80s, and the corporate groupware product, <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/2431837/7-things-it-managers-should-know-about-lotus-notes.html\">Lotus Notes</a>. Since then he has been CTO of Microsoft, and has founded several successful startups. He was recently honored as a <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/events/building-a-better-world-through-tech-for-collaboration/\">fellow</a> of the Computer History Museum. I asked if I could include some of his comments in a blog post here, and he agreed. I didn't do any editing, his words appear exactly as he typed them.",
