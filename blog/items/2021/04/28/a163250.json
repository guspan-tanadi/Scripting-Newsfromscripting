The company kept a list of customers with \"funny\" names, for years. Assuming this is true, they deserve all the grief they get. I understand that non-founders do stuff like that, I've seen it, I've fought against it -- it's the job of the founder to take the side of the users. And make it clear that showing anything but love and admiration for <i>all</i> customers, every damn one of them, is not only not optional, but will get you fired after not too many offenses. It's very hard to keep user-disrespect from taking over companies, so you always have to watch for it and be a complete fucking asshole about it. People who wade through all the confusion of the market and figure out that your product is the best are geniuses. They are your lifeblood. Also, I certainly would have been on their list. I have a \"funny\" last name. I know it. A product of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island\">Ellis Island</a>. But I am not a customer of theirs. ",
