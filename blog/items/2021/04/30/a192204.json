Just as Richard Nixon, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alger_Hiss\">famous</a> communist hater, was able to open relations with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_1972_visit_to_China\">China</a> in 1972. Biden has a reputation as a moderate, therefore he has credibility when calling for more radical approaches to recovery.",
