    "text": "I've said this a million times. One more time won't hurt. Podcasting was created so <i>everyone</i> can make media. It was designed, deliberately, without gatekeepers. To have a podcast, you have to have a public \"RSS\" feed with enclosures. That's why you hear at the end of podcasts, \"You can get this where ever you get podcasts.\" They may name one or two of those places, but you know, because it's a podcast, you can listen to it in any podcast client, or in a pinch just by entering the URL of the feed into a web browser. That's why when Spotify calls what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1388053831733362691\">Joe Rogan</a> does a \"podcast\" it's an insult to all the people who worked so hard to make podcasting the huge juggernaut it is today. They should be crucified and burned at the stake for being total corporate assholes. I don't use Spotify. Never have, never will. Luckily I don't give a shit about Joe Rogan. I hear he's mean and stupid. And if you make an exclusive deal with Spotify as he did, you can be sure I'll never hear what you say. There's nothing wrong with Spotify offering proprietary radio shows. Just don't call them podcasts. Same goes for Audible and all the other companies who think open networks don't matter.",
