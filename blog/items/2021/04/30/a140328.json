    "text": "I've been using <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces\">Twitter Spaces</a>, their new competitor to [%search: Clubhouse%], at the encouragement of [%search: Robert Scoble%], who has taken to it the way he gets involved in everything, head first and way over his head. Completely submerged. Fine. I'm vulnerable to media like this, so I spent a couple of hours there in the last few days. I've been recovering from the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/04/28.html#a164755\">stomach thing</a>, so there's no harm in wasting a bit of time I wasn't going to use productively anyway. One thing Scoble said to me, when we were discussing <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/04/28.html#a163250\">Basecamp</a>, is that's fine but you're a white person. To which I said what I've always wanted to say to this. Yeah, but you're not refuting what I said, which has no race, age or gender. How about considering the ideas, where ever they might come from. In my experience, good ideas can come from places you're not expecting them. Sometimes I'm sure I've missed them altogether because of that. Other times I've almost missed them. It has happened enough that I consciously try to turn off that kind of judgement and just listen and consider regardless of who's speaking. This is one of the worst things about the current rage to discount anyone who isn't young, of color and/or female. What made me think about all this is the flack the kids who are upset about inaction among adults re climate change are getting. The <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/youth-climate-strike?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">adults are attacking</a> them because they're children. They aren't even listening to what they say. ",
