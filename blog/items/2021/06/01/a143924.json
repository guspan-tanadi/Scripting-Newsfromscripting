    "text": "I started watching the HBO series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment\">In Treatment</a>. At first it's boring, but it develops as it goes along. Some of the most despicable characters become sympathetic, and vice versa. You see real love between some of the pairs, also a lot of fear. 90 percent is conversations in a therapist's office. I found it hard to imagine how that could work, but it does. ",
