    "text": "There should be a limit on the number of times a team can foul one player. When a team exceeds the limit, the team being fouled gets to choose a player on the fouling team who is fouled out of the game. Do it again, lose another player. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack-a-Shaq\">Hack-A-Shaq</a> isn't good for the game. There's no reason a power dunker like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo\">Giannis</a> has to be a good foul shooter.",
