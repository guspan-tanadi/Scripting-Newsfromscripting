    "text": "I start my programming day with a new outline entry where I make notes about the first projects I'm going to do as I start working on code. Inevitably, I think of next steps, so I note them too. At the end of the day, I make notes for the next day, so I never have to worry about showing up to work and having no idea of what I'm supposed to do (this happens sometimes). In the middle, I note anything I might need to remember about the work in teh future, similar to the way a doctor takes notes on your chart as they do an exam, or decide on a plan. ",
