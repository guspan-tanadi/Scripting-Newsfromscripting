    "text": "I'm <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/in-treatment\">still</a> watching [[In Treatment]], but season 3 is mostly cringe-worthy. The writing is awful, and the various plots are ridiculous, though Debra Winger is pretty great. It's a very simple concept, they must've gotten bored with it (?) and tried to turn it into some kind of mysterious love affair between patient and doctor and then doctor-as-patient. Also too many patients have miraculous turn-arounds, and it's not clear why. They seem to be charmed by Paul, but we know Paul ain't charming! Oy. I'm slogging through season 3 knowing there's a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/in-treatment-review-hbo-season-4-uzo-aduba.html\">new season</a> already in progress, with a new shrink played by a familiar actor, and I want to watch it so I don't want to skip anything.
