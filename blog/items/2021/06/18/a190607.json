    "text": "BTW, thinking about Ward Cunningham's <a href=\"http://makecommoningwork.fed.wiki/federated-wiki.html\">Federated Wiki</a>  project, if it understood OPML and had an outliner built in, that would make a pretty great publishing platform. Even better than a built-in outliner, an API by which any outliner could plug in. I'd love to help with that. I love designing and supporting APIs. Ward and I talked about this in our <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html\">meetup in 2016</a>. I'm about to ship a new outliner, so it's a fresh topic for me in 2021. Lots of talk about integrating the output of one outliner into another. ",
