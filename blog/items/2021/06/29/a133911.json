Just guessing it comes with its own editor. Yet another crappy writing tool that doesn't peer with other writing tools. This is what kills the web as a writing environment. We should flush all these pieces of crap down the virtual toilet. If you're going to do something with text, please for writers' sake do not require them to use your stinking editor. ",
