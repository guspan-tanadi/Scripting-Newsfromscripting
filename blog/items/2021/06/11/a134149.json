    "text": "I have a two-monitor Mac. Sometimes when I move my mouse in the Dock at the bottom of my main monitor, it moves to the bottom of the other monitor. All of a sudden I have to stop, launch the  Preferences app, open the Dock panel, click the Right button then the Bottom button, and now the Dock is back where it belongs. It seems the problem could be easily solved by putting a Lock icon on the Dock tab, as they have on other panels. I can't imagine why they thought a mouse gesture should do something so radical as move the Dock. ",
