I never talked shit like that in my whole life. I’m not going to start now once <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/01/clint-capela-goes-scorched-earth-on-dirty-knicks-in-epic-taunt/\">Clint Capela</a> starts talking crazy. I’m too old for that shit, bro.” I love this guy. If any Knick could boast, it's DR, but he's cool. He likes playing for the Knicks, and we like him. ",
