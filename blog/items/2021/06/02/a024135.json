    "text": "The Brooklyn Nets are not a real basketball team. They are just a shell that Kevin Durant pwned by signing with them. Kind of the way Apple didn't really buy NeXT, it was the other way around. Anyway, the Durant's \"Nets\" might win a title, or try a couple of times, but either way the train will move on and leave the Nets as wrecked as the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is a trend, it's no longer innovative, curious, fun or even good basketball. Durant was bored in Golden State. He'll get bored in Brooklyn too. Imho, they're boring right now. :boom:",
