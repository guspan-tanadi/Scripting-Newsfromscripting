    "text": "I tried to listen to a <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/max-boot-on-future-democracy-joe-manchin-gops-threat/id1523896927?i=1000524616180\">Joe Trippi podcast</a> today, an interview with another political insider, Max Boot, member of a political thinktank and columnist for the Washington Post. It's the same discussion you can hear on every cable news show or political podcast. Basic question -- what can we do to stop the Repubs from taking over the government and destroying everything. They run through all the options and come to the conclusion that there actually is nothing to be done. I got through the first ten minutes, on a 1/2 hour drive to town, so I paused his show, got out my iPhone and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/06/08/dearJoe.m4a\">recorded my response</a>. I don't like picking on Joe, he's a nice person. The thing that makes him different from say Chris Hayes is that he might listen. There <i>is</i> something that can be done. But it means leaving business as usual behind. You can't win a war with an enemy that is 1/2 of your government. So listen to my 12-minute answer to Joe. ",
