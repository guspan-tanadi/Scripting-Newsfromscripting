    "text": "[[NYT]] did something interesting: <a href=\"https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060848652\">Gift articles</a>. Every subscriber, they say, can share up to 10 articles per month that don't count toward the number of free articles non-subscribers can read. I thought I was giving this a try earlier when I clicked the gift icon, but looking at the link it generated, there's nothing special about it. I'll try again. They don't say on the site when this feature was added, I just heard about it today. A quick news search turned up nothing. ",
