    "text": "Long ago, when [[RSS]] was starting to boom, I was often surprised when a new product came out and I didn't hear about it until it was announced publicly. The one I remember best was [[FeedBurner]]. You'd think that they would want my endorsement, and to give them a chance to answer technical questions before the press started asking them. Maybe they had a developer story? Or maybe I could have helped with a design decision? At that time Scripting News was pretty well-read in the developer community. It always felt like they must have been hiding something, but if they were I never found it. Yes FeedBurner centralized a technology that was good because it was decentralized, but I don't think my saying that would have hurt them. What was even more strange is I had friends at the company, people from the blogging world and from other RSS devs. ",
