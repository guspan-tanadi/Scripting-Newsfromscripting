    "text": "In the last decade or so I modified my art from making software for everyone to making software mostly for myself. Some projects take years to complete, and some remain on the shelf waiting for their turn to be rolled out. But the best product I've ever made I think is <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Daytona&collection=scriptingnews\">Daytona</a>. A project that I was thinking about for a few years, but when it finally came time to write the code, took about <i>two weeks. </i>Of course I spent a fair amount of time in advance of those two weeks creating packages and techniques that made it possible. But it is right now by far my favorite writing tool. I have most of my writing for the last 20+ years available to me through search, with full text, and a usable UI, unlike the increasingly sparse and unusable commercial search utilities. This proves one thing, there's still a fair amount of unexplored territory in the web. ",
