    "text": "Outliners should support \"OPML\", then users will be able to switch between products without having to convert their work. OPML is the best candidate for interop between outliners, and we are <i>not</i> a long way from that. It's a mature format, widely deployed. it's something I think the users are going to have to ask for because the developers are either too busy, or are not on board with the idea of people being able to use their work independently of the tools they use. I'm not looking to profit here, any more than I profited from RSS or podcasting. I want the users be empowered, because we need better-organized thinkers more than anything. I'm here to help. ",
