I also assume the car is going to alert me if there's a car in the left lane. Icaught myself switching lanes without looking the other day, based on being trained by the Subaru. I'm not going to forget to look, I have decades of experience that I had forgotten. Also the thing about the Tesla is the promise it makes with that huge screen in the middle of everything, but then you find out it doesn't do any of the things you expect from Apple Car Play. All that promising screen real estate -- it doesn't deliver what you expect it to. How much would it cost for Subaru to add a huge screen to their 2023 or 2024 models? Heh, they <i>have</i> to be doing this. ",
