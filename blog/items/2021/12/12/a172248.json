    "text": "I noticed people are talking about <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml\">Daytona</a> on their blogs, and there's a general positive view of it, and an expectation that I will continue to improve it. That's all good. But a lot of that depends on how much I get back from users. Ideas that are interesting, not necessarily obvious, and aren't expressed in terms of panic. I want to move this forward, with friends, with people who are as excited as I am and are ready to roll up their sleeves and participate. But if you wait for me to do it, then I'll just add the things I want. I'm hoping that \"Drummer\" users take an interest. And not just \"do this for me now\" -- help out. I can't read minds, and I don't really like working for free. I don't want dollars, I want the product of intelligent, kind people who help. My friend <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=nakedjen&collection=scriptingnews\">NakedJen</a> has the perfect motto for this, \"You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up.\"",
