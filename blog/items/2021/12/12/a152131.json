    "text": "Already <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml\">Daytona</a> has improved my writing. I think I could be writing a book now, a memoir, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469\">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence</a>, my <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=island%20book&collection=scriptingnews\">Island Book</a>. A new dimension has opened up. Until now writing has been more or less Of The Moment. As Google has punished me for not supporting their various <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">hijacks</a> of the web, the writing has become more ephemeral, kind of like Twitter -- once written -- hard to find again.
