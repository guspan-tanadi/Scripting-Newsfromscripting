    "text": "I use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger\">debuggers</a> as an integral part of the coding process. I almost never run anything complex without stepping through the code in the debugger, to be sure it's running the way I intended it to. Having the data it's working on right there, easily browsable, gives me ideas for new functionality. Imagine being a surgeon who can get <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage\">inside</a> the living body, turn off all the systems to examine things, then click a button and have the organism reanimate. And then imagine having such a tool available to you and not using it. There are programmers who don't use debuggers. They're working at a lower level imho. Like flying without instruments. ",
