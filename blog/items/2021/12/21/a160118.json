    "text": "I haven't been listening to a lot of political podcasts these days because political reporting is asleep at the wheel, like the Biden administration, re the coup that keeps going, but <a href=\"https://slate.com/transcripts/Z3FUKzFDL2x0NURwZmJ2RmdnL0dXQzc4cUVwVmUyUzBzeWRrempwVElpYz0=\">this week's Amicus podcast</a> is the exception. Though they are too kind to the press, the guest, Walter Shaub, has a clear mind re the coup, and the Biden's lack of response. I highly recommend a listen. ",
