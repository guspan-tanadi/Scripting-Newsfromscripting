One of the goals of the project was to have great <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml\">docs</a>, and I think they came out pretty good, but there was still a major problem -- where to put things. This is the problem in all docs. Even if you're a good docs writer, and I've had a lot of practice, and you know the product well, and care about the users, some things just won't have a place. So you document them on the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/\">blog</a>, or in the Change Notes outline, and hope people can find them in a search engine. But they keep doing a worse job of indexing our stuff, and they don't know what is a Drummer doc and what isn't, so you can't say for example, \"search the Drummer docs for instructions on how to restore a blog.opml file in a myfiles archive\" which is a question a user posed <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/140#issue-1082790948\">yesterday</a>. I smiled when I saw it. This is a job for Daytona. So here's the query I entered.",
