    "text": "T'is the season to binge. Next up -- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Eleven_(miniseries)\">Station Eleven</a>. I read the book a few years ago, but this series isn't much like the book. I like it so far. I usually don't binge shows as they come out, I like to wait for the series to end, and then watch it at my own pace. But this is an exception. Anyway I watched episodes 4 and 5 last night, both were very good, esp the one that took place in the airport in the first days of the apocalypse. I think HBO has the secret formula for making great TV series. <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fstation-eleven\">This one</a> is right up there with Succession, Game of Thrones, etc. ",
