It's a farce and it's really funny and sexy, super-cute and sad, in the same way that <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/24.html#a143342\">Don't Look Up</a> is sad. Human nature is all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdPmNM0IF7Y&t=36s\">fucked up</a>. That seems to be a recurring theme. Heh. But it is so much fun, kind of like the way <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/beetlejuice\">Beetlejuice</a> is fun -- and there are two full seasons so there's a lot to binge. <i>Huzzah! </i>",
