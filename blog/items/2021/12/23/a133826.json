    "text": "I couldn't watch the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Resurrections\">new Matrix movie</a>, but I did get about 1/2 way through. If you haven't seen it, or you have and liked it, then don't read the rest of this post. I like story-telling in movies, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix\">the first Matrix</a> in 1999, was one of the best movies ever, as a story. It's a puzzle. Red pill, blue pill, who is Agent Smith, and The Oracle, and why does Morpheus think Neo is The One. And wtf is the Matrix! It's a beautiful story, and the characters -- young Keanu and Carrie-Anne, Hugo Weaving, Lawrence Fishburne. In the 2021 version, they recast a bunch of them and spent huge amounts of time explaining why. Who cares. When I switched it off last night, the characters were still yapping about what changed and why. It reminded me of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie\">Deadwood movie</a>, a movie whose plot didn't start until they finished re-introducing all the main characters. And then they had about 40 minutes for something unmemorable, even stupid. Anyway I will finish Matrix 4, if only because maybe there's something worthwhile there. And I know some people really liked it, I don't understand why, but I respect that. Maybe sequels like this shouldn't be made, or maybe no one has figured out yet how to do it. Or maybe all movies these days have to be all about action and narration without acting or plots getting in the way. Instead I watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piano\">The Piano</a> on Netflix, a wonderful movie, with almost no dialog, and no characters insisting that I hear their explanation for what happened. You get to figure it out for yourself.",
