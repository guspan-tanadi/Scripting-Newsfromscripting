    "text": "About normalcy. I was telling a friend how there was a party atmosphere at the place we all got our vaccines. She pointed out that it might have been that we had been so deprived of social contact, and I slapped my hand on my forehead. Of course. I am not usually as gregarious as I've been in the last year, when I have had a chance to be with other people. I thrive on it.So we were all high at the vaccination site not just with relief at gaining some immunity, but also because here were some real live humans to talk with! It's why I think, no matter how dire the reality is, when we achieve new kinds of social interaction we will be a happy place, probably for quite a while or hopefully. I remember how it felt after 9-11, but the togetherness was short-lived. Maybe we should think about what kind of normal we want?",
