    "text": "If you don't believe such a thing exists, listen to this <a href=\"https://cafe.com/stay-tuned/trumpeachment-with-david-frum/\">discussion</a> between David Frum and Preet Bharara, all the way through. Obviously Frum, a Republican, passionately believes in the rule of law, and he is staying a Republican, he says so clearly. I read Frum's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XKVQ2MJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">latest book</a>, I read all his Atlantic columns. I cringe when he talks about Republican campaigns he worked on, and his experience in the Bush II administration. How could someone so honest be so corrupt? Somehow it works for him. Who am I to question. I have a philosophy. I don't ask how you got to the party. I don't care if you took the subway, or cam in a limo or an Uber, or you walked, rode a bike, or hijacked a bus. You're at the party, that's all that matters. Let's work together to get back to a place where we can respectfully disagree, and retain our honor. I'm pretty sure Frum would agree.",
