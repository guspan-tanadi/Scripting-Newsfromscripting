I signed up to see how it works. <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/dave-winer/issues/weekly-newsletter-of-dave-winer-issue-1-79432\">You can subscribe</a>, but there probably will only be this one issue. Functionally it's very similar to the others. You have to use their editor. I already have an editor that's customized for the way I work, so there's no way I'm using their editor. I already have <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">email distribution</a> of my own. It's ridiculous. They must not understand how writers work. We find the tool that's right for us and it becomes part of our bodies. Too much world domination as a strategy in tech, as always. That's how we get situations like this. ",
