    "text": "In the early 2000s we had an <a href=\"http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi.html\">API for writing tools</a> to plug into content systems. We felt that writing tools should develop independently of how the writing is distributed. Simple idea, any developer can understand the need. But today, the systems don't offer choice. If you want to publish in their environment you have to use their text editor. Facebook makes you use their editor, it's a piece of crap, it has tiny little type, hard to read, super buggy. Why can't I use my own editor. Just want to tell non-devs out there, they could do it, easily and cheaply. Their reason for not doing it is to lock you in to using their tool. What a waste of our brainpower. It's as if your printer came with word processing software and you could only print stuff from that app. That's what Substack is doing, and Twitter's new newsletter software does it too. Use our primitive writing tool, that's the only choice. Ridiculous. It's a throwback to the way tech worked <a href=\"https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=929\">in the 1970s</a>. Bottom line, start evaluating these services based on the quality of their writing tools, really criticize them, until they get tired of hearing it, and offer you a chance to use the ones you love.
