    "text": "Another update in the [%search: Airpods%] saga. Recall that I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/02/10.html#a163710\">gave up</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=asc_df_B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=366402654398&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5599194572670142815&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1023511&hvtargid=pla-852536612290&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74513439285&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=366402654398&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5599194572670142815&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1023511&hvtargid=pla-852536612290\">Jabra</a> and Skullcandy earbuds. They both sounded horribly tinny, like an old style AM radio. Actually I didn't give up, it turns out. While watching impeachment hearings, I searched for reports on the Jabra earpods and the word <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=jabra+elite+75t+tinny\">tinny</a>, and read <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Jabra/comments/hf1z9k/should_the_jabra_elite_75t_sound_very_tinny/\">this thread</a> on Reddit. Basically they said do a bunch of voodoo, put them back in their case, take them out, do it again, change the silicon fits, do it all again, say a prayer, and sooner or later they will sound like you thought they should based on the glowing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/\">review</a> in Wirecutter. It worked! Unreal. This is another example of the way we used to fix broken Apple II's, just take them for a drive in the car, and they start working again. Anyway, good enough. And in the interim I ordered a new pair of Apple Airpod Pros, because I got hooked, and had headset-envy every time I saw someone on TV wearing them. As I've said many times, I collect headsets the same way some <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2021/02/03/kanye-west-moves-500-pairs-of-shoes-out-of-home-shared-with-kim-kardashian/\">people</a> collect shoes.
