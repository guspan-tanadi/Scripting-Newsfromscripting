    "text": "BTW, Google search is getting worse all the time. I know I've told the story of how we used to fix Apple II's by driving around (they always seemed to work when we got to the repair shop), and I've also said many times that I collect headphones the way some people collect shoes, but Google can no longer find either. I've been using Google search since 1998. I hate Google for the way <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html#a170258\">they treated RSS</a>, and the way they are doing the same <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">to the web</a>, but I've been using their search engine for 23 years, and it's a hard habit to break, but one way to break it is to break search, which they seem to be doing. They should shrug this off at their own peril. Imagine Coke taking the fizz out of their cola. Same basic idea imho.",
