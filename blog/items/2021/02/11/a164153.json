I tried it because I like regular <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/945757610/#comment72157601091354345\">Fresca</a>. My first taste was yuck this is like water with just a little hint of flavor. So I kept drinking my Diet Dr Pepper, my current go-to carbonated beverage. But then I ran out of chilled DDP, so I went with the backup, and the second time, wow, it was a super refreshing, bubbly instant thirst quench. I know this sounds like a commercial, but that's really where I'm at now. I'd pick Fresca Blackberry Citrus over <i>anything</i> at this point. Have to get some more. :boom:",
