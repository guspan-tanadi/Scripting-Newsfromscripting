    "text": "I've been watching the impeachment trial on and off. It's excellent. They thought of everything. Just asked a big question -- what if Trump had succeeded. He came close. What if they had killed a few senators, the VP, the Speaker. What would have happened next? Clearly this whole thing was planned, probably around the time Barr left. Did he see how it was shaping up and decided to get out then. Are the only ones who stood with Trump up to the coup, Hawley and Cruz? Were they surprised when the mob got into the Capitol? So many questions. A lot of them are off-topic for the impeachment, but historians are going to want to know how this came together. ",
