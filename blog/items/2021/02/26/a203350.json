    "text": "Perhaps my favorite thing about my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945\">Subaru Forester</a> is how well it fits me: \"It has more headroom than any car I've owned, which is cool because my torso is huge. In most cars, designed for normal-size people, I hit my head getting in, and have to scrunch my body uncomfortably just to fit. I sail in and out of the Forester, and I can sit any way I want.\" Is the same true of a Tesla, if so which one? I would certainly have to verify. ",
