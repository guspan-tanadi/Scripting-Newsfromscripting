    "text": "In a brief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1356988600483799041\">discussion</a> about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/globalvoices\">Global Voices</a> on Twitter, I mentioned the idea that news has been <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled\">unbundled</a>, today no single publication delivers the news, as they used to. A story to illustrate. As a student at <a href=\"https://www.wisc.edu/\">UW-Madison</a> in the late 70s, I'd often go to the <a href=\"https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/\">Memorial Union</a> with a copy of the <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/\">Chicago Tribune</a>, on a sunny afternoon perhaps, and sit on the patio by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mendota\">Lake Mendota</a>, people-watch, and read the news. Today I'd do it in a minute if I could, but today I'd read news on an iPad or laptop using \"RSS\" feeds. I'd have an all-in-one bundled news experience as I did in the 70s. But: My system kind of sucks, I never put any effort into maintaining it, and my system is vastly better than what most people get as a news experience. No wonder the truth has trouble getting out. The news industry blames Facebook, but as a former entrepreneur, I blame them. They've invested so little in understanding how their readers use their product. Their system is based on an incomplete understanding of their roles. The news industry product needs to be re-bundled. I believe the rewards will be huge for the first publication that bets on this idea. They wouldn't be the first, btw -- <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/19/whatToDooWithYahoo.html\">My.Yahoo</a> did it in the 00's. Have the guts to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3\">point to your competition</a>. And if you have a paywall, send them some money <i>and</i> some readers. Now that Jeff Bezos is retired, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html\">owns</a> such a platform, I would stand up and applaud if they had the guts to try this out. I'd also line up to hook my blog into such a network. Not because my writing depends on making money from it, it doesn't, but to help disrupt the news industry that's daydreaming itself to death over distribution, competition and economics. ",
