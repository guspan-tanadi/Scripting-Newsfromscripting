    "text": "Back in the late 80s I started a company called \"UserLand\". My second company. I knew that was going to be the name when I was running my first, Living Videotext. It was named after the tech. By the time I was ready for the second, I came to believe that every company is about the users, not the tech, hence UserLand. 33 years later, I feel the same way, only more so. ",
