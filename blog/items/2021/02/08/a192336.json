    "text": "I was asked why I care that the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/02/06/154705.html?title=nyTimesFiresDonaldMcneil\">NYT fired Donald McNeil</a>. It's pretty simple. We all have an interest in how journalism works. They like to say that journalism is a essential part of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/opinion/international-world/athens-democracy-forum.html\">democracy</a>, but do the people have any influence over journalism? To really press the point, democracy is about the people, right? You can't be of democracy without being of the people. We have a role in this, which journalism hasn't embraced, in fact by fighting Facebook they are actively undermining our participation. And when they fire a great reporter who helps people, I, simply as a person and nothing more, have a stake in that, as does everyone who depends on good information from news orgs. And sure I care how 150 reporters at the NY Times feel, but I don't care abput them that much, compared to how much I care about the service McNeil was providing. Those 150 people are pure narcissists with too much power. They should see themselves more as servants. ",
