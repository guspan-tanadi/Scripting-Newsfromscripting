    "text": "I keep sharing this idea with my friends at <a href=\"https://radioopensource.org/\">Radio Open Source</a>, but I don't think they get it. It's the same advice I'd give to any professional news org. Build more community around your podcast. If you do a weekly show, say on a Thursday, compile a set of emails from listeners and publish it on Tuesday, via email, as a newsletter. That way you get to know who's listening, and we get to know each other. Chris's podcast no doubt has some very interesting listeners, who are they and what do they think, what do they know? They've set up, imho, a too-narrow pipe, necessitated by the technology <i>we used to use</i> for radio. Today's tech makes so much more possible. You just have to want to do it. I don't doubt they could find volunteers to read and curate the emails, so only the really interesting stuff goes out. What made me think of this was <a href=\"https://radioopensource.org/write-like-the-russians/\">last week's show</a>, with a famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Saunders\">English prof</a>, going through how short stories work. It was just a tiny sliver of a scratch of the surface. I want to know much more about this. Also glad to get away at least for a moment of end-of-the-world stories, which tend to dominate the podcast-o-sphere these days. :boom:",
