    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Vann\">Lizzie Vann</a>, a famous entrepreneur, did something bold, she bought and renovated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearsville,_New_York\">Bearsville</a>, a town-like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(place)\">entity</a> that's next to and part of Woodstock, NY. The theater, studio and restaurants at the center of Bearsville were built by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman\">Albert Grossman</a> in the 60s and 70s as a place for the musicians he worked with to gather. He died in 1986, eventually Bearsville was abandoned. But now, it's beautiful again, an up to date and very attractive venue, what a great gathering place, as it once was, esp for people who produce audio (eg podcasters). Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FEpT8INVn8&feature=emb_logo\">video</a> to get an idea. A beautiful place. Lovely in summer. An idea, as we come out of the pandemic of course. :rocket:",
