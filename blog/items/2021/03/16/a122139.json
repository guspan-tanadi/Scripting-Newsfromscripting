    "text": "I think business, politics and journalism must have a code of ethics, and that includes treating everyone fairly. But we don't do that. We destroy lives of innocent people in the name of justice, which is exactly why I oppose the death penalty. Decisions about life and death must not be part of a political process, and neither should someone's banishment from public life. If the charges stick, if we believe the person is really guilty, first take steps to protect potential victims, then have a process for determining innocence or guilt, and apply that process to everyone equally, regardless of whether they are a nominee for president, governor of a big state, or just some random schmuck. This is America. We believe in protecting people from mobs. We are nothing if we allow mobs to tear people down. And we are living through a period where people do just that. This is not acceptable.
