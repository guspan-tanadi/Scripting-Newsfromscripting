    "text": "About politics, I'm not one of those people who cherry-picks bits of news to support a cherished theory. I try to see all the info that's available to me, and I do change my mind, sometimes in a very big way. I used to vote for Republicans, don't ask me why, I can't believe it myself. But I stopped that nonsense in 2004, and ever since I can't imagine why any sane person would. I also know that Andrew Cuomo was part of a very nasty campaign against Ed Koch on behalf of his father, Mario Cuomo, when both were running for mayor of NYC. They were <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/ed-koch-held-decades-long-grudge-against-cuomos-over-vote-for-cuomo-not-the-homo-posters\">picking on Koch</a> because he was a single man, questioning his sexual orientation. Back then this was nasty bullshit, but it didn't disqualify his father. Today, if the word ever got around, if people knew the slogan they were using, it would probably ruin Governor Andrew, as it should. To this day I can't hear the name Cuomo without thinking of this <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=cuomo+homo\">bit of nasty</a>. Basically the Cuomos ended up fucking themselves, and they deserve it. ",
