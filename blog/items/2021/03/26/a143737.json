They were behind by too many points, and they weren't playing well. I figured this game is gone. I was surprised the starters were still playing. Much later I saw fan exclamations on Twitter, that seemed to say the Knicks had won. They did. I've learned my lesson. This season's Knicks are special. They win games they have no right winning. The roll over Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beale like they were the rookies and the Knicks were the team packed with franchise players. It's like the 2015 Mets, perhaps. I honestly don't care if the Knicks make the playoffs. They have such heart, such love for themselves and each other. It's pure joy to watch them play. ",
