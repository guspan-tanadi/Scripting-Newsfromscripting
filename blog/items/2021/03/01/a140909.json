    "text": "[%search: Donald McNeil%] has started to write about his leaving the NY Times. It appears it'll be coming out in installments. <a href=\"https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/nytimes-peru-n-word-part-one-introduction-57eb6a3e0d95\">The first</a>, which was published today on Medium is mostly preamble. I know what he means about being edited. I wrote briefly <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awired.com+%22dave+winer%22\">for Wired</a> in the early days. I loved my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen\">first editor</a>, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes.",
