    "text": "I am pissed that the press is going after Andrew Cuomo, who led us through some very dark times, when it helped to feel like someone was in charge. We may need that again, and thanks to this purge, he may not be available. But if you really want to nail him, learn about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_New_York_City_mayoral_election#General_election\">1977 campaign</a> between his father and Ed Koch, for mayor of NYC. It was very mean-spirited, and Andrew was part of it. I find what the Cuomos did utterly abhorrent, but you know what, we still need people who can lead. Perfection is nice, if you can afford it. We can't. ",
