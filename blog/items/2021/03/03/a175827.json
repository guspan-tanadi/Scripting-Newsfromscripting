    "text": "Yesterday with the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/03/02.html#a171711\">power outage</a>, I listened to a lot of podcasts, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/opinion/the-argument-congress-filibuster-senate.html\">The Argument</a> from the NYT. They had a two-sided discussion of the filibuster. One side for getting rid of it, and the the other for preserving it. The latter was argued by a establishment Republican <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessAnderson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">conservative</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/\">Heritage Foundation</a>. I kept thinking, they aren't the other side any longer. They represent possibly 10 percent of the Republican Party which represents maybe 40 percent of the electorate. The real \"others\" are the nutjobs and fascists. They want to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc\">burn the whole thing</a> down. I doubt if they have anything specific to say about the filibuster. I'd love to hear a debate between the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein\">Ezra Klein</a> faction (smart, thoughtful, polite) and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy\">guy</a> who runs the US Postal Service or Josh Hawley. I also listened to the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mea-culpa-with-michael-cohen/id1530639447\">Michael Cohen podcast</a>. He has something. A real radio personality. A <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lawn%20Guyland\">Lawn Guyland</a> guy for sure. Surpringly it held my interest. ",
