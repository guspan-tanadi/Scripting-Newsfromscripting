    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/03/144317.html?title=myFatherApologized\">On this day last year</a>, in a dream, my father, who never apologized for anything to anyone at any time in his life, as far as I know, apologized for something. I accepted it, and we became friends. Does it mean my subconscious is ready to forgive and move on, or did my father, after being dead for 11 years, process his life and realize it was time to <a href=\"https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_step9.pdf\">make amends</a>? I don't know, but re-reading the post, I was able to feel the relief today that I felt last year. One of the many wonders of having a blog. I went back looking for comments about the looming (then) pandemic. ",
