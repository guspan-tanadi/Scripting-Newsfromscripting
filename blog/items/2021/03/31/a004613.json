Interviews with George Martin, the three surviving Beatles (in the early 90s). Many others. This album was the turning point from the Beatles being a touring phenom, to pioneering a new creative direction for pop music. It's inspiring, we need a similar turn in software. (It's also available <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1478913278982739\">on Facebook</a> if that works better.)",
