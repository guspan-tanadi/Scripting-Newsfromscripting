    "text": "One of the biggest misperceptions about how money works, even among educated people, is that the Federal Reserve creates money, and gives it to the US government. So we don't have to raise taxes to \"pay\" for projects we want to do, or to provide relief to victims of disasters. And in fact very often we don't, we pay for it with money we create for that purpose. The United States is unique in its ability to create new money because our dollar is the reserve currency for the world. So If say France owes money to India they pay them in dollars. If a small country is reserving some money for a future project, they store it in dollars. Our currency unlike all others is in demand all around the world. We are the richest country there is, it's not hypeperbole. And yet we have one of the worst benefit systems for our people in the world. If people really understood how this works (just re-read this bit) they would be enraged about how health, education, infrastructure, everything basically, in the US, is shit. You see this when you travel to Europe. A sense that everything is first class. And they don't have the economic advantages that we do. Some of it is the rich self-dealing, grift, the 1%, inequality, etc -- but a lot of is the dysfunction of Congress. A lot of waste happens that way. ",
