    "text": "I'm thinking about selling one of <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/fridayDave.mp3\">my first podcast</a>s, the one that got the ball rolling, that started my series of <a href=\"http://morningcoffeenotes.com/\">Morning Coffee Notes</a> podcasts, and then inspired a community to develop, which caused more podcasts and on and on. People are dismissive of NFTs, and critical, but there's been no other way for a maker of new media types such as myself to get credit for our creations. Looking back, I certainly would have led the bootstrap of podcasting, even if I didn't get credit for it, someone had to do it, we needed to use the internet for audible expression and no one else seemed able to do it. But I'd like young people to know how these things work, they don't have to start companies to make a significant contribution. They can stay in their art. ",
