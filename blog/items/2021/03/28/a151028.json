    "text": "As I'm developing a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation\">Frontier-like product</a>, I'm remembering how much I didn't like some of the developers we attracted. We used to believe in the goodness of everyone, but forgot the humanity, and that as a community grows, eventually you attract <a href=\"http://this.how/trolls/\">people</a> who try to make your life miserable. The pressure of dealing with these people literally made me sick. I got better as soon as I stopped. We've learned a lot about moderating community systems since then. So I'm going to keep my promise to myself, this project is mainly for me, because I want it, and I love the idea of other people using it, and helping each other, and that includes me, but when they start abusing me, I'm turning them off without a second thought.
