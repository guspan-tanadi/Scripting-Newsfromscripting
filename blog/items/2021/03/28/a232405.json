    "text": "I've known <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Arnett/e/B06VVR3DX6%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\">Nick Arnett</a> for a long time. He used to be a tech journalist, but in recent years, he's become a public service person. He has been on the front lines of fighting fires in California. Most he's recently has been working in Oakland, helping people get their Covid vaccinations at the Coliseum. This morning he asked for help on Facebook. They needed a simple app that could tell them when 15 minutes and 30 minutes were. These are the amounts of time people have to wait before leaving, to be sure that if they have a bad reaction to the vaccine, that they can be helped by medics. Makes sense that in the middle of everything else they have to do, adding 15 and 30 to the current time is a bit much to ask. I said I would be happy to do it. Just a small JavaScript project. I was glad to help. The result is this site: <a href=\"http://timeshifter.scripting.com/\">timeshifter.scripting.com</a>. It's possible other vaccinators could use it, if so please pass it on. ",
