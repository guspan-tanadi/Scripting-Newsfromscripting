    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html\">One year ago today</a> I recorded a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a\">podcast</a> about how the world was about to change and how Americans weren't ready for it. And for a few hours I replaced the contents of the home page of my blog with a simple statement in very <a href=\"http://scripting.com/urgent/2020/03/05.html\">big letters</a>: \"A deadly virus is taking over the world and the United States doesn't have a government.\" A year later, and the virus did take over the world, and thankfully the US now has a government, yet it is very damaged by the traitorous behavior of the ousted president. But we're doing better now.",
