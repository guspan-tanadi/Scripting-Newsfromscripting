    "text": "Just heard, on BBC, about a book entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Hate-Women-Misogyny-ebook/dp/B08QY6PXX5/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\">Men Who Hate Women</a> written by a woman. I don't doubt that there are men who do hate women. On the other hand, I also don't doubt that there are women who hate men. Maybe if we worked on all the hate, what an idea that would be. In the interview the author said that hate speech by men includes the statement that not all men hate women. We always have to be so careful because you never know what's going to be considered hateful. Not hating women and saying so is not hate, imho, it's more like pleading for mercy. To think it's hate is straight out of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6146-war-is-peace-freedom-is-slavery-ignorance-is-strength\">1984</a>. Further, it's exactly this kind of crap that makes people fear women, because they can ruin a man's life so easily. I've seen it happen. And when it does, it does not, imho, in any way help anyone. It's just more of what you hated about men being applied to men, and probably feeding more hate all around. You can't stop hate with fear. Also: every man had a mother, and early in life that little man was putty in that woman's hands. If you want to fix the problems, and make life better for women, you have to work on women's attitudes too, and help that little dude love <i>himself. </i>",
