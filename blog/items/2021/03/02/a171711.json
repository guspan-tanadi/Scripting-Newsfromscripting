    "text": "The weather. Oy! Very cold very windy and the power has been out, on and off, since yesterday afternoon. I charged up all my devices before the power went out and loaded up lots of podcasts, so I'm very entertained. Made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy82ekHbVpM&feature=youtu.be\">nice fire</a>, but the house still got down to about 45 degrees. I was worried about pipes freezing if the outage lasted much longer. But the power is back at about 12:20PM Eastern and I'm feeling pretty good now. ",
