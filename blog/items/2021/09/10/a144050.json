    "text": "Thanks to everyone who pointed me to the <a href=\"https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then\">Now & Then podcast</a> with Heather Cox Richardson and Joanne Freeman. I listened to the most recent <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/climate-control/id1567665859?i=1000534537048\">episode</a> about the history of humans and climate in America. Wow. So much information and perspective, without any extra junk, and with depth that can only come from having spent a lifetime learning. It is exactly what I was looking for, at least so far. There are quite a few podcasts in the library, and they're exactly as long as my bike ride. They were finishing as I was pulling into the garage, literally. Also only one commercial and it was for a new podcast from the same network. Not overbearing. Thrilled. ",
