    "text": "I'm loving going through [[Rick and Morty]] for the second time. I've promoted it to my friends, but the comments I get back are a lot like the ones about [[Bojack Horseman]]. They're turned off by the fact that it's a cartoon. I don't mind it at all, myself, and it has the advantage that they can go places with their imaginations that human actors can't. That's esp important for a show like R&M. Also another thing I like is that there's no fourth wall at weird times. Rick talks like a game show host, about commercial breaks, and then talks about episodes, and seasons of R&M. I love it when writers are free to talk to us through the characters, quite literally, not through manipulation. I think it's a masterpiece, as I did with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bojack\">Bojack</a>. Here's the thing, as kids we loved cartoons right? I know I did. I also loved movies. So now I like movies made for adults, why not cartoons for adults?",
