    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/08/31.html#a153800\">Yesterday</a> I put out a call for new \"Drummer\" testers, asking for people with blogging and/or scripting experience. I should have also asked for people who have used [[outliners]], such as LogSeq, Roam, Obsidian, Org-mode, my own MORE, ThinkTank and Ready, or others. [[Drummer]] is all about outlining, as I said yesterday -- unabashedly so. We used to be reserved about software centered on outlining, but no more. Send an email or Twitter DM if you're interested in being in the test group. ",
