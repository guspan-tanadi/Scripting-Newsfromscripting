    "text": "I don't want to jinx anything but \"Drummer\" is getting pretty solid. Nothing much will change when the product is available publicly, the process will continue, more fixes and features, more interop. I have a lot of little projects I want to do, all designed to build an open ecosystem of thought tools and their adjuncts. The first verison of Drummer will be a blogging tool and a scripting system. But there will be more of all of it. ",
