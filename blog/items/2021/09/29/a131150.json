    "text": "I hate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Pharmacy\">CVS</a>. I'm constantly getting email promotions from them to my GMail account, and I keep marking it as spam yet they keep coming. Now I'm going to try a filter and see if they can get around that too. Follow up -- the email is not from CVS after all. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/29/cvsSpoof.png\">Look at that</a>. I hate CVS so much, I kind of like that their rep is being trashed by a clever spammer. ",
