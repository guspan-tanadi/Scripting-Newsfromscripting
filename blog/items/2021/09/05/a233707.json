A recent <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> shows that 43 percent of American women are pro-life and 45 percent of men are pro-choice. I thnk everyone should be pro-choice, but it's wrong to blame men for the current situation. ",
