    "text": "Saw a report on the news that Facebook is evil because they enhance pictures on Instagram. A really thin story, so many things other than FB damage people's self-perception based on standards of appearance. CNN does it, for sure in huge ways. The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=brianna+keilar\">anchor</a> reporting the story is a beautful woman, but probably not quite as beautiful has her makeup, hair and lighting people make her seem. I wish they were required to have a constant critic in a window in the upper right corner of the screen, pointing out these hypocrisies.",
