    "text": "Speaking of podcasts, the next Now & Then episode I listened to was great, it was about <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/attacking-and-defending-voting-rights/id1567665859?i=1000533835280\">voting rights in American history</a>. What's happening now is actually fairly typical. There's so much interesting stuff they left out in grade school history, which I used to love, my favorite subject after English. Now I'm wondering where I can take a remedial history class after I go through all the Now & Then episodes, which I'm clearly going to do. I also wonder who's going to do the history of tech with the rigor, curiosity and humor of Richardson and Freeman.",
