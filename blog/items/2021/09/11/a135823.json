    "text": "I get <a href=\"https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/\">Andrew Sullivan's email newsletter</a>. Today's edition was a podcast <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/michael-wolff-on-the-trump-threat/id1536984072?i=1000534947059\">interview</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wolff_(journalist)\">Michael Wolff</a>, who I've met several times. Wolff is a great conversationalist, his writing is irreverent, and he's also very generous personally. The same <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1416791009082712070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1416791009082712070%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwatch-michael-wolff-flip-out-at-cnns-brain-stelter-2021-7\">people dismiss him</a> who dismiss me. So I started <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/michael-wolff-on-the-trump-threat/id1536984072?i=1000534947059\">listening</a> and it's great. I did a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=andrew+sullivan+podcast\">search</a> for \"Andrew Sullivan podcast\" on Google and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dishcast-with-andrew-sullivan/id1536984072\">there it is</a>. Another podcast to check out. I'm going to give it a try.",
