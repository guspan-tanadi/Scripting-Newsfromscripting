    "text": "Drummer has a feature called the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+glossary\">glossary</a>, it's been part of every outliner I have done since the mid-90s. It's a very simple idea. A table that associates terms with text. If I use one of the terms in my writing, when it's published, the term is replaced with the text. We use \"OPML\" to represent the glossaries. Here's my <a href=\"http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/glossary.opml\">personal glossary</a>. I wish every place I type text could be configured to use my glossary, so where ever I go I can use my terms. It would also be great to configure my searches to use these terms too, so Google for example would know what I am referring to when I type the name of one of my own products. ",
