    "text": "The other night I was bored and noticed that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire\">The Wire</a> was on HBO, so I watched one episode. Then another. And another. Later I started at Episode 1. I don't know how many times I've watched <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire\">The Wire</a>. I'm almost at a point where I can recite the lines along with the actors. I've yet to see a flaw in this show, there's nothing I don't follow with rapt attention. I can't believe there are people who haven't seen it. It's as I imagine Shakespeare was in his day.",
