    "text": "The only value in being credited for inventing stuff that became important is if it makes people open to new ideas from me. I've found that people just aren't interested in new ideas from anyone other than say Apple or Elon Musk. A track record doesn't help. Some people who have worked with me think I should be happy that I helped launch their careers. That actually wasn't what I was doing, I was trying to get good ideas into the world. To the extent that you helped I am grateful. What I really care about is if they'll listen and help the next thing I want to do get out there. That is really all that matters. ",
