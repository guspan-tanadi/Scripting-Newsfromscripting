    "text": "I thought of something the other night. I object when people say the Dems will suffer if the Repubs crash the national debt. It's the same way people think I must be unhappy if RSS gets trashed by someone. I don't think I need to be any more offended than you do. The same way when the debt finally is worthless, the US will be poor, and we'll be surprised how far we have to fall, all of us, not just President Biden or Speaker Pelosi. RSS really does not belong to me. I've made no money on it, and have no expectation of it. (I've made a lot more money off Apple stock! Heh.) It's not rigorous to look at limits to this kind of pain. If podcasting were to be owned by Spotify its effect on me would be about the same as the effect on you. I'd either have to pay them, or go without.",
