    "text": "Pet peeve: Being referred to in the past tense, as in \"you were...\" An amazing number of people think of me that way, and not just now, that idea goes back to when I was in my 30s. People have the wrong idea about software. It was possible, when I started, to decide that this is what I'm going to do, the same way a fireman or nurse decides that's what they're going to do. Later I got typecast as the RSS guy. Not really fair, I've spent a lot more time doing programming systems (Frontier), networks (blogging) and networked idea movement (outliners). If there was one technology I'd like to be associated with, it's that. There's only so much you can do with news, and the powers in the news world won't really let you do anything. We had that one brief opening in 2002, when the NYT let us have their feeds, and 2004 when podcasting caught on. So many rich and powerful and huge companies wanted to own it. But for now outlining is wide open. The biggest company can't yet be a bully. I think there's still time to base the market on open formats, and we can have a huge constantly evolving ecosystem, for a few years at least. And once you create the expectation of choice, you can't really get rid of it. We've seen that with podcasting. Amazing that after all this time RSS is still the language of podcasting.  ",
