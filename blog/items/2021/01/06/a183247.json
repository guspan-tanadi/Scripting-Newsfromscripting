It was time for a purge. Saddam had decided to execute the whole legislature. The doors were locked and they started taking out people one by one and shooting them. Saddam, sadist that he was, videotaped it. So you could see what these guys were doing as they figured out, one by one, what was happening. So what did the condemned legislators do while waiting to be shot? They gave speeches, denouncing each other as the real enemy of the state, and proclaiming their love for Saddam, the best friend he ever had. Didn't work, they were all killed.\" They used to have video on the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/\">PBS site</a>, but it was a victim of the deprecation of Flash. If you know of another copy, please send me a pointer. ",
