I saw a similar idea in action with <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research's</a> outliner, and thought it was a really nice idea. I always want to save references to my notes in a cumulative index, like the index in the back of a book. This has always been a good companion to the fluid hierarchy, the outline structure which is more like the table of contents in front of a book. Only when you're working electronically, there isn't really a middle. Everything is in both places, at the same time. It's ideas like this that make programmers' eyes glaze over. They start using words like orthogonal, or loosely connected, and of course the always welcome \"distributed.\" Really having fun programming the last week or so. As the world is falling apart. Why not? It's not like any of us are getting out of this alive. :rocket:",
