    "text": "The best podcasts are the ones with experts who simply share their expertise. So many podcasts begin with a long discussion about how everyone feels, with lots of chuckling and self-praise and inside jokes. No. One. Cares. The first time I noticed this was a podcast about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans\">The Americans</a>, a great show that I loved, with cast members. That's cool. Talk about the characters you play. But I really don't care where you, the actor, grew up. Exceptions are obvious. If you're a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles\">Beatle</a>, go ahead and talk about yourself. If you're <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson\">Jack Nicholson</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep\">Meryl Streep</a>, yes please. I would like to know what makes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Ernst\">Joni Ernst</a> tick. But most experts aren't interesting as people. Your audience is looking to learn something, so teach us. ",
