    "text": "Why do academics and journalists praise other academics and journalists? It's a club. Very often the insights of some brilliant journo or academic are as ordinary as a blogger or some random person on Facebook. But the name of the pub or uni makes what they say Important. I think this is part of why our society is so mediocre. Too much inbreeding. Too much trying to please, without telling what you really see. No one passing on a good idea simply because it is a good idea. There is supposedly a tradition of speaking the truth no matter how much trouble it creates, in both academia and journalism, but in  practice, not really.",
