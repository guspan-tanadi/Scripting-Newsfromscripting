    "text": "John Lennon was the cool Beatle when I was a kid, the poet. A person with deep thoughts. Moody <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/top-10-john-lennon-beatles-songs/\">songs</a>. Norweigian Wood, In My Life, Strawberry Fields. He's had an actor's face, a poet too. A prankster. Paul McCartney was just the commercial guy. Penny Lane, Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, Rocky Racoon, Mother Nature's Son, The Fool on the Hill. All the <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/paul-mccartney-beatles-songs/\">ones</a> you love to sing along with. Let It Be and Hey Jude. As I've gotten older, I still listen to the Beatles, it's been a life-long constant, and I've come to appreciate McCartney more and more. As he sings, there's nothing at all wrong with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzNpso_vDaQ\">silly love songs</a>.",
