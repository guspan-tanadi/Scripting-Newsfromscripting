    "text": "Followup on my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/01/21.html#a140859\">question</a> about why <i>neo</i>-Nazi instead of plain old Nazi and there is an answer. The original Nazis came with a lot of stuff the new ones don't. They had uniforms, a symbol, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nazi_Germany\">flag</a>, a leader and his manifesto. The new Nazis don't have any of that. In Germany the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_memorabilia\">paraphernalia</a> of the old Nazis are illegal. In the US that would be too offensive. There is still a memory of WW II, we remember who the enemy was then. If they walked around with swastika armbands people would know for sure they're the enemy. Maybe at some point they will decloak, but that hasn't happened yet. I thought of putting a swastika in the right margin, but felt that would be too shocking. That's the point. So there is a difference. I got emails from several readers. Thanks!",
