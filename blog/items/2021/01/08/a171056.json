    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lasorda\">Tommy Lasorda</a> is gone. 93 years old. A good run. He was manager of the Dodgers back before I hated them. But I can't say I ever loved them. I had an experience at the World Series vs the Oakland A's where we scalped tickets that turned out to be in the Dodger's wives section. They tried to have us removed, because we were very vocally advocating for the A's. Of course, this was at the Oakland Coliseum. They argued with the cops that we would have been ejected at Dodgers Stadium. You see that's the problem with baseball these days. Decorum. It was never meant to be a respectful sport, imho. Anyway, I digress. Lasorda was a famous manager of a winning team \"back in the day.\" Sigh. We're all getting old and soon we'll be dead. That's what it all means. Oh la. ",
