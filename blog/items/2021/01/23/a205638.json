I wonder why there isn't a database I'm registered in, so data can be gathered on the effectiveness of the vaccine over time and geography, so it can be added to other data to learn more about the virus. I registered for the [%search: Kinsa%] groupware thermometer for that purpose. Millions of people have been vaccinated all over America, but as with everything it's fairly disorganized. I do have an official-looking CDC identification card, but no corresponding web registration.",
