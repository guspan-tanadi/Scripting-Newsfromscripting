    "text": "Many years ago I got interested in massage, meditation, consciousness -- really it was all about being more observant. Looking at everything from different perspectives. I told my fellow explorers, many of whom had been to India, about the great American philosopher, [%search: Yogi Berra%]. Everything he said was about being more conscious! But his sayings were so concise and ironic, they passed for folksy humor. It's all the same thing. My friends <i>loved</i> that he was called Yogi. It sort of wrapped the whole thing in a bow. ",
