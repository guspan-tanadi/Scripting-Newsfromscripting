    "text": "A bunch of museums have made digital scans of their art available for re-use, but they always seem to make you download one image at a time. Sigh. This makes it very labor intensive to create applications that offer new ways to browse art collections. I want to make a nice screen saver, and display it on the big screen in my living room, for me and my guests (when we start having guests again). The <a href=\"https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2021/01/21/over-700000-paintings-from-the-rijksmuseum-online-copyright-free/\">latest</a> to do this is the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. So I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1352321597370101760\">asked</a> on Twitter if anyone had downloaded a large number of the paintings, and it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoodBrain/status/1352352014315909120\">turns out</a> <a href=\"https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/10/19/the-rijksmuseum-as-bittorrent.html\">someone has</a>! Thank goodness. Will report. ",
