    "text": "I read in a NY Times op-ed that we have to tax the rich to pay for pandemic relief. Not an income tax, which most would support, but an asset tax. So if your house has increased in value, you have to give the government money. Even if you didnâ€™t sell it. There is no rule that you have to pay for the relief btw. The government prints money. There is no inflation, kind of the opposite pressure on the economy, weâ€™re in a depression. Part of the reason for relief is to stimulate the economy. So a wealth tax could cause a stock market crash, Iâ€™m sure economic advisers would warn the president. All those rich people selling stock to pay the trillions in tax. Maybe we should tax people who write stupid op-ed in the NY Times instead. ðŸ¤ª",
