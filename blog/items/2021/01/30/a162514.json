In the meantime, I solved the problem with the crappy UI for the LG screen I bought <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv\">last month</a>. I bought the top-of-the-line <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08Q34DRLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Roku device</a>, plugged it in, and it gives the same great picture, and lets me control everything from the much more <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html\">elegant Roku remote</a>. I loaded on all the apps I need, including Fubo, which is not available for the LG, and after a few hours I realized why the Roku remote is so superior. There are so few buttons, and they're big enough, that I don't have to look at the remote to operate the UI. This is important for a TV where you use it in a dark room, ideally. Roku is the best. People say it's dated, I think it's really that it works, and that's what I want. ;-)",
