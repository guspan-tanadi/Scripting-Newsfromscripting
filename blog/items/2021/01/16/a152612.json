    "text": "People are actually commenting on Twitter about how much nicer it is now that Trump is gone. There's a secret lesson buried in that experience. If everyone who found him disgusting blocked him the same effect couldâ€™ve happened much sooner. It's fairly analogous to the virus. It would go away in three weeks if everyone social distanced and wore a mask. Instead, people have Christmas and New Years celebrations, as normal, and we all pay the price, with surging infections in January. On Twitter we're all obsessed with what other people should do, but there's something you can do. You can unfollow and block the trolls. Cut off their path to infect others with rage and confusion. We got played, bigtime. People were conned into helping Trump, as they foolishly believed they were resisting him. <a href=\"http://this.how/trolls\">Trolls</a> don't change, but we can. ",
