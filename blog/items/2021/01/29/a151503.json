    "text": "When I was in <a href=\"https://www.bxscience.edu/\">high school</a> a bunch of us asked to be excused from class at the same time. We went to the bathroom and flushed all the toilets at once. We figured the plumbing system hadn't been designed for that. The moral of the story is our whole system is designed that way. The stock market, the political system, the police, health care, the national guard. With 300 million people in the US, we could overload and destroy any system on any day, by coordinated action. That we <i>don't</i> do it is a key feature of civilization. ",
