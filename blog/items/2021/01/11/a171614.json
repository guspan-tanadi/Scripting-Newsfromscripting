Re this <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-trump-supporters-turned-one-mild-mannered-dc-lawyer-into-the-angry-guyonporch/2021/01/07/384be64c-5106-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html\">profile</a> of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRKveronica/status/1347002291249770496\">GuyOnPorch and WomanInCar</a> meme that became viral. Let me set the stage. The guy on the porch is an older white man. He's screaming obscenities at MAGAs (off-camera) telling them to get the fuck out of DC. Then the camera swings to a black woman in her car, and she's kind of astonished to see the white man saying what she was thinking. And she said so. I cried watching it. Later in the profile they said something that grabbed me. “Humphries was stunned that it was this 60-year-old White man speaking her truth. Their truth.” I wanted to give them both a big hug. We need to get our shit together. It's not just her truth and his truth, it's the truth of America. We love this country. And that means we love each other. For real. ",
