    "text": "Trump doesn't need Twitter, he could just use a blog. If he did, there would be pathways for people to find out he updated, and software that would let his followers read his latest messages, in reverse chronological order. There would be no Twitter to shut him down. Now, I'm not sure where he could go to get the blog hosted. I wonder if Blogger and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/11/messageFromWordpress.png\">Wordpress</a> et al have considered what they'd do if he started a blog in either of those places. Thing to know is \"RSS\" is a lot easier to deploy than a Twitter-like system, and it could be distributed. We looked at lots of those things in the heyday of [%search: Napster%] to route around the music industry. I hate that I'm helping Trump be the monster he is, but I feel obligated to share this with my followers, who probably want to think about real-world applications of distributed internet technology.
