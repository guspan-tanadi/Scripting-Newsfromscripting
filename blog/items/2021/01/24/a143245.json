    "text": "Yes I know these rants don't accomplish anything. At some point it has to stop. When I ran a startup in the 80s I remember trying to visualize the last day there, but I couldn't. Then one day I realized I had left, and I didn't even remember the last day. Like the last time I saw my mother, or an old girlfriend -- I don't remember most of those days either. But I do remember the day Trump took office. And I remember marching, and wondering if it would do any good. Like the rants I write today. Anyway one thing is for sure, we won't get many more chances to fix the country. I believe I know the answer -- look to the left and right not up or down. We don't have to unite with the miscreant Republicans in Congress. Most of them work for Moscow. We have to connect with other Americans who vote against democracy. This is not optional. So it's important to remember that and think of things we can do to shake ourselves out of our ruts and get out in the streets, figuratively and literally. ",
