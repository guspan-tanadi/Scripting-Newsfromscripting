Your participation helps keep COVID-19 vaccines safe â€” for you and for everyone.\" This answers the question I asked <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/01/23.html#a205638\">yesterday</a>, why aren't they staying in touch with vaccinated people. There is a system in place, apparently, I just didn't know about it. Now I do, and so do you. :boom: ",
