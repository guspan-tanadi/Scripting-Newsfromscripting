What will be 'normal' five years from now?\" I commented: It's a good thing we stopped doing that. I only took one plane trip myself in the couple of years leading up to 2020. it was shocking, after being away for so long, how much carbon was burned for so little reason. we have to stop having this \"carbon party\" -- and the virus gave us a new perspective for that. It's a total silver lining. BTW I was already living in the country when I took the trip. I was going to Austin, and flew through Albany NY, which is a very small airport compared to the bay area or NY. But I had to make a connection in O'Hare, and that's when it hit me how ridiculous this was. I was going to a conference that could just as easily have been held online. It will be held online from now on, I expect (and hope). I guess what this means is that where you park your ass makes a much bigger difference now than it used to. The people you have personal contact with will be the ones who live where you do. Everyone else will be virtual. Long distance travel will be a luxury.",
