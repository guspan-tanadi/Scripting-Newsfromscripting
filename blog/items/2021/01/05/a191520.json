I don't know who designs these things, but did they think that I, a sentient human being of 65 years and many accomplishments would appreciate being labeled as such by a fucking <i>algorithm?</i> This is right up there with <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/05/12/whyIMovedOffHeroku.html\">Heroku</a> telling me (again via algorithm) that I am a \"hobbyist\" developer. Excuse me. I have a MS in Computer Science from a fine <a href=\"https://www.wisc.edu/\">school</a>. I have won awards for my software, and invented many things, probably as many as anyone at your <a href=\"http://salesforce.com/\">fine company</a>, so please keep your opinion of my programming ability to your robot self. Sincerely, Dave Winer, a master of science. ",
