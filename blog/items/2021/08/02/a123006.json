I am too young to have been a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_DiMaggio\">Joe DiMaggio</a> fan, and I never loved the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees\">Yankees</a> (ugh) but I know what it feels like to be missing a hero. Where is <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/02/15/172451.html?title=mcneilTheJeremyLinOfTheNyt\">Donald McNeil</a>? The [[Covid]] crisis is still with us. We knew it wasn't going away that easily. If the [[NYT]] hadn't canned him, I'm sure he would have told us that. Now what? We miss him. At least this former Daily podcast listener turn our lonely eyes to him. Where is his Twitter account? How about a weekly podcast with him and someone to play the role of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barbaro\">Michael Barbaro</a>, an interested neophyte to represent us, to quiz the hardened Old Man of Covid, [[Donald McNeil]]? A weekly commentary on what's going on with Covid. That's a [[podcast]] I'd pay money for, if only for the peace of mind and the chance that his wisdom will save my life, and the lives of others.",
