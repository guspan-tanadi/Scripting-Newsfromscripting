    "text": "I'm reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)\">Player Piano</a>, Kurt Vonnegut's first novel. I probably read it before, but didn't remember. It's a slog unlike later Vonnegut novels. This was Vonnegut before he was Vonnegut. His writing is very relaxed, American, and irreverent. And very much his. If he wants to go to some weird place in his story-telling he just goes there. I think the peak of this was Breakfast of Champions which was about a character he invented (of course all fiction is) but he writes about <i>how</i> he invented him, and why. It's hard to explain. But in Player Piano, he's sticking to the basics of novel-writing. Only hints of a Vonnegutisms to come in later writing.  It's dull and my mind wanders while reading it. I guess that's the thing about later Vonnegut writing. He gets your full attention while you're reading. More than other writers. ",
