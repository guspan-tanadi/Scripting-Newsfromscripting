    "text": "\"Drummer\" testing is going well, still more features in development, but it is pretty stable. So I'm looking for more people to join the test group. I'm looking for people with either blogging experience or scripting experience, best if you have both, and even better if you've done development in Frontier. Think of [[Drummer]] as the continuation of the blogging work we were doing at [[UserLand]] before we took the turn toward [[Manila]] and [[Radio]]. Drummer is unabashedly about the [[outliner]]. It's the most fluid way to write, and I want to hook it up to as many rendering engines as possible, using open protocols, as possible. I see outlines as the center of the writer's universe, but you already knew that if you read my blog. Send an email or DM on Twitter if you're interested. Not guaranteeing access, and not saying when. We're still a ways from opening up to the public. ",
