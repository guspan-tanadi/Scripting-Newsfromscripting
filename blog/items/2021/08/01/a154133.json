    "text": "The monthly ritual is complete. Here's the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/07.opml\">OPML for July 2021</a>. And just for fun, I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/scriptingNewsArchiveInOpmlFromMay2017.zip\">zipped up</a> an archive going back to May 2017, when I deployed my \"new\" content management system. It's all a matter of perspective I guess. 2017 seems to me like a short time ago, but then a lot has happened in the interim. Some of it is in the contents of the blog. I think some interesting apps could be built using this archive as a seed. So far there haven't been any takers that I know of, but I think we may be getting close with all the [[tools for thought]] activity. ",
