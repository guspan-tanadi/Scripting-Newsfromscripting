    "text": "A number of years ago I wrote about the importance of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/03/27/submission.html\">submission</a>. No point fighting some things. I also was learning at the time that there is nothing you think of, that has to do with values, that isn't projection. Science is different, using your senses and intellect to draw inferences. But opinions and values, is just you broadcasting everything you feel to everyone in the world. But really it's an audience of one, you. Combine the two, and years later I realize that submission to yourself must come before submission to another. Give up the struggles between who you feel you should be and who you actually are. If you submit to yourself, you can stop worrying about that. :smile:",
