    "text": "Something about [[tagging]] has been bugging me and I think I just figured it out. Suppose you have a topic that's starting to develop, and you want to hijack its links to redirect to a page that includes more information than just a scrolling list of references. Well I have <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/06/24/150234.html?title=theGlossaryInLittleOutliner\">the glossary</a> for that, I just realized. I can override what double-square brackets means for a certain term, have it link to a page which also has a list of the references. Boom and bing. Do they have these overrides at \"logseq\" and other [[tools for thought]] products?",
