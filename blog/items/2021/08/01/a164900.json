    "text": "I watched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_Purple_(film)\">The Color Purple</a> on HBO last night. I'm looking for ways to learn what black people say about the black experience in America through history. It was a weird choice, because, even though the actors are black, it was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg_filmography\">Steven Spielberg movie</a>, like ET or Jaws. Always upbeat, even when a husband is raping his sister-in-law. The weirdest thing to have Indiana Jones type music playing while Oprah Winfrey is being beaten by a mob of white men. So bizarre. But I loved all the actors, esp of course Whoopi Goldberg, and there was at times a bit of suspension of disbelief, but the Spielbergishness of the movie was very awkard. ",
