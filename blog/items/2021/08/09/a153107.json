It's a beautiful story, and Walker has such a beautiful voice, oddly I find myself narrating my own story in my head in her voice. The book is in the form of letters between two sisters, who lead very different intertwined lives starting in the early 20th century. This has been so far a year where I have let black authors speak to me of the black perspective on life in America. I'm going to continue this exploration. ",
