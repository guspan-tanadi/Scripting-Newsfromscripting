I liked it. It's quick, only about three hours. It's a Sorkin-like show, like <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-west-wing\">The West Wing</a> or <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-newsroom\">The Newsroom</a>, fast dialog. Fun and really pulls on the heartstrings. There's cute smart little girl, and a timely plot of a second-tier Ivy League school that reminded me that campuses can be interesting places to hang out. I gave it a 4 of 5 <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-chair-2021\">on BingeWorthy</a>. ",
