    "text": "I'm starting to get some concrete ideas on what to tag and what not to tag. In the piece about Rick and Morty, above, I tagged the name of the show. I did not tag the names of the shows I compared it to. In the post about the Olympics gold medal game, I tagged the Brooklyn Nets, because I have an issue with them, and that issue a pivotal reason I didn't love the US Olympic team as much as I would have if they were more of a team. The Nets aren't a team either, maybe they will at some point. We're going to keep watching them, so I think there's a reasonably good chance I'll write about them again and again in this same context. They're an ongoing thread on my blog. And I have an issue with the Olympics, so I tagged them too. I did not tag any of these things in this post, but I did tag [[tagging]], because that's what this is about. ðŸ’¥",
