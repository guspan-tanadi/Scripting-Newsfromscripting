    "text": "I got to watch the second half of last night's gold medal game between France and the US. Something strange happened, almost immediately I was rooting for France, because the USA team reminded me of the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. A team formed quickly with star NBA players for the sole purpose of winning a championship. The French team, on the other hand, while they had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert\">star</a> or two from the NBA, and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier\">future</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ntilikina\">former</a> Knick, practiced together for quite some time, and had the fluidity that comes from being a team. The American all-stars did not. But they did have [[Kevin Durant]], and that made the difference. He is an awesome talent, maybe the best to ever play the game, certainly in the top ten. And the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/06/sports/olympic-basketball-usa-france\">USA did win</a>, and I can't say I'm sad about that, because I'm a nephew of Uncle Sam, but I did like the spirit of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_men%27s_national_basketball_team#2020_Olympic_roster\">French team</a>, and I would have been happy if they won. I am not a fan of the [[Olympics]]. I think they are playing for NBC and their advertisers, and I also think they should have one great venue for summer and winter, and stop all the waste. We have to change the way we run our civilization, or we won't have a civilization. ",
