    "text": "[[Rick and Morty]] -- one of the best <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty\">TV series</a> ever. It had barely registered with me until about a week ago, when I, in a fit of boredom, decided to give it a try. I was hooked almost from the beginning. Rick, Morty's grandfather, has spent his life exploring the universe, and has a really depraved sense of everything, but he also loves to party. Morty, who is high school age, sort of puts up with Rick, and he always has issues with him. Every episode has at least a couple of really novel and funny scifi themes involving alien civilizations who are truly weird, and horrible situations Rick gets them into. It's like a lot of sitcoms, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeymooners\">Honeymooners</a> for example, where Rick is Ralph Cramden and Morty is Ed Norton. Or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Lucy\">I Love Lucy</a> where Rick is Lucy and Morty is Ethel Mertz. Or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad\">Breaking Bad</a> where Rick is Walter White and Morty is Jesse Pinkman. It is LOL funny almost every episode. The people who do this show are off the scale creative. How do they keep thinking up these things? So perverse, sexual, vain, moronic, pathetic, depraved, mean, evil, pointless -- all the funniest crazy things we laugh at humanity over. I'm just through season 2, there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_episodes\">five seasons</a>. Archive is on HBO and <a href=\"https://showrss.info/show/44.rss\">other</a> places. Season 5 is on <a href=\"https://www.adultswim.com/\">Adult Swim</a>. ",
