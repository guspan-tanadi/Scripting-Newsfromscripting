    "text": "I'd say \"Bingeworthy\" didn't work. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/23/bingeworthyScreen.png\">Nice software</a>, but the goal was to keep an easy to find <a href=\"http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/\">public list</a> of shows I recommend, and those that my friends recommend. A couple of weeks ago I discovered, entirely on my own, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty\">Rick and Morty</a>. I loved it from the first scene in the first epsiode. I started telling everyone I know how great it is, and with few exceptions they said \"old news Dave.\" They loved the show since it started in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_episodes#Season_1_(2013%E2%80%9314)\">2013</a>. Why did I struggle for years to find something great to watch when Rick and Morty was out there. I'm sure there are a dozen other delicious shows I don't know about, and it's only getting worse. What is the answer? It seems like a simple problem to solve, yet it evades an answer.  ",
