But none of the talking heads will call for this because they all depend on a good relationship with the cable system owners. A very deep conflict of interest, across the board. It's like software devs can't afford to piss off Google or Apple, or else they'll figure out a way to kick them out of their app stores. There was a famous slogan at Microsoft back in the day, \"No version of DOS will ship until Lotus doesn't run.\" I'm sure it was just a joke. :smile:",
