I think we're doing the wise thing in NY state. It's easy to put a mask on, much easier than being intubated and dying. The peaches are the best part of the year except for the apple harvest. On the other hand at the hardware store, I was the only one wearing a mask. So maybe it's not <i>all</i> peaches yet. ",
