It's interesting that [[Jack Dorsey]] who is also the founder and CEO of a big successful payments company, can't get it together for Twitter to verify the identity of users in a routine way.The post office does it using credit cards. I can have my mail forwarded simply by paying them $1 with a credit card that has the address being forwarded from as its registered address. BTW, I got verified myself a few years back by doing nothing. They sent me an email saying they know who I am and that the account I registered really is me, so they went ahead and gave me the blue checkmark. I'm sure Dorsey et al know how valuable that asset is for them, and the people who have them. ",
