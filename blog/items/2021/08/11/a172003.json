    "text": "I've been looking for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html\">this piece</a> forever. It was part of my blog that was wiped out in the transition in May 2017 from <a href=\"http://1999.io/\">1999.io</a> to Electric Outliner and [[Old School]]. I finally had the thought to look in my previous editing system and there it was. I said this: <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html\">I want my old blog back</a>. I decided that all the crazy michegas in trying to make Twitter, Medium, Facebook, the defunct [[Google Reader]] that still limited what we could do with blogs, from its grave, to make all those work with my writing -- it wasn't worth it. All these limits amounted to there was nothing I could write that would make even a small subset of them happy. And no links, titles, bold, italic, or podcasts. Fuck you Facebook. What a bad netizen they are. And Twitter, although I love it, it's fucked up too. They support every damn type, video, audio, gifs, whatever -- except HTML text. What the fuck Jack. I'm out of patience with Twitter too. So in May 2017 I broke free of all that bullshit. And now four-plus years later, I'm getting ready to do more. ",
