    "text": "Debuggers aren't only for debugging, they're also programmer's way of looking inside the body of the software. We can stop the heart beat and look anywhere we want. We can put our attention in any organ we want. Or more than one at a time. It's how you can watch the organism doing its work, if you forget how it works because you wrote it a long time ago, or if someone else wrote it. If you aren't using a debugger in all aspects of your programming work you're limiting the amount of complexity you can deal with in your code.",
