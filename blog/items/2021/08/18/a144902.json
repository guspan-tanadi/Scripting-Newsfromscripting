A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1427976153164390405\">thread</a> followed. Text on rails is something you have to see. One incorrect thing people say about outliners is that they are strict hierarchies, but it's not true. The structure the outline manages is dynamic. Things move. It may look hierarchic but over time it's infinitely fluid, it can be anything you want.",
