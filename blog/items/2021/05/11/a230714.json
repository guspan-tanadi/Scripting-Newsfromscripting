But Trump says he won. A fair number of people agree. Some work in law enforcement. Let this fester a few more months. There will be a \"controversy\" about who the \"real\" president is. I said Trump will pardon him. Who will do what about that? How many days of fake rage will this generate on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, etc. No one seems to grasp the kind of twisted horror show American politics is becoming. Also, what happens if a Democratic senator dies. It's good to have programmers around. We are paid to think of the worst thing that could possibly happen. ",
