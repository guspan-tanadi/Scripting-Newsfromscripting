    "text": "I don't know why I continue to watch <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_episodes#Season_4_(2021)\">Handmaid's Tale</a>. It's the most ridiculously written show. Every scene is more ridiculous than the one before it. People keep changing their minds. One scene a character is in Toronto, safe from Gilead, then they show up in Chicago at the front, in the closing scene, meant as some kind of cliffhanger, I suppose. What is she doing in Chicago the writers must have thought we'd all be wondering. Can't wait till the next episode. Knowing there will be no good reason other than she felt she belonged there or some stupid shit like that. Aunt Lydia is a big power broker in Gilead, even though she's one of hundreds of aunts and a loser, and ridiculous. June Osborne keeps ranking on her. No explanation why this aunt is the new boss, except that she's played by one of the stars of the show. I should've stopped watching it a long time ago. But I obviously hate myself enough to keep going.",
