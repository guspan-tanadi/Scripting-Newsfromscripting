    "text": "At one point I thought I'd have a <a href=\"http://chat.scripting.com/\">chat app</a> adjacent to Scripting News, so I wrote a little bot that cross-posted everything I write <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">here</a>, over <a href=\"http://chat.scripting.com/\">there</a>. Just for fun I took a look at the chatbot, it's still running, and has every post I've written for the last year, including images. It's kind of nice when something you wrote that you never look at just scales up fine. I've written so much software like this over the years. I guess I must like to write software? :rocket: ",
