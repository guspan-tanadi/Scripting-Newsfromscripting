In turn, I thanked him for his many contributions, and for politely telling the people who wanted to destroy him to fuck off. We need more people to refuse to go away just because an internet mob demands it of them. Imagine if <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Donald+McNeil\">Donald McNeil</a> had said that to his bosses at the NY Times. They never did tell us why he had to go. And every time something puzzling happens with Covid I think of how they betrayed our trust, not that they care what we think. Clearly they don't. Imho, the only reason to keep the NYT around is to tell us the truth about what's really going on. Well, firing McNeil was something we never did hear the truth about. And I'm not forgetting it. ",
