    "text": "I had another conversation a few days ago, on Twitter Spaces, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clemensv\">Clemens Vasters</a> who works on standards at Microsoft. It was like the conversation with Taylor Lorenz, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/05/02.html#a125604\">above</a>. There was a brief period when I was involved with the standards groups, but mostly it turns out, it was to either transfer the power to evolve the formats and protocols without my further involvement with SOAP, or to fail to convince them to go with \"RSS\". Instead they tried to overtake RSS with another format, it failed, as I tried to tell them it would. Many years later, I hear there's a kind of reverence for RSS, its strength is amazing to them. But why should it be any less resilient than say HTML? Both are proof that the market creates these things, not the big tech companies. Honesly most of what they do in my experience is <i>destructive</i> to standards. Anyway if we're into interop now, maybe there's something more to be done here. I have three formats I am caring for -- OPML, XML-RPC and of course RSS. ",
