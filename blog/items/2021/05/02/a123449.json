It's the kind of story <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO\">HBO</a> excels at, they have a deep library of shows like this, many of which I've never seen. Unfortunately <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarnerMedia\">HBO's owners</a> decided that this unique library doesn't deserve to stand alone. They used its name to host a cheap Netflix clone called HBO Max, and filled it with crap, among which the HBO gems are buried. Sorry I know some people like superhero movies, I used to, but there's a glut and they're all the same, I can't watch any of them. I just want a simple interface for the HBO library. I guess the message is that HBO had no future, so let's just use what goodwill remains to throw a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass\">Hail Mary pass</a> at Netflix. Meanwhile Apple seems to be aiming for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586\">position</a> HBO used to own., ",
