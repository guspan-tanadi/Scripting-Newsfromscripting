Basically someone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artfridakahlo\">takes</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artistrivera\">responsibility</a> for a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artistokeeffe\">famous</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artlichtenstein\">artist</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArtistDaVinci\">uploads</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cezanneart\">scans</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vangoghartist\">their</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artistgauguin\">paintings</a> and drawings to Twitter. Seems to be catching on. My Node app reads those accounts periodically and downloads the images into a local folder, which I then point my Mac screen saver at. I have it running on a Mac Mini hooked up to my 65 inch screen in the living room. The result? Art show! I love this stuff. I'm going to hook the app up to a GitHub repo, so people can sync to that. We have such a wealth of art, and huge numbers of screens and good networks. Why not use them this way? The art is sooo beautful. Makes me happy. ",
