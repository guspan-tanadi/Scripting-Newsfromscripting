He asked for a profile picture, I didn't have a good one, so I took this selfie yesterday. He wanted me to smile. This is something that usually I have trouble with in pictures, I get self-conscious, my smiles look phony -- because they are. I am not happy being photographed, I feel trapped.  ",

If I didn't know Guy, I never would have gotten an early machine. The Mac was the perfect platform for our \"idea processor\" -- it attracted just the kind of people who would understand outliners. People who think, organize, analyze, do things. And Apple needed our software, Guy could see that. ",
