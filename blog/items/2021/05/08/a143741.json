    "text": "The reason <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elizabeth-warren-book-persist-campaign-memoir-2020.html\">Warren's campaign failed</a> is that once she was the frontrunner and people got a good look at her, they didn’t like her. She’s kind of what you’d expect, a <a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10935/Warren\">Harvard professor</a>. They do well at the top of academia, but don’t have a popular touch, and I’m being generous. Certainly there was some sexism, people who wouldn't vote for a woman under any circumstances, but she became the frontrunner with everyone aware of her gender. A woman candidate could have won the nomination in my opinion, someone like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a> or Michigan governor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer\">Gretchen Whitmer</a>. It's ridiculous to conclude that a woman couldn't get the nomination, esp since the Democratic nominee in 2016 was a woman. If Warren wants to be president she's going to have to listen to people outside her bubble. People who will, as they say, speak truth to power. ",
