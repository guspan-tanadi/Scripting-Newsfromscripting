    "text": "Following up on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/05/11.html#a164404\">yesterday's thread</a> about integrating \"LO2\" with Obsidian, an idea promoted by SMS. He said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sabre23t/status/1392115762358276097\">he expected</a> that putting a word inside two &lsqb;[square brackets]] would open a page full of links to that word within my outline. This is a very important point, and one I want to focus on. I actually put that feature into the outliner I currently use to write my blog, when I saw how they were doing things in &lsqb;[Roam]] and &lsqb;[wikis]]. I will ship that for sure, it's a good thing, I'm using it myself. But! It would be so much better if all these tools worked together in an open web of these things. That's the way I think about it. Remember, I led the development of &lsqb;[RSS]] in its early years. I always wanted outlines to be <i>world</i> outlines, ie to include content from other outlines all over the web. I've <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+%22world+outline%22\">written</a> a lot about that. In that context, I should be integrating with a <i>world wide</i> service that integrates lots of tools into a database of linked material. Roam insists that you use their editor, which is abhorrent to me, I will never support that, where Obsidian takes the open web approach. So the question I throw back to SMS and others is how can we set things up so a &lsqb;[bracketed]] reference works with the <i>world wide link manager.</i> We can do this. The technology is totally here. It sounds like &lsqb;[Obsidian]] is off to a good start. ",
