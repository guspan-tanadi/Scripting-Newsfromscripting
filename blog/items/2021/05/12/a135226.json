Any Republican who at this time stands for the rule-of-law and the Constitution deserves our support. We may disagree on everything but these basics. We can respect them because we agree on everyone's right to participate in our government. We have this cause in common, to make sure the fascists and would-be slave owners go back into hiding. We have a terrible history to overcome. Another way of looking at it -- Cheney might be one of a small number of Republicans in Congress who aren't owned by Russia. ",
