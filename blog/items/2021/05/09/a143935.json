I saw her on TV during the campaign, and this idea hit me square between the eyes, she's talking to us like we're in the <a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/\">faculty</a> lounge at Harvard Law School. Very top down. Center of the universe, only this isn't a good image to project to voters. They want to feel feel understood, which is weird because the candidate is doing the talking. HLS faculty make good <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_justices\">Supreme Court justices</a>, not presidents. We had one with Obama. And he was funnier than Warren. She's got a real mean streak. Not good for someone who wants to lead the Free World. Clearly they understood this problem when she launched her campaign, because they presented her as a down home single mom from Oklahoma. She may have been that at one time, but that's not who she is today. ",
