    "text": "Having written so much about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/12/paywallsAreLookingBackward.html\">paywalls</a> and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled\">subscriptions</a>, it was a big deal for me that yesterday <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/a-better-way-to-publish-and-read-on-twitter.html\">Twitter announced</a> that they had acquired [%search: Scroll%], a company that was founded to fix those problems, if only enough news publishers agreed. That's the chicken that's waiting for the egg, etc. It's possible that Twitter can make the difference, the same way the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/martinLeavesTheTimes.html\">NYT made the difference for RSS</a> in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html\">2002</a>. That's what gives life to a standard. An entity so central to an economy, like NYT was to news in 2002, getting behind an independently developed format or protocol. With RSS it was an instant hit. It would be better imho if the NYT had bought Scroll and put its subscription function behind it. Would have also made sense for the Washington Post to do it, esp with Bezos as the owner. No question Amazon would know how to monetize this so as to eliminate the stifling ideas of paywalls and subscriptions. But Twitter is what we got. There was a <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/a-better-way-to-publish-and-read-on-twitter.html\">post</a> from them yesterday that spelled out the vision. I wish them, and us, lots of luck, because the current economic system for news is untenable. Maybe Twitter can make the difference.",
