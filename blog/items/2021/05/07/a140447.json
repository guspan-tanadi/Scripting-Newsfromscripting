    "text": "I listened to another Kawasaki podcast, an interview with <a href=\"https://guykawasaki.com/mark-manson/\">Mark Manson</a>, a deliberately foul-mouthed young man. They talked about people's legacies. I don't doubt that people want to leave something behind, but as I've aged, I've come to an unorthodox view of this. With <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\">8 billion</a> people on the planet, if we all succeed at leaving something of ourselves behind, what a fucking mess that would be! Some of these behind-leavings will cancel each other out. And others will be horribly misguided, they'll be exactly the wrong thing to leave behind. A better approach, imho, is to do things that please you, and others. Be kind. Help people. And whatever is left behind, incidentally, from that all that, is what you leave behind. Don't consciously try to change the world. Just do your thing. I'm not perfect about this. I would like to see what I've written, both in software and prose, survive me. They won't take up a lot of space. And, in all likelihood <i>none</i> of it will survive me, I'm aware of that. What can I do but shrug? Even so, I'm <i>still diggin!</i>",
