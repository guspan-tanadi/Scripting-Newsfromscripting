Sending me on a five mile loop to go somewhere that's less than 1/2 mile away. This is new behavior. I wonder if it is related to my blog not supporting <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">HTTPS</a>. (That was a joke, but it could happen. Their search index for my blog gets worse all the time. And I believe that <i>is</i> punishment for not obeying their edict.)",
