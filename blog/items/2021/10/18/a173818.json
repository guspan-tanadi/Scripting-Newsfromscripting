    "text": "I was pretty sure the Dodgers would crush the Braves, but wow, the Braves are up 2-0. Gotta love it. I'm sorry if you're a Dodgers fan, but I was born in Brooklyn and people such as myself don't forget. I also remember when <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mlb-overturns-utley-supension-breaking-tejada-leg-article-1.2554514\">Chase Utley broke the leg</a> of the Mets shortstop during the 2015 playoffs. I also remember when I sat in scalped seats during the World Series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_World_Series\">in 1988</a>, in the Dodgers wives' section and they tried to get us thrown out for rooting for the A's who won, btw. I really feel justified in hating the Dodgers, but honestly even if I wasn't, I would still hate them. :boom:",
