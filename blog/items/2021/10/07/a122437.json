    "text": "It's a fitting moment to flip the switch, because [[Drummer]] will open the doors for a new <i>fluid</i> style of blogging, based on outlining. To create a post, you click the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/07/bigplusicon.png\">big plus icon</a> and start typing. When you're ready to publish, choose a menu command. No more slogging your way through Wordpress menus or a static site generator. It all happens in a second or two. And making a change to your blog is as easy as making the change in your outline, and publishing -- again -- just one command and a couple of seconds. Welcome to the world where [[tools for thought]] meets publishing. Blogging at the speed of thought. Where nothing gets in your way.",
