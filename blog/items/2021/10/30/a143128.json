I saw one for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy\">NJ governor Murphy</a> running for re-election, but the speakers in the commercial are voters, saying what they want and at the end <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovMurphy\">Murphy</a> says he agrees with all of it. That's a great commercial. It's great because it says something about our political system that we often forget. We are the government in the US, the people are. Show that you get it not with words but with actions. ",
