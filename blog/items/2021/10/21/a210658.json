    "text": "I think some people who read this blog think I'm a beast. I imagine it's because I say what I believe directly and with conviction? Maybe that makes you uncomfortable. I don't like that people make that kind of assumption about me. I'm kind and generous. I work for people for free, and I do a lot of work that way. I don't want their money, I want their creativity, courage, imagination, their minds and time. Maybe they think because I'm so stupid as to give them my work for free that I'm stupid. I don't know, but people should think about it. If you've judged me as being a jerk, who else have you got it wrong about?",
