    "text": "I'm watching <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/\">Succession</a> from the beginning, just to see how all the michegas got started. Seeing the first appearances of all the characters. The special relationship with <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/succession-roman-gerri-relationship-timeline.html\">Roman and Gerri</a> is flirtatious from the first meeting. Cousin Greg plays a starring role in the first few episodes. And my friend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton\">Nick Denton</a> is in the show, via proxy, only this version of Denton gets revenge over the rich capitalists who were tormenting him (no spoilers beyond that). Season 3 of Succession started last Sunday, it's just getting better all the time. One of the best TV series ever. ",
