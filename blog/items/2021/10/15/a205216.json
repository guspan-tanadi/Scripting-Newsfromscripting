    "text": "A friend asked if it was true that Spotify now owns podcasting. They read something in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/03/wiredWebIsDeadFreeGift.png\">Wired</a> that said they did. They're idiots. Or trying to get clicks. Or maybe they're idiots <i>and</i> they're trying to get clicks. Anyway -- no, Spotify does not own podcasting. As long as people say \"subscribe where ever you get your podcasts\" at the end of their podcast you have nothing to worry about. I'm not even going to link to the Wired article. ",
