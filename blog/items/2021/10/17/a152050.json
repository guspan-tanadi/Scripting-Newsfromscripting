    "text": "BTW, when I say a Linux version -- I mean an exact clone. The benchmark is whether it runs my software, not that it's a cool project. With these things it's the base of apps that matters. I think the language designers at big companies have lost the tune. The apps are what matters. That's why I program in JavaScript -- it's where all the code is. And that's why projects like <a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/what-is-deno/\">Deno</a> (A different arrangement of N O D and E) are such a bad idea. And deprecating the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/request\">request</a> verb? Only the most commonly called function the whole fricking language. Deprecated!! Someone has lost their sense of what matters. It's as if one day they decided the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tappan_Zee_Bridge_(2017%E2%80%93present)\">Tappan Zee Bridge</a> is too cool to drive cars over, so we'll require people to convert their cars so that the wheels are inside and the seats are outside. Always going backward is a good way to never get anywhere. BTW the Tappan Zee Bridge Is a beautiful bridge. It carries exactly the same traffic the old one did. ",
