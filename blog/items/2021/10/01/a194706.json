Skirting the question: \"private from whom?\" Google can <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519491117000\">read</a> every word no matter how much encryption there might be. The press loves to rail on Facebook, but I gotta say Google is dug in deeper than FB. And for some reason they escape the scrutiny of journalists.",
