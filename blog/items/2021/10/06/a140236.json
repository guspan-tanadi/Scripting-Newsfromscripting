The tech industry organized the people around its values, which they were very <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/people-at-obamas-tech-dinner-2011-2\">open</a> about. The Dems could've done it. Any news org could have. I begged them to do it, publicly and privately. Everyone who's complaining now, news people and politicians, punted, had no idea what FB did was possible, didn't listen when they were told. If they wanted their values represented, they should have done it themselves. That's how this works.",
