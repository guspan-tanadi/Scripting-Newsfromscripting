    "text": "it was asked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1454845999818678272\">on Twitter</a> why people don't like LeBron. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1454905160614957060\">My two cents</a>. He's not a friendly looking guy, like Melo for example. Also once you win two championships, you're just showing off. It's like leaving your starters in during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_time\">garbage time</a> and they do fancy trick plays. After a time you think why not just sit down. That's LeBron. You're right it isn't fair, but that's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTsoZbRb_ow\">the way</a> it goes. ",
