    "text": "Meanwhile the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%9322_New_York_Knicks_season\">2021-22 Knicks</a> are the exact opposite of a superteam. Every player either a rookie or a medium-tier mid-career player, and a couple of players in their 30s, on the second squad. A few of the young players are potential stars. All of them achieving far beyond expectations, and are growing together as a team. They are fun to watch and root for. It's a team, not a group of stars. That's the thing to aspire to, people making each other better. Not a balance sheet that's expected to win everything. Where's the fun in that.",
