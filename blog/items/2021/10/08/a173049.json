    "text": "BTW, Anton got on my case about a bug in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=links\">Links tab</a> on Scripting News not updating often enough. He noticed this because the same thing was happening on his Drummer blog. This got me off my ass to fix the problem. So if you're a fan of the Links tab here, rejoice -- it works about a million percent better thanks to Anton. This is the power of users who actually care, and pitch in to help. ",
