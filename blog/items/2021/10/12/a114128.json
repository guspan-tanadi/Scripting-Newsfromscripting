    "text": "A frequently asked question -- where is \"Drummer\" and how much does it cost? Hopefully the <a href=\"http://drummer.scripting.com/\">link</a> answers the first question. The <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml\">About page</a> answers the second. \"You can use Drummer at no cost.\" Further: \"Much of the software is open source.\" Why is it so inexpensive and will it always be that way? I don't have big plans to take over the universe. I just want to make sure that outlining, web scripting and easy, fluid blogging are not lost arts. I have been very lucky in my career, so at this point, money, at least the kind of money it takes to operate Drummer, is not an issue. So let's have fun and see where it takes us! :boom:",
