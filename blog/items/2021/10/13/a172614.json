    "text": "I was talking with my friend <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+dave+jacobs\">Dave Jacobs</a> last night and we got around to what should be done with [[Facebook]]. The only thing to do when a tech company gets too big, is to force them to unbundle. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling\">Bundling</a> is how their size becomes a problem for us. So, for example, [[Google]] owning the dominant search engine and the dominant browser means they're inevitably going to turn the web into a perfect way to continue to own search. That's all that's going to matter to them. But the web has more to do. Google doesn't care. Facebook has also been successful at strangling the open web, forcing all writing on the net to flow through them. Or at least keeping it from flowing outside of them. If Facebook's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/18/1269.html\">fat ass</a> wasn't squatting over the web, there would be a lot more movement. That might not solve the problem of Nazis ruining the world, but at least it gives the rest of us a chance to organize and solve the other vexing problems we have to deal with. RIght now all we're tasked with doing is making Zuck even richer, and even Zuck must be bored with that by now. The task for FB is to make it easy for the rest of us to run our own FB's and stay in touch with the people who use his FB. That's what happens when you get as big as they are. And it's far from an unsolvable problem. In fact they already have all the software written. ",
