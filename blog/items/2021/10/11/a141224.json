That link opens in [[Drummer]], even if you're not logged in, and updates when there are new features or fixes. I would be honored if you leave that outline open in Drummer while you do your work, that way I can instantly inform you of new stuff. The file's icon will turn to green when there's news. It's the best channel I've had as a developer to users of my product. We've been using it in the Drummer test community. It really works. Instantly updating outlines are called <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml\">instant outlines</a>, btw. ",
