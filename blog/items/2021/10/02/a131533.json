    "text": "Here's the big problem with Ted Lasso season 2. You have to like at least one character in a sitcom like Ted Lasso. That was the charm of season one, the star, the person the show is named after, was very likeable, and so were almost all of the others. Nice people, you cheer for them. This season you have to brace yourself because at any moment the formerly likeable Ted Lasso is going to do something supremely assholelike. I'm not joking. Come on. Anyway it's just like Apple to switch the user interface radically without any warning, just <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs\">ask Gruber</a> about where they moved the freaking <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-tabs-for-webpages-sfri11576/mac\">tabs</a> in the new version of Safari. It's conceivable that a character could reveal a very well hidden dark side and pull it off, but it's not very common and they totally don't pull it off. ",
