    "text": "\"Drummer\" has a <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/general.opml#1634478289000\">command</a> that downloads a zip archive of all your files. It takes a couple of seconds, so it's really quick (OPML files compress nicely). Even so the users, some of whom are quite technical, are <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/63#issuecomment-951849007\">writing scripts</a> to download them automatically. I love seeing this, because backups are the best insurance against software or server problems. And I like to see users take charge and solve problems for themselves. ",
