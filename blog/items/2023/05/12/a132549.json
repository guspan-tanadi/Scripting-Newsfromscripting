The sub-title would be \"As If Anyone Cares.\" Because that's what we do. We make statements. We ask questions no one is listening to. We serve as <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/substrate\">substrate</a> for people to post spam. I know I'm exaggerating. I just posted a <a href=\"https://staging.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3jvju7twmk22d\">thread</a> on <a href=\"https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=blueski\">Blueski</a>, and by the end I remembered no one would get this far. The top message got two Likes. It did make me feel good to write it, for a moment, but it was quickly forgotten. ",
