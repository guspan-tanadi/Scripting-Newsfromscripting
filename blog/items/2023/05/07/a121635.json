It's as if the check itself were worth money. It's why all the comparisons to smaller countries like Greece are ridiculous. Greece can print money if they want to, but people will only accept dollars not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma\">drachmas</a>. We can have anything we want and as much of it as we want and all we have to do is invent the money to pay for it!

By defaulting I mean, a depositor goes to the bank and ask for their money, and the teller hands them a card that says \"Sorry no money for you.\" Like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54\">Soup Nazi</a> in Seinfeld. As a depositor you would be very angry and you'd tweet about it to tell everyone what happened, and they'd all go to the bank and demand their money, and voila, you have a run on the bank. That would probably be the first thing that happened after a default. Everyone who had money on deposit with the US government would demand it back so they could put it somewhere that wasn't managed by lunatics. But because we're defaulting we give everyone the \"No money for you\" card instead of their money. ",

Shipping stopped. Airlines couldn't fly. It was a very scary time. The US government started writing checks, huge checks, and we just got through it by the skin of our teeth. But again, this time, it's the US government defaulting and no one can play that role in this meltdown.",

It won't be a recession in the US, instead we will see an invisible support for our economy disappear in an instant. Some of it already disappeared, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades#Background\">last time</a> we flirted with default. But if we actually default, the US economy will become much less potent. We no longer will have the ability to print money to pay our bills. Now some people will tell you that's a good thing, but they're the worst kind of idiot. It's like saying it's better to be homeless because you don't have to pay rent. We won't have an idea how our lives are elevated by this privilege until we lose it. It's been there for our whole lives. ",
