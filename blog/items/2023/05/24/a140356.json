The point is that once we have something wonderful running on one, we have something to show to people on others. And I'm on Mastodon and Twitter still (see <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a133305\">below</a>). Both have APIs and could conceivably get the same features we've added to Bluesky. That's what \"textcasting\" is all about, it flattens out the differences between the networks at a higher level than tweets. Optional titles, styling, links, enclosures, editable, no length limits.
