It's the first social network to have this feature. Of course it already works with \"FeedLand\". If you want to subscribe to my Bluesky list, <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/24/howToImportSubscriptionListScreen.png\">here's the command</a>, and this is the <a href=\"https://firesky.tv/lists/scripting.com/follows.opml\">URL of the list</a>. You're now following everyone I follow on Bluesky, in FeedLand. The future works! :smile:",
