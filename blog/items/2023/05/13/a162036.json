    "text": "There are so many things wrong with Bluesky. I've started to list them on Bluesky itself, but I seriously doubt any people on the team will pay attention. What we need more than anything are social networks that don't bury their heads in the sand and try to do it all themselves. They're making the same mistakes Twitter made, but 17 years later, with the benefit of hindsight that they are not using. And they re-invent old things, when the world solved those problems a long time ago. For example, they handle links the same way I did in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000815211629/http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml\">Scripting News format</a> in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html\">1997</a>. Great, it was a good idea, but it didn't happen that way, instead we use HTML. How could they believe that it will work this way. <a href=\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod\">Prior art</a>. Please. Yes I like the user interface because it is so much like Twitter it's like comfort food. But that isn't enough. We liked a lot of things for a while, but then the limits will catch up. Again what we need is what's spelled out in the \"Textcasting\" spec. <b>A social network that works for writers</b>. I put that in bold because no one seems to be able to hear this. Okay back to life, I'm done with pissing in the wind for today. :smile:",
