She's so smart and righteous and funny. She's a tiny but fierce person. And she had a new thing she said: BULLSHIT -- very loudly whenever conversation got around to that topic. I now say <i>bullshit</i> myself more often and more emphatically and when I do it on my blog I think of NakedJen doing her thing. ",
