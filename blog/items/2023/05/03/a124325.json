    "text": "The Knicks won. The series is now tied 1-1. They were losing until the very end of the game when a couple of bad calls went our way (truth), but also -- our passes were finding the open man, and the shots were going down. I tried to watch the beginning of the next game, the Lakers vs the Warriors, but I just couldn't get the energy. Instead I watched the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSG_Network\">local station</a> postgame coverage of the Knicks. It was fun to see them so excited. They have a star, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt\">Monica McNutt</a>, who is so cool, I could <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/03/monicaMcnutt.png\">watch her</a> talking about jello and oatmeal and find it fascinating. It's sad that the men on MSG don't seem to see her, but someone there must get she's the future and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pidto\">little troll</a> is funny as long as he shuts up after repeating himself once or twice. I will watch the next Lakers game, hoping they lose in a horrific way. I think LeBron should step aside. And hey it was great to see <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/05/02/carmelo-anthony-gets-garden-ovation-at-knicks-heat-game-2/\">Melo welcomed</a> so warmly at the Knicks game. We will always love Melo. Finally thank goodness there isn't another Knicks game until Saturday. I need some time to process the possibility that the Knicks <i>could</i> be going to the conference finals. ",
