Who else are you going to clash with? Sometimes people think someone is bad just because you didn't do that they wanted you to do. That's not your responsibility either. And that doesn't make you a bad person.",

When I finally figured out this was what was going on I tried to show her that she wasn't doing her part to create a perfect family, that became just another one of her many grievances! So now I see this behavior everywhere I look. Sometimes I think everyone I know feels they deserve a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver\">Leave It To Beaver</a> lifestyle or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet\">Ozzie and Harriet</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Eddie%27s_Father\">Courtship of Eddie's Father</a>. That's the problem with culture, they give us a totally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Cards\">Hallmark</a> view of what life should be like. It's entertainment, and it's compelling but it's also complete bullshit. Yet many of us think that's the ideal for life and if they aren't getting it they're deprived.",

The trick is to be conscious sometimes and see yourself as part of a very hard to describe humanity, and to take what comes to you as what was meant to be. My mother in her later years said things like that but I don't think she really believed it.",
