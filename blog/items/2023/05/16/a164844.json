    "text": "I was setting up a new instance of \"FeedLand\" and hit this <a href=\"https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji/issues/130\">surprising problem</a> in node-emoji, which is used in the <i>reallysimple</i> package. Apparently the node-fetch package can no longer be accessed via a require. My work is stopped cold until this can be resolved, and I don't see how I can do anything on my end other than disabling emoji support in reallysimple as an emergency thing. Any help appreciated. ",
