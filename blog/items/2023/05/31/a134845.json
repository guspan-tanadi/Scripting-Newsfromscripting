    "text": "I've already watched the last episode of Succession about five times, and I expect to watch it a few more. As my understanding grows, I hear different parts. I swear there could be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon\">QAnon</a> thing going on here. Anyway, yesterday I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/05/30.html#a122242\">wrote</a> about bullshit and about how Tom didn't win if winning means being the chosen successor of Logan Roy. That was the Swede. My jaw dropped when <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/30/bullshitBullshitEverythingsBullshit.png\">Roman said</a> they were bullshit. There's that word. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/05/30.html#a122242\">Bullshit</a>. The kids were bullshit. Nothing. Tom was a great choice to be the new Gerri. The book closes so neatly. The ending wasn't dramatic like the ending of the Sopranos or Mad Men, or clever like Six Feet Under. it was more like the ending of The Wire, things just wound down in a natural way. The truth was the people who really run the world (a \"world of a father,\" says Shiv) are Logans. The people we see on the news shows are Toms. We never hear from the children.",
