    "text": "BTW, I've re-learned recently that the hate some people in Silicon Valley have for me is real. Obviously I've known about it for years. There have been some really egregious outbursts, like the time I was invited to Mozilla to explain \"RSS\" from my point of view and it was an ambush. The source of the hate in some cases must be jealousy -- I guess they feel constrained by having jobs inside shit companies that they feel that limits their creativity. They must think what I do is easy, and if only they had the freedom to create whatever they want they could do what I do. I've seen that in action. I also write publicly and I try to be interesting in the way I write, partially because I write to amuse myself, but I also try hard not to make it personal. I don't mind telling Jack Dorsey, for example, to sit down, because he's a very public figure and his actions have big consequences. Just one example. I also feel free to say that I think the culture of Silicon Valley is poisonous. The rest of the world seems to have caught on to that idea. Or some people just don't like me as a person. But that's no excuse to behave awfully. I find that when I do something awful, I hurt myself more than the other person. I learned that a long time ago, so I try hard not to do it. I empathize with them a bit, they feel pain and try to give a little of it to me. Something like this just happened on Bluesky. A \"joke\" about exactly what I'm writing about here. I thought about responding to it on Bluesky, but instead blocked the troll and respond here instead. You should care about how you treat people, especially people who your peers have decided it's okay to hate on. You don't <i>have</i> to behave badly. And if you do that's your choice, it's not something you can blame them for. :boom:",
