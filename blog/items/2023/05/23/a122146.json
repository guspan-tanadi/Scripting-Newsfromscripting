    "text": "LeBron James says he <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10076982-sources-lebron-james-considering-retirement-after-wcf-exit-20-nba-seasons\">might retire</a>. Good move. He also says he isn't into basketball if he isn't in the race for a championship. See there's the problem, right there. There are 30 teams in the NBA. In any given year 29 of them will not win the championship. 28 of them won't even make the Finals. Yet their fans felt their seasons were worthwhile if they played the game with heart, if there's hope for next season. This is why I am not a Yankees fan or a LeBron James fan. I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/10/20/winningIsntEverything.html\">love my team</a> even when they lose, <i>especially</i> when they lose. ",
