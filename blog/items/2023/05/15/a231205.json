    "text": "There's so much movement in social media and AI, it's impossible to keep up with a fraction of what's going on. Totally stripping my gears. Meantime I wonder when will someone combine the two. A social media world with AI's as part of the community. Maybe it already exists, maybe that's what Twitter has become? No, not possible, hmmm, or is it? Don't freak out. Funny thing is there's a Kurt Vonnegut book with this as part of its plot, <a href=\"http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html\">Breakfast of Champions</a>. In it, the main character, Kilgore Trout, is informed that he is the only real person, that everyone else is a robot sent there to test him. I think that's how it went. But if you're reading this you must know that I'm a robot myself. Oh the humanity. ",
