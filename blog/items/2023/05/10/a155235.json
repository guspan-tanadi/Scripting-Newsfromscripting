    "text": "I'm trying once again to transfer the contents of an old iPad to a new iPad. It insists on installing a new version of the OS before proceeding. While that is happening the original iPad times out. When I try to restart the transfer, it hangs. Come back hours later, still hung. Then I tried to get the new machine to restore factory settings but it wouldn't accept my password, after a long wait. Tried it three or four times and thought maybe it needs wifi turned on to do this. It does. Okay now, with the new machine restored to factory settings, it has started the new OS install again. I started this at 7AM, now it's almost noon. I did do other stuff. My wifi is fast btw, so installing a new version here should be fast relative to other setups. But after all this time I don't believe I'm any closer to having the transfer of data even start. It's starting to look like reinstalling all the apps and data by hand would be faster. (Update: He's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/10/installNow.png\">screen shot</a> of where the new iPad gets stuck. That little star thing is spinning. I tried clicking on <i>Install Now</i> and nothing seems to happen. I'm just going to leave it there and come back in a couple of hours.)",
