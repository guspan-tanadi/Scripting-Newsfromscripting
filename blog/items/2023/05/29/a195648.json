    "text": "Something interesting to ponder. When we have \"textcasting\"-compatible social media networks, there will be no more wall between blogging and tweeting or tooting.

Blogging tools are equipped to deal with titles, styles, links, enclosures, no length limit, editing. These might seem like luxuries now, but once we have them, we'll be amazed that we put up without them for so long when they were very very very very easy to implement. ",
