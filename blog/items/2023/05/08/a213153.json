There's at least one OPML file in every one of <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories\">my repos</a>, containing the full <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/source.opml\">project source</a>. I edit all my code in an outliner. This is an art that should get exposure. It'm not exactly a nobody in software development, I've been developing this style for a long time. And tools to go with it. Anyway, back to work :smile:",
