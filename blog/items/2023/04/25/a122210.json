    "text": "Funny story. When I ask Alexa to play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFz3vdyirR4\">Here Come Those Tears Again</a> by Jackson Brown, it plays the song, then plays it again, and again and so on. I guess it gets tripped up on the last <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=define+again\">word</a> in the song name? The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Come_Those_Tears_Again\">story</a> of the song is quite moving. Background vocals by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Raitt\">Bonnie Raitt</a>. ",
