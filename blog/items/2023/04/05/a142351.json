    "text": "I don't often see links to articles on <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/\">Semafor</a>, a new journalism platform started by Ben Smith formerly of Buzzfeed and the NYT. One of the reasons I rarely see links from them is that they still apparently don't have an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=semafor+rss+feed\">RSS feed</a> for their stories. If they had a feed, I'd be subscribed and I'd be much more likely to notice, and would probably occasionally <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/110146691152214416\">pass a link</a> on to my followers. There is a distribution system that helps new pubs like Semafor boot up. My advice, do two things: 1. Put a linefeed at the end of each line in your <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/05/viewsource.png\">HTML source</a> so I can get some ideas where you might have put your RSS feed. 2. If you don't have a feed for your top stories at least, stop everything and do it. Every day you delay is more exposure you don't get. I asked them to do this when they started, so this is the second request. ",
