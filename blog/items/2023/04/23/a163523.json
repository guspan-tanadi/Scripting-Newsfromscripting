    "text": "Now that Twitter is less of a community site for me, whatever that means, and Mastodon has gotten really quiet lately (again, for me), I've turned to Facebook. Maybe in the next round we'll be able to create something that isn't owned by the tech cartel, (neither Twitter or Facebook is owned by anyone who appears to give a damn about it), that has the same kind of vibrancy that Twitter once had. Sure it could've been better, I wish Jack and Ev had been more supportive of developers, but I definitely miss what it used to be, flawed as it was.I'm really tired of all the bad-mouthing of Twitter on Mastodon. You all are missing something important, Twitter wasn't  just about who owns it, they're really not that important, it's about the people who use it. <i>It's always been that way. </i>",
