Early Mastodon fans will be as powerless to fix this as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1093562299758067712\">we are</a> when it comes to Spotify, Amazon, Google et al calling their audio programs podcasts, even though they don't provide the feeds that would give users choice. It's best to have your eyes open about this before it becomes a big issue, by then it will be too late. ",
