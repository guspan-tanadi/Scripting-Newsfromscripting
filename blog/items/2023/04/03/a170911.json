    "text": "A feature Google should have had a long time ago. I want to tell Google where <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">my blog</a> is. Have it be a preference setting. Then when I do searches it automatically gives priority to anything on my blog. Why would this be so incredibly powerful? I'd have a way to leave notes for myself on my research trips through Google's database. And if they let me do this in an outline and represented the structure in the query results, it would be explosively powerful. All without any AI, btw. Really cost effective.",
