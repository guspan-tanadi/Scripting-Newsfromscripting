But with my <a href=\"https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/\">personal chatbot</a>, the next step is to have a Dave-emulator, right? Wouldn't be that big a stretch. I basically write like I talk. It's almost dialog. I do go back and edit and take out the parts where I'm thinking while talking, and in the end those parts aren't needed to make the point. I'm sure you could write an AI thing that did that. It probably already does it. I knew there would be a reason to put an effort into having a good archive. (I deliberately left this bit unedited.)",
