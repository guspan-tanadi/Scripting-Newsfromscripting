I can describe what kind of music works for me, a strong fast beat, big bass drum and guitar. Something I can sing along to is good. And I like a certain set of bands from the 70s and 80s, so we might as well start with that. Now I'm going for a 40-minute walk. Program the music please and put it on my phone and off I go. ",
