You could leave and come back, or take a walk with someone you met there, or sit in a corner and read a book, whatever you want. It was open to everyone, no cost. ",

I was in my 40s at the time, and responded that some of us would love to have that problem. People laughed and the young man was probably embarrassed, so he shot back -- you think you know so much because you're old. I asked if he thought there was anything a person twice his age might understand that he didn't. He said no. I asked if he had learned anything since he was twelve. Oh yeah no comparison. Do you think learning ends at 22? Yes, he said.",

A lot happened in that time, obviously -- lots of learning, some of it intentional (training, therapy), and while I'm still the same person, the way I relate to the world is much improved in the intervening years. I could see it because I remembered what it was like then, and how different it is now. ",
