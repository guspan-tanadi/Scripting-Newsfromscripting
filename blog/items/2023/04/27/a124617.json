    "text": "I'm sure somewhere deep-down the Knicks still suck, but you couldn't tell last night when they <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/36299536/new-york-knicks-oust-cavs-1st-playoff-series-win-13\">eliminated</a> the Cleveland Cavaliers and went on to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time in ten years. Also last night, equally surprising, the #8 seed Miami Heat <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/36300795/jimmy-butler-heat-stun-bucks-ot-oust-top-seeded-milwaukee\">eliminated</a> the #1 seed Milwaukee Bucks. The Knicks will play the Heat starting on Sunday at 1PM at <a href=\"https://www.stubhub.com/new-york-knicks-new-york-tickets-4-30-2023/event/151513601/?quantity=2&sections=139986&ticketClasses=8177&seatTypes=&listingQty=\">the Garden</a>. That's where I'm going to be for sure (watching on TV of course). And to think it wasn't that long ago that Knicks fans were wearing <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/knicksPaperBags.png\">paper bags</a> over our heads. The Knicks are now the team I always hoped they would be. It all paid off. And thanks to <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/08/kevin-durant-new-york-knicks-are-not-cool-anymore/\">KD</a> for putting the positive jinx on the Knicks. ",
