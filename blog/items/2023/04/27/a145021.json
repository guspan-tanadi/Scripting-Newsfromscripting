We're beginning to be able to find those. Now can we eliminate the duplication and have the writing still be interesting? People seem so scared of having the machine alter our writing, but for me, it would be a service. I never am able to sit down and turn this stuff into a book, I just don't write that way. Maybe I could team up with a bot who would be the perfect editor. ",
