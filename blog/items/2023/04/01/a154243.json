He <a href=\"https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/chats/2d3f263f-f7b4-40d2-9f12-e5c6271da811\">discovered</a> that he could teach it how to program in UserTalk, the scripting language of Frontier. It also appears he was able to correct mistakes? I wonder how that works. But it's no longer purely my chatbot, now it's Jakes too? Hmm. (I trust Jake, that's not a problem. But I might not trust other people who explore my pod.) ",
