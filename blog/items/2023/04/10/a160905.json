    "text": "Spoiler alert. This item is about last night's episode of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)\">Succession</a>. I'm aware that one of the reasons I like to binge-watch TV series is the simulated community of it. Social contact is a basic human need. But our society has moved online, and then there's Covid, and that's why simulated communities that satisfy our requirement for social contact are so popular and valuable. It's relaxing to check in with a group of fictional people every so often, to see them behaving with ordinary human dysfunction, so our subconscious can project itself into their drama. The death of the central figure in a simulated community is why I feel so unsettled today, I think. At first I couldn't place it. What happened? I have a fairly ordinary week planned. Spring is arriving in the mountains. Then I remembered <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/tv/23674287/succession-season-4-episode3-logan-dead-conners-wedding\">what happened</a> last night. I suspect a few million others are feeling it too.   ",
