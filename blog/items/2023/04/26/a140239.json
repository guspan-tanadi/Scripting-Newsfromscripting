When I use an unusual word, I want to link to its definition. (Yes I know about Wordnik. I even wrote a <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/\">product</a> to work with it, but they shut us out of the API for some reason. I was hoping they'd adopt the product, even market it. I can't imagine it cost that much to let people use it.)",
