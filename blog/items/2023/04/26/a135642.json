    "text": "I've been linkblogging exclusively to <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew\">Mastodon</a> for the last week or so. No more posting links to Twitter. Just Masto (and <a href=\"http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml\">my RSS feed</a>, and the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=links\">Links page</a> on my blog.) I like it. It's changed the way I see the two networks. Not sure people on Mastodon understand it's my linkblog, I think we still have some more work to do there. ",
