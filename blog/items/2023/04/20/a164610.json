    "text": "Another ChatGPT use-case. There's an open source package called <a href=\"https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor\">medium-editor</a> that I use to edit text in most of my products. I believe it's popular, but because of its name, it can be hard to use a search engine to find technical information about it. I wanted to make an instance of the editor the focus by default when its created. I asked <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/20/medium-editor-package-familiar.html\">ChatGPT how to</a> do it, and it gave me fantastic docs, because it could sort out what Google simply can't. Incredibly useful. It will, if it works, result in a product that \"feels good\" -- people probably won't even notice that it did anything unusual. This is what make software excellent. (Update: Still scratching my head over this.)",
