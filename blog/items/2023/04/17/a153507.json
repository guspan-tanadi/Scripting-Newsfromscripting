    "text": "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange\">Stack Exchange</a> was a breakthrough, it accumulated a library of solved problems that you could borrow from, but you'd have to figure out which pieces went with others, and that was often an long arduous process, when it worked, and it didn't always work. ChatGPT is the next level after Stack Exchange. Now you just ask the question and you get docs customized to the exact problem you have and it writes docs that are better quality than what programmers write on Stack Exchange (not in any way diminishing their contribution). So this is like moving from a calculator to a spreadsheet. It's simply a higher-level tool.",
