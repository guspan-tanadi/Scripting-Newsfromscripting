    "text": "I don't believe in <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2023/02/27/rounding-up-to.html\">character limits</a> in blog posts. I hope in a few years all these discussions about what's the optimal number of characters for a post will be seen as farce, like the scene in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)\">Amadeus</a> where the Emperor says Mozart's opera has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMWy3EpEo_o&t=29s\">too many notes</a>. I don't think it's up to Emperors or software developers to have opinions on what's the right number of characters in my writing. What if in turn, as a writer, I said your code couldn't have more 500 characters per file. What's the likelihood that this edict would make any sense? Hopefully that puts it in perspective. There's a simple solution available to everyone, a <i>More</i> link at some arbitrary breakpoint, that does enough to encourage short posts if that's what you're after. And it also makes sense to writers.  ",
