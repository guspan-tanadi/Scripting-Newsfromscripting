    "text": "One of the funny things about <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/02/10.html#a020506\">XML</a> is that they pitched developers saying \"Now you can create your own formats!\" I'm sure they meant it, but once \"RSS\" was established, they tried to replace it with an incompatible format. Luckily, the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a> wasn't as powerful as Apple or Google, and their format didn't replace \"RSS\". But, imho, when you push an open tech and someone takes you up on it, you should help, not fight them, ie if you really meant it.",
