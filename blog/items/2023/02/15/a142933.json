I know you don’t come from the US so you might not know that here Blacks and Jews are equal, in theory. We’re all fighting for that to be recognized. Legally we have the same rights and deserve the same respect. That’s why your behavior was both bewildering and unacceptable, and why you feel you were chased out of NYC, which is an especially tolerant part of he US because it is a cultural melting pot. We all have to get along, and accept and even celebrate our differences. Your view of the world just doesn’t fit in here. Maybe they’ll like you better in Dallas, but I’d be surprised if they do.  ",
