It's been down <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/02/04.html#a162658\">since Feb 4</a>, while it was retooled for email-based identity and HTTPS. It all appears to work as well as it did when we previously did identity with Twitter. It has been a really <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/02/10/023900.html\">stressful</a> couple of weeks, while working with developers on getting FeedLand open source release out, I had to also rip up Drummer and put in a new identity system. All the code was written but it still was an ugly transition, one you hope to never have to do. <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/178\">Report problems here</a>. Remember to give us steps to reproduce. If we don't understand what the problem it'll be hard to fix it.",
