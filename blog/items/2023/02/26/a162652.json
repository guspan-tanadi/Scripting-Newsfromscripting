    "text": "I mentioned <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/02/24.html#a150333\">the other day</a> that I was having trouble building \"Electric Drummer\" after many months of being focused on FeedLand. It appeared as if I wasn't able to get it to build. Problem solved. My written build instructions were missing a step. I couldn't move on until I solved this problem. Electric Drummer is essential software to my daily work. I do all my for-work writing here. That's a very basic thing, and something I might take on, starting from scratch with an online world that assumes the writers are <i>always</i> able to write in their favorite apps. If an online system can't accomodate this, we don't write for them. ",
