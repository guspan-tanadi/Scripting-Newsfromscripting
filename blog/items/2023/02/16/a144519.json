It's about reviving the blogger developer community, to give them the tools we didn't have in the 90s and 00s that are now very practical. And start to grow, slowly at first, the way blogging and podcasting grew, with a clear foundation of what a <a href=\"http://textcasting.org/\">document</a> is, so <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop\">interop</a> is really simple and we're not so vulnerable to Silicon Valley adventures.
