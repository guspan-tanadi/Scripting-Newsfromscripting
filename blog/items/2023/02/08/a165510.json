    "text": "We started testing the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/175\">new release</a> of Drummer earlier today. There are features that used to work in Drummer that won't work in the new version. I am shipping the first open source version of FeedLand at the same time, working on both -- and this is really precarious work. Drummer will work as an outliner. The scripting features will mostly work, the Twitter verbs obviously will <i>not</i> work. Your public files will be at different addresses. As I've said before I'm one person, doing the best I can. I expect people to be appreciative and supportive, friendly. Thanks in advance. :smile:",
