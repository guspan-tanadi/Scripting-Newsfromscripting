    "text": "One of my favorite things on Twitter are the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1389951899424677888\">art channels</a>. The curators post reproductions of famous works of art. And occasionally RT another art channel they feel is related to their artist, that their viewers would enjoy. It's a way to broaden the art you get to see. When they talk about how horrible Twitter is they leave out stuff like this. However, without use of the API these channels can't exist, and since each is a labor of love, it's unreasonable to expect them to pay for it. ",
