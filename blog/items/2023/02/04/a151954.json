    "text": "BTW, yesterday's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/02/03.html#a020601\">problem</a> with my Android phone was solved quickly by a number of readers. Thank you all very much.

I never would have done that on purpose. This is a phone I use mainly for listening to podcasts and audiobooks and for 2-factor identity. Why does it turn off media? What kind of sense does that make. And from a UI standpoint, there should be some clue somewhere near the slider as to why that it's disabled. I tried to find the answer on Google and ChatGPT before broadcasting the question. Neither had any good advice about this. ",
