    "text": "First, it's good that people are working on new features for RSS for podcasts. Why not. But you should choose a modest name for your effort. By calling it Podcasting 2.0 you're basically forcing anyone else who wants to do something here to call theirs 3.0 or 4.0. Just come up with a random name, like <i>The Oslo Project.</i> How did I come up with that name? I asked <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/chat\">ChatGPT</a> to do it : \"Please give me 10 random names of European cities with less than 4 syllables in their names.\" Here's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/randomCityNames.png\">what</a> it came up with. Or you can ask for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/names.png\">children's names</a>. Or <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/colornames.png\">color</a> names. Or <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/yiddishwords.png\">Yiddish</a> words. And then please, look at what the other guys are doing and instead of implementing something slightly different with a different name, just do it their way. The only goal here should be upgrading the user experience and interop, so there's no freaking lockin. Keep the bullshit to a minimum. \"Available where you get your podcasts.\"",
