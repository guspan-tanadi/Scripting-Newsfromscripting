    "text": "If you're interested how the music of my generation (born 1955, Boomer) came about, I can't more highly recommend the two-part documentary <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/laurel-canyon/season-1\">Laurel Canyon</a>, currently streaming on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Laurel-Canyon-Season-1/dp/B0882JGTTV\">Amazon Prime</a>. I got real interested in the music of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Laurel+Canyon,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90046/@34.1173412,-118.3928177,14z/\">Laurel Canyon</a> when I was exploring the story of CSNY and all the members individually after David Crosby died. I wish I had been part of a creative community like that. That was what I was dreaming of for my life back then, and it was right there and until now I didn't know it existed. Learning a lot about my own life these days, by studying what was going on around it. I don't think any of this could have happened without Wikipedia, YouTube and podcasting. It's amazing how well our media cover history now. This could be the golden age of history. Weird idea, I know. ",
