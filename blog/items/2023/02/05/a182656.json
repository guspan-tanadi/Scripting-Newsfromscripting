    "text": "Making good progress converting \"Drummer\" to email-based identity. I had all the pieces written, but I wasn't sure at first how they fit together. This morning I started down a path and everything clicked into place. Like a ski boot into a binding. When the pieces fit together like this I call it \"clean living\" -- we didn't cut any corners when doing this for FeedLand, and the two products share a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver\">foundation</a>, the bits were already there for Drummer. I hadn't worked on Drummer in almost a year. It took a while for the cobwebs to shake off. Nice to see you my old friend, who I've been using all this time. Anyway, I think we'll have a test version of this ready in a day or two. To deploy shortly after, with fingers crossed, praise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law\">Murphy</a>.  ",
