It was first sung in Joni Mitchell's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles\">Laurel Canyon</a> living room, or Cass Elliot's kitchen, or John Sebastian's house. Crosby and Stills were tripping out on their harmonies. Cass brought Graham Nash with her to meet them. After hearing the song twice, he joined the harmony. Imagine the <a href=\"https://www.songfacts.com/facts/crosby-stills-nash/you-dont-have-to-cry\">discovery</a> that this kind of music was possible, and that it was coming from you! BTW, the song was written by Stills about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Collins\">Judy Collins</a>. ",
