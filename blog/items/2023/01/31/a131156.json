    "text": "To journalists (and others) who are trying to figure out how podcasting was born, I suggest listening to the podcasts in <a href=\"http://morningcoffeenotes.com/\">Morning Coffee Notes</a> starting at 6/11/2004. Work your way up the list. Those were amazing days, lots of firsts and imho lots of fun. I kept the archive because I hoped at some point someone would want to know how it happened. Maybe grad students will do a thesis on this stuff? This is a new medium being born. I tried to keep good records. Also recommend looking at Scripting News archives for 2004 as well. ",
