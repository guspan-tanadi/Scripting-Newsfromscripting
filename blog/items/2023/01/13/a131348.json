    "text": "As many people noticed, the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/email/\">nightly emails</a> didn't go out last night at midnight. The theory they had was that it had something to do with the reported <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/third-party-twitter-apps-tweetbot-twitterrific-echofon-down/\">outage</a> at Twitter. Only <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tangentially\">tangentially</a>. The cause was a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/?tab=links\">linkblog</a> item <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/13/nolink.png\">without a link</a>. The mail-sending software had never encountered such a thing before, and it turns out there was an assumption that all linkblog entries would always have links. So the software lost its mind and went boom. Easy to find, the error message and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace\">stack crawl</a> were the last thing in the log. Adding a protection against such a situation was also easy. This is how software gets mature. Sooner or later every weird case shows up and hopefully it will be patched well and documented, so next time it happens the email goes out as it's supposed to. This is all part of the \"It's even worse than it appears\" philosophy of Scripting News. And, how was this related <i>tangentially</i> to the outage at Twitter? Well that's what the stupid linkblog entry was about. As <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8VSSdteKqM\">Maude used to say</a> \"God'll get you for that Walter.\" In this case <a href=\"https://all-in-the-family-tv-show.fandom.com/wiki/Walter_Findlay\">Walter</a> is me and god is the Software God.
