    "text": "I wasn't very entertained with <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-menu\">The Menu</a> on HBO but now I find myself thinking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film)\">it</a> a lot, not deliberately. Weird. So I watched it again, and on the second viewing it came together. I've had a similar experience with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood\">There Will Be Blood</a>. I didn't like it on the first viewing, but watched it again, and it became one of my favorite movies. ",
