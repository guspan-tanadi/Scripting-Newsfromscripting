    "text": "When I first started using Mastodon <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/11/07.html#a233839\">late last year</a>, like so many others I had questions about what it is, how it works, what is ActivityPub, does it have an API, where is this going, will the BigCo's try to take it over, stuff like that. In the past when new markets appeared, like the personal computer, desktop publishing, the web -- there were always publications that grew up along with the platform, because there's such demand to know about the latest developments. I contacted my friend <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/109682144184951137\">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who teaches journalism at CUNY to ask if there was interest in one of their students forming a news site to gather news of the Mastodon world. He liked the idea and now they've taken the next step. They're offering a full scholarship to their \"100-day, online certificate program that helps creators establish their own enterprises to serve specific communities/markets.\" Apply by Feb 3 <a href=\"https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/j-plus/entrepreneurial-journalism-creators-program/\">here</a>.
