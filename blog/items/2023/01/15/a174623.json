    "text": "Bingeing report. I watched <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/band-of-brothers\">Band of Brothers</a> all the way through. It's good, but I had forgotten how bloody it is. Since I was in that mode, I watched <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-2022\">All Quiet on the Western Front</a> on Netflix. Same idea, with 2020's production, a different war, and from the other side. I think the next thing will be <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/they-shall-not-grow-old\">They Shall Not Grow Old</a> on HBO. I think an AI could have plotted this path for me. ",
