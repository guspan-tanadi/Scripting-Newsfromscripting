Now I'm a nobody compared to her, but she was so gracious -- it made we wonder if grace is part of what makes someone a great blogger. ",

It says to me, a person who got a fairly standard education in American History from New York public schools, that these founders that we all iconify and think were so great, actually were people, and some of them were not beyond reproach, like Jefferson.
