At the end with the Knicks defending, they stopped the best team in the NBA, without Mitchell Robinson. In previous seasons the Knicks would always lose these games. At the end we'd say well it was a good effort, knowing that's bullshit, it's pathetic. To win one of those games, with such competence, for the second time in two games, both times against the best in the league, wow. Maybe it's time to change how I think about this team. I'll let you know. :basketball:",
