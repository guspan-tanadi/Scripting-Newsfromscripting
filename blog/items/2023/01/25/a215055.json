    "text": "I finished bingeing <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/his-dark-materials\">His Dark Materials</a>. Utterly tedious. 99 percent speeches by people saying nothing and the music rising and sounding ominious as if something very profound was happening. The last episode was good for about 15 minutes then it got tedious too. Somehow I was snookered into watching one of those superhero shows that are so popular now. It's all special effects. I'm sure they're impressive, and they made a big deal about how important stories are, too bad the show didn't have much of a frecking story. I give it a <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fhis-dark-materials\">rating</a> of ðŸ’©&nbsp;and I'm rating myself a fool for sitting through it all the way to the end. Oy boy what a mess.",
