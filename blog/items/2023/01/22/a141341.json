    "text": "Twitter made a change so that you have to click a link to see the recent posts from people you follow. Hard to remember to do that, and you end up seeing a lot of disgusting crap. The stuff an algorithm chose for you, including posts from people you blocked. But you can work around this. If you have a bookmark for accessing Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Areplies&f=live\">change it to this</a>. Now you'll only see items from people you follow. None of the bullshit their algorithm chose \"for you\" which is really \"for their advertisers\" or \"for whoever.\"  ",
