For example, here's what I said <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/whatDaveSaidAboutGeneralMagic.png?nodialog\">about General Magic</a>, a Silicon Valley company that led in early PDA products. The team was made up of past and future tech superstars. Note that I just added to what I say about the company, so it'll be interesting to ask this question again in a few days. We haven't got the <a href=\"http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmarkdown?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml\">Markdown version</a> of my RSS feed flowing through the database yet.",
