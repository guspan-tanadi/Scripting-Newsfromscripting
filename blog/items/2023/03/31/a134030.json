There's going to be a lot of that, could happen tomorrow, or really any time. I'm not going to try to go with Twitter on this trip. \"Drummer\" and \"FeedLand\" have been converted to email-based identity, all the rest, including features on Scripting News, could break. That's how the web works. We know when we build on corporate APIs at some point they will stop working. Twitter has had a good run. I started <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=twitter%20api&collection=scriptingnews\">writing to their API</a> in 2006. I was hoping for great innovation and huge growth, but it didn't happen for devs, for whatever reason. Je ne sais quoi. C'est la vie. Que sera sera.  ",
