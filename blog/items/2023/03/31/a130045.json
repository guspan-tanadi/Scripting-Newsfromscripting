Still excited about the <a href=\"https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/chats/54392679-165d-4b09-b410-cfb3ba22759a/\">personal chatbot</a> I've been writing about all week. But -- now that more people are running queries, I see how \"inventive\" it can be. Someone asked what <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/31/awards.png?nodialog\">awards and honors</a> I've received. It provided a list, but as far as I can tell they're all bogus, awards that may exist, that I did not receive. I've had a nice career, but only <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/10/18/wiredsTechRenegadeFor2001.html\">one award</a>, if my memory serves me. Oddly that award was not included in the chatbot's list. ",
