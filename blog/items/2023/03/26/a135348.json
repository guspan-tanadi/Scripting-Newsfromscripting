    "text": "I got access to <a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\">Bard</a> this morning, which is Google's version of ChatGPT. I'm still pretty confused about what it is, the same way I was confused about the web in 1994 when I first got Mosaic and was reading various early websites. I can use it, but how do I create for it? I have a huge dataset of my own, most of 28+ years of my writing here on Scripting News starting in 1994. Anyway, the first thing I did was ask if I can add my own data to their massive dataset (their term) and it said yes. I asked how, and it sounds really easy, totally within my ability to do, and almost certainly within your ability too. I took screen shots of the relevant parts of the discussion and added it to the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254#issuecomment-1484102808\">thread</a> I started on this topic. I will try this out and report back. ",
