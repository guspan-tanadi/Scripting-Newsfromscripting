We've been to this place before. How long before the press starts calling it The Podcast Wars. Some of us will try to douse the flames, to no avail. ",

I have a lot of experience with this. People are always looking for a way to make a billion dollars. It never occurs to them that if it all has to be for them, there will be nothing. Now a whole new generation has to learn that again, and as usual the thing that pays for it is podcasting. ",
