I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/\">carpetbaggers</a> have left, everything is back to normal. Dallas and Phoenix can have them. Good riddance. ",
