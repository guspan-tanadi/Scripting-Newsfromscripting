    "text": "Reading my notes on being at Harvard, it sounds like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington\">Mr Smith Goes to Washington</a>. I was very excited, and it shows. In hindsight, I was about to have some great adventures. One of the best experiences of my life. Now twenty years later, I'm still very grateful for having had the opportunity to work with the people I met at Harvard, and the power afforded to me with the H-bomb business card. The friends I made there still benefit me to this day, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference. ",
