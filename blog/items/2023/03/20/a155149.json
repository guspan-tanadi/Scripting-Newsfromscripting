    "text": "A cool feature for FeedLand users. When you <i>Like</i> an item, it's automatically added to two RSS feeds -- one for <a href=\"http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml\">your likes</a>, and one for the <a href=\"http://data.feedland.org/likes/all.xml\">likes of all users</a> on your FeedLand.It's basically a single-gesture linkblog. There's a lot of that in FeedLand, where things have been factored to a point where they couldn't possibly be simpler. Of course since they're standard \"RSS\" feeds, you could follow them from any feed reader. ",
