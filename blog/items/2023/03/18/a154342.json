    "text": "Almost everything you do on FeedLand is public. You can read anyone else's feed list. Example, <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?username=KenSmith\">Ken Smith's list</a>. If you're signed in, to subscribe to a feed just click the feed's checkbox. You can also see <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?userslist\">who's been on</a> recently, when they signed up, how many feeds they subscribe to, and how many pages they've viewed. You can also see the feeds that have recently been <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?log\">subscribed to</a>. The idea is to make feed discovery as easy as it possibly can be. We steal (and improve on) ideas from social media apps that didn't exist last time I took a fresh look at feed systems. I don't think of FeedLand as a feed reader -- it's more of a feed management system, imho.",
