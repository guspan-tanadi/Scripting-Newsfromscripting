It wrote a paragraph profile on each, but did not discover that Palmer had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2IrTbWJxY\">written a song</a> about Lydon. Note -- Google's search function totally made the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=amanda+palmer+christopher+lydon\">connection</a>. ",
