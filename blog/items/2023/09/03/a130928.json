    "text": "It has been pointed out that I could use the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/\">OpenAI platform</a> to add commands to my outliner that are based on results of ChatGPT questions. For example, I could say (hypothetically) \"add a list for 10 random states under the bar cursor headline\" and it would be done. I hope to try that soon. In the meantime if you'd like to do it, the outliner I use is <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/concord\">open source</a>, so you can do it, and share it with me and that would make me even happier. :smile:",
