    "text": "\"textcasting\" will be what interop means in social media. Help me make it happen. I know it <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=US&q=textcasting&hl=en\">sounds ridiculous</a> to think we could change the net so it's a writer's paradise, but I think the time is right. What makes these things work is when enough people want to see the change that it achieves an aura of inevitability. That was the arc of podcasting. It applies to big companies too, Apple won't get anywhere with their new headset until it achieves that aura. I think the social media of textcasting will be amazing. And it's sooo low tech. There's nothing to it other than demanding that the techies stop imposing stupid rules on what we can write. ",
