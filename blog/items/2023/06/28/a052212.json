    "text": "Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/03/28.html\">announcement</a> of the new Harvard blog server on March 23, 2003. You can see how we got there by reading the archive for the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/03.html\">whole month</a> of March. I started out in Woodside, CA, having just sold my house and packed the car and drove cross-country. I got to work real quickly. By the end of the month I had given talks at the Kennedy School and to the user's group of system managers at Harvard. It was a real rollout. We had weekly meetups at Berkman, every Thursday. All the history was recorded on the blogs. Luckily I continued to tell the story on this blog too, and that archive will remain.  ",
