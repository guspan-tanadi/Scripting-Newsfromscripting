For whatever reason the people who are there now are creative, interested, and stimulated because they sense the presence of similar people. Kind of like Clubhouse was a few summers ago. This tells me something I've suspected, that small-size social networks have a place. They shouldn't just be an accidental thing that disappears because growth attracts less interesting, <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/destructive\">anti-creative</a> people. ",
