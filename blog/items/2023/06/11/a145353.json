This is <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@davew/110520163594030698\">what I wrote</a>. \"There was a lot of confusion about what RSS was until RSS 2.0 came out and the NYT adopted it. There was a thread based on RDF, and Aaron was credited as a contributor to that. I would ask those people what he did. I never worked with him. I saw some of his posts on their mail list and met him a few times at conferences. He was a precocious young person, obviously smart, but he didn't seem interested in what I was working on. That's about it.\"",
