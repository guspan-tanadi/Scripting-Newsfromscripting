    "text": "I borrowed a lot of prior art for \"FeedLand\" from social media, specifically, the idea that subscription lists are public. So you can walk a network of followship, and get ideas of who to subscribe to that way. Click a checkbox and you're connected. That makes it easy to peer with social networks, if they support OPML subscription lists and RSS feeds of posts. As I reported <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a135024\">on May 24</a>, we now have that for Bluesky. I've spent the last few days teaching FeedLand how to do with Bluesky what it does with RSS feeds. Today I got it working. Real sense of accomplishment here. Not deployed yet, but I'm pretty sure it will be soon. The pieces fit together amazingly well. ",
