It was the 1960s. I listened to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow#Radio_work\">WABC</a>, the Beatles and all the great new rock and roll. My grandpa said I’d see so many amazing things in my life. To him the radio was a futuristic miracle, like AI today. Anyway I just asked <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa\">Alexa</a> to play <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ7uXX9K7Sk\">You Can’t Hurry Love</a> by the Supremes, one of the songs I listened to on the radio he gave me 60 years ago. I realized just now he was so right, I have indeed seen many amazing things in my life.",
