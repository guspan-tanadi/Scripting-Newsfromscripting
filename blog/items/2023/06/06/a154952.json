    "text": "Another <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession\">Succession</a> post, maybe the last, for a while. At some point I'm going to re-watch the whole series, and then might have more observations. Anyway -- people who think that Roman and Kendall have no hope, well I think the writers gave them some cause for hope -- because when they controlled the company for a short period, each showed they were competent, not at running the enterprise, but a small part of it. Kendall was able to sell a complicated and kind of ridiculous idea. And Roman, when he had a clear goal, was able to manage it, and pulled it off. Neither were the kind of person who could run a sprawling enterprise like Waystar, for that you probably had to be Logan. If the two guys team up and manage something much smaller and more focused, they could possibly pull it off, once they get over not being their father. They <i>didn't</i> revert to where they were at the beginning of the show, as some people say, when Kendall was a drug addict and Roman was a pure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck_(pejorative)\">schmuck</a> blowing up a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sVB_BcbLlUs?t=35\">rocket</a> to try to impress the father. They both get a fresh start now that dad is dead. That is a big difference for men, when your father dies you get a chance to come into your own in a new way, I speak from experience. ",
