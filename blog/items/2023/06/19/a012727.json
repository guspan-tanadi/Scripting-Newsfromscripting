    "text": "Facebook is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub\">launching</a> an ActivityPub service to compete with Mastodon. There's a lot of talk in the webs about locking them out. Big words but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open\">not much power</a> behind them. They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is -- who's being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn't mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn't one of them. You have to <i>think. </i>",
