I'm hoping they'll point to the <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">actual RSS 2.0 spec</a> instead of hosting a hacked version of the spec. You can't ethically take the copyright notice off someone else's work and pass it off as your own. It happens all the time on the web, but the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/06/17/193133.html\">W3C can't be</a> one of those places. We're talking about the integrity of the web and its history. RSS 2.0 is a big milestone. What an awful way to try to show support for a standard, esp one created by independent developers and the news industry. ",
