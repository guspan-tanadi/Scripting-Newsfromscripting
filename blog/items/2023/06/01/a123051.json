It's way easier to read than a headline and a link to a blog post. They should work on the formatting a bit. The text is too large and there isn't enough spacing between lines. But it works, and is a welcome addition. There's still <a href=\"http://textcasting.org/\">more to do</a> -- let's have optional titles, links, styling, editing and enclosures. ",
