    "text": "I wish help systems for online services could answer questions about my account, not give me instructions on how to find the answers. Why can't they do it for me? I've been spoiled by ChatGPT which actually parses the words I type, and gives me the answers I asked for. For example, I have a Google Workspace account, set up by someone else. I want to add new email addresses to my account. I can't find out how much I'm already paying for the email addresses that are already allocated. I do know the total amount, $26/month. It's way too much money for what it's doing, btw. Basically I'd like to give it instructions in my language. \"I'm thinking of adding five new email addresses, how much will that add to my monthly bill?\" Then if I decide to go ahead, I could just tell it, in my own language -- \"add them please.\" Pretty simple, right? It's what I would say to a human being, and the human would get it. And so would ChatGPT. Why can't Google Workspace? See how much software now has to be redesigned to meet the expectations of people who expect the ease of use of ChatGPT? ",
