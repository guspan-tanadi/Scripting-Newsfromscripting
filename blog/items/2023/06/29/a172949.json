    "text": "An outliner is a combination of a text editor and draw program. You have gestures to move objects that's similar to what you can do with objects in a draw program, but you also have the use of the keyboard to write and edit text. I just realized that as I was editing a complicated JSON structure, thinking the design of this is overblow, but I'm glad I am using an outliner to manipulate it, I'd be going crazy selecting stuff, cutting and pasting. All that is at a lower level, factored out of the user experience of the outliner. ",
