    "text": "Today I get to work on eye candy, a little app that sends a beautiful work of art to Bluesky every so often, taken from the thousands of art images that used to be posted regularly on Twitter as an act of love by a group of volunteers. Apparently Musk's Twitter shut them down, what a stupid thing to do. Musk should be focusing on streams of content that have value in and of themselves. Art is like that. It's like putting curtains on your windows. Strictly speaking you don't need them. But they make the place look better. I think Bluesky is the place for that right now. Update: <a href=\"https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bingeworthy.bsky.social/post/3jzd2w6ddzc2c\">First post</a> with an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/29/bluescreenshot.png?nodialog\">image</a>. Now comes the fun stuff, spiffing up the format and getting it uploading random pics on a schedule. Then I move it to a server and just enjoy the art as it floats by. ",
