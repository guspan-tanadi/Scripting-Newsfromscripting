Then a third and fourth and so on. The holes get a little better over time, deeper, new features, etc. But they're still holes. ",

Back in my youth, when the NYC power utility <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Edison\">Con Ed</a> dug up a <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/62710514\">street</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JulianneBond/status/585938323799171072\">they</a> posted a sign <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/weekinreview/once-again-for-con-ed-it-s-dig-we-must.html\">saying</a> \"Dig we must for a greater New York!\" That stuck with me. And if you think about it, it's just another instance of the use in the first explanation. ",
