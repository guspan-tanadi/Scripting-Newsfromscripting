    "text": "I wonder if now what I've been trying to do with RSS, blogging and podcasting, get underneath the bigco's and live on a plane that doesn't require any one of them, makes a bit more sense now. I'm at least a generation older than most of the other techies who cohabit this space. What you're seeing now for the second or third time, I've seen five or six times. The more times you see it the more predictable it gets, and the more confidence you have in your understanding. That's why, when <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">Google</a> tries to take control of the web I won't do it. All my freedom as a developer comes from the integrity of the web. Once it's gone you can't get it back. I feel the pull. I could convert completely to HTTPS, it would make my life a bit easier to do so. But I won't as long as Google is the one forcing it. If they back off and commit to not blocking the non-HTTPS web, then maybe I have more flexibility. ",
