    "text": "I'm looking for people with Bluesky accounts who want to write threads, ie multi-tweet threaded posts, very much like the what we had at thread.center, except for Bluesky. If you're into it, send me an email. I just want to verify that it works for other people before making it generally available. I'm betting we'll still be using Bluesky and other social nets after Facebook introduces their wonderful new system, tomorrow (we hear). Send me an email and I'll send you the URL for the docs. ",
