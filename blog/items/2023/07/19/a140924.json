You can see how dull and lifeless and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyfication\">disneyfied</a> a perfectly moderated social network is. Look at that new bullshit thing Facebook just came out with. It's really Instagram, that's how they got all their users so fast by just getting them to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/19/jumpThroughHoopDialog.png\">jump</a> through another hoop. You can stop reporting that it set records. They just came up with a new design and name for Instagram and said it was setting records, knowing that the reporters were bored of hating Zuckerberg, and now were ready to say he's cool again because he is trying to embarrass the <i>Asshole Du Jour</i> for journalists everywhere, Elon Musk. The thing you should say about Bluesky is that it's freaking nice that these people made a nice UI and backend for the social web and give it away for nothing. Yay Bluesky for believing in all of us. And come on if you think moderation is so great and you think it can be done for free, why don't you volunteer to do it. Yeah I didn't think so. ",
