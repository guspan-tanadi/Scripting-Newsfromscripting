Congrats to <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/\">Cory Doctorow</a> for coining a term that has so much lasting value. Everything turns to shit. Everything is enshitified. Is it time yet to <i>de</i>shitify everything? Back in the day at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext\">Living Videotext</a> we used to say \"We make shitty software, with bugs.\" It was true, and of course so does everyone else. We also said we will strive to make it less shitty. We didn't put that on t-shirts, but some grouches tagged the Wikipedia page for our products with that caveat. Warning Winer makes <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+shitty+software\">shitty software</a>. Quick get them some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelling_salts\">smelling salts</a>. Roll out the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fainting_couch\">fainting couch</a>. Someone found a bug. Okay so maybe a good name for a tech company is <a href=\"https://www.hover.com/domains/results?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Deshitifiers\">Deshitifiers</a>. Why not.",
