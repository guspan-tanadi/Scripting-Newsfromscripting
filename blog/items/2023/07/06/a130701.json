One thing they reallllly need is a browser interface, so it can exist on the same plane as the other social nets. i can't paste links back and forth between their network and others. even at that primitive level of interop, it doesn't exist. On Twitter I'm able to write fluidly esp now that the character limit is just a speed bump. I've never felt in any way like writing on a phone was writing. The big picture is no one gets that these tools are writing environments. so they design them to have features writers can use.  ",
