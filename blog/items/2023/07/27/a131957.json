I agree with all you said, had discovered it on my own, quickly -- that I could build on Mastodon's docs (and did), but the ActivityPub maze of specs is not an API, and not something a busy developer can approach. It all has to be simplified. We're still far away from the dream. As I said in my open voicemail -- it's time for developers to do a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html\">BDG</a> for the social web, with docs <i>and software, </i>that embraces not just Mastodon and other ActivityPub services, but also Bluesky, and WordPress, which has a very mature API, offers stability, a foundation with clear value.",
