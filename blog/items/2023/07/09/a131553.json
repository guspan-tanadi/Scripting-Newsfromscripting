    "text": "<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/07.html\">July 2003</a> was a big month in the podcasting. Lots of firsts. Chris Lydon interviewed me on this day in 2003 for the first podcast in his series of podcasts and by some reckoning, the first podcast ever. Certainly the first one I was involved in. It's a long story, oft-told, of how it was lucky that Chris and I were new fellows at Berkman in 2003, when we met and I told him about my dream of radio on the open web. Chris said yes. As they say, you can fake caring but you can't fake showing up. Chris and his producer Mary McGrath were regulars at our Thursday evening meetups/dinner parties. He went on to do a series of medium-defining interviews with the founders of the political, historic, literate and art blogosphere, a practice he and Mary (and team) continue to this day. Radio Open Source is certainly the longest continually running podcast. All these years later, we who love podcasting owe Chris and Mary our thanks for their pioneering efforts and sticking with it all this time. Here's a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20031107083002/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pictures/viewer$558\">picture</a> I took of Chris as we were doing that first episode of his 20-year magic podcast.
