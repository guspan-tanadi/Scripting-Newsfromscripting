    "text": "When I was a grad student, in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977\">middle</a> of the last century, there were two kinds of terminals in the computer lab, ones that could only display uppercase characters, and the coveted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazeltine_1500\">Hazeltine</a> terminals that could do also do lowercase. A real luxury item. I feel the same way as we approach the middle of the next century when I get to use boldface text or a bit of italic in a tweet. I laughed out loud when some text I pasted from my blog went through with its boldness intact. We have a long way to go to <a href=\"http://textcasting.org/\">get back</a> where we were. ",
