I've wanted to see RSS and Markdown get together. We put support for it in FeedLand, and now there's a way to add it to any WordPress site. This will, long-term, add styling and links to RSS feeds, without opening the door to all the nasty stuff. I've been doing all kinds of interesting stuff with this group. An amazing confluence of philosophy. ",
