    "text": "A number of years ago I was driving long distance on an interstate highway. If memory serves, I was going west to east on I-80 in the midwest. I wanted to know if there was a [[Starbucks]] on my route that I could stop at to get caffeine and connect to the net. This was before wireless internet service was broadly available. I struck out. Couldn't find a way to do it. Tomorrow I'm driving west to east again, this time toward <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod\">Cape Cod</a>, and will have a little time to kill in transit, and was hoping to find a Starbucks where I could load up on caffeine and hook up to the internet. I asked <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/95da70c8-28ad-4351-aabd-c42a2bd7f299\">ChatGPT</a>, which offered no answer, but suggested a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/search/Starbucks+near+I-90+between+Albany+NY+and+Worcester+MA/@42.1286138,-72.3792273,10z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu\">Google Maps query</a> that unfortunately didn't work. It just showed me Starbucks around one of the endpoints of my search, Worcester, Mass. So based on this benchmark we still live in information impoverished times. ",
