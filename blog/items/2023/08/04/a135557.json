    "text": "I've finished the first pass of my review of the <a href=\"http://docs2.feedland.org/readme.md\">FeedLand docs</a>. I converted them to Markdown, with the source hosted <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/tree/main/docs\">on GitHub</a>, to make it easy for people to see the changes over time, and to make bug reports. I want to get more systematic in working on FeedLand. When you're reading a docs page, there's a command in the menu that opens the same page in GitHub. If you're a FeedLand user, you may want to read the new docs, it's always a good idea I find to review the docs of products I use. You often see things you didn't pick up on the first time around. ",
