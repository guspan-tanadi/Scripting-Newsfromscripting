    "text": "We're having a reunion at <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/\">Berkman</a> on September 7th and 8th in Cambridge and of course I'm going. Just reviewed the schedule where there were several references to the term \"unconference.\" I think we should talk about how good ideas are usurped or erased. The term was actually coined at Berkman, to describe the <a href=\"http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html\">format</a> we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/06/22/rethinkingTheConference.html\">used</a> for the second day of the first BloggerCon in 2003 by one of our participants, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennpryor/\">Lenn Pryor</a>, who was at Microsoft at the time. The term was eventually taken over for a imho much less interesting conference format, one where the sessions are chosen in real time at the event, but the format of the sessions is the same one used by non-un-conferences. In our version the hallways are empty, in the other format, well it's business as usual, the interesting stuff happens outside the meeting room. Maybe a university could help make sure that true innovation is rewarded? Something perhaps to discuss at our reunion. I tried to write this comment on the website, but they only allow 280 characters. Anyway here's a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=unconference+site%3Ascripting.com\">Google search</a> for the term unconference on my blog. And a <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=unconference&hl=en\">Google Trends</a> search.",
