    "text": "Google did something I expect more tech companies will do, they use AI to help people figure out how to use their software. For example, they changed the way downloads work in Chrome. It used to be that when you clicked a download link, a tab would open at the bottom of the window, but now it's been <a href=\"https://mspoweruser.com/download-bar-missing-in-chrome/#:~:text=Google%20has%20moved%20the%20download,%2C%20Windows%2C%20and%20ChromeOS%20devices.\">hidden</a> behind a menu at the top of the window. How would I know that? So I kept clicking the download link, all the while starting another download of the file. Finally I looked in the Downloads folder on my Mac, and saw five downloads of the same file, creeping along slowly, because they were all competing with each other, slowing each other down. So I went to the Google search engine and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+downloads\">asked</a> about downloading from Chrome, and immediately it gave me <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/28/googleAiOnChrome.png\">the answer</a>. This is new, it's the result of having turned on Google's new AI for search. It showed me where I had to go to cancel the downloads, and I did. Problem solved. I still hate Google for what they're doing to the open web, but I know how to separate the good from the <a href=\"https://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">evil</a>. ",
