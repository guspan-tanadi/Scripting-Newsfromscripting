Sitting on the bench waiting for the shuttle while nice families and happy people went by made me feel more and more like an unhoused person, sprawled on a sidewalk in Manhattan. ",

(The room was a 10 minute drive, who knew how long a walk.) So he comes out and asks me questions to identify myself I guess to be sure I was entitled to a ride, and in answering his questions, which I felt were rude given that I had been waiting for his freaking shuttle bus for over an hour at this point (and I didn't say freaking, I said the impolite word it stands for) while I was listening for an apology which never came, which is probably part of the reason I was so irritated.
