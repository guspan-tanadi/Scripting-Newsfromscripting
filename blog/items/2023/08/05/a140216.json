In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_BfWwbCrw\">interview</a> with her husband, he said everyone's eyes were on her when they performed, I thought I was the only one. When I listen to a Talking Heads song with a strong beat (a lot of them) I think of her. That's what she represents, the driving power of the group is a woman. Try listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXdVgILd38U\">this song</a> and look at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AB5stBgMSi6KCAVa4-pV7pTOKKxwIwrtQw:1691244562327&q=tina+weymouth&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6mfb62MWAAxW2kIkEHQGiDhMQ0pQJegQIDRAB&biw=1663&bih=1151&dpr=2\">images</a> of her.",
