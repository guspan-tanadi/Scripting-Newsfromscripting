We talked about the technological beginnings of blogging, RSS and podcasting. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I wanted to do this with Andrew because I had not respected his books in the 00s that said the online world we were creating wasn't going to be too great. I thought of course here's a guy trying to make a buck by invalidating our hard and successful work. Well it turned out Andrew had it right -- and so did we. There's no new technology that can't be abused or have serious downsides. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it, because the flipside is also true. The answers to our problems can be found in the new tech. We tend to discount the good things that came from online computer tech and there are many. I don't do many interviews, but I like to do them with old friends like Guy Kawasaki and with people who I didn't respect well enough in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+andrew+keen\">the past</a>, like Andrew, to try to make amends. It was a good show. ",
