Then next week is the craziest yet, but with any luck it'll be the end the crazyness. The problem is rain. It just keeps coming. And it's <i>depressing. </i>The summer without the summer. Yeah I can go swimming most days, but it's almost never sunny and it seems it's raining every day. Welcome to the all-new Planet Earth. We have it easy here in the northeastern US, relatively speaking. Outrageous heat in the west where summer is usually cool. The fires in Maui, a place you'd never think would be inundated with fire. Our industrial world had a good run, now that's over. It's only going to get worse from here. What will we do? Hell if I know.  ",
