    "text": "I guess the <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=mets&collection=scriptingnews\">Mets</a> were reading my blog? In the lead-up to the trade deadline, they dumped the two three-time Cy Young winning pitchers, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer\">Scherzer</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander\">Verlander</a>, they bought in the last two years, presumably in an effort to buy a championship, which totally didn't materialize. They traded them for young prospects, players they can develop. Maybe the Mets realized that they can't buy a kickass team, and that real fans aren't inspired by money, we want love, and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html\">philosophy</a>. Maybe the Mets will once again be the Mets, in the spirit of Casey Stengel, Cleon Jones, Tom Seaver, Tug McGraw, Mookie Wilson and Ed Kranepool and far too many soulful players to mention in this small space.
