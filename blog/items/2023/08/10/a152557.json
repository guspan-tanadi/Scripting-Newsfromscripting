    "text": "<a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/268\">Braintrust query</a>: Back in July 2022, I <a href=\"http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000\">wrote</a> about supporting Markdown in RSS feeds. This is something \"FeedLand\" does, as a feed reader and editor. I would love to see all content editors and feed readers support it. One product in particular I'd like to support Markdown is WordPress. The challenge is to figure out how to convert the HTML in a post to Markdown  and then to get a <a href=\"http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000\">source:markdown</a> element in the corresponding item in the feed. Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss\">checklist</a> that explains how it works. If you have any interest in working on a plugin that does this please post something in this <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/268\">thread</a>. When this work I'd love to host a WordPress site that runs the plugin as a proof-of-concept and to test against. ",
