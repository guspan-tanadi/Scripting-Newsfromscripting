    "text": "I was once told by a famous and stupid NYT columnist that people my age have trouble learning about new tech, saying that I specifically had not aged well tech-wise. It was just an insult from a very stupid person, but it did hurt. Anyway, now that I'm much older I'd add aging means learning about all kinds of things, like sore and weak backs, knees, hips, memory, hair, lower metabolism, and all kinds of other things. My father as his health declined kept saying old age ain't for sissies, and I could see it in his body and his suffering, and now begin to feel it in my own. My advice -- ignore idiotic young folk, they'll find out soon enough, you don't need to explain it to them.",
