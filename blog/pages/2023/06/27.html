I'm neutral. I don't know what it is. I seriously doubt it'll be exciting. And I think they should stop calling themselves Meta, that's stupid and dishonest. They're Facebook.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162329"></a>I got a call from someone deep in Amazon, their CTO who reads my blog had asked him to call to see if he could help, but I had no time. I had to leave. 1.35 million reasons.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/27/162204.html#a162329" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
