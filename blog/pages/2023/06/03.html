So you can walk a network of followship, and get ideas of who to subscribe to that way. Click a checkbox and you're connected. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html#a163124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a032814"></a>That makes it easy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering">peer</a> with social networks, if they support OPML subscription lists and <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds of posts. And -- as of <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a135024">May 24</a>, we now have that implemented for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22">Bluesky</a>, through their API.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html#a032814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a032708"></a>I've spent the last few days teaching FeedLand how to do with Bluesky what it does with old school RSS feeds. Today I got it working. Real sense of accomplishment. Not deployed yet, but I'm pretty sure it will be soon. The <a href="https://www.smallpieces.com/">pieces</a> fit together amazingly well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html#a032708" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164131"></a>If you're a regular FeedLand user who also uses Bluesky, please respond to <a href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3jxbljxkizc2f">this post</a>. I'd like to loop you in on the new stuff when it's ready for testing. You don't actually need a Bluesky account to get the benefit, that's the cute/cool thing about it. We're bringing Bluesky to the open web. ðŸ˜€<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html#a164131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
