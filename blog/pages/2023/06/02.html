<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162753"></a>More Succession. People wonder how can they like a show where everyone is ugly. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that the main character of the show isn't human -- it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0WzqanwlG0">The Song</a>. Maybe it's just a 4-season-long music video. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/02.html#a162753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160714"></a>Newsletter apps have had their moment, now WordPress has one, and wonderfully it has inadvertently plied open the <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/30/173742.html?title=substackLockin">lock-in</a> that Substack imposes, by making everyone use their editor. WordPress has a time-tested API, so I could theoretically write my newsletters in <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> and push them up to WordPress which would then send them out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/02.html#a160714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
