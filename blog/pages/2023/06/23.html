The same way they tried to kill the Mac in the early-mid 90s. They don't report on anything other than their own dreams.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/23.html#a022947" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220414"></a><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is a starting point. What you add to it is what makes it interesting. We've used RSS to convey news articles, and we love that, and will always support it, but there are breakthroughs to come.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/23.html#a220414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

For whatever reason the people who are there now are creative, interested, and stimulated because they sense the presence of similar people. Kind of like Clubhouse was a few summers ago. This tells me something I've suspected, that small-size social networks have a place. They shouldn't just be an accidental thing that disappears because growth attracts less interesting, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/destructive">anti-creative</a> people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/23.html#a220054" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
