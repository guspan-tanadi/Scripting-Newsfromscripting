That's the hardest part of quitting, getting over the physical addiction.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/14.html#a183558" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was stuck trying to figure out how to encode some text in a sticky corner. I had tried the first two methods I usually use, and neither worked. I was about to give up and back out of the feature when I thought to explain the problem to ChatGPT and ask for a suggestion, and it included pragmatic issues like it really mattered to me that I not have to bring another toolkit into the mix. It suggested something I hadn't considered, a third way, and it worked, and I can move on. How do you put a value on that kind of contribution? It's like a programming partner that knows everything basically and is always there to help out and doesn't charge for their time. Pretty amazing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/14.html#a163448" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
