<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163356"></a>I'm doing a Bluesky thread writer and publisher. Here's an example of a <a href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bingeworthy.bsky.social/post/3jxy72dbzxy2r">thread</a> it published just now. I had ChatGPT write a story about the many kinds of bread in the world and pushed that out as a thread of nine. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/12/threadCenterScreen.png">Screen shot</a> at the end of business today. This was the first Node.js app I wrote for Twitter back in 2014, it was called <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/11/06/twitterLovesLittlePorkChop.html">Little Pork Chop</a>. Maybe you remember. Now it's the first app I wrote for Bluesky. Should have it usable in a day or two, knock wood. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/12.html#a163356" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
