<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160608"></a>Here's a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/artshow.bsky.social">new feed for Bluesky</a> I put together in a couple of days. It's based on feeds on Twitter that were shut down in the great twitter app blackout that periodically spooled great art in the middle of all the hubub and todo of Twitter. I loved it. And missed it. So I brought it back. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/30.html#a160608" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I feel pretty good about how this is going. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/30.html#a162316" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161026"></a>As a software developer and marketer, I really don't care what goes over the wire, as long as I know what to do and it doesn't break. The main arguments in RSS-land were whether or not to rip up the pavement and start over. I'm pretty much always against that. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/30.html#a161026" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
