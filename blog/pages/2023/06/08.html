<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215424"></a>Blocking prevents spammers from replying to your tweets, denying them a chance to hitch a ride on your flow. These days a very high percentage or replies are spam, a lot of it abusive. Giving users the tool to help you keep your moderation costs down Elon.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/08.html#a215424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Now that I have this great Bluesky feedlist browser I don't know where to point it. I think the truth is that these social networks we've created don't actually do anything. They're just ways to pass the time, like the movies Netflix makes. The ones that really work are the ones you can put on in the background and pay no attention to while your attention is scattered on other things you're only partially paying attention to, sporadically. The sad truth is that everything is all bullshit top to bottom 24 hours a day 7 days a week, around the globe. When aliens discover the remains of our civilization they'll find we self-destructed out of boredom. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/08.html#a165901" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We've done it all, the human species. Fought against all kinds of extinction, and for a while we won. It's like in sports, once you've won the championship, the second time it's getting pointless, and by the third or fourth you really should hang it up. Thinking of LeBron James or Steph Curry, as examples. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/08/230438.html#a230443" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Well we won. Our species was trying to dominate everything and we did it. Now we have no purpose, and while we may not be conscious of this as individuals or collectively, it plays out in our having no idea what we should do. So we pass the time watching Netflix and Twitter, Youtube and Tiktok. Arguing about meaningless bullshit. Passing the time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/08/230438.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>If we had evolved to be a truly motivated species, we would reinvent ourselves, but we aren't that. We're a stupid selfish individualistic species, evolved to survive in a kill or be killed environment. We have no goal, no purpose, no meaning, so we might as well hang it up and that's what we're doing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/08/230438.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
