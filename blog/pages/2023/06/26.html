Most company info if documented at all is scattered, depends on Google for search, and it increasingly sucks. I spent <i>years</i> not finding a crucial piece of technical info about a company whose products I depend on, till I asked the question on my blog for the Nth time, and most people don’t have the ability to do that. And that's info the company <i>wants</i> people to have, and it ’s well documented on their site. We were supposed to be creating an information rich world, but so far it hasn’t worked. Someone should step up and be the example, reap the competitive benefits.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/26.html#a052238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
