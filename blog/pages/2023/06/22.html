That was good enough for me to give it a try, that and it got <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/swagger">excellent ratings</a> via Metacritic. I'm now most of the way through the first season, it's really good, kind of a cross between <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/friday-night-lights">Friday Night Lights</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire">The Wire</a>, with a bit of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/atlanta">Atlanta</a>. Takes place in Baltimore, the story centers on a 14-year-old star-to-be and his life in the same city as The Wire, during the early days of Covid, based on the life story of NBA star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant">Kevin Durant</a>.  An urban version of Friday Night Lights, which I had been working my way through, loving the first two seasons but the show got pretty bad by the third imho. Season 1 of Swagger is very good. I'm on episode 7. Season 2 starts tomorrow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/22.html#a123559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
