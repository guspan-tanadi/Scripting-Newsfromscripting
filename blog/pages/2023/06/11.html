<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145353"></a>I was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@shoq/110516792922874801">asked</a> on Mastodon what role <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> played in developing RSS, since he is often credited with co-developing it. This is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/110520163594030698">what I wrote</a>. "There was a lot of confusion about what RSS was until RSS 2.0 came out and the NYT adopted it. There was a thread based on RDF, and Aaron was credited as a contributor to that. I would ask those people what he did. I never worked with him. I saw some of his posts on their mail list and met him a few times at conferences. He was a precocious young person, obviously smart, but he didn't seem interested in what I was working on. That's about it."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/11.html#a145353" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195159"></a>A small favor from ChatGPT, now when I'm working on a writing tool (basically always) I don't have to use my own writing for test cases. For example, <a href="http://ai.scripting.com/2023/06/11/summer-love-s-everlasting-imprint.html">here's</a> "150 words about the freshness of summer and how the best memories of love and happiness are summer memories."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/11.html#a195159" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145152"></a>In general on social media if someone posts a bit that's an oft-repeated bit of wisdom from the cable networks, I delete it, esp if it's from someone I don't know. I could watch MSNBC if I wanted to. No need to practice such idiocratic punditry online, imho of course ymmv. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/11.html#a145152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
