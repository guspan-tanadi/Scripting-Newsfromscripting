	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165817"></a>One of the nice things about <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> is we can all look at each other's feed lists to get ideas about what to subscribe to.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/18/165754.html#a165817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165847"></a>Yesterday I was playing with ideas, looking at a bunch of different people's collections, and I saw in <a href="https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1">John Naughton's feed list</a> a reminder of a centerpiece of the early blogging world, weblogs.com. You could quickly see which blogs had updated recently so you knew there was a reason to go there. It was the beginning of what eventually became Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/18/165754.html#a165847" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165903"></a>Over time as more blogs came online, it got diluted, we had to come up with something better and luckily <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> came along, and without much thought we switched over to that and weblogs.com fell into disuse. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/18/165754.html#a165903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165953"></a>Looking at <a href="https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1">Naughton's list</a> I had the old weblogs.com feeling! These are all people I'm interested in, but I don't have them in their own category anywhere, so I never see it like that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/18/165754.html#a165953" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170011"></a>With a bit of coordination it would be pretty cool to have a FeedLand page that tracked a bunch more Old School bloggers who are still blogging, or give ones who aren't a reason to restart. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/18/165754.html#a170011" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
