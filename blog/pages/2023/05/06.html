Nor does mine. Here's why I think that. Most of my relatives had strong opinions and stated them often and did not welcome dissent. My father and mother. Both grandfathers. My maternal grandmother. Uncle Ken. They all had opinions about everything. Sometimes they even changed their minds, to their credit. And one hid something about himself that I learned later from Wikipedia (amazingly my maternal grandfather was a communist, still not sure I believe it, Wikipedia is often full of misinfo). Anyway the point is that all the people I listed are now dead. If anyone cared about their opinions when they were alive (I don't think anyone did) they certainly don't care about them now. Soon enough you and I will be dead. So go ahead and have the opinions if it makes you happy. But if it makes you miserable, as it often did for my relatives, consider not bothering because simply does not matter. And the stupid thing is we've built our networks around the idea that opinions matter. Think of all the wasted bandwidth and server space. Maybe it'd be better if the AI bots win. At least they don't repeat themselves all the time with complaints about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti">graffiti</a> and whatnot. BTW I loved all the people I listed above even if I didn't enjoy their opinions very much. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/06.html#a124058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

On the radio, someone talking about Facebook and making a lot of sense. Usually on NPR they talk bullshit about Facebook. It was Cory Doctorow, who in my experience is an extreme &lt;bleep>.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141154"></a>Along with the monthly fee, add a certain number of API calls to every user who pays. Then devs could make products for them, without having to pay Twitter. Make the thing self-funding so individuals could play not just corporations. Twitter is more of an end-user thing than a corporate thing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/06/141135.html#a141154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141205"></a>For  $1 more per month, include some JSON storage for the user, accessible to the apps they grant access to, thus moving into an area AWS should be in but refuses to go. Storage that goes with identity for people not just techies. A retail-ized version of Amazon S3. It will be an <i>enormous</i> business. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/06/141135.html#a141205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141155"></a>I'd comp devs who make software, and give them a special icon so people know to ask them for features. Incentives.
