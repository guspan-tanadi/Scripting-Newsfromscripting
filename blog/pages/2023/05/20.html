<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122101"></a>Watched the Miami Heat roll over the Boston Celtics last night. If the Heat win, no matter who wins in the West I can't imagine I'll watch the Finals this year. I am really pulling for the Celtics to come from behind and wipe the smile off Jimmy Butler's face. Butler has never won a championship and I desperately want it to <i>stay that way.</i> But I have no feelings for Denver and I can't decide who I despise more LeBron James or Butler. But I will watch Game 3 on Sunday night, after <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a> of course, because that's what really matters. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/20.html#a122101" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
