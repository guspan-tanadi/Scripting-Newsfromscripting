The sub-title would be "As If Anyone Cares." Because that's what we do. We make statements. We ask questions no one is listening to. We serve as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/substrate">substrate</a> for people to post spam. I know I'm exaggerating. I just posted a <a href="https://staging.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3jvju7twmk22d">thread</a> on <a href="https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=blueski">Blueski</a>, and by the end I remembered no one would get this far. The top message got two Likes. It did make me feel good to write it, for a moment, but it was quickly forgotten. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/12.html#a132549" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And since journalism doesn't cover itself, we never look at their motives when discussing the news. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/12/122333.html#a120522" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122534"></a>If we did, we'd have no trouble <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/12/trump-town-hall-cnn-staff-rages">parsing</a> the CNN "town hall" presentation of candidate Donald Trump. Paraphrasing what <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/">Les Moonves</a>, former CEO of CBS said about Trump in 2016. "[Trump] may not be good for America, but [he's] damn good for CNN." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/12/122333.html#a122534" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122401"></a>You can raise the price of ads with Trump. That's obviously what CNN hopes to do. Trump, who has been deprecated by Fox, needs a mainstream outlet. There's no mystery why all the people in the town hall audience were Trump supporters, that obviously was a Trump condition. He probably chose the reporter, the questions, and came prepared to get talked about, which appears to be happening. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/12/122333.html#a122401" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
