<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195648"></a>Something interesting to ponder. When we have <a href="http://textcasting.org/">Textcasting</a>-compatible social media networks, there will be no more wall between blogging and tweeting or tooting. And then we will be able to choose our writing tools and they could be blogging tools as easily as they are the tiny little writing boxes Twitter et al give us. Blogging tools are equipped to deal with titles, styles, links, enclosures, no length limit, editing. These might seem like luxuries now, but once we have them, we'll be amazed that we put up without them for so long when they were very very very very easy to implement. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29.html#a195648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Bluesky is the first that I've had an OPML interface to work with. So I created an outliner for walking the structure of people and who they follow on Bluesky. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29.html#a154524" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193959"></a>I am an infrequent SQL query writer. My knowledge of the language is pretty limited, but I'm pretty good at understanding the kinds of things it can do, and since I am an experienced programmer, I can specify my needs in fairly accurate technical terms, they just don't happen to be in the SQL programming language. That's where ChatGPT is very useful! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/193942.html#a193959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194222"></a>In the old days before ChatGPT I'd write a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22braintrust+query%22">braintrust query</a>, put it on my blog and the odds were pretty good that in 24 hours I'd have the answer, and would feel grateful and proud. That of course would be after putting in a few minutes trying to find the answer using Google and StackExchange. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/193942.html#a194222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194431"></a>I edited it a bit because it assumed field names where I used slightly different names. And I never said that fields had URLs that identify them, and we must use that, not the unique integer ID that each row also has. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/193942.html#a194431" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194536"></a>It worked. Turns out there are 872 feeds in <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>'s database that have no subscribers. I'm looking for ways to make the feed reading part of FeedLand perform better, and time spent reading feeds no one is watching could be a place for savings. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/193942.html#a194536" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134312"></a>A nice thing about Succession: The Roy kids could fuck each other up and all the while they're still a family. They spent a lot of time on that in the last episode. Trying to give us a glimpse of the future for them. Now the ways the hurt each other will be more mundane, more like a normal 0.0001 percenter. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/134519.html#a134312" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134922"></a>Succession is a parody, that's what makes it so entertaining. And they play games with us, distract us into overlooking what was obvious -- what eluded all three of the kids, even though the adults were constantly reminding them that they didn't compete at the level they thought they did. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/134519.html#a134922" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222106"></a>I can't speak for anyone else, but I was led astray by this speech from Karl, about Tom: “You’re a clumsy interloper and no one trusts you. The only guy pulling for you is dead. And now, you’re just married to the ex-boss’ daughter, and she doesn’t even like you. And you are fair and squarely fucked.”<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/29/134519.html#a222106" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
