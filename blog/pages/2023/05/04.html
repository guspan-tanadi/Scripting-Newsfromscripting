How to make it possible for there to be lots of social media apps that we all use, without turning us all into copy/paste robots. We've been here before, with the internet itself and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> and the web with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>. The same process will yield a result that's good for social media users and developers, and will allow social networks to evolve without being dominated by the Silicon Valley cartel. We've been down that road, and we now know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">where</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">it</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">ends</a>.<i>16 minutes.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/04.html#a145706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142003"></a>Each social net we belong to should have a feed coming out of it, virtually or for real, that contains a stream of all messages from accounts I'm subscribed to. How they do it behind the interface is up to each network, as with TCP/IP. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/142200.html#a142003" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132751"></a>I definitely want Bluesky to just go away. I don't like it because if it gains traction it has potential of replacing Twitter as the festering turd in the middle of what should have been a vibrant growing market that keeps anything else from rising in competition with it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/133259.html#a132751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133930"></a>To people who say "Oh Dave but it's federated and it has an open protocol" -- yes I've heard that, but there are all kinds of games you can play, such that even if it's true (and so far it isn't), no competitor ever rises, or as soon as they do, they are foreclosed on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/133259.html#a133930" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133254"></a>I don't like it because it's Jack Dorsey. You say "Oh Dave but Jack is just a board member" to which I say oh please, I wasn't born yesterday. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/133259.html#a133254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133813"></a>The only way out of this Jack-induced nightmare is for: 1. It to fail quietly and 2. Jack to sit the fuck down and do something other than plant huge turds in the middle of what should be a vibrant thriving open market, which means there are lots of entrants, choice, and opporunities for cooperation and innovation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/133259.html#a133813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133834"></a>If having a license from <i>The Jack</i> is a requirement, well we've already wasted 17 years on Twitter waiting for that to become something wonderful and it's fair to say now that it never did and never will, so Jack please enjoy your wealth and play somewhere else and leave Twitter and post-Twitter alone.
