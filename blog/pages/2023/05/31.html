<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193110"></a>What if the blogosphere of 20 years ago traveled to the future and saw what remains of Google, Twitter and Facebook and got a taste of ChatGPT, Mastodon and Bluesky. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/31.html#a193110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145453"></a>I asked ChatGPT to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/6ce97dcb-7023-48c8-ac8c-8bac467a56b5">write a description</a> of my linkblogging tool, and it came up with something far more hyped that I would ever write, but actually I think I should write this kind of copy for my products. I told it nothing about my product other than it was a linkblogging tool.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/31.html#a145453" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134845"></a>I've already watched the last episode of Succession about five times, and I expect to watch it a few more. As my understanding grows, I hear different parts. I swear there could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon">QAnon</a> thing going on here. Anyway, yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/30.html#a122242">wrote</a> about bullshit and about how Tom didn't win if winning means being the chosen successor of Logan Roy. That was the Swede. My jaw dropped when <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/30/bullshitBullshitEverythingsBullshit.png">Roman said</a> they were bullshit. There's that word. <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/30.html#a122242">Bullshit</a>. The kids were bullshit. Nothing. Tom was a great choice to be the new Gerri. The book closes so neatly. The ending wasn't dramatic like the ending of the Sopranos or Mad Men, or clever like Six Feet Under. it was more like the ending of The Wire, things just wound down in a natural way. The truth was the people who really run the world (a "world of a father," says Shiv) are Logans. The people we see on the news shows are Toms. We never hear from the children.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/31.html#a134845" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140506"></a>BTW "world of a father" is interesting. Remember <a href="https://twitter.com/successionreact/status/1459240142586138624">Marcia said</a> "He made you a playground and you think it's the world."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/31.html#a140506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
