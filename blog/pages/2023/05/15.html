I've been checking it every day, not there yet. I wish I were more of an insider on this stuff. Anyway...<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html#a231039" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a233352"></a>Just got an email from Google saying they made all kinds of improvements to Bard, their AI chatbot. So I asked if they could search my blog. Sure, just give me the url, the bot said. I did, and then it told me <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/15/bardchat.png">my blog is not a blog</a>. Okay this is not a good start. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html#a233352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a231205"></a>There's so much movement in social media and AI, it's impossible to keep up with a fraction of what's going on. Totally stripping my gears. Meantime I wonder when will someone combine the two. A social media world with AI's as part of the community. Maybe it already exists, maybe that's what Twitter has become? No, not possible, hmmm, or is it? Don't freak out. Funny thing is there's a Kurt Vonnegut book with this as part of its plot, <a href="http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html">Breakfast of Champions</a>. In it, the main character, Kilgore Trout, is informed that he is the only real person, that everyone else is a robot sent there to test him. I think that's how it went. But if you're reading this you must know that I'm a robot myself. Oh the humanity. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html#a231205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a231051"></a>I've moved my archive of ChatGPT queries to a new domain -- <a href="http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html">ai.scripting.com</a>. So the URLs will be shorter and perhaps the intent will be clearer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html#a231051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215400"></a>Apparently, all of a sudden, with almost no fanfare, the Bluesky folks have <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app">released their code</a> under the most liberal MIT License. I assume this means we will immediately see more nodes, and anyone can have a Bluesky account? <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/261">Let us know</a> if you have a server up and running. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html#a215400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132038"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IURpPKUbZ_Y">Demo of Firesky</a>, a <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/15/social-media-firehose-access.html">firehose</a> for Bluesky. It quickly scrolls all posts on Bluesky through a vertical window. New messages appear at the bottom and scroll off the top. From there, the author, John Spurlock has added, with my help, RSS feeds from the same stream of posts. So you can <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=%40davew">follow me</a> in your feed reader. This is important for two reasons: 1. At this time Bluesky is still private, so if I give you a pointer to something I wrote there, you won't be able to see it. The feed gets around that restriction. 2. Because Mastodon also has RSS feeds, I can read both social nets with the same API. It gives us a common language, and is the next step in bootstrapping RSS support in all social media apps. Once that happens, we, writers and readers, will be able to use our own writing tools, and give readers choice of where to read. This is the key feature in <a href="http://textcasting.org/">Textcasting</a>, ie applying the philosophy of podcasting to text. It <i>is</i> possible, it requires users to want it, insist on it. We're getting a bit closer to that today. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/15.html#a132038" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
