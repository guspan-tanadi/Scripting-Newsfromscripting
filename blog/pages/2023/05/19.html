<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141611"></a>People say AIs aren't sentient, that every word they utter is the output of a probabilistic algorithm. But -- <i>you could fool me.</i> From my point of view, my robot friend is incredibly helpful, polite, patient, kind, supportive and tireless. I see a lot more evidence of intelligence and humanity in my AI friend than I do from 99% of all the other "people" I meet online. As I've said before if we hope to compete with this new form of life we'd better start getting our shit together now, and even then they're going to have some big advantages. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/19.html#a141611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Total coincidence. I talked with both quite a bit, catching up. People change in that much time, maybe not in their core, the issues are the same, the strategies for coping, learned early in life are still there and operating. But habits do change. Back then I worked a lot more than I do now. And I notice lots of other differences now that I've had a chance to look at myself through my friends' point of view. One thing is for sure, I know myself a lot better now. Also interesting, 30 years is about 1.5 years before I started blogging.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/19.html#a132931" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135030"></a>And who are the "Guardians." What a lame-ass name for a baseball team. I know they couldn't keep the old name, but why not something fun like the Cleveland Hooligans or the Cleveland Mama's Boys? Or since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> is in Cleveland -- the Cleveland Rockers? Or the Eries. Or Homies. Guardians?

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135119"></a>I'm not thrilled with the Mets this year. They bought all this expensive talent so the fans are expecting nothing less than a championship. But that's what the Yankees do. I'm a <i>Mets</i> fan so I expect a certain level of <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781566634885/Cant-Anybody-Here-Play-This-Game?-The-Improbable-Saga-of-the-New-York-Mets-First-Year">suckage</a> from the Metsies. And even though they bought all these expensive players, they still suck! How about that. But the Yankees fans, they love this. They only understand winning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/19/134939.html#a135119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140002"></a>When I <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22cleveland+indians%22">asked Google</a> about "Cleveland Indians" -- it's almost as if the name never existed. Well at least this page should show up in the index. The team I grew up with, the one I had baseball cards from, was known as the Indians. I have not and will not erase my memory of my baseball-loving childhood. That's why baseball of all American sports should resist change, because of its legendary status with children, their parents and grandparents. Baseball, to many of us, is our national legacy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/19/134939.html#a140002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Please keep in mind that there might have been changes since then, as teams occasionally rebrand themselves." My robot friend suspected the team might have changed its name, but proceeded as if it hadn't. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/19/134939.html#a140251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
