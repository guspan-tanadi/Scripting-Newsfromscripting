<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012928"></a>It might not be possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification">de-Nazify</a> social nets like Twitter, Mastodon or Bluesky -- yet that seems to be what users want. Which leads to a big question, what is the purpose of these networks? Has anyone ever tried to write that down?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/27.html#a012928" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a035229"></a>What if for the sake of argument there were lots of Mastodon or Bluesky instances that didn't connect to any other instances, that just served little communities, maybe gathered around a blog, for example. Each one being its own Reddit type thing, or a micro-Twitter. Not part of anything bigger than themselves. And what if it were reallllly easy to start one of these things. And, what if it were carefully designed to do at least what the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">Textcasting</a> spec calls for. What if. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/27.html#a035229" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There was an Italian bakery on the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7731255,-73.7952689,3a,75y,335.51h,75.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s85YMHq9DXGPKJPqzMLS-cQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">corner</a> of Francis Lewis Blvd and 26th Ave. This was back when I could eat beautiful creations like this without too much guilt. The bakery is gone, btw.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/27.html#a035816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I expect the answer to 1 is "yes" if you write your own code, but the official Bluesky server source has not been released yet.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/27/204615.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
