Here's an example, Matt Haughey's <a href="http://xoxo.zone/@mathowie.rss">feed</a> on Mastodon, as <a href="https://feedland.org/?river=http%3A%2F%2Fxoxo.zone%2F%40mathowie.rss">viewed in FeedLand</a>. These posts, as you <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/20/titlelessPostsInFeedland.png">can see</a>, have no titles. So we bold-up the first sentence, or if it's too long, a big part of it. They look different from titled posts, but now that we've lived with this for a few weeks, I think it works. Might still do some tweaks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/20.html#a233943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235202"></a><a href="https://this.how/publicFolder/">Public Folder</a> is a utility I depend on. Created when Dropbox eliminated its "public" folder. Works the same way, create, update or delete files in a special folder, and it syncs with a location on S3. Strictly doesn't have to be a public location, that's up to how S3 is configured. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/20.html#a235202" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
