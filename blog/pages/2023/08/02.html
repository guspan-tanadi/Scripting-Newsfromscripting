As president he ruled like an autocrat, with contempt for the most American idea, that we pick our own leaders. So the jury will be asked to decide if he should go to jail for being an autocratic president. In other words, will the system validate itself. It's like asking a program to decide if it's functioning correctly. If the validator works, it should reject any argument that Trump makes. Sorry, you're going to jail because you tried to rob us of our right as citizens to replace you with Joe Biden. It's pure, brilliant, gets right to the heart of the matter. Is our system of voting real, <i>do</i> we choose the president, or does our system crumble when it's violated by its top official. Finally we're asking the right question, making the correct accusation. And if it's decided the way it should obviously be decided our country says no to this bullshit, no matter what a bunch of our fellow citizens want. We had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">revolution</a> to get rid of the king.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/02.html#a010128" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012156"></a>What made the news worth watching tonight was that finally the most important question was asked -- will our system defend itself? Finally, we've gotten around to insisting that this question be answered. And a jury of Americans will make the decision. How perfectly American.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/02.html#a012156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
