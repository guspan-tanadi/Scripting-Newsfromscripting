<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141259"></a>There should be a system call in Node.js that calls me back when all the threads I just launched have completed.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142234"></a>An immediate improvement AI could make for developers are making the error messages from language interpreters and runtimes better at pointing to the actual source of the problem, not just where it shows up. That would require some guesswork, but it's better to have the computer do some of that before turning it over to the human. The same way it can make medical doctors work easier. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/13.html#a142234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135557"></a>My generation of software developers totally fucked this up. Everyone went their own way. Nowhere near enough working together. There was some collaboration however with people in the news world, and we created media that empowered millions of individuals to publish. We got stuff done, but we could have done much better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/13/135457.html#a135557" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
