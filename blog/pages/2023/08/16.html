I don't believe them. I saw the race, and gender and age, of the black women in the Atlanta justice system, moving around DJ Trump's condemnation, the pieces of paper that should end him. I laughed out loud about how freaking appropriate this was. America is <i>all</i> of us, and we all have equal power at least when it comes to voting and <a href="https://this.how/blackLivesMatter/">existing</a>, though assholes like Trump would have you believe only people who look and smell like him matter. Trump did the worst thing he could possibly do, played stupid, visible, not even slightly under the radar of law enforcement, games with the franchise of all Georgians. And what a great reminder America is all us. Us. E pluribus unum. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/16.html#a103052" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a102337"></a>I've always been fascinated by the history of NYC. It's where I was born and raised, so for me it's personal, and besides -- it's a very interesting place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/16/102319.html#a102337" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a102408"></a>For me the most interest is in its evolution. And you can see in this picture, 499 years after it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_(state)#:~:text=European%20discovery%20of%20New%20York,in%201609%20by%20the%20Dutch.">discovered</a>, why humans decided this was the place to build an amazing city -- look at the size and shape of the port and how it's protected from the ocean. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/16/102319.html#a102408" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
