	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131639"></a>This is about a service that is sold to end users and developers. The users pay for the service, and developers invest in it. Once it's up and running it will be the foundation for the web as an open platform for users and developers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131639" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130536"></a>Until recently I was using Twitter as my identity service. I knew there was some risk, but as long as one of the original founders was still involved, I felt it was pretty safe. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a130536" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130640"></a>Then with new ownership, I had to quickly pivot to create my own identity system, based on email. It took four months from beginning to end to transition <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> and <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a>. The rest of my products that used Twitter identity were left to break. I wrote about this effort in the <a href="http://roadmap.feedland.org/">roadmap doc</a> for FeedLand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a130640" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130759"></a>Every developer needs the same service. And it's a mess for users that there's a new identity system for every app. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a130759" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130900"></a>Users need storage. I have to provide them storage for their writing in Drummer, and in FeedLand for things like bookmarks, their personal feeds (ones they generate). Again, I have no interest in this. But I have to do it. And I am stuck paying for their files. <i>They</i> should be paying for them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a130900" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214029"></a>And if my service should ever go off the air, they lose their data (I also provide ways for them to back up their data, but no surprise a lot of them don't do it). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a214029" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213957"></a>No surprise there's almost no developer community for the web in 2023.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131126"></a>An identity service as a business. Operated by a strong company with longevity and a good track record for treating users and developers fairly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131126" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131132"></a>A standard OAuth interface for logging on. Can handle multiple identities per user, make it easy to switch from one to the other. Prior art, look at how Twitter or Bluesky do this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131132" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131209"></a>No per-app storage. Rather functional storage. A folder for PNG images, a folder for OPML outlines, or Markdown files, graphs, spreadsheets, or whatever. And make it easy to form projects with files of whatever type. So a user can have 15 programs that use OPML files and decide which get access to the OPML folder. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131209" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132303"></a>Here's a key point -- such a system enforces the need for interop. Teaches users they have a right to demand it. When users know this, good things happen in markets. (Example: Podcasting has not gotten siloized because users know they have a right to choice in listening apps.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a132303" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131447"></a>Amazon should do this but for some reason hasn't. They have end-user identity working (their shopping system) and they lead everyone in storage as a service. Connecting the dots seems to be incredibly easy for them, but they haven't done it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html#a131447" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a121851"></a>When I started at Harvard in 2003, one of the first things I did was get my official ID card. When I got it, there was my picture. Underneath that was my name, and underneath that my status: Officer. It was a bit breathtaking. A few minutes before I was a schmuck.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a121913"></a>What an unusual perspective. Here's a place where saying someone is human is saying something. A familiar tweak I haven't felt in a while -- I am once again living in the future. 2023 has been like that for me, a lot of living in the past, and bringing it forward into the future, and then living in that future. I hope to do a lot more of that. Shoveling ideas from 20+ years ago that never got a chance into the future. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/121628.html#a121913" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
