That's where I'm headed. Anyway, <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/23.html">last week</a> I thought it worked, but hadn't tested the accessToken WP returns, and it was getting mangled going back and forth to my server. I've <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordpressIdentity/blob/main/worknotes.md#82623-121410-pm-by-dw">worked that out</a> today. I think it's going to be relatively smooth sailing from here, but I thought that a few days ago too. Praise Murphy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26.html#a185717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183830"></a>To anyone who thinks ChatGPT is useless, have a look at <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/7ecef75d-7fb4-475c-940e-7834258da3e5">this transcript</a> of a programming session I just did. If you know anything about programming, you can see a really high quality collaboration going on here. Of course I am communicating with the AI. It's brilliant, as smart at programming as I am. Seriously. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26.html#a183830" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155410"></a>Someday there will be a new twitter-like service with one feature that will blow the doors off this hugely dormant product area. Just support Markdown in your posts. That's it. (Wait there's more. Let's get a really nice RSS feed going for your service, just copy the <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">design</a> we did for Bluesky) and that'll be the knockout punch. Now federation becomes as simple as supporting these two features. No complex server stuff. Low tech and weblike.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26.html#a155410" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153221"></a>I've been writing about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com">future-safe</a> archives for many years, a way to put down $10K or so, and guarantee best efforts to keep my web presence going long after my death. But I expected it would be implemented by a long-lived university with the help of an insurance company, which is by definition a long-lived entity. It's good that <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/">Automattic is thinking</a> about this (there is no published plan, so far just an idea), maybe they'll seek a partnership with Harvard or Oxford, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London">Lloyds of London</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26.html#a153221" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Sitting on the bench waiting for the shuttle while nice families and happy people went by made me feel more and more like an unhoused person, sprawled on a sidewalk in Manhattan. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a143727" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150002"></a>I returned to the hotel lobby, a total of three times while waiting, asking them to call the shuttle bus driver <i>again,</i> but on the third time they said the hotel manager would drive me to my room himself. (The room was a 10 minute drive, who knew how long a walk.) So he comes out and asks me questions to identify myself I guess to be sure I was entitled to a ride, and in answering his questions, which I felt were rude given that I had been waiting for his freaking shuttle bus for over an hour at this point (and I didn't say freaking, I said the impolite word it stands for) while I was listening for an apology which never came, which is probably part of the reason I was so irritated. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a150002" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150501"></a>Later when we were seated in his SUV he told me that I needed to be "civil" and not use f-bombs (I was sitting quietly at the time waiting to be taken to my freaking room so I could get over this hangover that was forming) and that was enough for me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a150501" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150118"></a>I paused and said the kind of thing you wished you would have said at the time but I never had the guts before to say. Use your imagination. He got out of the SUV and left me sitting there. I don't know what he expected me to do. I eventually got out of the SUV and saw that the lost shuttle bus had finally arrived, and I got on it, and the manager once again lectured me on proper social behavior, from outside the bus, and I looked at him and told him to literally get lost. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a150118" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150601"></a>The driver then drove off, and we had a mostly pleasant converation where I explained what an asshole the manager was, noting that the driver did not disagree. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a150601" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150201"></a>And btw, for the record I stayed at the hotel for two nights for over $1000. So I felt I was entitled to a certain amount of respect, if not for being a human being, for paying so much money to stay at such a <a href="https://www.oceanedge.com/">shitty hotel</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a150201" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

Some people are really easy to please I guess. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/08/26/145925.html#a145210" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
