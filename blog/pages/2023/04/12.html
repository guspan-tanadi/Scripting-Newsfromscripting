Like there are lots of places to get coffee, there will be room for lots of big services that provide different experiences. And to create more headaches for everyone, the huge instances will develop differentiating features that are not supported by the others, without offering any interop. Early Mastodon fans will be as powerless to fix this as <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1093562299758067712">we are</a> when it comes to Spotify, Amazon, Google et al calling their audio programs podcasts, even though they don't provide the feeds that would give users choice. It's best to have your eyes open about this before it becomes a big issue, by then it will be too late. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/12.html#a184847" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In contrast, NPR received no money directly from the US government, and a few million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is partially funded by the US government. In other words, if receiving money from the US government to subsidize your business is a sin, Musk is a far greater sinner than NPR. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/12.html#a023937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The question is, why aren't other journalism companies withdrawing in sympathy? Should they cede to Musk the power to decide which sources of journalism are allowed to publish via Twitter? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/12.html#a184702" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Definitely worth a watch.
