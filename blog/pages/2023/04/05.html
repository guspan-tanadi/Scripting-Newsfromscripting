<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150027"></a>I asked ChatGPT to write a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/05/lovestory.png">story</a> in 35 words. Simple but beautiful.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a150027" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/metrocard.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142351"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/metrocard.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I don't often see links to articles on <a href="https://www.semafor.com/">Semafor</a>, a new journalism platform started by Ben Smith formerly of Buzzfeed and the NYT. One of the reasons I rarely see links from them is that they still apparently don't have an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=semafor+rss+feed">RSS feed</a> for their stories. If they had a feed, I'd be subscribed and I'd be much more likely to notice, and would probably occasionally <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/110146691152214416">pass a link</a> on to my followers. There is a distribution system that helps new pubs like Semafor boot up. My advice, do two things: 1. Put a linefeed at the end of each line in your <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/05/viewsource.png">HTML source</a> so I can get some ideas where you might have put your RSS feed. 2. If you don't have a feed for your top stories at least, stop everything and do it. Every day you delay is more exposure you don't get. I asked them to do this when they started, so this is the second request. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a142351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134218"></a>The journalism industry ought to form a news Twitter. It could be part of the fediverse, but it should also have its own easy UI. There are ease-of-use advantages to centralized systems. A lot of the people who use Twitter need the simplicity. A service can be both centralized and open at the same time. A lot of people got their first exposure to the web on AOL, for example. But news needs to have a single point of congregation. Twitter was providing a useful service there.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a134218" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They learned nothing from the Twitter experience. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a031156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
