Also last night, equally surprising, the #8 seed Miami Heat <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/36300795/jimmy-butler-heat-stun-bucks-ot-oust-top-seeded-milwaukee">eliminated</a> the #1 seed Milwaukee Bucks. The Knicks will play the Heat starting on Sunday at 1PM at <a href="https://www.stubhub.com/new-york-knicks-new-york-tickets-4-30-2023/event/151513601/?quantity=2&sections=139986&ticketClasses=8177&seatTypes=&listingQty=">the Garden</a>. That's where I'm going to be for sure (watching on TV of course). And to think it wasn't that long ago that Knicks fans were wearing <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/knicksPaperBags.png">paper bags</a> over our heads. The Knicks are now the team I always hoped they would be. It all paid off. And thanks to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/08/kevin-durant-new-york-knicks-are-not-cool-anymore/">KD</a> for putting the positive jinx on the Knicks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27.html#a124617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The idea of hooking up with another Jack Dorsey sell-out at this point seems the most ridiculous idea ever. He made his billions, he sold out to Musk, and now he wants another shot. No. Not unless we have no choice.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27.html#a034225" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124557"></a>Tucker Carlson should just do a YouTube channel and a podcast (with an RSS feed of course, please). And forget about big media companies. Go direct. Keep all the profits. Don't get fired next time. And how about the Tucker Carlson from the leaked text messages, not the conspiracy theorist Carlson.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27.html#a124557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145028"></a>I would love to read a chatbot-condensed version of the 28 years of my writing. Maybe in a couple of years they'll be able to do that well. I tend to repeat ideas over and over. We're beginning to be able to find those. Now can we eliminate the duplication and have the writing still be interesting? People seem so scared of having the machine alter our writing, but for me, it would be a service. I never am able to sit down and turn this stuff into a book, I just don't write that way. Maybe I could team up with a bot who would be the perfect editor. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27/145021.html#a145028" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143611"></a>It's got a weird title, "Market Entry Error" because ChatGPT tried to correct what it thought was an error.  I actually had a question about it, and as a result of the dialog, I simplified the text and avoided using a word some people would mis-read (as the bot had initially).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27/143541.html#a143611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143639"></a>When people trivialize what's going on here, they must not be using it well enough. It has a more intelligent conversation that most humans would because it <i>never gets distracted,</i> it always tries hard to understand what I said. It's a sad comment on us humans, we're <i>very</i> distractable, and even though we might have the intelligence to help with this kind of question, in practice we can't do it because our attention is so scarce.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27/143541.html#a143639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132818"></a>A quick story. I was once at a workshop, a free-form thing, where a group of people sat in a circle for three days. You could leave and come back, or take a walk with someone you met there, or sit in a corner and read a book, whatever you want. It was open to everyone, no cost. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27/131847.html#a132818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133112"></a>Anyway, I got some shit from a 22-year-old who had complained that it was awkward to get an erection at odd unplanned times. I was in my 40s at the time, and responded that some of us would love to have that problem. People laughed and the young man was probably embarrassed, so he shot back -- you think you know so much because you're old. I asked if he thought there was anything a person twice his age might understand that he didn't. He said no. I asked if he had learned anything since he was twelve. Oh yeah no comparison. Do you think learning ends at 22? Yes, he said.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27/131847.html#a133112" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133125"></a>I mention this because I recently talked with a friend I hadn't seen in 30 years. Very interesting and memorable experience. Like a time capsule. A lot happened in that time, obviously -- lots of learning, some of it intentional (training, therapy), and while I'm still the same person, the way I relate to the world is much improved in the intervening years. I could see it because I remembered what it was like then, and how different it is now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/27/131847.html#a133125" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
