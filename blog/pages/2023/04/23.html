Maybe in the next round we'll be able to create something that isn't owned by the tech cartel, (neither Twitter or Facebook is owned by anyone who appears to give a damn about it), that has the same kind of vibrancy that Twitter once had. Sure it could've been better, I wish Jack and Ev had been more supportive of developers, but I definitely miss what it used to be, flawed as it was.I'm really tired of all the bad-mouthing of Twitter on Mastodon. You all are missing something important, Twitter wasn't  just about who owns it, they're really not that important, it's about the people who use it. <i>It's always been that way. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/23.html#a163523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I still need the code. So I tried asking ChatGPT for help here, and it had a number of suggestions. I implemented the one they suggested that didn't require using a package other than HTTP. I adapted it but am getting a <i>400 Bad Request</i> response from WordPress. I'm going to keep trying to massage the code. I feel like I'm really close. (I got my <a href="https://concordtest.wordpress.com/2023/04/23/this-is-a-test-5/">hello world</a> <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordpressHelloWorld/blob/main/wordpresshelloworld.js">code</a> to work. This is a big deal. I didn't end up using the ChatGPT code, instead I used an NPM package that was suggested three years ago, and for whatever reason I didn't get it done then. It was the first response in the thread.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/23.html#a144609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131900"></a>The Washington Post did some kind of <a href="https://wapo.st/3AsTRnv">study</a> (free link, no paywall) to discover the sources behind "AI like ChatGPT" -- and they have a dialog you can use to find out how often certain sites are used in <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Documenting-the-English-Colossal-Clean-Crawled-Dodge-Sap/40c3327a6ddb0603b6892344509c7f428ab43d81?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template">Google's C4 dataset</a> (whatever that is). So of course I checked to see how much data from <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> is included. The answer: 710K tokens, which is 0.0005% of all tokens. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/scriptingquotes.png">Screen shot</a>. Some comps: <a href="http://daringfireball.com/">daringfireball.com</a> had 610K, <a href="http://seths.blog/">seths.blog</a> had 750K and <a href="http://kottke.org/">kottke.org</a> had 590K.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/23.html#a131900" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
