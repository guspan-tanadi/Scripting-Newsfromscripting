I expected to find the announcement of Tucker Carlson leaving Fox on Twitter, and <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1650527435182546944">there it was</a>. Once there's a default way to do something that's deeply ingrained, it doesn't get displaced quickly or easily. That's not taking anything away from Masto which is an amazing accomplishment. Both systems exist and will evolve to have different uses.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/24.html#a155055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155825"></a>But I haven't been focused on that kind of stuff, so I didn't want to create an expectation that there would be a lot of support. That's still true, but the product deserves to be out there, so very quietly last week I made the feedland repo public. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/151114.html#a155825" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162122"></a>Last night's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)">Succession</a> was both impossible to watch at times, and in some ways the best most revealing most fun episode ever. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/161426.html#a162122" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162205"></a>And like the previous episode which ended with Kendall smiling (over something stupid), this one ends with <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/shivSmile.png">Shiv smiling</a> (over something clever and kind of evil). So I guess in the next one it's Roman, right? Five episodes to go. Two more siblings, plus Tom and Greg. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/161426.html#a162205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
