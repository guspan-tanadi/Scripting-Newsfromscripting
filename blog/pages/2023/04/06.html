<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/09/jessica.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154106"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/09/jessica.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I spoke with the <a href="https://chatthing.ai/">chatthing.ai</a> people on Tuesday. Really smart, and fun -- and it turns out there's a lot more that can be done with the ChatGPT api. I asked how much they were spending to keep <a href="https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/">my personal chatbot</a> up, and they said it would fit in their $99 a month plan. Not wanting to depend on their generosity in this way, they're young and just starting up, I signed up. I think it's worth that much to have a personal playground and have them do the hosting and also collaborate on new features. I'm going to help them recruit really special people to use their service, because that's where I think the juice is right now. People who already have interesting content flows (ie blogs) that could be pushed through this new kind of software machine. At the same time I've been trying to encourage my friends at Automattic to get involved in helping people with ideas flow them into chatbots via their chatblogs. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06.html#a154106" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Apparently they do, but it's not like Twitter's embedding API. If you want it to look like a toot you have to dress it up yourself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06.html#a190649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153046"></a>Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a164206">posted</a> about the new <a href="http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml#1680702347000">linkblogging</a> capability in FeedLand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153100"></a>It was always the plan to add this to FeedLand, but I moved it up because someday soon I expect <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> to stop working because it depends on the Twitter API for identity, and they seem to be breaking devs all the time these days, but so far not Radio3. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153651"></a>Rather than converting Radio3 to email identity, I decided to move its core features into FeedLand which already has email identity. It took a few days, and they were mostly enjoyable, because I do dialog stuff much better today than I did when I wrote Radio3, which was a <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/08/29/#a1409347551">long time ago</a>! It totally needed a rewrite. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153651" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153231"></a>But -- for now I'm continuing to use Radio3, because it can post to Twitter and Mastodon, and anyone who's subscribed to that feed should keep subscribing. I never like to rock the boat, too many other things worth doing, and maybe Twitter will never break Radio3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE">It could happen</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153231" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153500"></a>In the meantime as far as I can tell <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> still works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153500" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Now the day that Radio3 stops working, at least this is some work I won't have to do. I will have a linkblogging tool ready to go.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153512"></a>And no one will be bothered by my Radio3 feed going quiet because nothing was going out that way anyway.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>And FeedLand's linkblogger will be infinitely better than Radio3 because it works. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153534"></a>So my advice is, don't depend on FeedLand for linkblogging if you already have your Radio3 act together.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/06/153044.html#a153534" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
