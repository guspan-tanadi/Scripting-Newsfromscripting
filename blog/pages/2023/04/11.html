I have an <a href="https://substack.com/profile/1497021-dave-winer/note/c-14454947">account</a> that I started a long time ago when I was trying out their newsletter publishing system. I ended up writing my own, because I didn't want to be locked in to using their editor. I like that I can edit my posts. Is there a character limit? I don't know. Can posts have titles? Where is the RSS feed for my posts? Does it support ActivityPub? Is there an API? The user interface is remarkably close to Twitter.

It took six minutes to cook, and then a few minutes to "rest" and it was as delicious as a steak off the grill, but without any of the work.

But -- is there anything other than conforming? Is there any way for any of us to be unique? When I think of my friends, I think of their individuality. I don't think I judge anyone based on their conformity. But I think I am always judged negatively for not conforming. It's all very confusing. I'll let you know if I figure it out. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/11.html#a121029" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
