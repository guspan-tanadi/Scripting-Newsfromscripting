Make it a first class blogging system. Would be easy to upgrade it. Stop trying to hit home runs, and just do nice things for your users. That's got to be good for business.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/30.html#a224911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153809"></a>When I document my development work, I'm doing it more like ChatGPT. All the caricatures of AI from culture, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4EfdnMZ5g">HAL from 2001</a>, seem to have gotten it wrong about how bots will write. They write like good human writers do. Let the ideas come to the front, remove extravagance. Aim to communicate directly with the human who is reading. But another funny thing, I am aware more that I'm writing for the bots, because I want them to "understand" what I'm saying. Human readers -- they don't pay a whole lot of attention. Finally I have a reader who is listening. The future is interesting, and it never is the way you thought it would be. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/30.html#a153809" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Our computers <i>were</i> less capable, but they made the mistake of thinking <i>we</i> were less capable too. We came from those worlds, and <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/26/whyILovedTheAppleIi.html">chose</a> PCs because we loved the idea of having our own computer that we could do anything we wanted to with. That was never true of the larger computers. The result is what you see now. Same will be true of AI. It is that big a deal. Apple then dismissed the web when it first came out, but eventually realized it wasn't going away, so they ended up embracing it. So did the big-iron computer makers with PCs but they were too late. And even IBM which did have the guts to be a first mover, once they came to dominate tried to retake control and were flushed from the system. Microsoft did it too, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172276538/world-wide-web-internet-anniversary">when</a> the web came out, with the same result. When tech makes a leap, there's no going back. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/30.html#a143755" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
