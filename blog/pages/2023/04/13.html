It seems to me staying on Twitter implies that I support what they did, and I do not. I could just as easily see them putting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_badge">yellow badges</a> on Jewish people's accounts. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/13.html#a214346" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211636"></a>I just got notice that Twitter was turning off the identity service for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io">my.1999.io</a>. This is the first one that I care about. Gets me thinking about how I might resurrect this app. I wrote it shortly after I became a fan of Facebook. I wanted to create a blogging system around their UI breakthoughs, and to improve on them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/13.html#a211636" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151051"></a>I had ChatGPT write some SQL code for me. I probably could have figured it out in a couple of hours, but instead it took me five minutes to specify the problem, and it took ChatGPT another five minutes to code it up and explain it to me. I wanted to see how many feeds each FeedLand user is the "first subscriber" of. Here's an <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/13/mysql-database-design-users-feeds.html">archive</a> of the conversation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/13.html#a151051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130849"></a>I'm not getting very much work done these days. Still more work to do on <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a>. And after that I'm thinking the next project might be a Linux port for Frontier. I really want to leave a functioning <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> behind as part of my body of work. And the Mac isn't a very reliable platform going forward. It's so funny -- the best product I ever did, really -- and it got all mired in the jealousy of Apple employees. Thinking about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/04/13.html#a130849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
