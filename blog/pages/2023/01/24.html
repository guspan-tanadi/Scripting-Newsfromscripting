Suppose I have a package called package1 which is required by a package called package2, which in turn is required by package3 which is required by an app called helloworld, which only requires package3. I know that's complicated to say but it's really simple. Okay, so I make a change to package1, and go to the directory that contains helloworld and <i>npm update</i> it. You'd think that we'd get the new version of package1 but we don't. The only way to get it to update that I've discovered is to make a change to package3, publish it, and then npm update. But nothing changed in package3, why should I have to rebuild it just to get the change reflected in the app. I have a feeling that this is because NPM modifies the package.json that NPM passes up the chain of require's? I swear this used to work, and what a pain in the ass if this is the only way to get changes deep in the stack reflected at the top.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150205"></a>I'm not sure why but I hate the term zettelkasten, but I love to say it. It sounds like something goofy and idiotic at the same time.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150234"></a>He was German and zettelkasten is a German word so it isn't icky or pretentious.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/24/150122.html#a150234" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
