<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162942"></a>My apps still work with the Twitter API. I don't think any developer should try to <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/make+hay">make hay</a> out of the pain of another developer. I wouldn't do that to you, even if I had questions about the foundation of your product. You see this in sports, no one puts down a competitive team just because one of their star players is injured. For good reason -- it can happen to you too and you don't want to see people do that to you. Remember this isn't just about Twitter, it's about developers too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/18.html#a162942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Learning when to let people go when they have done harm to a community, even if it isn't the Black community, is a muscle that has to be trained. Hell, folks haven't let R. Kelly go."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/18.html#a150142" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
