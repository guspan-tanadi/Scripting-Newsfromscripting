<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a022614"></a>Thereâ€™s no comparison between Twitter and Mastodon for idea distribution. I routinely get hundreds of RTs on Masto. The Twitter system thinks the same ideas are worthless. Iâ€™m guessing virtually no one sees my tweets. For an idea why that is, see the next item. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/22.html#a022614" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Hard to remember to do that, and you end up seeing a lot of disgusting crap. The stuff an algorithm chose for you, including posts from people you blocked. But you can work around this. If you have a bookmark for accessing Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Areplies&f=live">change it to this</a>. Now you'll only see items from people you follow. None of the bullshit their algorithm chose "for you" which is really "for their advertisers" or "for whoever."  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/22.html#a141341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>But once he assumed the office, and until he leaves, he belongs to us, the American people. I'm sure this is a new feeling for him. But we all must submit to something. The president submits to the people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/22/142131.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I can't imagine what hell it must be behind the closed door that leads to the press room. The ranting and screaming, the tears and the "there there's" from his staff, the promises to get even. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/22/142131.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>But he will keep bumping up against the reality that now, we own his ass, even the ones who thought his campaign was crazy and dangerous. The people who voted for him thinking it left the rest of us powerless are in for a surprise too. The other politicians you elected care about what we think, because they need us to keep their jobs. The election is over, now they're worried about the next election. And like it or not, they need us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/22/142131.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I don't know how Trump will come to terms with this. We have an idea of what a president does, says, how he or she reacts to events. We just had eight years with a guy who never lost his cool over anything. The new president sees a report on TV saying he lost the MLK bust in the Oval Office and he loses it? He has a long way to go before he is our president. He may hold the office but he hasn't embraced it yet.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/22/142131.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
