If you want things to be long-lived, then we need to make some major changes. And no one, absolutely no one, is working on making a long-lived net. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/21.html#a155631" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Pub-sub could use a "really simple" interface. You could send any kind of message with RSS, and the knowledge of how to find the new stuff in a feed is totally established in developer-land.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/21/202721.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202827"></a>And that's what the Pub-sub people wanted. Ideas for new simple APIs. They look down on RSS as beneath them. I've seen "serious" devs do that over and over and it's a mistake. Simple is better, not trivial. Microsoft, for example, had something "much better" than RSS coming in the late 90s. Eventually they did get on board with RSS, to their credit.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/21/202721.html#a202827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
