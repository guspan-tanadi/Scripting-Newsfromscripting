<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152324"></a>If you're going to tell the story of the growth of podcasting, you can't leave out <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a>. Podcasting was a mission that two people were on, myself and Adam Curry, mostly working in harmony, to find ways to get people to adopt this idea. We kept throwing ideas out there, and it wasn't until MCN in the summer of 2004 that other people got the idea that <i>they could do it.</i> That was the breakthrough. You didn't need a big studio and money to produce good audio programming. That's what MCN did. It was as crucial to the growth of podcasting as Serial or The Daily were many years later. You can't write a truthful history of this without including this series. Luckily the <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">archive</a> is pretty good! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/26.html#a152324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Sending out a link to them won't cause trouble for anyone. Over time that builds a brand.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145119"></a>It's not because we're smarter, or make better products, or have more natural resources. It's because the dollar is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency">reserve currency</a> of the world. It's the safest place to store value. That means when we create a new dollar someone accept it as repayment of a loan. That's how our wealth is created and sustained.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/26/145052.html#a145119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150735"></a>In other words, people are happy to be paid in dollars. They want to be paid in dollars.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145222"></a>If we don't pay back our loans, the safety thing blows up. It'll be gone.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145511"></a>It means we can piss away huge amounts of money on the military, and let the super-rich get off with paying no taxes. That's where the difference goes. It's why we can still live in a Western way, with big cars and mortgages, and have the hugest miltary and fuel the growth of the super-rich all around the world all at the same time. It's not because we're a great country, it's because everyone thinks the dollar is safe.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/26/145052.html#a145511" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
