<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153217"></a>BTW, all who think Musk/Twitter is the big problem, you're falling for a smokescreen. A much bigger problem is the brain of Google. It's the nightmare of science fiction. We have no clue what it wants. It has unfathomably immense and unchallenged power. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/29.html#a153217" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I can't tell you how much I love this song. And it turns out this was the first CSN song. It was first sung in Joni Mitchell's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles">Laurel Canyon</a> living room, or Cass Elliot's kitchen, or John Sebastian's house. Crosby and Stills were tripping out on their harmonies. Cass brought Graham Nash with her to meet them. After hearing the song twice, he joined the harmony. Imagine the <a href="https://www.songfacts.com/facts/crosby-stills-nash/you-dont-have-to-cry">discovery</a> that this kind of music was possible, and that it was coming from you! BTW, the song was written by Stills about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Collins">Judy Collins</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/29.html#a150911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's in there, in my brain, but I can't quite get at it. It's amazing how it <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/29/chatscreen.png">nailed this question</a>.

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143654"></a>I like Mastodon, and like Twitter. I've been on Twitter since 2006, and on Masto since 2017, but didn't start using it until late last year. I think Masto is an improvement over Twitter, but the limits I list below matter more than all the improvements.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/29/143627.html#a143654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143733"></a>Yes I know some instances don't have these limits, but what matters is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">LCD</a>. What can be exchanged with all Masto systems, and the list above applies to the vast majority of instances. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/29/143627.html#a143733" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144145"></a>Think about it this way. This is a simple post, expressing a simple idea. Yet neither Mastodon or Twitter can transmit this message. When we really get out of this bottleneck we'll be able to send messages like this one, and we'll wonder why we put up these limits for so long. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/29/143627.html#a144145" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143821"></a>Also, I've heard all the arguments. At one point 140 chars was the limit that mattered, if we went over that then it wouldn't be any good. Then we went over it, and communication got better. I don't want to argue about this. Just want to point out that we're still waiting to be set free from the limits imposed by Twitter 17 years ago.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/29/143627.html#a143821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
