<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140751"></a>I don't use WordPress very much, but recently I had a chance to try out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/">block editor</a> and my reaction was that I can't imagine writing this way. If you're a writer who uses WordPress, do you use the block editor, if so <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1614261301466865664">what do you think</a> of it?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/14.html#a140751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It took a lot of iterating to get the right version of the OS running on the machine and to then restore a Time Machine backup on the machine without having one or more extra accounts on the machine. One thing I will never understand is why Macs are so slow at transferring stuff over a local wifi network. All the advice on the net says you need to use faster wifi, but my wifi is very fast. Here are <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/14/speedtestresults.png">speed test results</a> communicating with a server in NYC, about 100 miles away. Why is it so much faster to communicate with that server than it is to communicate with a laptop that's in the same building? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/14.html#a140821" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's worth another listen because he's explaining why news is like it is, from the point of view of someone who was an insider for years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/14.html#a141655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In the past when new markets appeared, like the personal computer, desktop publishing, the web -- there were always publications that grew up along with the platform, because there's such demand to know about the latest developments. I contacted my friend <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/109682144184951137">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who teaches journalism at CUNY to ask if there was interest in one of their students forming a news site to gather news of the Mastodon world. He liked the idea and now they've taken the next step. They're offering a full scholarship to their "100-day, online certificate program that helps creators establish their own enterprises to serve specific communities/markets." Apply by Feb 3 <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/j-plus/entrepreneurial-journalism-creators-program/">here</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/14.html#a143124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145153"></a>The world lets us do this for them because a dollar is considered the safest way to store value.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145245"></a>So, why are the oligarchs who own all our sources of news, willing to let a default actually happen? I think it's a good chance it's due to inbreeding, narcissism, stupidity, selfishness and resentment. They don't believe they will suffer personally if the US turns into an economic basket case. Maybe they won't. For sure, that's <i>all</i> they care about. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/14/144959.html#a145245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140735"></a>I keep waiting for a news article that doesnâ€™t gloss over the real impact of defaulting. If news were run like journalism this would be the horserace of the millenium. A story with a billion angles. We'd all tune in every night to hear how bad it'll be. But they clearly aren't interested in that. They're interested in keeping their jobs. That probably also explains why we're not responding to the climate crisis or the pandemic. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/14/144959.html#a140735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
