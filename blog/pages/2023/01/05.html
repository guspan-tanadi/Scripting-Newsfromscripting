I can add the feeds of a few dozen people I want to pay closer attention to under my Mastodon or News categories. Mastodon for the raw feed, Feedland for the curated feed. Once I went through it, the process was clean, straightforward, quick."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/05.html#a020509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I seem to remember there was a point at which Mac laptops started sucking. Is it safe to buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Macbook-MJLQ2LL-15-inch-Processor/dp/B07ZFZ33SK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=Z9YH82KC98CP&keywords=mac%2Blaptop%2B2015&qid=1672943328&sprefix=mac%2Blaptop%2B2015%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-3&th=1">2015 Powerbook</a>?

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162635"></a>I'm now setting up a second FeedLand instance, this one for me personally. Learning what it takes to set one up and smoothing things out. Taking lots of notes. Found a few bugs, but not many. Surprising how little breakage there has been between Instance0 and Instance1. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/05.html#a162635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162834"></a>If you've been reading this blog since the beginning you know about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22">Fractional Horsepower</a> servers. It's an important idea. That software you think of as running on huge servers in the cloud also can be deployed on much smaller systems, including behind a firewall on a personal computer. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/15/radioUserLandScreenShot.png">Radio UserLand</a> was a server that ran on the desktop, yet very few users knew that. It just ran in the browser, there was a little cloud component to act as a proxy, to do the kinds of things you can't do from a desktop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/05.html#a162834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175850"></a>I wasn't very entertained with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-menu">The Menu</a> on HBO but now I find myself thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film)">it</a> a lot, not deliberately. Weird. So I watched it again, and on the second viewing it came together. I've had a similar experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood">There Will Be Blood</a>. I didn't like it on the first viewing, but watched it again, and it became one of my favorite movies. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/05.html#a175850" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
