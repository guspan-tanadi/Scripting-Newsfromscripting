<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173721"></a>In my first job out of college I was in a similar situation and I thought to myself they shouldn't put programmers in offices on the 39th floor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building">Empire State Building</a> with <a href="https://bigapplewindowcleaning.com/this-is-how-the-empire-state-buildings-windows-were-once-cleaned/">windows</a> that open. I found that thought both disturbing and comforting. I guess I figured out the problem, because I'm still here 47 years later. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/09.html#a173721" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163445"></a>The Like button on various systems is a way of acknowledging that you saw something and thought it was noteworthy. Since micro.blog doesn't have a Like button, what's the proper way of saying that? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/09/163016.html#a163445" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164226"></a>As a person who writes posts that get zero response here (and not on other systems) I wish people had a less-committed way of saying they saw something I wrote.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163211"></a>If I see something on Micro.blog that I would Like on another system, I don't comment, I just do nothing, not because I'm bashful or overly quiet, rather because this is a language, and a comment has different meaning from a Like. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/09/163016.html#a163211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163314"></a>In real life there's all kinds of non-verbal communication. you can nod your head, smile. We've come up with a similar language online, I don't think there's any more meaning in this. We're being human. Not a huge surprise.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/09/163016.html#a163314" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163349"></a>Here's a parallel. My TV doesn't have a brightness control. It's an expensive screen, and I imagine that the designers of the system figured "we have a computer in this that knows how to automatically adjust brightness based on room light." But it doesn't work properly, I don't know what the problem is, but there are times the TV is useless because you just can't see what's on the screen, because the lack of a brightness control. Maybe if TVs never had brightness controls I wouldn't miss it, but they do in my mind, require one. Same thing here. <i>Like</i> is something that's part of the language of social media. To try to deny that at this stage is kind of pointless imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/09/163016.html#a163349" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
