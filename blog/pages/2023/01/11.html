<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175023"></a>WordPress is in the way. I've avoided saying this because I like Matt, but at some point, it being in the way has to win out. And since when do I not say something because I like the person who made it. It's in the way. I would like to see it move out of the way. I will write a piece soon explaining how they could, and should, do that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/11.html#a175023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And I can validate that it did try to do the worst thing at the worst possible moment. Luckily I have always been a nervous passenger and I wasn't about to trust a bot this much. I intervened at the first sign of trouble.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/11.html#a180034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin">Banshees</a> movie is supposed to be a comedy of sorts but it was so painful to watch, not much room for laughter. And I guess I didn't really watch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans">Fableman</a> movie, walked out after the opening scene. Spielberg's movies have declined into self-obsession. He thinks we're so freaking stupid and he's so freaking wonderful. Come on man do another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)">Jaws</a>. Now <i>that</i> was a movie. One thing I got from Banshees is that the Irish say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feck">fecking</a> and I wonder if it means what I think it means. Anyway, I'm looking for something great to watch, and have fallen back to re-watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)">Band of Brothers</a>. It's been so long since I last watched it that it seems pretty fresh. I long for that kind of story-telling, but they don't seem to make shows like that these days.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/11.html#a144616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
