In tech we talk a lot about interop in software, but there is no interop in software without lots of interop between people, so start there. Open an invite to anyone you want to interop with, no matter what the history, let's work together to remove barriers to interop.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a030311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191339"></a>In that spirit, here's an open <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/244">invitation</a> to developers at Automattic to learn how <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">blogging</a> works in <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a>. It's very fluid, designed for writers. Does small and large posts easily, in the same data structure. I'll help. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a191339" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a031124"></a>My wish for us, in the blogging world, for the new year. We'll know it's working if most people feel their best place to write is their blog, where the editing tools work just as they like them to, and there are no boundaries to where those ideas can be published.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a031124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a032915"></a>My blogger of the year is <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-1-2023">Heather Cox Richardson</a>. Every day she teaches us something about what's happening, in a historic context. This is blogging at its best. If she has a business model it isn't in your face. She has something to add and she does it generously and with great expertise and sass. A role model for us all, and a perfect example of the blogging ethos and a perfect choice for my 2022 <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty">BOTY</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155426"></a>Mastodon has a cute way to validate sites as being yours. If you put your masto address in the text of the site that's good enough. But it has to be HTTPS. Oh well. I think they get most things right at Masto, but the trying to force people to adopt HTTPS is selling out to <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google</a> and their thirst to own the web, which is imho not theirs to own.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a155426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155314"></a>If you run a blog or other site, check your copyright notices. We're in a new year folks. For example the copyright notice on this blog should've changed. And then I realize there is no freaking copyright notice. I better <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/01/copyrightNotice.png">fix that</a>. Today is a day of fixing things.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a155314" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155200"></a>A new application for AI. Rate the humor level of a tweeted "joke" response. If people knew how unfunny their supposed jokes were they might think again before inflicting them on others. Better yet, score people on the quality of the jokes they actually post. Publish that score next to their number of followers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a155200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155053"></a>Requiring people to use one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character in a password is bullshit. It doesn't make your password more secure. What it does is make it impossible to remember the password. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a155053" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161457"></a>I remember when I saw a product that expired after 2000 and thought that I had arrived in the future. Hah. It's 2023 now. That's just ridiculous. It's impossible that I actually have lived this long.
