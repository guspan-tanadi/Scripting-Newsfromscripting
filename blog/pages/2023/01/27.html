<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130645"></a>Just when I thought I'd seen all the good bingeable shows, I started watching <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/feel-good-2020">Feel Good</a> on Netflix, and wow, it's such a great story, so emotionally involving. Not going to spoil anything, but if you need a good love story, this is it. Gave it the highest rating on <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Ffeel-good-2020">Bingeworthy</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/27.html#a130645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190706"></a>Last night's <a href="https://www.postingandtoasting.com/2023/1/27/23573957/rj-barrett-after-edging-celtics-in-ot-we-played-together-we-played-hard-we-held-our-own">Knicks game</a> was a real milestone. At the end with the Knicks defending, they stopped the best team in the NBA, without Mitchell Robinson. In previous seasons the Knicks would always lose these games. At the end we'd say well it was a good effort, knowing that's bullshit, it's pathetic. To win one of those games, with such competence, for the second time in two games, both times against the best in the league, wow. Maybe it's time to change how I think about this team. I'll let you know. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üèÄ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/27.html#a190706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131731"></a>Just heard an excellent <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ortgard/109760375504217740">analogy</a>. Defaulting on the debt would be as destructive to the US as Brexit was to the UK. Only I think it would be a lot clearer to the world how we've lost our minds, and also the US is bigger than the UK, economically, so we have further to fall. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/27.html#a131731" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
