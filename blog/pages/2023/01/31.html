Work your way up the list. Those were amazing days, lots of firsts and imho lots of fun. I kept the archive because I hoped at some point someone would want to know how it happened. Maybe grad students will do a thesis on this stuff? This is a new medium being born. I tried to keep good records. Also recommend looking at Scripting News archives for 2004 as well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/31.html#a131156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174654"></a>2001 was also a big year in podcasting. The first program to <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154217">download podcasts</a> was <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MUOTD%22&t=h_&ia=web">MUOTD</a>, in January 2001, in conjunction with the <a href="https://podnews.net/article/first-podcast-feed-history">Grateful Dead experiment</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/31.html#a174654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162319"></a>I have a group of testers working with me on getting the <a href="http://roadmap.feedland.org/">open source release</a> of FeedLand ready to go. And this is the week we're working on HTTPS support. One of my friends thanked me for doing this work, and I thought my response deserved to be public, so here it is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/31/162311.html#a162319" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162409"></a>Supporting HTTPS in FeedLand was the plan all along. The rule is if you're giving your identity to a service, you gotta have HTTPS. My commitment is to the web. I think HTTPS is shitty technology, I'm sure Google if they tried harder, or asked me, could have come up with more of a win-win. But it is what it is. They're a shit company, but HTTPS is not Google. I know that. Some people can't seem to get that I get that. Not everything is a political cause. I think they're accustomed to Republican politics where they'll burn the world down to assert their will. I'm genuinely in this for the good of everyone, not just me. And -- I don't blame HTTPS for Google. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/31/162311.html#a162409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
