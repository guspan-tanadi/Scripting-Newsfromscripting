Looking for people with experience running a WordPress server, or equivalent. It should be that level of complexity. I want to smooth out the experience, before releasing it publicly. If you're interested in participating, please send me an email. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/20.html#a153250" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Yes, they shut down the clients, but the people who make the clients should have known that was coming. It happened before. Every corporate platform vendor will defend their cash flow. If you bet otherwise, you're probably going to lose. If you don't like it, develop for an open platform or stay out of the platform vendor's path.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/20.html#a152659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145320"></a>I went to Davos in <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/01.html">January 2000</a>, just once, with a white badge (access to everything). Not as a journalist. I was a representative of the web, which was the hot thing at the time. Not sure what other people were doing but I was a celebrity and enjoyed all the attention. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/20.html#a145320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145629"></a>After Davos, I went to Amsterdam, to write and enjoy the local herb. Back then it was the only place in the west where you could buy and consume the weed openly and semi-legally. Scroll to the end of the <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/02.html">February archive page</a> for pictures from Davos and Amsterdam, as well as a few pieces with closing thoughts about my experience at Davos. This is one of the advantages of blogging and keeping relatively decent archives. You get to relive experiences like this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/20.html#a145629" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Davos+Man%22">Davos Man</a> was skeptical.
