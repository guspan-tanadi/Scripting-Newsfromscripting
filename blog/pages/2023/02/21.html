If the user subscribes to an outline that's served under HTTP, the browser won't let us read it, because (I guess) they think we're loading code or private data. Neither is true. By definition the outline is public. There will be a workaround, we can call a server to read the file. I could be spending the time inventing new stuff, instead I'm mopping up after the EFF and Google. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21.html#a021924" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180809"></a>I chimed in on a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/109902923171500510">Masto thread</a> about whether the standard is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/109904059935718937">Mastodon</a> or ActivityPub.

Till then, my life was directed toward success. Something I wanted ever since I was a small child. I wanted to do something great and creative. Maybe invent something. I wanted my life to have meaning. I wanted to make a difference. And I wanted to be recognized for my accomplishments.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a171231" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171419"></a>I arrived in the 90s with most of the boxes checked. Then I waited for the feeling of satisfaction. I waited for everyone whose approval I yearned for to approve of me. Nothing. Emptyness. All the approval felt conditional, hollow, not based on any understanding of who I am. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a171419" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171626"></a>So, did I approve of myself? No, not in any way. I was living a lie. Trying to design myself to fit into everyone else's idea of a worthwhile man. I wasn't listening to myself. I was letting other people define me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a171626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a021836"></a>I still had another hill to climb, to learn how to listen to the internal chatter always going on inside me. All the voices, who were they and what did they want? Which were the powerful ones, and which were just nagging critics. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a021836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171805"></a>I started writing publicly frequently, and then every day. I took risks, and told stories that didn't used to make it to journalism. I was offered a writing job at Wired. And I developed software to support this new activity, and in the process created something new, and this time wasn't aimed at fame and fortune, checking the boxes. It was simply something I wanted to have. Not saying the software I did before was just for checking boxes, that was never the case. Just that this was the first software I made that had nothing to do with checking the boxes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a171805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172026"></a>Another thing I did was start therapy in 1994. Eight years on the couch. Talking about myself. Being heard by someone whose job it was to listen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172026" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172109"></a>The first big discovery came a couple of years in. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172109" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172147"></a>I was frustrated with something a relative did. I said "I know what he's doing right now." I was sure of it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>The therapist asked: "How do you know?"<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172158"></a>That stopped me. I said: "I don't know."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172158" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172204"></a>Then I asked: "Why didn't you ask that before?"<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172218"></a>Therapist: "I've been asking all along, this is the first time you responded."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172218" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172432"></a>The big lesson was, as you dream your way through life, before you make a decision, check with your senses to see if the perception was right. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a172432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173814"></a>Always ask yourself how you know what the other person is doing.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a173814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

"I know this sounds geekish, but it pays to use the scientific method in relationships with other people." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/21/171228.html#a205542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
