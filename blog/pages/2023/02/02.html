They made the announcement in a vague way and with just seven days notice. I think there's a good chance they'll realize that this is a shitty way to do it, and will take it back, on one hand, but on the other hand, let's get out of here now. This is not a good place to develop products. I hoped they would leave this part of their API alone, and I expected more notice, but it didn't turn out that way. It is what it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html#a132436" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133031"></a>A disclaimer, all of what I write here today is seat-of-pants. I don't know how this is going to turn out, but right now I want you, if you use my products, to prepare for a complete shutdown, just in case. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html#a133031" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133235"></a>In some cases, esp for products that were designed only to enhance Twitter, they will not come back. For example, <a href="http://thread.center/">thread.center</a>. It only works with Twitter, so when the API is gone, I will just shut it down.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html#a133235" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133320"></a>The two products I care about most are <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> and <a href="http://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a>.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133343"></a><a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a> which I have left running even though Drummer is a better version of the same product, will not transition. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html#a133343" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133411"></a>Both Drummer and Little Outliner have commands to download all your outlines. You should do that <i>now. </i>There's no excuse for you losing any data, and I will not help get your data after Twitter shuts off the API. Take care of yourself. Download your stuff.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133527"></a>For FeedLand there's nothing to worry about. All your data is public, so even if for some reason you cannot log onto FeedLand, you will still be able to get your data because you don't need to log in to get it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/02/133127.html#a133527" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
