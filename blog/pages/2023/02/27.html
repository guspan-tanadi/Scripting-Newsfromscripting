I hope in a few years all these discussions about what's the optimal number of characters for a post will be seen as farce, like the scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)">Amadeus</a> where the Emperor says Mozart's opera has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMWy3EpEo_o&t=29s">too many notes</a>. I don't think it's up to Emperors or software developers to have opinions on what's the right number of characters in my writing. What if in turn, as a writer, I said your code couldn't have more 500 characters per file. What's the likelihood that this edict would make any sense? Hopefully that puts it in perspective. There's a simple solution available to everyone, a <i>More</i> link at some arbitrary breakpoint, that does enough to encourage short posts if that's what you're after. And it also makes sense to writers.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/27.html#a145150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a032321"></a>In Jamaica when they say someone “dirty shirted” you that means they disrespected you. I was looking for a reference to it on the web and can’t find it.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193707"></a>I keep finding legit tasks for <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a>. For example, I have a new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlCloud/blob/main/desktop/iobridge.js">utility</a> that hooks <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar">Chokidar</a> up to websockets. If a file is modified, a message goes to a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlCloud/tree/main/server">server</a>, which in turn forwards the message to N listeners. Chokidar is a very nice utility with lots of configuration options, but sparse docs. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to improve latency, ie the time it takes for a change to a file to be noticed and acted on. The docs provide some vague clues, but when I asked ChatGPT if I could adjust the latency, it gave me a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/27/reducelatencychokidar.png">clear yes</a>, and showed me how to do it. Also suggested there might be lesser-known toolkits that would be better for this kind of application. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/27.html#a193707" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
