I've loaded it <a href="http://feedland.org/?river=https%3A%2F%2Ftradesecrets.archive.podnews.net%2Findex.xml">into FeedLand</a>. And James loaded it into <a href="https://web.podfriend.com/podcast/trade-secrets4">Podfriend</a>. It's great to have this stuff resurrected in a form that people interested in the formation of podcasting, journalists and historians we hope, can learn from. Thanks James! I hope he does the same with my <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a> podcast, which precedes Trade Secrets, and documents developments in the summer of 2004. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/10.html#a140722" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was supposed to be the week we launched testing of feedlandInstall, enough of a stretch on its own, but it also simultaneously became the week that Drummer had to be converted to a new identity system and HTTPS, all happening at the same time, thanks to the implosion of the API at Twitter. It's okay, it is what it is. I went into it with my eyes open, I knew there could be a day when we had to quickly get out of TwitterVille. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/10/023900.html#a023906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023937"></a>This added some extra chaos to the feedlandInstall process because the products share a package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver">daveappserver</a>, and I had to make changes to how it works to get Drummer working, and there was a risk of FeedLand breakage as a result, and some breakage has occurred.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/10/023900.html#a023937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a024007"></a>We will get there. A new Drummer without Twitter for identity and a new open source release of FeedLand's server so a thousand instances can bloom. Everyone will want to be part of a FeedLand workgroup the same way they are joining Mastodon instances. Communities of feed readers serving larger communities of news users. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/02/10/023900.html#a024007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
