<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/06/17/charlieTheTuna.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131817"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/06/17/charlieTheTuna.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A couple of weeks ago I found and fixed an error in <a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark</a> that made <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> and <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> fail. The apps were offline until I could restart the server, and that sometimes meant hours of downtime.  That no longer happens. But now there's a different problem, sometimes I go to <a href="https://feedland.org/?river=true&screenname=davewiner">my news page</a> on feedland.org and for a minute or so there's no response. Eventually I give up and try again in a new tab. Same thing. Eventually the problem clears and the server returns to it's normal performance. I'm starting to think about how I might isolate this problem. My theory is that the problem is in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/appServer">appserver</a> layer, not in FeedLand itself, because when it happens nothing is returned. If it were at a higher level, the lockup would be in the code that gets a timeline or feedlist or whatever, so you would see a menu at the top of the screen. But it's always the news page this happens on, come to think of it. Maybe I should start a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/270">thread</a> on this in case other FeedLand users who are also developers (please) might have some ideas.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/03.html#a131817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130928"></a>It has been pointed out that I could use the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/">OpenAI platform</a> to add commands to my outliner that are based on results of ChatGPT questions. For example, I could say (hypothetically) "add a list for 10 random states under the bar cursor headline" and it would be done. I hope to try that soon. In the meantime if you'd like to do it, the outliner I use is <a href="https://github.com/scripting/concord">open source</a>, so you can do it, and share it with me and that would make me even happier. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/03.html#a130928" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
