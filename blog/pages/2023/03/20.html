<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155149"></a>A cool feature for FeedLand users. When you <i>Like</i> an item, it's automatically added to two RSS feeds -- one for <a href="http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml">your likes</a>, and one for the <a href="http://data.feedland.org/likes/all.xml">likes of all users</a> on your FeedLand.It's basically a single-gesture linkblog. There's a lot of that in FeedLand, where things have been factored to a point where they couldn't possibly be simpler. Of course since they're standard <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds, you could follow them from any feed reader. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/20.html#a155149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134426"></a>Archive of my blog from <a href="http://scripting.com/2003/03.html">March 2003</a>, marking the start of the war in Iraq, and my arriving in Cambridge to begin my fellowship at <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/20.html#a134426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was very excited, and it shows. In hindsight, I was about to have some great adventures. One of the best experiences of my life. Now twenty years later, I'm still very grateful for having had the opportunity to work with the people I met at Harvard, and the power afforded to me with the H-bomb business card. The friends I made there still benefit me to this day, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/20.html#a134528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160735"></a>So it's been twenty years since I started at Berkman. Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nesson">Charlie Nesson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain">Jon Zittrain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey">John Palfrey</a> for giving me the chance. Met so many who became lifelong friends, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/20.html#a160735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160826"></a>I remember when I got a key to the building. I didn't ask for it, and I certainly didn't expect it.  My first thought was hmmm i wonder what i can do with <i>this?</i>  That's where the regular Thursday evening meetup came from.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/20.html#a160826" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160941"></a>The first thing I did when I started at Berkman, twenty years ago, was to get a blogging server up and running. It was 2003, so I used <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a>, a product we made at UserLand. It was the first weblog server at any university, in the world. Early days. A few years after I left they converted to WordPress. A solid move both times because by then UserLand had shut down and the default blogging server was the software made by my friend Matt. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/20.html#a160941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152513"></a>You have to boil it down to the minimal number of steps-to-reproduce. Those are facts that are incontrovertible. That one problem caused another?
