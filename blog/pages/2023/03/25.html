Sometimes you drop down a few levels into the trance, and you need a "sponsor" to help you pull yourself out of it. Obviously no one else can pull you out, you have to do it. A friend can help. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/25.html#a195034" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180212"></a>Here's the thing about Twitter. Since they started showing the number of impressions on every tweet, you can see how meaningless the number of followers is. You could have 66.7K followers, but <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1639404110725402626">your tweet</a> might still only get <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/25/tweetscreen.png?nodialog">764 views</a>. Once, a long time ago, Twitter was a flow machine. Now it's like a <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2022/11/29/drying-california-lake-to-get-250m-in-us-drought-funding">dry lakebed</a>. A void. It looks like Twitter used to look, but looks aren't everything. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/25.html#a180212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'd like to have that content loaded into ChatGPT so it can be part of the knowledge base. I am a JavaScript programmer. What's the easiest way to get a quick result?" I understand the code, I think -- but I'm no closer to understanding what to do. How do I come up with the prompts? What if I have no prompts, what's the result? They say be careful of the cost, what is the cost based on. I feel lost like I did when I first saw what the web could do, I wanted to know -- how do I set up a node on the next. The answers I got from those in the know made no sense to me, until they did.
