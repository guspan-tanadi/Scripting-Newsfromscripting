<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/18/accordionGuy.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154342"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/18/accordionGuy.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Almost everything you do on FeedLand is public. You can read anyone else's feed list. Example, <a href="https://feedland.org/?username=KenSmith">Ken Smith's list</a>. If you're signed in, to subscribe to a feed just click the feed's checkbox. You can also see <a href="https://feedland.org/?userslist">who's been on</a> recently, when they signed up, how many feeds they subscribe to, and how many pages they've viewed. You can also see the feeds that have recently been <a href="https://feedland.org/?log">subscribed to</a>. The idea is to make feed discovery as easy as it possibly can be. We steal (and improve on) ideas from social media apps that didn't exist last time I took a fresh look at feed systems. I don't think of FeedLand as a feed reader -- it's more of a feed management system, imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/18.html#a154342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160435"></a>I first wrote about the use of checkboxes in this way (see above) in 2007. I called it <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/checkboxNews.html">Checkbox News</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/18.html#a160435" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155158"></a>Another important feature, <a href="https://feedland.org/?userfeedsnews=true">every user has their own feed</a>, which you can edit in FeedLand, of course. To write a post, click in the edit box at the top of the page, type some text, click the Post button. It should show up in the list of user-feed posts, below. If you want to edit one of your posts, click on the text, make <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/18/editingAPost.png">the changes</a>, click the Update button. Of course there's an <a href="https://feedland.org/?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Ffeedland%2Fuserfeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml">RSS feed</a> for each user, which you can subscribe to in FeedLand or any other RSS-compatible application (there are many, as I'm sure you know). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/18.html#a155158" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195015"></a>It's important for users to have their own feed in the same way it was good to be able to develop software for the Mac on a Mac. Most users will never make a software product, and maybe most FeedLand users won't write publicly, but you want to make it was easy as possible for people to contribute to the ecosystem they use. It's a philosophy of the active not-just-eyeballs users. It's a basic democratic idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/18.html#a195015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
