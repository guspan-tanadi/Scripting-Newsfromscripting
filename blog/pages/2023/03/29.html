<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141504"></a>The exploration of my <a href="https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/chats/54392679-165d-4b09-b410-cfb3ba22759a/">personal chatbot</a> filled with the archive of Scripting News going back to 1994, continues. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a141504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175657"></a>BTW, let me get in a plug for <a href="https://chatthing.ai/">Chat Thing</a>. I've been working with the developers to get this up and running. They've been fantastic. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a175657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214831"></a>I asked my chatbot to <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/mystyleofwriting.png?nodialog">describe my style</a> of writing. Flattering.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a214831" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a181112"></a>I asked my personal chatbot what I think <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/coralReefs.png">about coral reefs</a>. An example that puts no writers out of business, since they weren't writing about this topic.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a181112" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175351"></a>I just asked my chatbot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_newspaper_strike_of_1994">San Francisco newspaper strike in 1994</a>, which was a seminal event for blogging, believe it or not -- and there's probably more stuff in my archive about that event than in the rest of the web. So I'm going to link to a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22san+francisco+newspaper+strike%22+1994">Google search result</a> instead. Let's see how that works! It's a reminder that for some things, Google is still considerably better than my chatbot. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a175351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174619"></a>I've been asking my chatbot what I think of various tech companies, people and products. For example, here's what I said <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/whatDaveSaidAboutGeneralMagic.png?nodialog">about General Magic</a>, a Silicon Valley company that led in early PDA products. The team was made up of past and future tech superstars. Note that I just added to what I say about the company, so it'll be interesting to ask this question again in a few days. We haven't got the <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmarkdown?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml">Markdown version</a> of my RSS feed flowing through the database yet.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a174619" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144752"></a>BTW, it seems Markdown has become the default way to feed new data into chatbots. We're converting my OPML files to Markdown. As always -- Markdown is "Just Enough HTML."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a144752" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144950"></a>I asked the chatbot if it knew what "Just Enough HTML" means. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/justenoughhtml.png?nodialog">It did a great job</a>, but didn't pick up the connection to Markdown. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a144950" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145156"></a>Noted that my blog has been taken over by my chatbot which desperately needs a name. I wonder how the chatbot will absorb references to itself. And of course then come the third level references, which is what this post is. Oh the humanity!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a145156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145408"></a>Then I asked if there was a connection between "Just Enough HTML" and Markdown, and omg it <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/connectionbetweenjustenoughhtmlandmarkdown.png?nodialog">got the answer</a> totally right! If this were a student of mine, they'd get a freaking A+. Maybe just an A because it didn't include the connection in the answer to the first question. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a145408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141541"></a>It was suggested we ask questions related to time. For <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/daveWriteAboutIphone.png?nodialog">example</a>, "When was the first time Dave wrote about the iPhone?" <a href="http://scripting.com/2007/01/10.html">January 10, 2007</a>.  But <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/255#issuecomment-1488795349">how</a> does it know which article was first?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a141541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a005716"></a>Summary: Today's experience with my personal chatbot has been fantastic. I love it. We're just getting started. Yesterday was the first day. Learned so much today. Expect to learn a lot more tomorrow. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/29.html#a005716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
