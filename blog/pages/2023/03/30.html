<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133602"></a>I've been trying to figure out what to call these things. For now, I've settled on personal chatbot, like a <i>personal</i> computer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a133602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135648"></a>My personal chatbot is a good writer, composition-wise. I asked it <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/30/food.png">what kind of food I like</a>, and it answered with a story about me and my longtime bud Dave Jacobs and how we both like Chinese food. It's been a long time since I've taken a writing class, but I think that would get a good grade. Find a way to tell a story, rather than just reciting facts. Make it about people, and people will read it.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a135648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135852"></a>I wonder if my personal chatbot should have a name. I asked the bot if it had a preference. I quote the bot: "As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or emotions, so I don't require a name. However, if you'd like to refer to me in a specific way, you can choose any name that you prefer." <i>Reasonable.</i> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a135852" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144314"></a>My personal chatbot just <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/30/bingeworthyinvention.png">invented</a> a feature for BingeWorthy, by lying about its existence. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a144314" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If so, it's justified. There are orders of magnitude too many programmers. The tech industry doesn't factor, they do the opposite, reimplement things that work well, or throw out things that work well in favor of things that don't work at all. I think the bots are now going to help us do the factoring we humans wouldn't do on our own. All the layoffs in tech foretell this. The truth is stranger than fiction. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a142633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142952"></a>The reason it's nice to have old people around is that we don't care about the future in a personal way, so we might just tell you the truth. We also tend to be smartasses. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a142952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144349"></a>I think "personal chatbot" may be a fanciful <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anachronistic">anachronistic</a> name, like <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html">weblog for the ears</a>, which ultimately became podcasting.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30.html#a144349" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You're in the shithouse now. It's even worse. The chatbot <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/30/oyughbullshit.png">thinks</a> I credited the British reporter with coining the term. No I did not.

It's pretty good, even though some of its facts are wrong, and includes some ideas I never came up with but make sense.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162650"></a>Frontier is a software environment developed by UserLand Software in the late 1990s (Note: development actually started in 1988). It was designed to be a high-level scripting environment that combined an outliner-based editor, an object database, and an integrated scripting language. Frontier was used to build a variety of web-based applications and services, including content management systems, blogging platforms, and syndication tools.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30/162631.html#a162650" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>At its core, Frontier is an outliner-based environment that allows users to create and manipulate hierarchical outlines of information. These outlines can be used to store and organize data, as well as to create scripts and macros that automate tasks within the environment. Frontier also includes an object database that allows developers to store and retrieve data in a structured way, as well as an integrated scripting language that can be used to create custom applications and services.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30/162631.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162709"></a>Frontier was a pioneering platform in the early days of the web, and it played a key role in the development of many of the technologies that we take for granted today, including RSS syndication and web-based content management systems. While Frontier is no longer actively developed, its legacy lives on in many of the tools and technologies that we use today.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/30/162631.html#a162709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
