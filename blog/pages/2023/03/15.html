It sometimes can replace four apps I used previously: Google, GitHub, Twitter, Wikipedia.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/15.html#a162057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161612"></a>I was wondering how I could create something that behaved like an app on the Mac desktop from a page in Chrome. I want to use web Drummer to write docs about something I'm working on in Electric Drummer. It helps to have each in its own window for something like that, rather than switching back and forth between tabs. I was going to post a braintrust query but realized I could <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/chrome-page-to-app.html">use ChatGPT</a> and get the answer right away. It seems to have worked. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/15.html#a161612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160457"></a>I kind of like the idea of letting the <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/google-reader-shutdown.html">ChatGPT version of history</a> be the authoritative one. In the record of my own life, it's more accurate than Wikipedia, which has been hacked mercilessly since inception by opportunistic credit-takers<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/15.html#a160457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154150"></a>RSS 1.0 was not a fork, not sure how you'd characterize it, but it was definitely not a fork.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154152"></a>RSS 2.0, which appears to have been left out, was finished in September 2002, and was supported by the New York Times, and thus was supported by the whole news industry and became the standard. Though some disagree, it was backward-compatible with RSS 0.91 and 0.92.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/15/154044.html#a154152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
