<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141820"></a>In <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a>, if you're being asked to log in every time you go to the site, you're probably opening it via a bookmark that goes to the old URL. The easiest fix is to edit bookmark so it goes to <a href="https://feedland.org/">https://feedland.org/</a> -- note the <i>https.</i> Another fix is to do a <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html">hard-reload</a> of the page. This will force a new version to reload. It redirects if it gets a non https request. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/19.html#a141820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142952"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I get that people don't like that ChatGPT will return incorrect results. But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html">docs page</a> to answer this question. Looks pretty good to me! No bullshit in the page either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/19.html#a142952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
