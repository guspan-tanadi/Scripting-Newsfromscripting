<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142132"></a>Fixed a problem in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MtEsrcTTs">reallysimple package</a>. It caused FeedLand app to crash, occasionally. Just had to check that something wasn't undefined. I love fixing problems like this. It's how software gets burned in.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/22.html#a142132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't see any fascist messages, or antisemitism, or race hate, for some reason -- that everyone else seems to see. I still have longtime friends who I only see here. It still has that annoying character limit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/22/145205.html#a145211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145300"></a>I also use Mastodon, and it's more interesting all the time, esp when it comes to technical discussions. One thing I don't like about Mastodon culture is it seems to assume Twitter is over, and only terrible people use it. This feels a lot like the political divide in the US and elsewhere. I don't find this is a political thing for me. Maybe I'm too old to give a shit. That's probably it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/22/145205.html#a145300" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
