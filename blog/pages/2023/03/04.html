They wanted me to put this text in a blog post so they could quote it. There was no request, no "please," just here's the job. I didn't do it, and got a flamey email from the guy which surprisingly included a threat to never quote me again. What shocked me then and still shocks me today was how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma">pro forma</a> it seemed. The kind of thing they do for each other all the time in the news business? As far as I recall, I never wrote about it, and certainly never mentioned the name of the reporter. All that's interesting about it to me is that it appeared to be standard practice.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/04.html#a143146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
