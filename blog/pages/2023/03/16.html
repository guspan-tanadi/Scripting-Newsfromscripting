As part of the transition, and please this is only for people who read Scripting News, so don't pass it on -- membership in <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a> is now open. It had been closed since Dec 12 when I started working on the transition. You only need an email address to sign up, not a Twitter identity.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/16.html#a155848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
