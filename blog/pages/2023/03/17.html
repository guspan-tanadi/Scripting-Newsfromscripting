<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145459"></a>It will be possible to create better teachers out of ChatGPT tech. What led me to that is that it certainly could help people write better bug reports. It would have far more patience than a busy developer, whose job is to fix bugs, not decypher a user's (justifiably) imprecise understanding of how software works. But a chatbot could help, patiently asking the user questions. Then, of course, over time -- the user would learn how to do it themselves, and get this -- they would also learn how software works. There might be some great programmers out there who don't know they are. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/17.html#a145459" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The world was smaller then or so it seems. Maybe it's just me, maybe I've gotten smaller.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/03/17.html#a150026" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
