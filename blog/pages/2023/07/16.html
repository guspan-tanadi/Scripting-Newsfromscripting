Raining all the time. The rivers and ponds are full. So what comes next? Well if it stops raining, summer, which is usually the best time of year here, and pretty much anywhere. It's why I live here. But this summer. Well the only thing that could be worse imho is if we had this much precipitation in winter. Well, I know that isn't actually true. The heat wave in the west sounds pretty awful. Oh we really did it, the planet is on its way to being uninhabitable by humans? Whee here we go. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/16.html#a162545" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm more driven to write. Iâ€™m a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html">natural born blogger</a> or NBB. We write because thatâ€™s what we do. The first impulse is to write. First thing I want to do when I sit down to work is write and when Iâ€™m thinking about more things to do, Iâ€™m usually writing about it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/16.html#a194215" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
