I agree with all you said, had discovered it on my own, quickly -- that I could build on Mastodon's docs (and did), but the ActivityPub maze of specs is not an API, and not something a busy developer can approach. It all has to be simplified. We're still far away from the dream. As I said in my open voicemail -- it's time for developers to do a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html">BDG</a> for the social web, with docs <i>and software, </i>that embraces not just Mastodon and other ActivityPub services, but also Bluesky, and WordPress, which has a very mature API, offers stability, a foundation with clear value.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/27.html#a131957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a184750"></a>In general, if there's a change in <a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> or <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>, you want to be sure you're getting the latest client software. Normally the browser caches the code, but you can force it to get the latest versions. In Chrome/Mac with Cmd-Shift-R. Obviously it's different in different browsers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/27.html#a184750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

My mind is now possibly on the path to sanity. One can hope. Four Drummers on two machines is at least two too many. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/27.html#a163105" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165827"></a>There was a problem in <a href="http://sally.scripting.com/">Sally's Reader</a> that only showed up on some machines, having to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> permissions. I think I've worked around it, so it should work everywhere, one hopes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/27.html#a165827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Had this been an actual emergency, well we would have found some other way of notifying you, because this is hardly the way to tell a fine person such as yourself about an emergency. I hope all is well with you and yours and have a nice day! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/27.html#a160957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
