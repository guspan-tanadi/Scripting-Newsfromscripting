<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a120334"></a>I'll believe that Facebook's new social network is growing when I get the feeling "it's happening over there." So far that hasn't happened once. To think that's it's somehow dominant is ludicrous. As a developer, I want a platform that has curious creative people ready to try out new ideas. That's a niche Twitter has now given up, probably forever, and I doubt if Facebook wants developers for Threads. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/08.html#a120334" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122902"></a><a href="https://avc.com/2023/07/threads/">Fred Wilson is excited</a> about Threads, for the right reason, but I don't think it's going to play out the way he thinks. I replied <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/Cub6HNMu66A/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D">on Threads</a>, hunting and pecking on my tiny iPhone keyboard (I have huge hands btw). I'll expand on it here... <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/08/122852.html#a122902" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123022"></a>He repeats the folklore that Twitter "killed off" its app ecosystem in 2010. Certainly not at a technical level, the problem with Twitter's developer situation was that they didn't do anything to help products get the attention of users, esp important when we were filling gaps in the user experience that users desperately wanted filled. If a corporate platform wants developers they have to do this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/08/122852.html#a123022" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020458"></a>Even open source platforms need <i>someone</i> to spread the news of reliable and useful additions to the platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/08/122852.html#a020458" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020454"></a>Users aren't on their own that adventurous. They like to use what everyone else is using, which makes the bootstrap hard. But the platform vendor can provide the magic that gets it going. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/08/122852.html#a020454" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a123030"></a>However, like Fred, I am excited. Because somewhere in this chaos (a good thing) there is at least the possibility of a developer ecosystem. That hasn't been true for a long time. I don't think that will happen in ActivityPub, for technical reasons. It needs a small amount of centralization to make the hurdle for developers surmountable.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/08/122852.html#a123030" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
