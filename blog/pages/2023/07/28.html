I thought to use a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api">toolkit</a> John Spurlock pointed me to. But where to start? All the theory upfront, like the spec, I just want something that takes the ID of a post and returns a JavaScript object with a bunch of info like the text, any image enclosed, when it was posted, stuff like that. There really are only 5 or 10 endpoints most apps need. If you're interested in solving this problem for Bluesky, please post a note in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/266">thread</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/28.html#a160538" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195026"></a>Reporters say the allegations against Trump are damaging or incredible are yet again selling the same Trump story they’ve been selling since 2016. He’s a full time 24-by-7 criminal. If Trump is doing anything it’s incredibly damningly criminal, and he doesn’t care because he openly says the laws don’t apply to him. The only news here is that someone in government is finally trying to really do something about it, or at least that’s what it kind of looks like. We’ve been here many times only to find out at some point they decide for some reason he’s right and the laws don’t actually apply to him, and so far they haven’t. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/28.html#a195026" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Now I want to be mobile, camp out in various places, and still be able to keep the servers running, update and write new code and docs, and my blog, basically everything I do at my desktop. This has meant going back to Dropbox, but not sacrificing the very nice systems I've built that don't depend on Dropbox, because the Linux version is hard to install, and is unpredictable and flaky. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/28/122106.html#a122128" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122607"></a>I have one server system that runs Dropbox well, so I'm moving all the software I ran locally to push stuff into the cloud onto that server, and instead of saving things to local folders, I save them to Dropbox-hosted folders. The server versions of the software watch the Dropbox folders and move things to where they belong, just as they did on the desktop. Voila, Uncle Davey can move around, and theoretically everything works as it did before. And so far it does. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/28/122106.html#a122607" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122233"></a>I am able to edit all my docs in <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a>, and my blog, and I'm much happier than I was when I was trying to do all that in web Drummer. E/D is a much better fit for the way I work. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4pN9L2ArGs">Bookmarks menu in Drummer</a> was key to making this a (so far) relatively easy transition. But figuring out what to do and doing it took pretty much the whole month of July. Still have a bit more to do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/28/122106.html#a122233" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
