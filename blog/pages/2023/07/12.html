<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124257"></a>Facebook hasn't done anything to support the open web. All they've done is put it in a press release and post an email to a mail list. It's a long road from there to being on the open web. More likely they're going to use the open web and leave it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Superfund_sites">toxic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">waste site</a> after they leave.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/12.html#a124257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211901"></a>If Facebook really loved the open web they'd hook Facebook itself up to it. Support RSS feeds in and out. Let users have rich text and links.

A real luxury item. I feel the same way as we approach the middle of the next century when I get to use boldface text or a bit of italic in a tweet. I laughed out loud when some text I pasted from my blog went through with its boldness intact. We have a long way to go to <a href="http://textcasting.org/">get back</a> where we were. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/12.html#a123300" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a111706"></a>I've seen people use the term "social web" where previously they'd say "social media." I like this. Going in the right direction. Let's try to bring everything back to the web. I bet most people who use the web these days only have a vague idea of what it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/12.html#a111706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a111522"></a>I was just filling out a form that asked for my social media addresses and noticed how I don't remember how to specify the addresses for Bluesky, Mastodon and LinkedIn. I had no trouble with Twitter and Threads, though I have a lot of trouble remembering the name of Threads. I think Bluesky is headed in the right direction, by letting people specify a domain name. A service that made this a bit easier for non-technical users could help here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/12.html#a111522" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
