And respect for Elon Musk in a limited way, reminds me of Philippe Kahn. 20 minutes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06.html#a153423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190704"></a>Twitter isn't going away. What we should hope for is they start adding stuff to Twitter that users really like. And that'll force Facebook to do it too. As a result technology moves forward. One-party systems stagnate as we've seen.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06.html#a190704" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154639"></a>The discussion about Threads is happening on Twitter. In a sense nothing has happened until links to Threads posts show up here. It's an almost zero-interop system at this point.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06.html#a154639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155015"></a>Actually you can embed posts in HTML pages (<a href="https://fruitsalad.lucky.wtf/embedfrombluesky.html">example</a>), but that's about it. <s>You can't even link to individual posts or threads. Or if you can, I haven't seen any.</s> You can also link to individual posts, <a href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuVhc4xpYZS/">example</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06.html#a155015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've said the same. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/142246.html#a130701" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142336"></a>One thing they reallllly need is a browser interface, so it can exist on the same plane as the other social nets. I can't paste links back and forth between their network and others. even at that primitive level of interop, it doesn't exist. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/142246.html#a142336" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142348"></a>On Twitter I'm able to write fluidly esp now that the character limit is just a speed bump. I've never felt in any way like writing on a phone was writing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/142246.html#a142348" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142355"></a>The big picture is no one gets that these tools are writing environments. so they design them to have features writers can use.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/142246.html#a142355" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125250"></a>Earlier, I started to write about how boring, sad, depressing and unnecessary Threads is. How pathetic Zuck is. How I visualize the process that led to this product as being a combination of the TV series Succession and Silicon Valley. Facebook is desperately trying to become anything but Facebook. I like Facebook as a community. I have friends there who I would never talk with if it weren't for Facebook. I hope they keep running it. But I wish the company behind it would stop demanding attention because they are so completely unattractive. And btw, I can't get into writing on an iPhone. I write at a desk, or maybe occasionally a tablet. Everything about this product pushes me away. Maybe that'll change, maybe the people who are trying to get ahead on Threads will think up some new use for social networks that will justify using it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/140646.html#a125250" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134158"></a>Some of my friends think that Threads is enough, and once they fill in some missing features it will suck the life out of Twitter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html#a134158" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023532"></a>They might be right. Hard to argue.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html#a023532" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023540"></a>All I want is a playground with an open API and enough creative users to try out new ideas from developers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html#a023540" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a022548"></a>I want to go back to the pace of innovation we had going in the 90s and 00s. The big platforms snuffed all that out, corralled it and kept it in some too-restrictive bounds. Did what BillG failed to, locked us in the trunk and cut off the air supply. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html#a022548" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023558"></a>That some of these people were the most fervent advocates for open platforms says that maybe those beliefs ran pretty thin, and the opportunity to cash it out for billions made it worthwhile.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html#a023558" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a023632"></a>Maybe we'll just be hobbyists. I'm okay with that. Or maybe people are will to pay good money to sustain creative development.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html#a023632" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
