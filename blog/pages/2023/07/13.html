	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115114"></a>I know how The Mind of Facebook works. There are people at the company who believe in the open web (or at least there were at one time) and some of them have the ability to launch projects to be part of the open web, but by the time the project has to get approval from one of the top execs, it dies -- because Zuck et al have hearts of stone, and think they can have anything that isn't nailed down, and think anyone who believes in being fair to users and competitors is a chump -- a Mother Teresa type, someone to laugh at not work with.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/13/115050.html#a115114" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131201"></a>They're running a standard <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?EmbraceAndExtend">Embrace and Extend</a> strategy of a giant company entering a market that's "dominated" by a small competitor that's hoping for the best. I put <i>dominated</i> in quotes because it's obvious that the market defined by the startup is going to be huge. But it's better if the new area is dominated by a mega corp, that is for the established billionaires. For the rest of us, it sucks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/13/131033.html#a131201" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>

I'm here, I am typing into <a href="http://scripting.com/">my blog</a>, but not enough people are hearing it. Don't believe Facebook has good intentions. If they did, they would hook the main Facebook product up to the open web, not the new one.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/13/131033.html#a131249" title="Direct link to this item." style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: .1em; color: purple;" >#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131316"></a>Maybe it's time from some other names of the open web generation to step up and help. Facebook is going to run over the nascent federated social web the same way <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html">Google</a> ran over <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>.
