I have a big roof repair job going on, and, as you probably know it's <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/17/weather.png">raining almost every day</a> and quite a lot, which makes the job take longer and makes the work riskier, but it has to happen now.  I have to work this out. And not lose any work, and not break anything. A real high wire act. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/17.html#a215131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
