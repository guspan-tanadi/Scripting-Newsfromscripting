	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150653"></a>Someone I follow on Twitter complained that people thought just because he was a VC he wasn't allowed to have opinions.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I don't see him as a troll. I think there are VCs in Calif who have a very limited set of people they talk with, and they actually fit into Trump's target. Even though they;'re hugely rich, young, healthy, super super privileged, they really feel misunderstood and victimized. It's real. They really feel it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/150629.html?title=trumpingOnTwitter#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131206"></a>I've set up the root, <a href="http://opml.org/">opml.org</a> itself, as an A record pointing to 142.93.4.110. This server is where I host all my simple PagePark sites, ones that consist of static pages, and config.json settings. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/131002.html?title=undoingTheOpmlorgRedirectMess#a131206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<ul class="ulLevel2">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131709"></a>Why? Until recently opml.org was a bucket on S3, set up to redirect to <a href="http://dev.opml.org/">dev.opml.org</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/131002.html?title=undoingTheOpmlorgRedirectMess#a131709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131723"></a>I'm guessing they used a 301 permanent redirect, which causes my browser to cache the redirect. It doesn't bother making a DNS request for opml.org, because (guessing) the redirect was permanent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/131002.html?title=undoingTheOpmlorgRedirectMess#a131723" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131838"></a>So that's where I am this morning.

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124512"></a>I grew up in the time of the Vietnam War. I was draft age, had a low lottery number, no exemptions, and was flunking out of high school, so the prospect of being drafted was pretty real. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/125212.html?title=commentsOnAfghanistan#a124512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125244"></a>One thing I was absolutely sure of was that none of the people who were draft age in that time would start another war like Vietnam, but then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">one of them</a> did. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/125212.html?title=commentsOnAfghanistan#a125244" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125251"></a>It became a debacle just like Vietnam. But with a few differences. No draft and no body bags. And far fewer American casualties. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/125212.html?title=commentsOnAfghanistan#a125251" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125315"></a>The idea of the US converting a country we know nothing about and don't want to know anything about into a country modeled after the US is just as wrong today as it was in the 60s and 70s. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/125212.html?title=commentsOnAfghanistan#a125315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125330"></a>Lots of parallels. Another one is that journalism is completely fucking up the story, telling bedtime stories about what the US could do, and how events developed, and getting the story completely wrong. I'm no expert, but I've read enough to know that there was a deal between the US and the Taliban that did not include the Afghan government, where the US committed to leave in 2020, and the Taliban agreed to not attack us as we left. Had we decided to stay, breaking that deal, we would have committed to a full scale war with the Taliban. There was no middle alternative between leaving and war. Whether or not this was wise is something you have to ask former president Trump. He desperately wanted to get out of Afghanistan and was willing to give up everything to get it. But even that much he couldn't pull off. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/16/125212.html?title=commentsOnAfghanistan#a125330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125434"></a>Fact: once we went in, there was no graceful way out.
