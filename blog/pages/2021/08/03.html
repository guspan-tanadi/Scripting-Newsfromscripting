But none of the talking heads will call for this because they all depend on a good relationship with the cable system owners. A very deep conflict of interest, across the board. It's like software devs can't afford to piss off Google or Apple, or else they'll figure out a way to kick them out of their app stores.

I think we're doing the wise thing in NY state. It's easy to put a mask on, much easier than being intubated and dying. The peaches are the best part of the year except for the apple harvest. On the other hand at the hardware store, I was the only one wearing a mask. So maybe it's not <i>all</i> peaches yet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/03.html#a200400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
