I loved it. Warning, there are spoilers in this <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/howTheMoviePigReallyResonatedForMe.m4a">podcast</a>, but something to know about the movie is that it isn't the kind of movie that you can spoil with spoilers, but you have been warned. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/15.html#a172001" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210111"></a>opml.org is a mess, like all of my long-term tech projects, suffering from lack of focus, but no lack of experimentation! I've been going through the projects one by one, now it's opml.org's turn. I have a staging site for the new version at <a href="http://2021.opml.org/">2021.opml.org</a>. Notes and links on that page.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/15.html#a210111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You could use a CNAME for any name, including the top level of a domain. It's so rational, I don't understand why all DNS service providers don't allow it. Except now it no longer appears to work on Hover. I'm trying to set up opml.org to be CNAME for pagepark.scripting.com. I don't want to hard-code it to a specific server IP address. The whole idea of having a name like <a href="http://pagepark.scripting.com/">pagepark.scripting.com</a> is so that I can easily relocate it to new hardware someday without having to find all the places that have its IP address hard-coded. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/15/hoverScreenShot.png">screen shot</a> of what it says when I try to do that now. It appears to be a user interface thing only, the domains I set up previously using this feature still appear to work. If you have an idea what's going on, please post a note <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/220">here</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/15.html#a140054" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
