<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012642"></a>The way we’re responding to Covid is exactly like the way we respond to climate change.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163233"></a>I wanted to try <a href="https://holly.plus/">Holly+</a> so I recorded a song but got "error" and <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/25/Song2.m4a">did another</a>, and also got an error. Disappointed. I thought it was a good idea. Maybe my songs weren't good enough. Oh la.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/25.html#a163233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162315"></a>I saw somewhere the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/bidens-approval-ratings-plummet-bad-news-for-democrats-in-congress.html">Biden's approval numbers are down</a> because the virus is booming. This is wrong. He's doing the job we hired him to do. Our mistake is we give up our power and responsibility and look to a parent figure to take care of us. But that's not how America works. The president isn't all-powerful, isn't a god, or even god-like. The president is a human being. We should judge the president on their honor and intelligence, and ability to listen, and we should take responsibility for <i>our</i> power.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/25.html#a162315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
