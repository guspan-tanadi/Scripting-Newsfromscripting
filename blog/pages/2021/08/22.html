<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175730"></a>You'd think that by now <span class="spTagref">Facebook</span> would have figured out how to make a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/22/squintyText.png">story</a> read well on their website, by default, based on who's reading and what their vision is capable of. I can kind of read a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/22/squintyText.png">story</a> like this, but it involves a lot of squinting and scrolling and interpolating.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/22.html#a175730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171302"></a>A perhaps surprising truth. We aren't free to ignore other people. For example, you're not allowed to shit in a public swimming pool. Think about it and all the other things you aren't free to do. It's not something you can argue about and live with other people.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/22.html#a171302" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a002235"></a>Om, the height of silo-osity was when <span class="spTagref">Substack</span> came along, they insisted that in order to use their service you had to use their editor. I absolutely refused to do that, so I had to write my own <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">email distributer app</a>. What a waste of effort. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/22/002233.html?title=extremeSiloosity#a002235" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a003231"></a>We have to get through to them and others. Componentize so some devs can specialize in editors and others can specialize in distribution.
