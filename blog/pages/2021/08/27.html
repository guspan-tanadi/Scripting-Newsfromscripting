He says (paraphrasing): "The NRA is not going away. Every American should have a gun." I wanted to ask if he felt that every Black man should have a gun, or just Whites. What about religion? Should Jews and Muslims have guns too? Should only rich people have guns, or should poor people have them too? If a Black man came to your all-White neighborhood would you like to see him with a gun? Would you call the cops if a Black man came into a convenience store with a gun? I suspect he was thinking, when he said every American should have a gun, of Americans like himself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27.html#a125656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I like it -- it's really simple. But it could be even simpler! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131201"></a>First a summary of why this is important. I want to use my own editor to write a newsletter and publish it through a commercial newsletter service. I don't want to use their editor. Why? Because as a writer, I have the best editor for me. And I don't like being a copy-paste-bot. My writing has too many ways to get out to make it possible to do that for all of them. And I want someone to go first, to make it easy to publish without forcing me to be creative in their world, with their inadequate (for me) editor.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131330"></a>So to further the discussion -- here's how I would do the API .<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulNumberedSubs">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131408"></a>The user, through the app's user interface, enters the URL of an RSS feed. That interaction is of course authenticated.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131414"></a>When a new item appears in the feed, publish it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131423"></a>For extra credit, accept a simple unauthenticed ping message with the username, which tells your server to check the feed. That way your server doesn't have to check as often.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131418"></a>Voila, super simple API.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/27/131137.html?title=apiForNewsletterPublishing#a131418" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
