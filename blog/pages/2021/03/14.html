<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193849"></a>Well haha I believe I have all the issues worked out with the ThreadViewer app. Here's my <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370863807715762179">test thread</a>, viewed in <a href="http://threadviewer.com/1370863807715762179">ThreadViewer</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/14.html#a193849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a182400"></a>BTW the people who said I'd like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/ted-lasso/season-1">Ted Lasso</a> were right. I'm through episode 4 now. Hooked. I thought at first it was like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/brockmire">Brockmire</a>, but later realized it's actually more like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-good-place">The Good Place</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/14.html#a182400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140327"></a>Earlier today the NYT published an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/opinion/andrew-cuomo.html">editorial</a> about Cuomo <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/14/nytEditorialScreen.png">saying</a>: "The governor has lost his political allies and the publicâ€™s confidence." There's no question about the first part, lots of Democratic office-holders in New York have called for him to resign. But there are no polls that show that he's lost the confidence of the voters. For a few days last week I thought it was over, he should resign, because they're never going to let him be a functioning governor again. But I get an email from him every day, and he's going forward with the business of helping New Yorkers deal with the pandemic. Without him, we'd be as adrift as every other state. So I say, stay in office Governor Cuomo. Let the investigation run its course, let the people see, clearly, what the charges are, and how they're substantiated, and then we'll talk. The idea that such a huge decision that has so much affect on New Yorkers, should be made in a rush, without our participation &mdash; no one has made that case yet. This is our decision to make, collectively. Times editors get one vote, the same as every other voter in New York. And imho, it's wrong for them to say the public is losing confidence and then offer no evidence to back that up. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/14.html#a140327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214743"></a>I wonder if they have arguments within the NYT Editorial Board about whether or not "the public" is something they can fudge. When they say "the public" is losing confidence in the governor, should they back that up with data, or just say it because it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8UZn7PmyXc&t=58s">feels right</a> to them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/14.html#a214743" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
