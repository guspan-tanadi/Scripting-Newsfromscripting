What a difference it would make if we had a leader who could do fireside chats and keep us all directed in the most positive way,  as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Cuomo%22&t=h_&ia=web">Cuomo</a> did last year. Biden is doing the right things, but he doesn't have a good fireside manner. Cuomo was one-in-a-generation. I think that is now impossible. I think ultimately this was a product of very bad judgment on his part and journalism without perspective. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/09.html#a152717" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So I downloaded a bunch of classics I read in school to see if I wanted to read any of them again. 1984. Brave New World. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>. I started reading it, and the racial slur that got <a href="https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/nytimes-peru-n-word-part-four-what-happened-in-peru-2a641a9b5e83">Donald McNeil</a> fired is all through the first chapter. A dozen times probably. It's really hard to listen to, so I stopped reading it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/09.html#a144535" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143328"></a>The most amazing thing happens when woman friends visit. They take over my kitchen. Move things around. Hide them.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145910"></a>I got so used to it, and btw angered about it, that I tried to make a deal with my aunt when she and my uncle came to visit when I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California">Calif</a>. I said if you tell me why you want to do it, I'll let you. (At least they asked, I think that was probably my uncle's influence, I should have asked him why they asked, usually they don't, they just start doing). Anyway, when I made the offer Aunt Marsha said nothing and went ahead and started cleaning and reorganizing.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/09/143317.html?title=myKitchenIsMine#a145910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143452"></a>It. Happens. All. The. Time. And I hate it. I fucking hate it. I tell them this before they do it. I tell them while they're doing it. I warn them, don't mess with the kitchen, after they've done it, and they do it again. Oy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/09/143317.html?title=myKitchenIsMine#a143452" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Now on their side -- I don't think there's much thought to it. I think I am invisible to them. Not a factor.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143559"></a>I've asked many times if they would do this to a woman friend, come for a visit and start rearranging and cleaning their kitchen. No one has said yes, but I think some of them actually do it. But most won't because it's such a sign of disrespect. I guess maybe they can see other women. Or they can relate to it, they can imagine how they would feel if their friend tried to take over <i>their</i> kitchen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/09/143317.html?title=myKitchenIsMine#a143559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
