Put everything else aside. I think I'm ready to create a small subset of <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> that runs in the cloud. Basic components are outlining of course, twitter and a cloud-based file system. Scripts run from a user-editable menu as they did in Frontier. Still major things to work out, it's probably months away. But I might start sharing little bits of the work I'm doing, to get discussions going, esp with Frontier alums. The language is JavaScript, but here's the thing -- we don't need callbacks for asynchronous operations, it flows just like any other language. <a href="https://blog.andrewshell.org/">Andrew Shell</a> figured out the escape from callbacks, that was what convinced me that you could make a scripting system based on JavaScript. BTW, the codename for the project is Drummer.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140341"></a>In the Roam <a href="https://twitter.com/10ch/status/1374343900765192198">world</a>, which I am following, they document their workflows. Come up with best practices. This is really eye-opening for me. Inspired me to do a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1374354453768380416">quick writeup</a> of how I manage my development projects using an outliner. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a140341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162200"></a>One curious thing from working on Drummer: I like working on verb docs. I find it relaxing, satisfying, rewarding. I just realized why. I'm writing a book. At the top level the structure is rigid. I like working within such a structure. By verb docs, I mean docs like what you <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/file/exists">see</a> on <a href="http://docserver.userland.com/">DocServer</a> from Frontier, which is still running, btw. The difference is this time I'm writing the docs. Last time I didn't have the energy to do it, but now it's the structure for my review of various aspects of the system. Reading the verb docs you'll know I went through that verb's functionality before release. Of course I'm also documenting the bugs.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a162200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
