For example, the Finder on the Mac needs a simple scripting language. Starting with Lotus 1-2-3, spreadsheets had macro languages. Programmable editors are popular because writers love to get their writing environment just-so. The theory of Frontier was to pour lots of attention into the scripting language, and make it work across all apps. We did a pretty fair job. It didn't get as much attention as it deserved because Apple got in the way. We shouldn't give up on this ideal. It's still possible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a151444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've been to places where it is legal  (Calif, WA, Colorado, Mass to name a few). It's one of those "did you ever think you'd live to see it" days. Weird that tomorrow is April 1. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a170459" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a004613"></a>Highly recommend <a href="https://productionadvice.co.uk/the-making-of-sgt-pepper/">The Making of Sgt Pepper</a>. Interviews with George Martin, the three surviving Beatles (in the early 90s). Many others. This album was the turning point from the Beatles being a touring phenom, to pioneering a new creative direction for pop music. It's inspiring, we need a similar turn in software. (It's also available <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1478913278982739">on Facebook</a> if that works better.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
