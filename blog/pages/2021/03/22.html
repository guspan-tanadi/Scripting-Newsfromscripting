<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164120"></a>In my experience, most programmers don't care how things came to be the way they are. I'm different, I always want to know the story. I find this the most fascinating thing about us humans, how do we synthesize ideas, build on other people's work. More common is people try to ignore the past, esp if it interferes with their success. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/22.html#a164120" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Patents have really screwed things up, but no one has ever picked up on the idea that we could have something like patents, but without the tarriff. I want people to know whose work they're using. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/22/165048.html?title=nftsContainAGoodIdeaAndItsNotTheMoney#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Once I made enough money, I stopped trying to put barriers on where my ideas could flow. But as a result, I rarely have been able to finish an idea before a big company comes along and takes it over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/22/165048.html?title=nftsContainAGoodIdeaAndItsNotTheMoney#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

If you have to join a big company to be creative, well you can see from that how little creativity there would be. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/22/165048.html?title=nftsContainAGoodIdeaAndItsNotTheMoney#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165128"></a>The potential of NFTs is it could document how ideas entered the world.
