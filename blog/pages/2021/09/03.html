<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153947"></a>I saw a supposed expert on Wolf Blitzer's show on CNN last night saying there was nothing the Dems could do about Roe v Wade. This is what passes for expertise at CNN these days.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141445"></a>Drummer user note: When you're creating something new in a chronologic structure, use the big + icon at the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/03/plusIcon.png">top of the icon bar</a>. Don't do it by hand. The software that cares about chronologic notes ignores nodes that were created by hand. The + icon puts special attributes on the nodes that matter. You could if you wanted to do it yourself. But why would you? I'm saying this 20 different ways, here on Scripting News and everywhere else I can think to because I want <span class="spTagref">Drummer</span> users to get this right. It's important. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/03.html#a141445" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145848"></a>I'm doing user support for the first time since <span class="spTagref">Fargo</span> days and am reminded of what sucks about it. In the groups I am part of, as a user,when I ask for help I have reproduced the problem on my machine several times. I have tried workarounds. I've thought about it. I don't immediately ask for help, because I know the other people are like me, doing it for love, it's not their job, they're helping because they like to help. For whatever reason the groups I assemble often don't do this. At the first sign of trouble they post something that's impossible to understand, and it's really clear they didn't try it again, or they would have spotted their mistake. Support is a dear resource. Use it when you need it, but be sure first that you do need it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/03.html#a145848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
