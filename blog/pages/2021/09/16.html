<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210823"></a>Something to think about. While we're debating all kinds of things, so far 4.5 million have killed by Covid in the last two years. In four years, 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/16.html#a210823" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143324"></a>Saw a report on the news that Facebook is evil because they enhance pictures on Instagram. A really thin story because so many things other than Facebook damage people's self-perception based on ridiculous standards of appearance. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/16/143239.html?title=cnnCouldUseAConstantCritic#a143324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143506"></a>CNN does it, for sure in huge ways. The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=brianna+keilar">anchor</a> reporting the story is a beautful woman, but probably not quite as beautiful has her makeup, hair and lighting people make her seem.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/16/143239.html?title=cnnCouldUseAConstantCritic#a143506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

If you haven't seen it, you might love it. It's very different from the usual TV news fare. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/16/143239.html?title=cnnCouldUseAConstantCritic#a143855" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
