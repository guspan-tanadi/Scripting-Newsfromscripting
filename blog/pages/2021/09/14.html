<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200114"></a>Today is one of those rare days where I have very little to say on the blog. I'm still working my way back through the <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then">Now & Then podcasts</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(season_1)">The Wire</a> (still in season 1) and of course working every day on <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer">Drummer</a>, with the help of the test group. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/14.html#a200114" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
