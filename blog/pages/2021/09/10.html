I was living on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/425+Manzanita+Way,+Woodside,+CA+94062/@37.4190408,-122.2473884,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa438d2e58d87:0x6c0dbc392cc6bf79!8m2!3d37.4190408!4d-122.2451997">Manzanita Way</a> in Woodside, CA. Woke up early as I always did in those days. If you <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/10/scriptingNews911.png">scroll to the bottom</a>, the day started out normally. A link to a friend's blog hosting service, a Wired story about Hollywood, a new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Windows-Fumbled-Microsoft-Hardcover/dp/B010CKSFT0">book</a> about Microsoft, then at 6:15AM, we get the news of the first plane. Then a reader finds a web cam on the Empire State Building pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001)">WTC</a>. Then a second plane hits. And from there the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif">story develops</a>. There was a personal side to it, my father taught at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pace+University/@40.7112562,-74.0073645,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c258fe30a7b447:0x8a0a55f0a5fd1f1f!8m2!3d40.7112562!4d-74.0051758">Pace University</a>, which is across from City Hall, very near ground zero. He was okay, but had to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Pace+University,+One+Pace+Plaza,+New+York,+NY+10038/29-31+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/@40.7336612,-73.9707111,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c258fe30a7b447:0x8a0a55f0a5fd1f1f!2m2!1d-74.0051758!2d40.7112562!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!3e2">walk</a>, like many thousands of others, from lower Manhattan to Queens. My mother saw the whole thing from a rooftop in Brooklyn.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/10.html#a194215" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144050"></a>Thanks to everyone who pointed me to the <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then">Now & Then podcast</a> with Heather Cox Richardson and Joanne Freeman. I listened to the most recent <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/climate-control/id1567665859?i=1000534537048">episode</a> about the history of humans and climate in America. Wow. So much information and perspective, without any extra junk, and with depth that can only come from having spent a lifetime learning. It is exactly what I was looking for, at least so far. There are quite a few podcasts in the library, and they're exactly as long as my bike ride. They were finishing as I was pulling into the garage, literally. Also only one commercial and it was for a new podcast from the same network. Not overbearing. Thrilled. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/10.html#a144050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
