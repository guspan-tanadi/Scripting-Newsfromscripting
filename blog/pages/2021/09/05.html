<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163149"></a>I once designed a JSONified version of RSS. <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/03/17/jsonifiedRss.html">Wrote about it</a> and even put up a demo.

A recent <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx">Gallup poll</a> shows that 43 percent of American women are pro-life and 45 percent of men are pro-choice. I thnk everyone should be pro-choice, but it's wrong to blame men for the current situation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05.html#a233707" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Colin Kaepernick  is  black, in America that means heâ€™s a slave. Our country has yet to settle that question. Most of us have decided to grow out of it, but for a sizeable minority, theyâ€™re going keep fighting it. What Kaepernick is to them, a slave who forgot his place.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05.html#a154341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140409"></a>I have an Electron version of <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer">Drummer</a> for the Mac (to start) almost ready to go, but there are problems with the File dialogs. It feels like a versioning thing? These routines worked fine in earlier software. So I figure what I need to do is get this app building using the latest versions of Electron and the latest build tools. If I recall correctly they change a lot. And it's been a while since I figured out how to do it. When I read their docs for building stuff I feel as lost as I felt when I was just starting out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05/140327.html?title=gettingCaughtUpWithElectron#a140409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Summary: it was a bad idea. I don't know why devs want to come up with new names for well-established concepts. It makes all our lives more complicated if the format catches on, and if it doesn't, it just makes a mess.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05/160829.html?title=jsonFeedAfterFourYears#a160841" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160940"></a>If you absolutely had to have a JSON feed format, which no one does, it's easy to encapsulate anything you don't like about a format behind a simplifying API, and anything you can represent in <span class="spTagref">RSS</span> can be represented in JSON and vice versa, the best thing to do was a <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.json">JSONified RSS</a>. But they didn't do that either. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05/160829.html?title=jsonFeedAfterFourYears#a160940" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161037"></a>Okay, so four years later <a href="https://github.com/manton/JSONFeed/issues/157">this thread</a> appears in the support repo. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05/160829.html?title=jsonFeedAfterFourYears#a161037" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161105"></a>I might have been vaguely aware that Apple has a new format, obviously its own reinvention of RSS, also a totally bad idea, and another developer thinks JSON Feed should adopt its features. He is correct. That is the right move. Or even better, just leave JSON Feed behind and support both Apple's new incompatible format and RSS 2.0. Given that they're rooted in the Apple world, probably both. But the sparsely supported format they put out there was a bad idea and today it's an even worse idea, and it's only going to get more so. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05/160829.html?title=jsonFeedAfterFourYears#a161105" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161326"></a>People keep doing this, thinking that starting over is the thing to do. Apple will have trouble with their format because publishers will see it as the trap that it obviously is and probably will forever tell Apple it would be better if they didn't go off and blaze a new trail when there already is a well-worn path. No one wants to get locked in the trunk, they want to ride up front with you. And in publishing, thankfully, Apple still is not dominant. And hopefully it stays that way. And the rest of us have to circle the wagons and <i>reduce</i> the number of formats we have to deal with, not add to them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/05/160829.html?title=jsonFeedAfterFourYears#a161326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
