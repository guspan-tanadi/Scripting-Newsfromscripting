He was right about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpST8KE3vSI">type-casting</a>. His one great role was Omar. Once you get a part that good, and play it so well, and everyone else is that good, you just don't get to do that twice.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13.html#a180437" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135520"></a>Chrome has done something insidious to break the web a little more. They do this so often, breaking the web seems to be Google's business model. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a135520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135553"></a>Here's what they changed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a135553" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140138"></a>If you type a domain name into the address bar of the browser, the protocol is hidden. This isn't new, or particularly bad, until they made the next change.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a140138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135620"></a>Now instead of automatically generating http as the protocol in the URL, they generate https. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a135620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135828"></a>So sites that are running fine appear to be broken. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a135828" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135829"></a>It happened on a <a href="http://javascriptscript.com/">placeholder site</a> to me just now. I was fooled, I immediately thought a server had gone down, and started looking for the outage. Then I was reminded of this trickery Google is doing. I was reminded of how much I hate what Google is doing to the web. They're fighting with me, and weakening the web in a way they have no right to. My site is a perfectly functional web site. It's just a placeholder. No one needs to worry about a "man in the middle" interference. There are no ads on this site. I don't know how else to say it. My choice of protocols is none of Google's business. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a135829" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135632"></a>That's basically a protection racket. If mobsters were doing it. "Nice little website you have there, be a shame if people couldn't reach it because Google broke the web.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/13/135514.html?title=moreWebBreakageFromGoogle#a135632" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
