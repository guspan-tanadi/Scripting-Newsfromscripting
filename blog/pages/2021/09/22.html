At one point Heather Cox Richardson said, almost proudly, that the only thing she knows about NYC is the line in the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u1zK8AaHic">New York, New York</a> "If you can make it there you can make it anywhere." This is one of my big problems with podcasts, the thing that tunes me out, when people speak from a position of false expertise. They're having a grand time, and while I (the listener) am deciding whether or not to cut them off, based on the probability that they'll ever say anything interesting before the end. Yesterday I cut them off and listened to music for the second half of my ride. It's the same reason I can't watch any MSNBC show for more than 3 minutes. They're filling the air, meantime I know there are things going on they should be informing me of, and add to things my mind can think about. Okay so N&T had a bad episode, not the end of the world, the other most recent episodes are totally worth listening to, I highly recommend them, and I will keep listening in the hope that the NYC episode was just a bad idea they followed through on instead of canning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/22.html#a150318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
