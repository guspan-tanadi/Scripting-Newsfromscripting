It gives the person who posted a piece absolute power over the existence of comments. On pieces I post, I don't limit myself to deleting abusive or personal comments, I delete ornery or challenging ones too. I hate online debates. I host a debate-free environment. If you want to debate, take your business elsewhere. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/07.html#a153108" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202817"></a>All the nasty fascist crap that's surfacing now has always been there, handed down lovingly from generation to generation. Every family no matter how good or bad, depraved, sociopathic, narcissistic, everything -- they all think they're the best, smartest, luckiest <i>and</i> the worst treated and unluckiest. SItting around the kitchen table listening to mom and dad philosophize about the world, it rubs off. What makes families different is how they deal with those beliefs. March, write letters, watch Maddow or Hannity. Or join the Nazi party. I don't honestly think there's anything that can be done to break this, family is the strongest force for determining our view of the world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/07.html#a202817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a201533"></a>I just remembered that Apple basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics#Subsidiary_of_Apple_Inc._(2014%E2%80%93present)">merged</a> with the music industry, so it's not surprising that it's difficult if not impossible to copy MP3s from my Mac to my iPhone so I can program my own music.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/07.html#a201533" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Technically it's still summer, but I'm sitting here trying to warm up for a day of work, wearing a sweat shirt and shivering.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154154"></a>The promises syntax is slightly more compact.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154311"></a>This is a basic mathematics thing. They're always looking for a way to find one theorum that encapsulates and makes unnecessaray two or more. A more fundamental truth. The hope is ultimately to have one concise way of saying everything. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty">Rick and Morty</a> kind of idea. But why do programmers always seem to do the opposite? Solving a problem of too much complexity by adding even more complexity.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/07/154126.html?title=factoring#a154311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
