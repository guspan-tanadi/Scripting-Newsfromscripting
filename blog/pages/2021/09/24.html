<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a182621"></a>The <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage">OPML package</a> has a new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/3b4a4e289d87ebd9cffe9d239c7a8b63b3954a4c/client/opml.js#L154">end-point</a> that reads an OPML file, and if it has an <i>urlUpdateSocket</i> head-level attribute, sets up a subscription, and calls back when the outline is modified. Captures all the complex code behind the interface, so an OPML-consuming app can have instant updates with no effort. It's wonderful to see this in action, hope to have a public demo soon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/24.html#a182621" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
