There's a huge difference between the two models. In the first model we are free to compete, but never on the basis of user lock-in. In the latter, the platform vendor has all the power, you can only coexist with them on their terms, and they can change the terms at any time. This has always been true in my experience. The way we work as equals is we agree on an interchange format. I have committed to supporting <span class="spTagref">OPML</span> in all my products. So they can all be replaced. And so can yours, if you make it easy for users to migrate, and when you do that you also open the door for people to create products that plug into yours without having to replace yours. We compete as equals. We compete to please users. We are free to build on each others' work. That's the kind of discipline I like as a developer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/23.html#a163211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

No contrition, theyâ€™ve never done an exposÃ©, and they have the gall to be sarcastic. Iâ€™m no fan of Facebook, but journalism is actually making them sympathetic.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/23.html#a152823" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141013"></a>They do act as a unit. You'll see basically the same stories on all websites and cable news stations. They often interview each other, which is pretty amazing if you think about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/23/140953.html?title=journalismInTheAggregate#a141013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141031"></a>And to balance the way they view Facebook, with 2.7 billion users, they only consider one user when they talk about Facebook, as if we all are just Zuck-clones. I made a <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings">list</a> of all the things Facebook is, and journalism rarely considers anything but the personality of one person when talking about "Facebook." Not that they really have any insight into his personality, btw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/23/140953.html?title=journalismInTheAggregate#a141031" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
