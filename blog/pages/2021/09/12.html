<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171236"></a>The other night I was bored and noticed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The Wire</a> was on HBO, so I watched one episode. Then another. And another. Later I started at Episode 1. I don't know how many times I've watched <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire">The Wire</a>. I'm almost at a point where I can recite the lines along with the actors. I've yet to see a flaw in this show, there's nothing I don't follow with rapt attention. I can't believe there are people who haven't seen it. It's as I imagine Shakespeare was in his day.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/12.html#a171236" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's a very simple idea. A table that associates terms with text. If I use one of the terms in my writing, when it's published, the term is replaced with the text. We use <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> to represent the glossaries. Here's my <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/glossary.opml">personal glossary</a>. I wish every place I type text could be configured to use my glossary, so where ever I go I can use my terms. It would also be great to configure my searches to use these terms too, so Google for example would know what I am referring to when I type the name of one of my own products. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/09/12.html#a142358" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
