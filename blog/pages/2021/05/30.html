<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203542"></a>If the Knicks end up losing, the moment their fate was decided was when they gave Julius Randle the <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/26/julius-randle-son-surprises-him-most-improved-player-award">Most Improved Player</a> award. Just before the first game of the playoff series. Who decided that timing? Tempting fate. God'll always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpSw5tREOxQ">get you for that</a>. If I were advising Randle, I'd urge him to throw the award into the <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/how-to-walk-across-the-williamsburg-bridge-nyc-4158670">East River</a> before Game 5.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30.html#a203542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There was a surprise, he didn't watch the NBA bubble last year. I didn't either. It was too sad. The NBA now, finally, is back. And having the Knicks do so well this year, and it being the immediate post-pandemic season, it's like both happened at the same time and one was the cause and the other was the effect, though it's impossible to say which is which. I would like to hear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee">Spike Lee</a> ramble about the Knicks, for an hour or so, or really as long as he wants. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30.html#a135637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200059"></a>In the early days of the web there were purists who thought HTML should be edited by hand. I was not one of them.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132903"></a>I guess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki">Guy Kawasaki</a> is finishing up the edit of the interview we did a couple of weeks ago. He asked for a profile picture, I didn't have a good one, so I took this selfie yesterday. He wanted me to smile. This is something that usually I have trouble with in pictures, I get self-conscious, my smiles look phony -- because they are. I am not happy being photographed, I feel trapped.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/132859.html?title=myNewProfilePicture#a132903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134052"></a>But Guy and I have been friends for a long time, and we were close in a very important time, around the launch of the Macintosh in 1984. If I didn't know Guy, I never would have gotten an early machine. The Mac was the perfect platform for our "idea processor" -- it attracted just the kind of people who would understand outliners. People who think, organize, analyze, do things. And Apple needed our software, Guy could see that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/132859.html?title=myNewProfilePicture#a134052" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134147"></a>In 1986, the Mac was set to explode and we had had enough time to create a killer outliner for the Mac, and as they say, the rest is history. So I thought of how much I value our friendship as I was taking the picture, and the smile came naturally, all on its own. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/132859.html?title=myNewProfilePicture#a134147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133302"></a>PS: Guy used to call me Beeeeg Stuffff. He has a very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">LA</a> way of speaking. I can <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/beeegStuff.m4a">imitate</a> him saying it. That's what actually put the smile on my face, the same smile is there right now. Instead of saying Cheese, I said Beeeeg Stuff. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/132859.html?title=myNewProfilePicture#a133302" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133803"></a>PPS: Many of the nicknames people have for me are about my bigness. For example, Mike Boich and Dave Jacobs call me El Grand√®. I like that one too, because has adds a Latin accent to my grandiosity.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/132859.html?title=myNewProfilePicture#a133803" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
