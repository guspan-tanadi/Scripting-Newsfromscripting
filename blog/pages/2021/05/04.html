You can't get up from bed, can't go home, can't even take a piss on your own. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04.html#a143658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think there has to be a radical response to this.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131835"></a>I wrote a couple of potentially controversial tweets yesterday and earlier today. I'm happy to say everyone responded respectfully, and at least tried to respond to the questions I asked. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a131835" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131942"></a>The first was about political discussions at work. The issue was raised by the recent controversy at the Basecamp company, which had suspended political discussions on the company's internal message boards. Later it came out that they were getting criticism for an internal list they kept of customers with "funny" names. I wrote about this on <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/28.html#a163250">April 28</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a131942" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132141"></a>It’s a privilege to spend the day discussing politics instead of doing the job you were hired to do. At least some jobs could not work that way. Could a bus driver? An assembly line worker. A teacher. A tech support worker. A cashier at Starbucks. A cop. Emergency room doctor.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a132141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132157"></a>Suppose you worked at a company handling customer service calls. It’s a grind. All those angry people you deal with. But it’s a job. One of your colleagues spends much of their time on an internal discussion board commenting on the people they work with.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a132157" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132206"></a>They start talking about you! You looked at someone funny in the lunchroom. You might be a white supremacist. Do you keep answering support calls, or join the discussion. You’re worried you might lose your job. Someone saw you reading a suspicious magazine.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a132206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134604"></a>If you can't tell, as a former founder of two companies, I think people should keep political discussions at work to an absolute minimum. It should be possible for people with different political views to work together. This, to me, is one of the central features of freedom. You are free to believe what you believe and so am I. But we can and must still respect each other, and the highest form of respect in my opinion is to create something with each other. Personal blogs are good places to express political opinions, so is Twitter. But not work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a134604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132524"></a>I like that a lot, but only if you feel affection toward the person. I don't feel that way about Chappelle. I think he's using it as an act of hostility, knowing there's no way for a white person to respond in kind.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132620"></a>Karri Carlson asked me to listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/heykarri/status/1389388998154412037">comments</a> by Ta-Nahisi Coates, which I did, specifically pointing at 3:23 in the video. I understand that blacks use the n-word as a term of endearment for each other and it's not something white people are entitled to an opinion about, according to Coates. Whatever he says, we can have opinions about whatever we want, as he has negative opinions about white people, and expresses them. At 3:23 he makes a generalization which I found offensive. I don't think I own everything. Further I don't <i>want</i> to use the n-word, and further, please don't use that word to refer to me. Thanks.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/04/131914.html?title=twoControversialQuestions#a132620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
