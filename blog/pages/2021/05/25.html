I asked about it, and was told because they had been vaccinated they didn't have to wear them. I kept my mask on. I would have liked to have not worn the mask, but I think we should have kept wearing masks, until the pandemic is squashed in most of the world. It isn't yet. I'd prefer to err on the side of caution, but I guess we've decided it's over and that's it. But what if it isn't over?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/25.html#a155017" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153310"></a>Upsetting the Trumpians is inevitable and if done at the right time, probably survivable. It's better to provoke them now rather than later. Now we have a rule of law government. If you let things run their course, when it happens a Trump will run the government. Nothing you or I do or say will matter. If you make too much of a stink you'll go to jail, or worse. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/25/153110.html?title=ourLeadersLackTheWill#a153310" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a114930"></a>There have been other black people killed by police, recorded in video and shared on the web. Those were relatively instantaneous acts.
