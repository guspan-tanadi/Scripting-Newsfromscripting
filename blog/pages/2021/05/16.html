<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a200641"></a>Idea: An international conference on voting rights in the US. Give journalism something to report on, a question to ask, create new voices to stand alongside Liz Cheney.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16.html#a200641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a012722"></a>This may sound odd, but I think the most direct way to fight what the Repubs are trying to do to our voting rights is urgent and broad education about slavery in America. We need to quickly learn who we, this country, really are. Even people who immigrated here. No matter what was done to us, we joined a country built on slavery. It never went away, despite what we were taught in school, and what we came to believe when we elected a black president. We are very much still fighting slavery.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16.html#a012722" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152944"></a>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/16/tech/colonial-ransomware-darkside-what-to-know/index.html">ransomware attack</a> that knocked out the flow of gasoline in the eastern US last week was likely a good thing. Better that the vulnerability in our infrastructure is made clear in a form that costs just $5 million. Never mind trying to find and fix all the security holes, there will always be more. Just take the critical resources offline. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16.html#a152944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145147"></a>This morning they had an item about how Bill Gates owns a big piece of Canada's largest railroad network. This is a current interest, how the non-philanthropist side of Bill Gates is more or less the same as before inventing his philanthropist alter-ego. I'm wondering how much the philanthropy is just good PR, vs a real change of the goals of a hugely rich and aging person (Gates and I were born in the same year, so I have an idea). He said, during his most active years in tech that someday he would stop being a predator, and start giving away his money. That's a full-time job he'd say.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16/144853.html?title=twitterCouldHelpFixNews#a145147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145438"></a>I clicked the link. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/newsbox.png">Screen shot</a>. It took me to Twitter's news page, but there's no obvious link to the story, just a synopsis (<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/topOfTwitterStoryPage.png">screen shot</a>) that isn't even about the investments. Oy I've been sold a bill of goods, I thought to myself.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145630"></a>Eventually I found a <a href="https://twitter.com/TorontoStar/status/1393658704529170432">tweet</a> further down the page from <a href="https://twitter.com/TorontoStar">@torontostar</a> with a link. I clicked it.

I start reading. But after I get through the first paragraph, which is a repeat of what I had just read on Twitter, I am informed that this story is <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/paywallArrrrgh.png">Exclusive to Subscribers</a>. Arrrrgh!! All that just to hit a freaking paywall? You gotta fucking be kidding me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16/144853.html?title=twitterCouldHelpFixNews#a145630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<ul class="ulLevel1">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145910"></a>It seems they must know this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">UX</a> sucks. It didn't take me very long to figure that out. Maybe they don't know, so I'm doing them a favor by documenting it. Instead, please let's have a new rule Twitter, offer a deal to pubs via your new Scroll acquisition, they take down the paywall for readers coming from Twitter, in return they are paid a fair price for every click, and the news can start becoming useful, at least to Twitter users.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16/144853.html?title=twitterCouldHelpFixNews#a145910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150039"></a>The news industry complains they need money from the government. No that's not what they need. They need to offer their product in an easy to use way that isn't completely diseconomic. It's ridiculous, I am not even slightly in the market for the Toronto Star. I live two hours north of New York City in the US. But they got a story, apparently, that no US paper has, so they're entitled to some money for that. All they're getting from me now is grief. And btw, same with Twitter. Yes, I was interested in a story about the non-philanthropist Bill Gates, they got that right. But I do not have a subscription to the Toronto Star. Surely you can figure that out. If not, I'm willing to tell them which pubs I actually do have subscriptions to. Or better, to repeat myself for the 80,000th time, let me pay. I will pay you. You will make money. You will stop complaining about how there's no money and we can move on from this ridiculous stalemate. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16/144853.html?title=twitterCouldHelpFixNews#a150039" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
