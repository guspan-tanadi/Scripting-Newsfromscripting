<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134909"></a>I agree, it was a <a href="https://twitter.com/DrLeanaWen/status/1393030530577444865">mistake to cancel the mask mandate</a>. I imagine they did it thinking it would incentivize people to get vaccinated, but it seems it'll do exactly the opposite. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/14.html#a134909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/24/subaruForester.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132934"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/24/subaruForester.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I figured out the cruise control on my 2020 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Forester">Subaru Forester</a>, and it's lovely, interactive. Turn it on, set the speed, and how far you want to be from the car in front, it does the rest. It knows if you take your hands off the wheel and yells at you. The Forester also knows how to stay in lane, even on twisty mountain roads, like the roads where I live. I find  I no longer stress about driving off the road, which is weird because I used to be paranoid about that. But I kind of trust the car to keep me from killing myself.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/14.html#a132934" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154018"></a>I have a friend who has had a kidney transplant. He got vaccinated, but the belief is that it doesn't do much for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression">immunosuppressed</a> people like my friend. Sentencing him to death because we don't want to wear masks sounds pretty harsh, and that's what it amounts to, if the virus is allowed to run wild. Which is, it seems to me, certain to happen now. There aren't enough vaccinated people to stop that from happening, imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/14/153557.html?title=weHaventWonTheWar#a154018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
