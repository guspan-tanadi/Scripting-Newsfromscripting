I have said that much <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/27.html#a105240">here</a>, and I'm glad it looks the same from his point of view. It's <i>good</i> that two developers in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought">Tools For Thought</a> market want their products to <a href="http://this.how/standards/index.opml#1497798753000">interop</a>. Much better than the alternative, where everyone retreats to their own silos. Why should I have to learn another editor to be part of your world? What about all the docs I already have, do you really want me to retype them? Isn't that why we have computers and networks? So this is good. A first step. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/28.html#a181603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a182403"></a>That said, I like the two products that are trying to get together on this basis, and I like that they are interested in interop and willing to work for it, and compromise. That's really the most important thing. It's the <a href="http://this.how/standards/index.opml#1497798753000">first item</a> in my Rules for Standards-Makers faq. So if they proceed with Markdown as the basis for interop, I hope at least one of them doesn't stop there, and we can build on the capabilities of outliners and add-ons that already interop based on OPML. I think ultimately more will be possible with OPML, and I'm happy that they're working for interop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/28.html#a182403" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
