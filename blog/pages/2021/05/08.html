<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/07/elizabethWarrenActionFigure.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143741"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/07/elizabethWarrenActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The reason <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elizabeth-warren-book-persist-campaign-memoir-2020.html">Warren's campaign failed</a> is that once she was the frontrunner and people got a good look at her, they didn’t like her. She’s kind of what you’d expect, a <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10935/Warren">Harvard professor</a>. They do well at the top of academia, but don’t have a popular touch, and I’m being generous. Certainly there was some sexism, people who wouldn't vote for a woman under any circumstances, but she became the frontrunner with everyone aware of her gender. A woman candidate could have won the nomination in my opinion, someone like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar">Amy Klobuchar</a> or Michigan governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer">Gretchen Whitmer</a>. It's ridiculous to conclude that a woman couldn't get the nomination, esp since the Democratic nominee in 2016 was a woman. If Warren wants to be president she's going to have to listen to people outside her bubble. People who will, as they say, speak truth to power. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/08.html#a143741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Does it make you want to get vaccinated? What if our vaccines don't protect against the new strains?

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145111"></a>As a basketball fan this is how I look at where we are with Covid in the US. We have a 2 point lead going into the fourth quarter. Our two star players are out with injuries. Our fans are going home, they think the game is won. I know anything could happen at this point.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/08.html#a145111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
