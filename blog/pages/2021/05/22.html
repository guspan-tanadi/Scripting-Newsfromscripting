<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183934"></a>I test drove a Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3">Model 3</a> today. Very nice car. So powerful. And while it was hard for me to get in and out of the car, once I was in there was plenty of head room. I also surprised myself and let it drive for a bit. It was pretty scary. I'm a horrible passenger and back-seat driver. But it seems to work pretty well.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/22.html#a183934" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
