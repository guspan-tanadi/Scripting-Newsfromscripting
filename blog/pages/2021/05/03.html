I now have my app running and downloading images from the initial 26 accounts. I've uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/data/images">first batch of images</a> to a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader">GitHub repository</a>. I plan to update them as long as there's interest in this project. I've also included the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/blob/main/app/artdownloader.js">source code</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader#running-the-app">instructions</a>, in case you want to run it yourself. I'm sure there will be problems that need fixing, if you spot anything, post an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/issues">issue</a> in the repo for the app. I love this, it started as a warm-up project, but quickly got a life of its own.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/03.html#a154124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I pointed my iPhone at my living room TV, displaying my Mac Mini, which has the images from the new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader">project</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/03.html#a011600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I did not understand the web at first, I was reading about it, scratching my head, until boom, I saw it happening. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/03.html#a163424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
