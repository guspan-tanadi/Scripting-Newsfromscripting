The idea, as always, is to create a layer below which there are differences between the app that runs over the net, ie your files are stored on a server in the cloud, and the one that runs on the desktop, where the files are on your local system. For my most important writing, I prefer to use the Electron version. So hopefully by the end of the week I will be able to switch from the Electron app I've been using for the last four years, to the new Drummer-based system, which is much cooler, more <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>-like.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/24.html#a181638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
