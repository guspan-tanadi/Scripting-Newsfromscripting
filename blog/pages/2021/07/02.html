<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153741"></a>When I was planning the third <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html">BloggerCon</a>, I realized at one point that I could, if I wanted, have every <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html">discussion leader</a> of every session be a woman. I didn't go for it, felt like a stunt. Discussion leaders are like editors or teachers. They choose people to speak. We tried to discourage people from raising their hands (hard to enforce). The discussion leader is also empowered to move the mike to another person via a monitor (a human being, usually a student), who "owned" the mike. That's why things kept moving. I didn't choose DLs based on their fame, though I admit sometimes I gave into that, I chose people who could think on their feet in a classroom setting. So I often went with teachers, if one was available. There was a rule that vendors couldn't talk about their product. That became an issue at BloggerCon III at Stanford because Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurs will whore their product no matter what you say. BloggerCon was a users conference. We need to get back to that. Not just marketing events, but where users get together to talk about what they're doing and what they want.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/02.html#a153741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131738"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment#Season_4">Season 4</a> of In Treatment became unwatchable. I skipped the last two episodes with Colin. I came close to skipping the other patients, and the two episodes about the therapist and her boyfriend and drinking were most unwatchable, but since one of them was the <a href="https://tvline.com/2021/06/28/in-treatment-recap-season-4-finale-brooke-eladio-colin-laila/">finale</a>, I watched it, and hated it. The season started off so good and the actors, esp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzo_Aduba">Uzo Aduba</a> are fantastic. I don't know who the writers are, but the characters they created are just foils for speeches on social issues. I don't mind, if there's some art to it. Something to think about. But they're at the level of decade-old Twitter rants, I've heard it all so many times before. At least with Twitter I have a mute button. The concept of the show is very good when there's suspension of disbelief. While this season started out great, in the end the story was bleh, and the telling of it cringe-worthy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/02.html#a131738" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The last couple of days my friend <a href="https://www.sanforddickert.com/">Sanford Dickert</a>, who now lives in London, has been walking around the city with his iPhone on a stick, broadcasting his travels <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanford/videos/975431809884849">over Facebook</a>, conversing with people who speak to him in the comments. I tune in when I can when he does it in London, but this week I've been feeling homesick for NYC. It's still there, but also quite empty. I hadn't counted on that. Those streets are just begging for me to ride on them by bike. Hotel <a href="https://www.kayak.com/hotels/New-York,NY-c15830/2021-07-07/2021-07-10/1adults?sort=rank_a;map">rooms</a> are still pretty cheap, a nice hotel goes for about $150 a night. I probably should go down for a few days before the summer is over. I do miss the city, which is surprising to me. I no longer have family there, maybe that's why I'm staying away?  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/02.html#a130523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'd love to work on this with him and others. I don't think the way we're going about it has much of a chance of working.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/02/213019.html?title=aSustainableWeb#a213041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I think we'll get better results sooner if we go for a sustainable web. That will require new financial structures and organizations that have longevity built into their models, for example, universities like Harvard. Insurance companies. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/02/213019.html?title=aSustainableWeb#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Say I want to give someone $10K to keep some of the domains I've registered going for say 100 years. And I give them say 10GB of static content.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213324"></a>It seems it should be possible from there, if enough people and organizations pay money for longevity, at least it's a start.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/02/213019.html?title=aSustainableWeb#a213324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
