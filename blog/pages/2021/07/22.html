<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/21/giannis.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171655"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/21/giannis.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Now that I can see <span class="spTagref">tagging</span> in action, I changed how tags are displayed. A tag appears as a single-square-bracketed term, in blue. When you hover over it, it's underlined. This is more consistent with the way links work. And single-square-brackets are less intrusive than double, but still convey the idea that where you're going is different from a normal link. Feedback is <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/218">welcome</a>. I'm also finding bugs in the tag server. Of course, and that's good. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/22.html#a171655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172110"></a>Falling in love with <span class="spTagref">Google Reader</span> and then giving up on open <span class="spTagref">RSS</span>-based news after it was cancelled is like falling in love with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXpKiY2MXE">The Monkees</a>, and giving up on music when their show was <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-was-The-Monkees-show-cancelled">cancelled</a>. Long term the open wholesome tech ecosystem is where the breakthroughs come from. When the users learn to accept that tech companies just harvest these developments, don't manage them or develop them, or care about them, then progress will accelerate, but not until then. The power is strong, but you have to use it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/22.html#a172110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Kind of like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX_TFkut1PM">American Pie</a> about the death of music, and as wrong. As it turns out, since we now <i>know</i> how it turned out, having <span class="spTagref">Google</span> adopt <span class="spTagref">RSS</span> was a pretty bad thing for everyone, except maybe Google. The tragedy isn't that Google fucked us over so hard, it's that even now, eight years later, people still haven't figured out that companies don't make wholesome tech, they consume it. Leave it like an Amazon rain forest after harvesting. <span class="spTagref">Google Reader</span> should have been called Exxon Valdez Reader. The author's attitude toward people who understand this tragedy is to dismiss us as na√Øve. Which is ridiculous given the premise. It's like saying that we liked the meal but we insisted on it being served it by <span class="spTagref">Darth Vader</span>. Oh boy he betrayed us! The users have the power, this has always been true, and until now, they have used the power to be idiots.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/22.html#a170423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
