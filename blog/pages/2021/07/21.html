You can say whatever you want, the other person can opt out at any time, so can you. Repeat as many times as you like.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/21.html#a142046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't understand why, maybe it's because I had been following the east more than the west, largely due to the time difference. Or maybe it was my connection with Wisconsin? Whatever the reason I was happy last night because the Bucks won the series, 4-2, over the Phoenix Suns who are also an excellent team. I felt bad for <span class="spTagref">Chris Paul</span>, this was his first chance in the finals and at age 37 perhaps his last, after a long playoff career, marred by injuries, and he didn't win, not just because the Bucks wanted it more. The playoff process is a long grind. He was still standing, but the Bucks prevailed -- because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo">Giannis  Antetokounmpo</a>. He's a superstar in league with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AooUnpj5nzE">best</a>, plays through pain, and basically carried the team on his back. He is also famous as a terrible free throw shooter, but last night he made 15 of 16 free throws. Without that, the Bucks would've lost, and we'd be going to a game 7 showdown in Phoenix tomorrow night. The most important thing to me, and Giannis commented on it too, is that the Bucks are a team that was developed through the draft and trades, not as a superteam formed for the purpose of winning a championship, like the detestable <span class="spTagref">Brooklyn Nets</span>. The two stars of the Bucks, Giannis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khris_Middleton">Khris Middleton</a>, have been on the Bucks since 2013. I feel great that the NBA, despite the best efforts of the superteams, is still a game where talent and perseverance wins. The playoffs were good this year, it was the year the Knicks competed well, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young">young talent</a> impressed and entertained. Now it's time to shift to the Olympics which start on Friday, and the Mets who are in first place! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/21.html#a124330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
