It makes it a bit simpler to set up a Glitch server, for example, for people who are new to PP.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/05.html#a161048" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154941"></a>A problem happens when an app running in <a href="http://pagepark.io/">PagePark</a> makes a request of another app that's running on the same machine. It reared its ugly head again today, and I had a heck of a time finding <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/17">this thread</a> by searching. In this post I used all the terms I used in my search, so hopefully if I ever hit it again, I'll find my way back here, with <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/17">this link</a> to the answer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/05.html#a154941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151126"></a>Americaâ€™s <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2021/07/05/americas-politics-are-stubbornly-fixed/">politics</a> appear to be stubbornly fixed. That's just a symptom. The bigger problem is the US has a genetic defect that makes it impossible for it to be united. Slavery. Everyone has a position on that. Either for or against. Not too many people in the middle. And the division in the country, to me, appears to be right along that line. People may be pro-slavery without putting it that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/05.html#a151126" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130225"></a>I am happy to report that archive.org has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170705073731/http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">good copy</a> of the <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML 2.0 spec</a>. It's the easiest kind of page to archive, static HTML, stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. They started sampling it in 2016, even though the page has been there since the mid-00s.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/05.html#a130225" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130415"></a>It's really weird <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190815000000*/https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">how they do</a> the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>. They're sampling it every day, as many as 17 times a day. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/05/rss2archiveorgsampling.png">Screen shot</a>. It's a static page for a format that's been frozen since 2002. A few samplings a year would be sufficient. As with the OPML spec, their archive starts in 2016, but the doc has been there at since 2003. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/05.html#a130415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131652"></a>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/05/opmlarchivescreen.png">screen shot</a> that shows how frequently the OPML 2.0 spec is sampled. I can think of three differences. 1. RSS is more famous than OPML. 2. RSS spec is on a Harvard website, the OPML spec is on opml.org. 3. The RSS spec is served via HTTPS, the OPML spec via HTTP.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/05.html#a131652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
