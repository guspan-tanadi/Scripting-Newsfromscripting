I have a new feature coming for Scripting News. As soon as I posted this I started writing.

I don't get reporters who think that's acceptable. Their job is to know (and tell us) what crazy place we're in <i>right now. </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/19/204215.html?title=reportersArePussycats#a204232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204255"></a>Same with the military. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/14/donald-trump-reichstag-moment-general-mark-milley-book">Joint Chiefs guy</a> thought Trump might be doing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire">Reichstag fire</a>. Great. So WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T HE PREPARE THE MILITARY TO KNOCK IT DOWN BEFORE IT STARTED AND SHIP THE INSURRECTIONISTS OFF TO GITMO. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO WITH TERRORISTS?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/19/204215.html?title=reportersArePussycats#a204255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204342"></a>When are some reporters going to get into the present and deal with today's truth. Stop praising the military for *saying* how fukced up everthing is. Praise them for keeping it from getting that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/19/204215.html?title=reportersArePussycats#a204342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204358"></a>Let's hope Biden, first thing when he got on the job, sat down with the military and told them they fucked up big, and they better be prepared next time. I suspect he didn't because he hasn't fired any of these nincompoops. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/19/204215.html?title=reportersArePussycats#a204358" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204415"></a>We need to stop thinking like pussycats and start getting in front of this.
