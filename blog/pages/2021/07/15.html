We need new leadership, and it's not the Lincoln Project. Their war is within the Republican Party, which is not the war we're fighting. Our war is whether we go back to slavery, or do we live up to the promise of the country post-Civil War and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society">Great Society</a>. We need black leadership. We need to respond to the slavers very clearly, no, we will not discuss what you want to do. Your only choice is whether you will change or you will crawl back into the hole you came out of. There is no other choice. And we need to expel from Congress every traitor to the Constitution, and there are many of them. No half-steps. Nothing that makes people feel like everything is okay, that our war is winnable with stark advertising.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/15.html#a151005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's a real <a href="http://mindbomb.org/">mind bomb</a> on racism. 18 minutes, for a brain explosion.

The usual tricks aren't working. Here's his Apple Podcasts <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827">preview</a> page. Usually if you give that URL to the <a href="https://getrssfeed.com/">GetRSSFeed</a> app, it returns with the address of the RSS podcast feed. This is <a href="https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377">where</a> it took me. I <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377">viewed the XML</a>, and it shows me an HTML page? If anyone can figure out the URL of his podcast feed, please let me know.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a120954"></a>Sometimes I get stressed, like everyone else. I have a technique for working my way through it. I ask myself this question: What would Dave do if he wasn't stressed out. Change the perspective. I'm now outside myself, am an observer of myself. Often I have no trouble writing down a few things. Then I do one of those things. If it works, I get into it, and an hour or two later I forgot why I was stressed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/15.html#a120954" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
