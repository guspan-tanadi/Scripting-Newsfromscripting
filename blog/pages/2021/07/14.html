<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131939"></a>My <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1414945524101287938">tweet about GitHub</a> yesterday got a fair amount of attention. I'm glad, because the idea is powerful and works. Further if GitHub/Microsoft made this a business priority, it could be streamlined for end-users, and be a revenue source, and an incredible developer platform, beyond what it already does. I would love to begin a conversation with MS, privately if they want, to figure out what's possible here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/14.html#a131939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's talking about whiteness from the point of view of a black man of my parents' generation. I can't agree with some of what he says, he's talking nasty shit about my people, and it's as oppressive as anything anyone says about blacks, even the stuff he quotes. Don't respond to oppression with more oppression. But overriding that is the bigger point, that the United States has been destroying the lives of black people since inception. I just spent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk">18 minutes</a> with the flipside of Malcolm X, a white academic, <a href="https://documentarystudies.duke.edu/people/john-biewen">John Biewen</a>, explaining what it means to be white, in the same context as that which X describes, but from from the other side of the relationship. I think if you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&t=1095s">this video</a>, it'll be the most transformative 18 minute video experience you've had in a long time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/14.html#a130929" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The <a href="http://nbariver.com/">NBA</a> finals resume tonight, I'm actually going to miss basketball when it's over. But then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics">Olympics</a> start, and after that my attention will finally turn to the Mets. I've got the rest of the year planned out. But the weather. Oy does it suck. I know there <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/07/none-of-the-old-rules-still-apply-when-the-driest-city-in-the-us-faces-a-catastrophic-drought/">are</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1013446314/amid-a-mega-drought-a-water-shortage-will-be-declared-along-the-colorado-river">droughts</a> and <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html">heat domes</a> elsewhere, but here we're living in a constant state of deluge. I take my bike ride every day, rain or shine. I used to skip rainy days but this summer that's not an option because it rains every damned day, and not just drizzle, hours of downpour. And the thunder last night. Who could sleep through that. Not this sports fan. I just want some beautiful warm summer weather. On the other hand the new rose bush I planted really seems to like all the wetness. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/14.html#a114704" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a115627"></a>Toaster ovens are now called "air fryers." That's weird, but I just bought one, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details">Cuisinart</a>, as recommended by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-fryer/">Wirecutter</a>. I love it. I've been using it every night, and my eating has become more healthy, and also much tastier.
