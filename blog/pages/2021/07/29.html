<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204124"></a>It would be cool if you could hire a Trump impersonator to speak at a rally or business conference, and have him say whatever you like.

Or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_impersonator">Elvis impersonators</a> you can hire in Las Vegas. Flood the market with fake Trumps.

There is a new config option that lets you re-open the door, either globally or for a specific domain.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/29.html#a135651" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
