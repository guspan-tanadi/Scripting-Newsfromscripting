<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/08/scottLove.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a205642"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/08/scottLove.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I just heard that a longtime friend and fellow outliner Scott Love has died. Oy. I knew Scott when he was our chief product marketer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">Living Videotext</a> back in the 80s. He was part of the team that shipped ThinkTank, Ready and MORE. When we sold to Symantec, Scott went to NeXT where he was on the rollout team for their product. His heart was in outliners. He went on to start Aquaminds, which he explains in his <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Love">bio</a> on Quora. Scott was a brilliant creative funny friendly and vulnerable human. He put his heart into everything he did. His boss, before he worked for me, Alfred Mandel, called him Nudgie. When I heard that I started using that name for him too, until I realized it might not be the nicest thing. Recently Scott and I reconnected on Twitter. In a private exchange he said he liked the name. I'm sorry his life was so short. His enthusiasm and big heart and super active mind will be missed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a205642" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210832"></a>Scott and I had dinner many times, and often traveled together on business. We always joked about how we were going to take on the then-dominant tech company IBM. It was either Boca or Bucha, which was short for Bucharest, where we were surely headed if we failed to defeat the mighty IBM. We'd talk about catching the red-eye to Bucharest. I don't know why it was then (and still is now) so funny. Bucharest was a pretty awful place at the time, run by an even worse dictator than IBM -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu">Nicolae Ceau»ôescu</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a210832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194013"></a>There are lots of other differences, but the thing most Americans don't get is that slavery is deeply rooted and it isn't over yet. And if we want it to be over, it's going to require a near-universal conscious decision to end it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/08/193728.html?title=slaveryFormedUs#a194013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
