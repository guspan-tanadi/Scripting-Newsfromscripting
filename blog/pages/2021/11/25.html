As a kid I had so much invested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">the Beatles</a>. Each period of their existence marked some big period or event in my life, things that I've mostly buried, but come right to the surface with (for example) Paul and George <a href="https://youtu.be/b-VAxGJdJeQ?t=131">flopping their heads</a> in the chorus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_and_Shout">Twist and Shout</a>. To see the Beatles, alive and young and at the peak of their creativity, in a way we couldn't see them at the time, that's like reading a letter from a long-dead relative. The people are gone, the experiences were seminal, and recoverable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25.html#a140021" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135805"></a>I'm watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_(TV_series)">The Great</a> on Hulu, and it's really good. Didn't get the best <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-great">reviews</a>. I'm only on episode 4. It's about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great">Catherine The Great</a> of Russia. The story is pretty heavy, but believe it or not, it's a comedy! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25.html#a135805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a184004"></a>I am a NYT subscriber, but can't access Wirecutter. It's weird, the site seems broken -- when I try to log in it just sends me back to <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/25/wirecutterSaysFuckOffNYTSubscriber.png">the page</a> that says I have run out of free articles. It could be they want more money for WC, if so, the answer is no. I don't read a lot of NYT articles as it is. I have a very bad feeling about them, and it gets worse every year. That took a lot of work on their part because I was raised on the NYT. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25.html#a184004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144311"></a>It has happened, esp in Silicon Valley or New York, when a woman I was dating, or interested in dating, revealed that she was really there for the business. I want to understand up front. If it's business, fine -- I'll evaluate it one way, if it's sexual, another. It's a really awkward situation where someone I was attracted to sexually, wants to do business -- and wouldn't have gotten a meeting if it were clearly about business. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25/144141.html?title=paradoxInSocialCustom#a144311" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144444"></a>If you work for me, or we're equals in a business relationship, either way -- no one is accountable to the other for what they do with personal time. Your boss can't call you up on the weekend and expect you to tell them what you're doing. You don't have to tell them anything, unless it impacts your ability to do the work.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25/144141.html?title=paradoxInSocialCustom#a144444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144547"></a>I think it's equally wrong when a person who reports to me, or is an equal, reports to me on what they're doing in their personal time. It creates a conflict, am I expected to reciprocate, because I won't. I draw a solid line between work and personal time. If I share personal things in a work context, they are no longer personal.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25/144141.html?title=paradoxInSocialCustom#a144547" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144709"></a>These concerns are spelled out more carefully in professions like medicine, academics, law. A therapist isn't allowed to date a patient.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132641"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html">Last year on Thanksgiving</a> we were in the midst of the worst of the pandemic, and the best we could do is stay home and hope we don't get infected. This year it's very different -- thanks to the vaccine. I got my first dose of Moderna on January 20, the day we inaugurated the first post-insurrection president. What a relief, in two ways. The Orange Tyrant who tried to overthrow the US government was gone, and I was on my way to being protected from the virus he let run rampant through the country we all have been told is the greatest on earth, but did the worst job of protecting its citizens. I hope that was the low point, but who knows!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25/132638.html?title=thanksgiving#a132641" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133020"></a>I also was thankful for my car. It's funny that I thought about <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945">that post</a> just the other day driving my new Tesla around the neighborhood, marveling at its intelligence, muscle, and how much it is like the computers I use, the exercise bike I just bought, and the phone I carry everywhere with me. The Silicon Valley design ethos, which I am schooled in and in a small way helped develop, is eating the world, as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/software-is-eating-the-world-5-years-later/">said</a> so well. The <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945">Subaru</a> I drove last year is a fine machine, and in some ways it's more comfortable than the Tesla, and it'll probably do better if we get a blizzard in the mountains. But its software is a jumble of poorly designed components that don't work well with each other from a UI standpoint. In that area the Tesla is perfect. It's a system designed to be understood by a modern user. The pre-Tesla car manufacturers have a long way to go to catch up to Tesla. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25/132638.html?title=thanksgiving#a133020" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133802"></a>I am thankful for the first users of Drummer. We have reached a critical mass where I can add features, and get feedback from users, and that gives us the ability to move forward. I think this happened because I decided to put my head down on Drummer and work until it was really ready. There still are problems with the software, it is far from perfect, and I'm thankful for the users' patience, but mostly I'm thankful that there are users to be patient. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/25/132638.html?title=thanksgiving#a133802" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134009"></a>At 66, health is no longer something I can take for granted. it takes work to keep going, and I've had my troubles this year, but basically I'm still here, and most of my body is working fine.
