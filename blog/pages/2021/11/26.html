<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222145"></a>Sometimes people deliberately mispronounce or misspell my name, I guess theyre trying to embarrass me? I have a name almost as bad as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOHPuY88Ry4">Boy Named Sue</a>. Itâ€™s hard to get under my skin that way. ðŸ˜€<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/26.html#a222145" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222136"></a>I tried watching <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/25/the-beatles-get-back-review-peter-jackson-eight-hours-of-tv-so-aimless-it-threatens-your-sanity">Get Back</a>, but after five minutes of holy shit those are the young Beatles acting like normal people it became fairly boring. I guess I like a plot? Did it get better?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/26.html#a222136" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190736"></a>I added <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-great">The Great</a> as a favorite on my <a href="http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/">BingeWorthy profile</a>. I'm well into Season 2. It's a pseudo-history dramedy in the spirit of <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fsuccession">Succession</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Stalin">The Death of Stalin</a>. It's about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great">Russian empress</a> who overthrows her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_III_of_Russia">husband</a> the emperor. As they say, hilarity ensues. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/26.html#a190736" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221941"></a>One of the stars of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-great">The Great</a>, the guy who plays emperor Peter, is a dead ringer for a young Elon Musk. Same mannerisms and look, but heâ€™s funnier and of course a better actor. One of the tech companies or car companies should hire him to do ads. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/26.html#a221941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
