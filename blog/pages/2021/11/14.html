Listen. I understood the Web in about a minute. Web 2.0, I played a role in defining and developing it. So you could say I got it. But Web 3? Why did they choose a name that promises so much, and more than anything -- simplicity. The idea of anything called "Web" being opaque, sounding like a scam, a VC's wet dream -- that's so counter to what the word means in tech. I shouldn't have to read a few white papers, and still not get it. Look, my intuition says that the web is the web is the web and there is no Web 3, there's just the web. I don't like that they usurped the name of something so simple and precious for something that looks scammy. I think they should have chosen a different name. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14.html#a235554" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235400"></a>I‚Äôve done classes and rides with no content. I don‚Äôt like the classes. The impersonal ‚Äúyou can do I it‚Äù motivation is a real turn off.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235413"></a>Why not have classes where you learn something?

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235424"></a>I‚Äôm going to keep trying with the classes. Basically I am already motivated, I love the high I get from exercise.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a235436"></a>Then this evening I took a class with a teacher I really liked. And it made all the difference. I got a better workout, and I had fun. I even talked back a few times. Totally got into it.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142001"></a>I don't think I've ever "begged" though at times I imagine it might have seemed that way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14/141902.html?title=aintTooProudToBlog#a142001" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142022"></a>And I haven't been promoting rivers to them for quite some time, because I think the problems are much bigger now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14/141902.html?title=aintTooProudToBlog#a142022" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142103"></a>I think the most important thing news orgs can do to improve their service is to include ideas and perspectives from outside the newsroom, esp those that are critical of their work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14/141902.html?title=aintTooProudToBlog#a142103" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152147"></a>I would encourage a news org to run a <i>river of sources</i> their reporters consider authoritative. Blogs, newsletters, and whatever new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_press">forms</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamphlet">come</a> up in the future. This would initially be an internal resource, but the obvious next step is to share the resource with their readers, in the interest of increasing news flow, broadening perspectives, and also introducing transparency. And perhaps most important to introduce criticism of their work to their flow, something we need and they need. If I were going to beg for anything that would most likely be it. I wrote about how this would work in more detail in <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/05/13/howToHaveAFuture.html">May 2015</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14/141902.html?title=aintTooProudToBlog#a152147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142250"></a>When I read yet another NYT article or op-ed about how Facebook is letting us down, I keep wondering when they're going to look at how <i>they</i> contribute to this problem, how their coverage of Hillary's Emails, for example, gave Trump the White House, and set the country on the path to authoritarianism. I think they did far more damage than Facebook, and not surprisingly, that has not been examined to anywhere near the extent Facebook has. This is a serious problem, and it's not going to get better in the current news system. That's where rivers could make a huge difference, if they cared enough about the service they provide readers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14/141902.html?title=aintTooProudToBlog#a142250" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
