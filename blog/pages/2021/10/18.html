<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202115"></a>I hear <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/politics/democrats-virginia-mcauliffe-governor/index.html">Dems might lose</a> in Virginia because of voter apathy. Right now the big issues are abortion, COVID, climate and fascism. Thatâ€™s a pretty good set of issues. Run some freaking ads on social media. Never stop campaigning, every day of every year. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/18.html#a202115" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Gotta love it. I'm sorry if you're a Dodgers fan, but I was born in Brooklyn and people such as myself don't forget. I also remember when <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mlb-overturns-utley-supension-breaking-tejada-leg-article-1.2554514">Chase Utley broke the leg</a> of the Mets shortstop during the 2015 playoffs. I also remember when I sat in scalped seats during the World Series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_World_Series">in 1988</a>, in the Dodgers wives' section and they tried to get us thrown out for rooting for the A's who won, btw. I really feel justified in hating the Dodgers, but honestly even if I wasn't, I would still hate them. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/18.html#a173818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195528"></a>Meanwhile the NBA season starts tomorrow with a <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bucks-celebrate-title-nets-without-014222568.html">game</a> between last year's champion, the Milwaukee Bucks, and a much-hyped superteam, the Brooklyn Nets. I will be rooting for the Bucks. Superteams suck. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/18.html#a195528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204815"></a>No one would have believed Cheney, Rumsfeld or Rice. They got the only person in the Bush administration who had credibility. If Powell was willing to say this, it must be true, we had to act. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/18/204738.html?title=colinPowellLiedForWar#a204815" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204828"></a>When people act naive as they do horrific things, seriously -- he knew what he was doing. Powell wasn't a tool, we were the tools. He abused our trust. And in death he doesn't deserve the acclaim he's getting. Too many people died because of his lie.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/18/204738.html?title=colinPowellLiedForWar#a204828" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
