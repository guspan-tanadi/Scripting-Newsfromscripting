I'm so sorry. I knew however that it would end in an awful way when the batter, with two out in the bottom of the 9th with a runner on first, the <i>Dodgers</i> leading by one in what was the last game of the season for one of these teams, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Flores">Wilmer Flores</a>. Mets fans remember him and love him like a son, because the Mets broke his heart and he didn't hide his feelings. So they didn't trade him in 2015 when the Mets went on to win the National League pennant, Flores was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/sports/baseball/wilmer-flores-swaps-tears-for-cheers-with-walk-off-home-run.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbcrohkQFUbAibORd89sgbBj_HUzbY1gnu5MymRTDtYiuoRBJKN4ALWeqN7fJ4v0j2BX5pPN6VqT_x_w_VEelNsVwntvZKAm9ECLStwqYW2UyYswpSLXaw99XWiSFiFH9pF5e_1uQOaYn_3COeZiSd_cBBhqZVgfQyvimgCk6rHDuJ0itBhjqgjVoR5FW0LbCCAt_bjAkluKZ7ROEGnnwo3W-xeXzrUjITcv-pGKFMOfAqAGHBv4m886MdfOccUOMv8Kx0nfcn5iNYBGzAibdfpV9BqGd-ix_g9uqXNqBeP1MK02_49ca1Tt7_CuWqwX009Qbv6r_islZBt2LGYmSKLPw&smid=url-share">team mascot</a>, but they eventually did let him go, and he was on the forever to be remembered as the ill-fated Giants of 2021. When he stepped into the batter's box late last night I knew it would not end well. It didn't. In a very <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2021/10/15/umpire-explains-controversial-strike-call-wilmer-flores-dodgers-giants-playoffs">unsatisfactory</a> way. Which I think was inevitable, probably the instant the Giants signed him. He is a man of great consequence.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/15.html#a154903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a205216"></a>A friend asked if it was true that Spotify now owns podcasting. They read something in <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/03/wiredWebIsDeadFreeGift.png">Wired</a> that said they did. They're idiots. Or trying to get clicks. Or maybe they're idiots <i>and</i> they're trying to get clicks. Anyway -- no, Spotify does not own podcasting. As long as people say "subscribe where ever you get your podcasts" at the end of their podcast you have nothing to worry about. I'm not even going to link to the Wired article. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/15.html#a205216" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
