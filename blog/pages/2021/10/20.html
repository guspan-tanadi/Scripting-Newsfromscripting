I can see we're going to need a new structure, because people aren't finding a lot of it, and there's more coming.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195028"></a>I've been very critical of the way journalism covers Facebook, because they miss the human freedom part of the story, which is just as important as the fake news part. But of course journalism is only concerned with the freedom of journalists, not <i>our</i> freedom. In fact journalism would probably prefer if we had no means to speak publicly, if we just got our ideas from them. Only thing is they don't have any ideas. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/20/194852.html?title=whenPeopleLoveRss#a195028" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
