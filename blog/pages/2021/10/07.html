There will still be things to do at that point, and that's ok. As they say <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html">software is a process</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/07.html#a122417" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122437"></a>It's a fitting moment to flip the switch, because <span class="spTagref">Drummer</span> will open the doors for a new <i>fluid</i> style of blogging, based on outlining. To create a post, you click the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/07/bigplusicon.png">big plus icon</a> and start typing. When you're ready to publish, choose a menu command. No more slogging your way through Wordpress menus or a static site generator. It all happens in a second or two. And making a change to your blog is as easy as making the change in your outline, and publishing -- again -- just one command and a couple of seconds. Welcome to the world where <span class="spTagref">tools for thought</span> meets publishing. Blogging at the speed of thought. Where nothing gets in your way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/07.html#a122437" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
