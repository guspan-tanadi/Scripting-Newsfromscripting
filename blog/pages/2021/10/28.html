<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203943"></a>I saw <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/28/metaMetaMets.png">this</a> and for a moment I thought it said Mets. Maybe he should have named Facebook The New York Mets. He could've bought the team with the change that falls out of his pocket at night. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/28.html#a203943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm getting incredible support from the Drummer users. This is the kind thing you have nightmare dreams about, a deployed product where you missed a serious problem in development and have to scramble to deal with. We still have some serious problems to deal with, but I think it's mostly possible to avoid them, and I'm confident we will get them fixed. I want to get to work on some new features, I really miss that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/28.html#a153022" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203557"></a>Update: the new CMS is deployed and seems to work. Most important the problems with international blogs appear to be solved. Drummer blogs are unique in that there are archive pages for each day, and month. Which is a date problem other blogging tools don't have. I was trying to think how we solved the problem in Manila and Radio, and then realized we didn't have the problem. Drummer is different. Which is kind of what you'd expect from a product with that name. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/28.html#a203557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
