<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a024036"></a>Want to break up Facebook? Easy. Let people on Facebook (the online service) connect via Facebook to other services that are not Facebook, just as email, RSS, the web, instant messaging work. It’s the internet way of doing things. Gets Facebook the company out of the hot seat. Everyone wins.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/29.html#a024036" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

All the rest are still there. Yet no one will speak for Facebook #6. Can you imagine 2.9 billion people and it's defined by a handful of columnists and reporters in mostly American news orgs. And there's a company that can communicate with all of them, any time they want for $0. And they have nothing to say other than we're going to change our name now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/29/154353.html?title=facebookIsACowardlyCompanyThatHasNeverHadToFight#a160700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154607"></a>According to Pew, a credible source, all the American news orgs combined have about 15 million readers. Facebook #6, the user community, is 2.9 billion. Could Facebook mount a defense? It wouldn't be a fair fight. They would destroy the news orgs' message about Facebook being an evil swamp of petty Boomer sludge and garbage. Instead they run away, give up, let the journalists define "Facebook."

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155428"></a>I use Facebook only because the people are there. It's the closest thing to a universal online service. Based on what I know about cycles in tech, Facebook #2 (the company) has a small chance of prevailing in their goal to reinvent themselves to be important in the next wave. It has never happened, even with leaders who were more prepared for it than Zuckerberg is. Companies have to stand for something beyond money and dominance. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/29/154353.html?title=facebookIsACowardlyCompanyThatHasNeverHadToFight#a155428" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I hope I live to see his disgrace. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/29/154353.html?title=facebookIsACowardlyCompanyThatHasNeverHadToFight#a155603" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
