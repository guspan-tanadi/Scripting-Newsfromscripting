<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140635"></a>There's a <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/">Drummer development blog</a> with an <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> of course.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/11.html#a140635" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141224"></a>The blog is an HTML rendering of the <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/drummer/changeNotes.opml">Change Notes outline</a>. That link opens in <span class="spTagref">Drummer</span>, even if you're not logged in, and updates when there are new features or fixes. I would be honored if you leave that outline open in Drummer while you do your work, that way I can instantly inform you of new stuff. The file's icon will turn to green when there's news. It's the best channel I've had as a developer to users of my product. We've been using it in the Drummer test community. It really works. Instantly updating outlines are called <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml">instant outlines</a>, btw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/11.html#a141224" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
