<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213403"></a>It's a good idea to re-read the docs after you've been using a product for a while. You find things you miss when you were new to the product. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/17.html#a213403" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213206"></a>In general journalism should report tech that is actually being used to do new things, not on VCs hyping ideas of things that will make them even richer but donâ€™t actually do anything for anyone. If a VC is promoting something that fact alone should make you suspicious.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/17.html#a213206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153205"></a>Idea for a TV miniseries for HBO or Netflix. In 2022 a variant of Covid comes out that kills Republicans and leaves Democrats unharmed. Two thirds of the Supreme Court is wiped out. The state governments of red states are decimated. Within a few months there are no more red states. Series ends with the main characters enjoying a beautiful sunset reveling in the bright future ahead. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/17.html#a153205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134802"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I spent all of 2021 working on <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a>, and part of 2020, and I'm going to keep working on it in 2022 (which is just a couple of weeks away gulp). One of the goals of the project was to have great <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml">docs</a>, and I think they came out pretty good, but there was still a major problem -- where to put things. This is the problem in all docs. Even if you're a good docs writer, and I've had a lot of practice, and you know the product well, and care about the users, some things just won't have a place. So you document them on the <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/">blog</a>, or in the Change Notes outline, and hope people can find them in a search engine. But they keep doing a worse job of indexing our stuff, and they don't know what is a Drummer doc and what isn't, so you can't say for example, "search the Drummer docs for instructions on how to restore a blog.opml file in a myfiles archive" which is a question a user posed <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/140#issue-1082790948">yesterday</a>. I smiled when I saw it. This is a job for Daytona. So here's the query I entered.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/17/134755.html?title=whyDaytonaIsAGamechanger#a134802" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135201"></a>I laughed out loud when the result came back. Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't in a place a user would have looked, and Google <i>never</i> would have found it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/17/134755.html?title=whyDaytonaIsAGamechanger#a135201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135242"></a>The point is this -- it's past time to take responsibility for finding the stuff we write, and if we do it well, and Daytona does, all of a sudden blogging works so much better, and the incentive to write stuff, to document, to narrate our work, to index everything you can, makes total sense. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/17/134755.html?title=whyDaytonaIsAGamechanger#a135242" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
