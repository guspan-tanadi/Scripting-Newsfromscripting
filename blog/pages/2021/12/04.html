<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183851"></a>Andrew Sullivan wrote a <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/why-roe-will-fall-and-obergefell-77a">piece</a> where he wonders why men don't have as much at stake in abortion as women. This is like imho "all lives matter." Fact: You and I have already been born, not aborted, so we do not have a personal interest in abortion.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/04.html#a183851" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The amazing thing is how much fun they had doing Let It Be. And you can see the process, they talk about it. I had the wrong idea about the Beatles as people.
