It's a farce and it's really funny and sexy, super-cute and sad, in the same way that <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/24.html#a143342">Don't Look Up</a> is sad. Human nature is all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdPmNM0IF7Y&t=36s">fucked up</a>. That seems to be a recurring theme. Heh. But it is so much fun, kind of like the way <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a> is fun -- and there are two full seasons so there's a lot to binge. <i>Huzzah! </i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/26.html#a174827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Or -- at death you are told the punchline of the joke. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/26.html#a223417" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154007"></a>Heard a preacher on NPR yesterday saying we should stop vilifying people who vote for racist climate change denying fascists who want to violently overthrow the elected government, so they can do god only knows what. I gave it some thought. No.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/26.html#a154007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
