<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/12/zen.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152131"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/12/zen.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Already <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml">Daytona</a> has improved my writing. I think I could be writing a book now, a memoir, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence</a>, my <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=island%20book&collection=scriptingnews">Island Book</a>. A new dimension has opened up. Until now writing has been more or less Of The Moment. As Google has punished me for not supporting their various <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">hijacks</a> of the web, the writing has become more ephemeral, kind of like Twitter -- once written -- hard to find again. With Daytona all of a sudden my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">memex</a> has memory. My writing is upgraded a billion percent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a152131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152710"></a>An Island Book is a book that after it's published you have to go live on an island. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a152710" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172209"></a>Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive. PS: I can fly. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a172209" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151800"></a>I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debuggers</a> as an integral part of the coding process. I almost never run anything complex without stepping through the code in the debugger, to be sure it's running the way I intended it to. Having the data it's working on right there, easily browsable, gives me ideas for new functionality. Imagine being a surgeon who can get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage">inside</a> the living body, turn off all the systems to examine things, then click a button and have the organism reanimate. And then imagine having such a tool available to you and not using it. There are programmers who don't use debuggers. They're working at a lower level imho. Like flying without instruments. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a151800" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a033852"></a>The first environment I used that had a real debugger was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THINK_C">THINK C</a>. Before that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string">printf</a>, <a href="https://borlandpascal.fandom.com/wiki/WRITE_and_WRITELN">writeln</a>, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a033852" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

That's why you have to develop things in layers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a145617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145719"></a>So I have the last 4.5 years of Scripting News in the Daytona index, now I desperately want all the rest of the years, but that's not going to be so easy. In 2017 I had a really good idea of how I wanted the data stored, but until then, I was playing around a lot. A lot of it is in OPML, somewhere, probably. But a lot more of it is in HTML. But it's pretty incredible to have 4.5 years. Makes all that writing so much more useful.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a145719" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172248"></a>I noticed people are talking about <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml">Daytona</a> on their blogs, and there's a general positive view of it, and an expectation that I will continue to improve it. That's all good. But a lot of that depends on how much I get back from users. Ideas that are interesting, not necessarily obvious, and aren't expressed in terms of panic. I want to move this forward, with friends, with people who are as excited as I am and are ready to roll up their sleeves and participate. But if you wait for me to do it, then I'll just add the things I want. I'm hoping that <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> users take an interest. And not just "do this for me now" -- help out. I can't read minds, and I don't really like working for free. I don't want dollars, I want the product of intelligent, kind people who help. My friend <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=nakedjen&collection=scriptingnews">NakedJen</a> has the perfect motto for this, "You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/12.html#a172248" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
