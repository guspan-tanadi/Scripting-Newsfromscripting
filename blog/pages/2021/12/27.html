It's really very simple. It's art. What does that mean?

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a232233"></a>About eight years ago I sat down to write a bit of software that would let me edit numerous files in a single outline. When I saved the outline they would all update in the various places they were aimed. So with one click I could update a server and its user interface, scripts that run on the server, and a documentation website on GitHub. All the associated files would be in one outline. The <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=outline%20as%20a%20file%20system&collection=scriptingnews">outline as a file system</a> model. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/27/233237.html?title=glorpOrOutlineAsAFileSystem#a232233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a234002"></a>I use it all the time for every project I do.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a233338"></a>It came together remarkable quickly in 2013, in Frontier. In the last few days I've rewritten the software to run in <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a>. The codename for the product is <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=glorp&collection=scriptingnews">Glorp</a>. I'm actually kind of falling in love with the name. When I wrote the initial version in Frontier in 2013 it was just for me. I called it <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=NodeEditor&collection=scriptingnews">NodeEditor</a> because it was initially conceived as a way of editing Node apps. It has outgrown that name, it does much more than that now. Glorp will do for now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/27/233237.html?title=glorpOrOutlineAsAFileSystem#a233338" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
