To our friends in media and politics and the billionaires who own them -- they keep our focus regulated and narrow so they can keep their jobs and keep selling their stuff, we can show them this movie and say the reason we find it funny and you don't is that you're in the way. The bullshit isn't sticking anymore. At some point, dear friend something is going to give where you won't be able to continue being in the way, let's hope the ending in our lives isn't the one in the movie. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/29.html#a165732" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170914"></a>So interesting -- people who write for major media can't see the humor in Don't Look Up. It would require them to see their own filters, which are impossibly hard to see. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/29/170859.html?title=theSmokingGun#a170914" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171142"></a>But here's a fact: Major media can't report bad news.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/29/170859.html?title=theSmokingGun#a171142" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171416"></a>Case in point: I saw a bit that maybe we've found the smoking gun for Jan 6. They've been speculating for months.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/29/170859.html?title=theSmokingGun#a171416" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171200"></a>But we saw the smoking gun on Jan 6, on C-SPAN. If they could remember <i>we saw the gun, </i>they could make the story about what it should be -- why hasn't the DoJ indicted him yet? What's the hold up. That should be the top story on political news every night. Not where's the smoking gun. Trump is, if anything, a walking talking smoking gun. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/29/170859.html?title=theSmokingGun#a171200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172035"></a>PS: If you don't like the Jan 6 invitation to the MAGA mob to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3eC35LoF4U">burn down the house</a>, how about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIJU3M-kKhI">recording</a> of him trying to fix the Georgia election. That's looks like pretty good evidence to this non-lawyer.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/29/170859.html?title=theSmokingGun#a172035" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
