<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163131"></a>The other day I <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/18.html#a140711">reported</a> that I had the project I'm working on "stabilized" after major brain surgery. In software it's always a good idea to be prepared for the worst possible outcome. In this case, I forgot that I hadn't deployed the new version to a server, and when I did that, nothing worked. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case">Edge cases</a>. It is once again "stabilized." But the list of new stuff to do is growing, not shrinking. And who knows what broke in the last round of changes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/23.html#a163131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm not aware of any comparison websites, but I've heard that Oregon is the least expensive, because they have an oversupply. I'm guessing that <a href="https://www.leafly.com/dispensaries/massachusetts/">Massachusetts</a>, the nearest state with retail sales, is still relatively high priced, because the business is so new. 1/8 ounce <a href="https://www.theorywellness.org/ma/great-barrington-recreational-cannabis-dispensary/?dtche%5Bcategory%5D=flower">goes</a> for about $50. I imagine that some of the aggregator sites have a good idea of this. I also wonder what kinds of plans there are for stores in various parts of New York. I imagine that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village">Village</a> in Manhattan will be a place where there are lots of stores. I expect that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York">Woodstock</a>, the nearest town to where I live, will also be a big spot. If you have any information, please leave a note in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/207">this thread</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/23.html#a133909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
