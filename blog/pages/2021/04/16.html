<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/27/bidenActionFigure.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a201229"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/27/bidenActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've been trying to watch the news on MSNBC and CNN, but it's really hard to get into. Their product transformed under <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Trump%22&t=h_&ia=web">Trump</a>, and now that he is gone, or so it seems, knock wood -- what's left for them to cover? Here's what I suggest. This requires that you put the heat on Biden and Judge Garland. First I've heard it said that January 6 could happen again, which I think is too meek. It <i>will</i> happen again. And until the prosecutions begin, the news should be filling in the details the same way they were covering every detail of the Trump crime scene when he was in office. Who are the leaders? Their names, pictures, backgrounds, are they free, awaiting trial, on the run? These people, and the politicians that are covering for them, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-senators-voted-against-bipartisan-bill-anti-asian-hate-crimes-2021-4#sen-tom-cotton-of-arkansas-1">six sentators</a> who voted against the Asian hate crimes bill, to name a few, are vying for the position of <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/03/06/howToPreventAnotherTrump.html">The Next Hitler</a> of the United States. We need a bunch of good enemies. And why aren't the Bidens prosecuting them. We need some bodies in cells for January 6, now. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸŽˆ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/16.html#a201229" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203846"></a>So, instead of watching the news from 6PM to 10PM every night, as I did during the Trump years, I've been reading books, watching the Mets and Knicks, and watching British movies, also the Godfather I and II. On the whole this is a better deal. More variety, it's more personal, much less repetitive, and besides the Knicks are playing entertaining basketball, and that's more than I can say for whatever sport they're playing on MSNBC. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/16.html#a203846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a204151"></a>On the <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813">Drummer</a> front, I decided to rewrite the tab code to use JavaScript closures. Much simpler code and hopefully more easily extended to add new functionality. But right now the app is a mess. I learned some new jQuery tricks with custom event handlers and triggers. You can have a very isolated function with persistent and private storage but you can still make calls into it, for the times when the outside world needs to know something about what's inside. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/16.html#a204151" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So vaccination scarcity is over. All you need is ID. But people without ID can get and spread the virus. Whatâ€™s the plan for such people?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/16.html#a143132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
