Sleeping a lot, not eating much, drinking lots of water. A busy week coming up. It would be nice if this virus-like thing were to go away. And this is weird because I thought we weren't supposed to get virus-like things. Still maybe it's something I ate? Oy. Thanks for all the get well messages. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/25.html#a175412" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180004"></a>An easy way to make your writing better. Write the first draft as you think of the ideas. Then <s>go back and</s> delete <s>all</s> the connectives, <s>all</s> the <s>things</s> words you put in while your mind <s>plotted out</s> plots where you're going <s>to take the writing</s> next. And, delete every instance of the word <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/very">very</a>. Only leave <s>the ones</s> it where it's <s>absolutely</s> necessary to convey the veryness of the idea. Usually it adds nothing to the writing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/25.html#a180004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
