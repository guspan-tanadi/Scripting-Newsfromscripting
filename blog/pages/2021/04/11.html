That’s why I say Fauci should have a podcast. The interviews he does with various people isn’t enough. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/11.html#a021149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Really interesting read because now, only 30 years later (heh), I'm doing a smaller version of the same idea, not on the Mac but on the open web, once again using standard protocols to connect apps. It starts on page 51 of <a href="https://vintageapple.org/macworld/pdf/MacWorld_9108_August_1991.pdf">this PDF</a> of the August 1991 MacWorld. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/page51.png">screen shot</a> of the first page. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/11.html#a134617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135304"></a>What neither Levy or I understood, at the same time in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee was working on the world wide web. Frontier's importance in bootstrapping the web as a content management platform, via blogging, RSS and podcasting, was where the real growth would come. It would require a pivot, of course. The Mac <i>was</i> entering middle age, as Levy postulated. But a new shiny thing that worked really well with the Mac was coming along and would soon change everything. The same vacuum that existed on the Mac at the time, now exists on the web. There is no simple-enough scripting language designed for power users to integrate the functionality of many and disparate apps. Why do I like this so much? I guess I'm just a pipes and wires kind of guy. And I think lots of new media will emerge from the ecosystem we'll create here.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/11.html#a135304" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142201"></a>Embarrassing mistake. Yesterday, in a <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/10/142746.html?title=shouldNetflixHaveASchedule">longish piece</a> about bingewatching, I gave Kazuo Ishiguro credit for writing the novel Howard’s End.  He actually wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day">Remains of the Day</a>. There is a connection. Both were made into movies starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson">Emma Thompson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>. I corrected the piece, but here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/theError.png">screen shot</a> of the error. BTW, interestingly, I received an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/netflixemail.png">email from Netflix</a> last night suggesting I watch Howard's End. Is it a coincidence, or does their algorithm read my blog? That would be amazing if it did. (I'm sure it doesn't but it's an incredible source about my interests.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/11.html#a142201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
