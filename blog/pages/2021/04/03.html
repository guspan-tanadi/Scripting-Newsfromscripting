He goes around the obstruction in DC, bringing his ideas to the people. Journalism could learn from this.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/03/lennon.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131856"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/03/lennon.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've thought more about <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613">Making of Sgt Pepper</a>. It's amazing to hear the Beatles' perspective on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band">album</a>, I had never really thought how it was created, yet as a creative person myself, I’m often surprised and even offended that people don’t consider my point of view about the things I created. But at one time, Sgt Pepper was their thing, their secret. That's why the <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/01.html#a155654">final quote</a> was so strong for me. "You just wait," says McCartney -- echoing the feeling in 1967 when he knew he had something great, that was going to shake the world (as it did) and no one but he and a few others knew what it was. And the lesson of the Making of Sgt Pepper is that you and I will never know Sgt Pepper the way McCartney does. And one more thought, if only John Lennon could have been there, what would we have learned. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03.html#a131856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

One of them is as a developer of scripting systems. I did a big one, Frontier, developed mostly in the late 80s and 90s. People seem to refer to it in the past tense, but I use Frontier as do others. it does things no other product can. It works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer#a163902" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133027"></a>As you may know, <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813">Drummer</a> is my new outliner-based scripting system for the web. It's still at least a few months from shipping, maybe more. But I'm making big decisions about how it works right now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer#a133027" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164239"></a>The same way Frontier was designed around an <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manual/objectDatabase">object database</a> and the Mac filesystem (and later Windows), Drummer works with public and private files on a server.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer#a164239" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133149"></a>Frontier is a very broad and deep product, but it wasn't originally designed to be so big. The initial idea was to integrate it with the Finder, add a Scripts menu, and have it do things with the file system, and provide a way to program and connect scriptable apps. That was it. Simple.  I offered it to Apple. At the time, the early 90s, I knew all the decision-makers there, but I asked for too much money, they thought they could do it for less. So now I had tipped my hand, showed them my product, I figured to be competitive I'd have to add more stuff, which I did have available to me, since I always try out ideas that don't make it into the final product. The product got deeper, but it also got more complicated.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer#a133149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133406"></a>I always wondered if it would have worked better if we had started with the small product. We could have shipped sooner. It would have been more approachable, more immediately useful. I think there is a good chance it would have worked better, but it didn't go that way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer#a133406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135152"></a>This time, I'm trying to keep Drummer small, focus on a few innovations, and make a lot of the parts replaceable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer#a135152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134241"></a>I am creating a product, but as with Radio UserLand, I also want to try to create a new use for our computers. With Radio it was blogging and RSS.
