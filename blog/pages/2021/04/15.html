<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a215017"></a>An unusual day is one where It's almost 6PM and I haven't posted anything to the blog. This is one of those days. I think I actually have to update at least once a day for the nightly mail app. Not sure what it would do if midnight came and there was nothing new. I don't really want to find out. Everything's fine, in the middle of a pretty heavy bit of development so my focus is there. See you tomorrow! ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/15.html#a215017" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
