<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214305"></a>I guess most people think we go back to business as usual with Congress doing more or less what it did at some point in the past.

Maybe we don't have a Congress anymore. Maybe it's Biden and a fig leaf for a Congress.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183819"></a>For right now, treat Congress as a museum. This is a shell of what it used to be. You have to use your imagination to see that there once was a co-equal branch of government here. Now they're a PR appendage for the executive branch.

Keeps them busy when they aren't reporting on President Biden's latest heroic battle against the virus. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/13/183757.html?title=afternoonImpeachmentNotes#a183819" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
