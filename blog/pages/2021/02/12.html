<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191144"></a>This is what I posted on the <a href="http://scripting.com/urgent/2020/03/05.html">home page</a> of my blog on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html">March 5</a> last year. "A deadly virus is taking over the world and the United States doesn't have a government." It occurs to me now that the United States does now have a government.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a191144" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But I do believe in the death penalty for political parties. If the Repubs don't vote to convict, a small gesture of respect for the Constitution, we must condemn the party to death. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a191745" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Even if you’re that 5% yes you almost certainly have some immune training that will keep you out of the hospital. Now is the time to enjoy your life and not worry, at some point a nastier variant could evade the vax but not yet man so go enjoy the spring and summer!"  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a185752" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171524"></a>I tried watching Trump's impeachment defense, but the instant I tuned in I heard the lie. I immediately turned it off. This is the moment of truth when the Republican Party, or most of it, legally, openly and on the record becomes <i>the party of sedition.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a171524" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Recall that I <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/10.html#a163710">gave up</a> on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=asc_df_B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=366402654398&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5599194572670142815&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1023511&hvtargid=pla-852536612290&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74513439285&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=366402654398&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5599194572670142815&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1023511&hvtargid=pla-852536612290">Jabra</a> and Skullcandy earbuds. They both sounded horribly tinny, like an old style AM radio. Actually I didn't give up, it turns out. While watching impeachment hearings, I searched for reports on the Jabra earpods and the word <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jabra+elite+75t+tinny">tinny</a>, and read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jabra/comments/hf1z9k/should_the_jabra_elite_75t_sound_very_tinny/">this thread</a> on Reddit. Basically they said do a bunch of voodoo, put them back in their case, take them out, do it again, change the silicon fits, do it all again, say a prayer, and sooner or later they will sound like you thought they should based on the glowing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/">review</a> in Wirecutter. It worked! Unreal. This is another example of the way we used to fix broken Apple II's, just take them for a drive in the car, and they start working again. Anyway, good enough. And in the interim I ordered a new pair of Apple Airpod Pros, because I got hooked, and had headset-envy every time I saw someone on TV wearing them. As I've said many times, I collect headsets the same way some <a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/02/03/kanye-west-moves-500-pairs-of-shoes-out-of-home-shared-with-kim-kardashian/">people</a> collect shoes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a153946" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160051"></a>BTW, Google search is getting worse all the time. I know I've told the story of how we used to fix Apple II's by driving around (they always seemed to work when we got to the repair shop), and I've also said many times that I collect headphones the way some people collect shoes, but Google can no longer find either. I've been using Google search since 1998. I hate Google for the way <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html#a170258">they treated RSS</a>, and the way they are doing the same <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">to the web</a>, but I've been using their search engine for 23 years, and it's a hard habit to break, but one way to break it is to break search, which they seem to be doing. They should shrug this off at their own peril. Imagine Coke taking the fizz out of their cola. Same basic idea imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a160051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
