As you may recall, I <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/30.html#a162514">lost one of my AirPod Pro's</a> 10 days ago. I tried to order a replacement through the <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/repair?caseid=101319750634&locale=en_US">Apple website</a>, but <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=sfaq&PGF=PGF32003&category_id=SC0298&symptom_id=23360">the page</a> appears to be broken. So I compromised, and bought a couple of less expensive bud-style headphones, one from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082Y2KM92/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Jabra</a>, which comes highly recommended by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/">Wirecutter</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0857JLRFJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Skullcandy</a>. Together they cost about what the Airpod Pro's cost. But here's the thing, both of them sound awful on my iPhone. No bass at all, all high end. So I tried them on my Pixel 4a, same thing. My hearing is fine, I tried the one remaining AirPod Pro, and it sounds great. So now I'm trying to figure out how to equalize the audio on either of these phones. I can't believe there isn't a built-in equalizer, but it seems there's not. I really got to like the AirPods, didn't think I would. I find over-ear headphones clunky now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/10.html#a163710" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
