There's simply too much news happening for the journalists try to cover it all. We need a cooperative effort. And despite all the trash talk from journalism about Facebook, a lot of very important stuff happens there, without their awareness or help. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20.html#a154214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The beginning is hard to watch, but if you're getting on in years, you should know that what they depict actually happens, out of the blue people are committed, by strangers, and their assets stolen, legally. Anyway, once you get over that hump, almost every time you turn a corner, there's something new and wonderful. I haven't had my attention held by a movie like this in a long time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20.html#a174048" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153155"></a>I was once invited to speak at an <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> conference in NY. I was living in Florida, they refused to pay my expenses, so I sold advertising for my speech. The promoters were offended. Of course all that anyone wanted to talk about at the conference was how to add advertising to RSS.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20.html#a153155" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211302"></a>The US is great at elections. We have been running them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1788%E2%80%9389_United_States_presidential_election">since inception</a>, longer than any other country in the world. We are the gold standard in elections. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20/211231.html?title=trumpSupportersAfterTheInsurrection#a211302" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211420"></a>On January 6, Trump supporters attacked the US Congress, and came close to overthrowing the elected government of the United States. This was and still is shocking. We have not fully processed yet what happened on January 6. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20/211231.html?title=trumpSupportersAfterTheInsurrection#a211420" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211400"></a>Whether you think Trump caused it or not doesn't matter for this question. Trump supporters did it, in his name. It seems impossible for one to support Trump at this point, and not also support and accept the insurrection. If you self-proclaim as a Trump supporter, you also support the overthrow of the elected government of the United States by force. Sorry if this is news to you but you are not a patriot, you are a traitor. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20/211231.html?title=trumpSupportersAfterTheInsurrection#a211400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211829"></a>Before the insurrection you could possibly shrug off our "differences" but now your friends who are Trump supporters are no longer willing to accept the result of a fair election, and their response to the fair election is to try to overthrow the government. You can't accept this. Even if they are family members. You have to turn your back on them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20/211231.html?title=trumpSupportersAfterTheInsurrection#a211829" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213010"></a>I thought Julian Castro said it brilliantly at the impeachment trial. Asked if he was concerned about Trump winning in 2024, he said no --  he was afraid of Trump losing. He's afraid of a repeat of what happened on January 6. He's right to be afraid. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20/211231.html?title=trumpSupportersAfterTheInsurrection#a213010" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213015"></a>Trump supporters live in an incompatible alternate country. The two cannot co-exist. We have to defeat them. It's not just about the people who crashed the Capitol, it's about the people who accept that. No excuses, not interested in discussing. We do not co-exist. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/20/211231.html?title=trumpSupportersAfterTheInsurrection#a213015" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
