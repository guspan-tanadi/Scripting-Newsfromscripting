<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161331"></a>A little computer design/philosophy. Everywhere you look on a computer you see the same pattern repeating itself. Folders, sub-folders, files. If you're looking for it you see it everywhere. So why not have one really great browser for such structures, and use it everywhere. That way when you add a feature to the core, it improves everywhere. I think very quickly the computer itself would become simpler. BTW, this was the basic idea behind <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22outliners%22&t=h_&ia=web">outliners</a>. We never got close enough to putting code "in ROM" to complete the vision. But that was the idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/04.html#a161331" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164355"></a>A favorite recent Twitter feature: I can filter replies so I only see, by default, replies from people I follow. It has made Twitter more civil for me. But it has a downside, that I realize when I reply to someone who doesn't follow me. They probably can't see my idea.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/04.html#a164355" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
