In this podcast I explain how magical things happen in the days after someone you're close to dies. It feels that way with Trump. We got one last look at him, not in person, because the person is gone, the Trump who watched TV and tweeted all day from the White House. Gone, not forgotten, becoming a distant memory. What little is left is finishing up old business, and then will depart for good. It's a 20 minute series of stories. Hope you enjoy!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14.html#a145901" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a182459"></a>I just released a new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute">everyMinute</a> script. It's now incorporated into the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emailer</a>. So the <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330">drift I wrote about earlier</a> should now be gone. Fingers crossed. Knock wood. I am not a lawyer. Praise Murphy.

They really are. They have two full teams now. I love the way they did it, not like the Nets, Clippers, Lakers. They didn't buy a team of rental players. It's a home grown team. There are a half dozen Jeremy Lins on this team. So much fun to watch. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14.html#a182951" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162633"></a>I think Apple could make a diff in cars. The other day I was on a longish drive and wanted to listen to the NPR coverage of the Senate hearings. I went in and out of range of various NPR stations. Something the car could have handled for me.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134304"></a>Listening to pundits yesterday, it was remarkable they forgot how scared we were on <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07.html">January 7</a> that this wasn’t the end of the insurrection. Something had to be done and impeachment was the only option. That’s why I keep <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07/152745.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes">a blog</a>, it’s like a time machine.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14.html#a134304" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134601"></a>There is a silver lining to Trump's acquittal. He can now go back to his new occupation of Former Pain In The Ass. Let the bill collectors and district attorneys have him. And Hawley, Cruz and Cotton can go back to their Hitler lessons. Maybe a new reality show that every week gives you a glimpse of the miserable life of a would-be despot, who failed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14.html#a134601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135315"></a>Net-net I'm not too depressed about the Senate acquittal because I remember how the impeachment happened. It was the only instant response possible. (Except as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/remove-trump-tonight/617576/">David Frum</a> pointed out at the time, the Senate could have met and voted him out of office the same day, that would have been awesome. Wish they had the guts to do it.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14/135744.html?title=imNotTooDepressed#a135315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140426"></a>The inauguration was two weeks away. The concern was what would happen next. People say McConnell refused to have the trial before Trump left, but actually that was somewhat rational. They needed to clean up the Capitol, it was trashed, covered in blood and human excrement, and secure it. It sure looked like there would be more attacks at the time. Also don't forget that then-VP Pence refused to consider the 25th Amendment. He gets his share of the credit, if you want to blame McConnell.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14/135744.html?title=imNotTooDepressed#a140426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135903"></a>We know how it turned out now, but we did not know then. And of course a conviction wouldn't have had much practical value. I think it's better if Trump fades into obscurity. Let minor government officials harass him now. He'll protest. "But but I'm the great Trump!" No, you're now a defendant in criminal and civil trials. Then, no you are a bankrupt resident of a federal or state prison. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/14/135744.html?title=imNotTooDepressed#a135903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
