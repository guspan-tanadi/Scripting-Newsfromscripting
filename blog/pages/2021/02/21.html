<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a210405"></a>I released a new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/folderToJson">Node package</a> earlier today.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21.html#a210405" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180308"></a>Just read the name "ivanka" in a Facebook message and had to try hard to remember where I had heard that name before. Another thing I'm having trouble with is remembering if and when "intent" matters with the NYT. They run an op-ed from a troll, I guess intent is irrelevant?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21.html#a180308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171854"></a>A platform like Facebook is very hard to build. Serving billions of users, hundreds of millions at the same time, is a mostly unheralded accomplishment, probably like putting a man on the moon. Yet this never comes up in the public analysis. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21.html#a171854" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/21/nomadland.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151820"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/21/nomadland.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I don't watch a lot of movies these days thanks to the pandemic I guess. But in the last two days I watched two, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadland_(film)">NomadLand</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Care_a_Lot">I Care a Lot</a>. It's hard to imagine two more different movies. NomadLand is a character study, played by a 63-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_McDormand">Frances McDormand</a>. Her age is important. I understand this somewhat because I'm 65, and it's like that great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_7eu64y6c">Al Pacino speech</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday">Any Given Sunday</a>, as you get older <a href="https://youtu.be/_Z_7eu64y6c?t=102">things are taken</a> from you. Parents, friends, lovers, and then pieces of yourself start going, and you're left wondering what the fuck. That's NomadLand in a nutshell. The acting is beautiful, the scenery, the characters, the feelings (somewhat) -- but the story? It's like viewing a work of art in a museum. It's just there. It's for you to decide what it means and a lot of that will depend on how old you are, I imagine. I Care a Lot is very much the opposite, but interestingly it's also about things being taken away from an old person, in this case played by 72-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Wiest">Dianne Wieste</a>. So much happens in the first few minutes of the movie, and it's so anger-making, I turned it off at least three times to regain my composure to continue watching. But then it becomes a rollicking ultra-violent comedy, kind of like a Quentin Taratino movie, but funnier. If you want entertainment, I Care a Lot is for you. I will watch NomadLand again. Sometimes movies like this don't grab me on the first viewing, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood">There Will Be Blood</a>, which i panned after a first viewing, then <i>loved</i> after a second. I'll let you know.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21.html#a151820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162201"></a>Had a thought. Simple arithmetic. There was a fantastic boom, blogging made a lot of stuff happen. Where did it all go? The thesis from journalism seems to be all that is over, ancient history. I think the evidence is to the contrary. Blogging reshaped the world. Not only for good, of course. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21/161031.html?title=bloggingIsStillWithUs#a162201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161115"></a>Journalism plays a magic trick, ignoring the changes, and the good, and only focusing on how the new tech (yes it still is new) can be used for evil. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21/161031.html?title=bloggingIsStillWithUs#a161115" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Perhaps possibly because of their conflict of interest.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21/161031.html?title=bloggingIsStillWithUs#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161128"></a>Jarvis is going on with <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter">Brian Stelter</a> who I understand got his start in <a href="https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/how-a-cable-news-blog-turned-into-a-top-source-for-the-highs-and-lows-of-broadcast-media/">blogging</a>. So it would be interesting if Jeff asked him a question. Do you think the flow is just one way, from journalism to Facebook, or perhaps something more is going on. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21/161031.html?title=bloggingIsStillWithUs#a161128" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161557"></a>My thesis is that blogging may be somewhat vestigial, may be a virtual dinosaur, but its genes are still in ciculation, the equivalent of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-dinosaurs-shrank-and-became-birds/">online birds</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21/161031.html?title=bloggingIsStillWithUs#a161557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
