Par for the course? Shit happens? Move on? Get over it? MAGA! Why not? Look who's up there on stage.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a203350"></a>Perhaps my favorite thing about my <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945">Subaru Forester</a> is how well it fits me: "It has more headroom than any car I've owned, which is cool because my torso is huge. In most cars, designed for normal-size people, I hit my head getting in, and have to scrunch my body uncomfortably just to fit. I sail in and out of the Forester, and I can sit any way I want." Is the same true of a Tesla, if so which one? I would certainly have to verify. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/26.html#a203350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141746"></a>The other night it was super windy, and my house makes pretty nasty sounds when it's windy, but nothing like what it did that night. A huge crashing sound from the roof, like a big tree had hit the house. I was surprised the house could be rocked so hard and still be standing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/26/133100.html?title=thatHugeCrashingSoundWas#a141746" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>In the morning, I checked. No tree. This really weirded me out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/26/133100.html?title=thatHugeCrashingSoundWas#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141806"></a>I had no idea what had happened until a few minutes ago, when I saw on the upstairs patio off my office there were these huge chunks of ice. I tried picking one up, and it wouldn't budge. Hundreds of pounds of ice, all over the place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/26/133100.html?title=thatHugeCrashingSoundWas#a141806" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141836"></a>Clearly what had happened that night was a chain reaction of ice that had accumulated through all the storms this winter, dislodging and crashing down off the porch at once. Right over my poor sleeping head! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/26/133100.html?title=thatHugeCrashingSoundWas#a141836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143507"></a>Oy at least it wasn't a tree. And the house is still standing!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/26/133100.html?title=thatHugeCrashingSoundWas#a143507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
