I keep the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/macbook-air/the-dock-apd4b7fb731f/mac">desktop Dock</a> at the bottom of the main screen. I want to be sure the dock doesn't magically get moved to the second screen. It happens every few days, if I click in the dock in a certain way. Is there some way to lock the dock in place, at the bottom of the main screen? It doesn't seem there should be any mouse click that gets the dock to move such a great physical and conceptual distance. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/17.html#a142847" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've had this problem where it complains about disks being ejected that I never ejected. I deal with it, but today there seems to be an infinite number of these dialogs. I've been clicking on the Close button in these dialogs for ten minutes, and it's impossible to know how many there are. It feels like thousands. I've tried pressing modifier keys while clicking, to no avail. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/17.html#a152409" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I couldn't for the life of me read the very <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/17/instructions.png">simple instructions</a>. Letters are a light gray on a white background and tiny. Why? They have so much space. Why not use a big font and black letters? Did they user-test this at all? Are their designers sadists? Questions questions. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/02/17.html#a152559" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
