The news is that Repubs are planning, openly, the destruction of the American political system, turning the US into Russia, with vast wealth to be looted. The question is wtf are we going to do -- now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/22.html#a123640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's true, they are hostages, and it made me stop and think because at first i thought you said hostage-takers.    <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/22/175508.html?title=myDialogWithJoeTrippiContinues#a175541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175803"></a>Working to get Dems elected is not enough. The Democratic Party is in the way. It might be better to run ads attacking them first. To establish that something unusual is going on, that the Dems are weak and disorganized and not the answer.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/22/175508.html?title=myDialogWithJoeTrippiContinues#a175803" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175937"></a>Michael Cohen has some of what's needed. I really liked what he said about driving sign trucks through neighborhoods stating obvious truths that everyone knows that they never say on TV. It's a brilliant idea. He's a brilliant guy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/22/175508.html?title=myDialogWithJoeTrippiContinues#a175937" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180005"></a>I don't think the Lincoln Project is the right banner for you to fly under. No matter what they do they identify as Republicans. i don't know if you're a basketball fan but that's like saying the 76ers or Nets should lead us in our quest to win the title. (Both have been eliminated). They are brilliant advertisers, but they are not leaders because they have the Republican stink on them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/22/175508.html?title=myDialogWithJoeTrippiContinues#a180005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180057"></a>BTW, someone who has leadership qualities -- Stacey Abrams. I found when she endorsed Joe Manchin's election reform platform I had to go look at it. Because I trust her and believe in her intelligence. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/22/175508.html?title=myDialogWithJoeTrippiContinues#a180057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
