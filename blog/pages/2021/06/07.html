I would if I were them. Hey I would if I were me! Trump's insurrection is ongoing. What would you expect, we're not putting up any resistance. And right now, theoretically at least, the resistance occupies the White House. I don't know if Biden understands why he was elected.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/07.html#a161516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If we don't defend against that, regardless of what the senators from West Virginia and Arizona think, we deserve to be over.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/07.html#a170506" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a130907"></a>Today's song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE">The swimming song</a>. This was the song of the summer of 1978 in Madison. I was in love with a beautiful young woman. I was a beautiful young man. I had so many friends. We all went swimming. I had a key to the computer lab at the university. I would go swimming every day. Sometimes in the lap pool out by the Ag School. Other times at a flooded rock quarry outside town. We went to the farmer's market on Sundays up by the Capitol. Fish fry on Friday night at Crandall's. This was life at its best. I had everything. I'm not doing too bad these days, and I have the memory of swimming in love, health and creativity when I was young. Nothing better than that.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/07.html#a130907" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
