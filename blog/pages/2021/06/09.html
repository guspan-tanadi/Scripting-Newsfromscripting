<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a182458"></a>Just did my first <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-hosting">Spaces</a> session. I have a suggestion. When you start a space, ask the user if they want to set a time limit. Then display the time limit for everyone to see. Maybe even have a clock counting down. And when it's over, just shut it off. I'd do more of them I think.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09.html#a182458" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160846"></a>Other apps can be notified when any of these files changes, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09/154656.html?title=githubNotificationsViaWebsockets#a160846" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160906"></a>This is accomplished by a very thin publicly accessible server app that gets <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks">WebHook</a> calls from GitHub, accepts subscriptions from browser apps and mobile apps, really any kind of app, over WS.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09/154656.html?title=githubNotificationsViaWebsockets#a160906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192834"></a>I like that it relies on GitHub. It performs well, and it'll probably be around for a while. And it's free to use, all you have to do is set up an account. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09/154656.html?title=githubNotificationsViaWebsockets#a192834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161214"></a>The files themselves contain the ws:// address of the server app as metadata, so all you need is the address of the data to hook up to the correct server that does notifications over WS.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09/154656.html?title=githubNotificationsViaWebsockets#a161214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161123"></a>This, btw is exactly the infrastructure neeed by an <a href="https://bhc3.com/2009/01/16/before-there-was-twitter-there-was-dave-winers-instant-outliner/">Instant Outliner</a> via OPML. The apps that generate the OPML could be outliners, or really any app that wants to deal in outline-structured data. But the protocol is general enough so it could be used for any data file type. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09/154656.html?title=githubNotificationsViaWebsockets#a161123" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214012"></a>In a few days, once the app has been running for a while, and I have a good demo put together, I'll publish a pointer to a compatible OPML file, and provide example code running in a browser for requesting notification via Web Sockets. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/09/154656.html?title=githubNotificationsViaWebsockets#a214012" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
