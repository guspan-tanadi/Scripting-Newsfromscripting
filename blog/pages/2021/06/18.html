<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/07/tangerineChair.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183936"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/07/tangerineChair.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A few days ago I asked for an idea of what the term "garden" meant when applied to a software product. I had seen it used in conjunction with various Tools for Thought projects. I also saw <a href="https://twitter.com/holden">Mike Caulfield</a> talk about it on Twitter. I wanted to understand what it means. After reading his <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">whitepaper</a> on the garden and the stream, I think I get it. My garden is various product and technology sites, like <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>, <a href="http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html">OPML</a> and <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a>. The product sites for <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>, <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>, the <a href="http://home.opml.org/">OPML Editor</a>. There's even a <a href="http://outliners.com/">garden</a> for outliners of the 80s: ThinkTank, Ready! and MORE. And the stream? That's a blog! And podcasts, and RSS itself. OPML is more the language of the garden. These are useful words to apply to ideas we've been developing since the dawn of the web. It's good to have these words. I also thought of Chance the Gardener's idea of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgGvd1UPZ88">garden</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_There">Being There</a>, a wonderful comedy about how the world really works. Chance talks about tending his garden. People find great meaning in this, which is weird because he really is talking about his garden, not economics. It's a farce, a current-day, more thoughtful version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy">Idiocracy</a>, another great movie. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/18.html#a183936" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183523"></a>I updated the <a href="http://this.how/opmlChecklist/">OPML checklist</a> with a <a href="http://this.how/opmlChecklist/#1624040113000">section</a> explaining what OPML is, and how it came to be the interchange format for outlines. I also added a link to the Instant Outlines <a href="https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines">project</a> which was released after the checklist. Keep the garden properly tended. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/18.html#a183523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190607"></a>BTW, thinking about Ward Cunningham's <a href="http://makecommoningwork.fed.wiki/federated-wiki.html">Federated Wiki</a>  project, if it understood OPML and had an outliner built in, that would make a pretty great publishing platform. Even better than a built-in outliner, an API by which any outliner could plug in. I'd love to help with that. I love designing and supporting APIs. Ward and I talked about this in our <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html">meetup in 2016</a>. I'm about to ship a new outliner, so it's a fresh topic for me in 2021. Lots of talk about integrating the output of one outliner into another. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/18.html#a190607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
