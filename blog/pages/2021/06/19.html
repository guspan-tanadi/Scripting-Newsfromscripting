<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152910"></a>I think I've updated the home page of Scripting News a hundred times this morning trying to get five systems to work together. Interop is hard, at the first time you get things working, and as long as you don't "fix" things you hope it keeps working. Knock wood. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/19.html#a152910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a184406"></a>Today's project is really twisty. I have an OPML file that should always show exactly what's on the blog, but in OPML. That's different from a realtime update, because it only updates when I publish. I don't necessarily like being watched while I edit. It could get weird. It would have been simple to put it on S3 and give it a scripting.com URL, but I wanted it to be on GitHub, so it would be transparent about how it got to the client. And then there's the notification server, that gets a webhook call from GitHub when the OPML file updates. But that's not enough! The client apps, which are browser-based, hook up to the notification server via websocket, which it found the address of in the &lt;head> section of the OPML file. It's all very simple for the client apps, which is the point, but there are a lot of moving parts to debug on my end of things.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/19.html#a184406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
