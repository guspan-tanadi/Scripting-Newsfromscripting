Lots of good stuff to build on.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a022047" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Logseq now exports OPML. If you <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/?url=http://instantoutliner.com/pg">click this link</a>, their outline will open in LO2. Seeing their outline open in my world is revealing to say the least. This is like joining two cultures. The Mac outlining culture with the "other" culture (to me) which derives from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode">Org-mode</a> (i am told) and wikis. I can see some interesting cross-fertilization happening.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a170955" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There are lots of things I want to show that we can do <a href="http://this.how/opmlChecklist/">with OPML</a>. Most important it's all about the open web, connecting people's virtual minds, not just everyone on their own island.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a025232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171849"></a>I'm watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment">In Treatment</a>. It's kind of appalling how people trod all over the therapist's boundaries. They project wildly on him. He should get combat pay. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a171849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a024135"></a>The Brooklyn Nets are not a real basketball team. They are just a shell that Kevin Durant pwned by signing with them. Kind of the way Apple didn't really buy NeXT, it was the other way around. Anyway, the Durant's "Nets" might win a title, or try a couple of times, but either way the train will move on and leave the Nets as wrecked as the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is a trend, it's no longer innovative, curious, fun or even good basketball. Durant was bored in Golden State. He'll get bored in Brooklyn too. Imho, they're boring right now. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a024135" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124151"></a>Yesterday I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/01/141749.html?title=naomiOsakaDerrickRose">about Derrick Rose</a> as a 32-year-old star athlete, and as if to prove my point, he was quoted in today's <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/01/knicks-can-keep-magical-season-going-just-a-little-longer/">NY Post</a> saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 32 years old. I never talked shit like that in my whole life. I‚Äôm not going to start now once <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/01/clint-capela-goes-scorched-earth-on-dirty-knicks-in-epic-taunt/">Clint Capela</a> starts talking crazy. I‚Äôm too old for that shit, bro.‚Äù I love this guy. If any Knick could boast, it's DR, but he's cool. He likes playing for the Knicks, and we like him. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a124151" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
