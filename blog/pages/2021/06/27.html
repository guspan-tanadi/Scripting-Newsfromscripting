Now I have trouble getting through them, because I know the truth and the stories in the biographies are not that.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153328"></a>A slogan for programmers. "Let's see what happens." An idea pops into my head. I wonder if that could possibly work? Go for it. Other kinds of product designers, engineers, or screen writers, don't have the luxury that we have.

Or maybe in its failure it'll give you and idea of what might work. But be careful not to risk actual data. I expect this might show up in my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/679fe7641178a7946f4b8aab806e0360f85f960d/daveutils.js#L828">snarkySlogans</a> array. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/27.html#a153328" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
