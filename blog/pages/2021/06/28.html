I went in thinking I wanted Atlanta to win, but it turned out I actually was rooting for Milwaukee, who won again, decisively. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28.html#a141513" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141552"></a>There should be a limit on the number of times a team can foul one player. When a team exceeds the limit, the team being fouled gets to choose a player on the fouling team who is fouled out of the game. Do it again, lose another player. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack-a-Shaq">Hack-A-Shaq</a> isn't good for the game. There's no reason a power dunker like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo">Giannis</a> has to be a good foul shooter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28.html#a141552" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132051"></a>I start my programming day with a new outline entry where I make notes about the first projects I'm going to do as I start working on code. Inevitably, I think of next steps, so I note them too. At the end of the day, I make notes for the next day, so I never have to worry about showing up to work and having no idea of what I'm supposed to do (this happens sometimes). In the middle, I note anything I might need to remember about the work in teh future, similar to the way a doctor takes notes on your chart as they do an exam, or decide on a plan. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28.html#a132051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132209"></a>This is an interesting time in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer">Drummer</a> project. I'm deep in InstantOutlineLand, this time doing lots of documenting, sample code writing, and developing flows of automatically updating outlines so we have something to test against. Not too different from the initial development for various other projects, such as podcasting. You need to do all the chickens and eggs if you want a new protocol to develop.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28.html#a132209" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135724"></a>It's kind of a shame Apple didn't do something creative with their pricing for podcasts.   <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#a135724" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The pricing is voluntary, according to their <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2021/06/15/1006687574/support-your-favorite-npr-podcasts-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions">press release</a>. You can still listen if you don't subscribe (for money). Not sure how it could work otherwise. Would NPR want to transition Fresh Air, one of the founding podcasts? It's kind of like the Meet The Press of podcasting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#a135734" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135822"></a>But, what if there were something new, call it a <i>paycast</i> perhaps, where you pay per episode. Maybe $1 per. Flat price, everything costs the same, at least at first. Keep it simple and easy to understand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#a135822" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>You need a special app so there's no confusion about what's what. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135837"></a>It's tied to your credit card. Every time you listen to at least 5 minutes of a podcast, you pay. Put a warning beep at 4 minutes 45 seconds.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#a135837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135837"></a>I would love to try this out because I'm pretty sure this is the way web news will ultimately work, and there is no pricing model for podcasts, therefore nothing to displace, unless you consider ads a model, see below. As long as we're trying something new, might as well try something better than what's already out there, from the point of view of users (we're the ones with your money in our pockets).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#a135837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>And btw, no ads please. Ads in podcasts really suck, esp the ones at the beginning. I almost never make it through the ads. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/28/135711.html?title=paycasts#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
