It was time for a purge. Saddam had decided to execute the whole legislature. The doors were locked and they started taking out people one by one and shooting them. Saddam, sadist that he was, videotaped it. So you could see what these guys were doing as they figured out, one by one, what was happening. So what did the condemned legislators do while waiting to be shot? They gave speeches, denouncing each other as the real enemy of the state, and proclaiming their love for Saddam, the best friend he ever had. Didn't work, they were all killed." They used to have video on the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/">PBS site</a>, but it was a victim of the deprecation of Flash.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153626"></a>I changed the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/06/headerImage.png">header image</a> on my blog to a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/06/usCapitol.png">beautiful shot</a> of the US Capitol. Amazing how quickly the political action moved from Georgia to DC. But all this Trump michegas is masking the big story -- the pandemic is digging in with increased virality all over the world, but especially in the US. With power as it's currently configured, we finally have a chance to help ourselves. But only barely. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/06.html#a153626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152002"></a>Stacey Abrams does it right: She finds out what the people need. That's a pretty good basic method for politics. And she says, I think correctly, that as the Dems get better at that, the Repubs will have to too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/06.html#a152002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
