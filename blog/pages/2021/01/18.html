Move one of the news networks to the middle of the country. CNN, MSNBC, or something new.  Instead of reporting from NY and DC, do it from Chicago or Dallas.   Same news, same people, just put the host in the middle of the country. When and why did CNN move from Atlanta?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/18.html#a172128" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172436"></a>When the virus is under control will the networks revert to having in-studio guests? If not, one of the tech companies should make a total turnkey home TV guest computer, with everything you need to sound and look great when your Maddow moment comes. This sounds like a project for Microsoft. Or one of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/best-smart-speakers-of-2021-amazon-echo-google-nest-mini-and-apple-homepod-compared/">smart speaker</a> companies? A lot of interviewees use Skype. One thing to start, teach people how to make ther room sound good. Lots of pillows to start with. You can handle a poor picture better than awful audio.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/18.html#a172436" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163427"></a>I think the people who invaded the Capitol are telling the truth when they say Trump told them to do it. But that's not all. Trump made them feel special. They were one of a few thousand people that he trusted to set this right. It may not be logical, but the people in the videos seemed drunk. From the recognition from god. The ProPublic videos show that, at the demonstration. They actually called him god. Trump. The scene in the Senate from the New Yorker video, sounded like what I think a hospital for the insane would. Where was their sense of self. DId they think they would get away with it? Why would they think that? Hard to imagine someone could be so far from reality.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/18.html#a163427" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So you can quickly create connections between apps when the idea occurs to you, when you have the need. Then you can use it, and then you have experience using the 1-in-10 idea that's so good to want to further develop, when you develop it for real. That's why your second version of something is so much better than the first, and the third version is good enough for other people to use (even though we make them use the first two versions anyway). The idea we had, for connecting apps on a single machine, back in the mid-80s was right. It has been a big part of the evolution of every layer since. (And probably before, I just wasn't around during those evolutions.) I mention this because in less than 10 minutes I whipped up a connection between two worlds I'm working on, and watched the newer app update based on a ping from my older app. Ping! It "just worked" and if you're a programmer you know how satisfying that can be. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/18.html#a160235" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
