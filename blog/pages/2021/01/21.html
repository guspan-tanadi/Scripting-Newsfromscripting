<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151812"></a>I spend an awful lot of money on video entertainment and receive very little in return. There were many months I paid for HBO but didn't watch a single thing on it. I paid for Showtime, but I think there were whole <i>years</i> that I never watched anything there. I'd love to re-watch <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-knick">an HBO show</a> that I recommended to a friend (and am hereby recommend to you) but I'd have to re-sub to watch it legally. Couldn't I just use one of those months in the past where I watched nothing but paid anyway? Okay so they need so much money for the lavish productions of new stuff. Maybe they could price their archives separately? How about that. Anything more than 10 years old say, you can have for $1 a month, and do a bundling deal where I can get everything that's 10 years or older from any of the majors for $10 a month. Problem is they'd find they have a glut of good stuff. We don't really need that much more. The whole thing is grossly out of whack. BTW, I did sign up for <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/19.html#a125040">Fubo</a>, only to find out they don't have an app for my LG TV, which is a whole other rant, why exactly do there have to be special apps for every TV. (Yes I know the answer, but I'm asking at a deeper level. Thank you.) I thought I might watch the Knicks, but there was an inauguration, and I had my Covid vaccine, and it made me tired, I think, so instead I just went to bed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21.html#a151812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142628"></a>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ericnuzum">Eric Nuzum</a> for writing this <a href="https://podnews.net/article/first-podcast-feed-history">story</a> of the <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml">first podcast feed</a>, about the project I did in January 2001, twenty years ago. The feed he writes about was used to test software I had developed that reads podcast feeds, otherwise known as a podcatcher. The feed was a small effort compared to the software that reads podcast feeds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a142628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142720"></a>A few people on Twitter have criticized Eric's story, they say it was wrong, but actually <i>he got it right.</i> That's why it's always a good idea to hedge a bit when you say someone is wrong.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a142720" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141347"></a>Okay first, a nit -- the idea that Chris Lydon had the first real podcast is not true. There were a couple of others that predate his Radio Open Source -- Doug Kaye's IT Conversations and Steve Gillmor's Gillmor Gang. They were doing MP3-based radio when we came out with the podcast format, and they quickly adopted it. I've written about them here <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22">many times</a>. Lydon's podcast was the <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/02/21/cbcsOriginStoryOfPodcasting.html">first</a> I had a role in producing. I've shrugged off the distinction a few times, because Chris was the first who showed up to play in my sandbox, and that, to me, was worth a lot. I learned from his experience, a lot. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a141347" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142910"></a>But here's where Nuzum got it right and his critics are wrong. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a142910" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141702"></a>In early 2001, after meeting with Adam in New York, which Nuzum documents, I produced a daily feed of Grateful Dead songs. I don't think the RIAA would have had a problem with it (as Nuzum jokingly says) because the Dead had a culture of letting their users do what they like with their music. I thought it was completely appropriate that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=320&v=Kj_kK1j3CV0">Heart of Gold Band</a> would play a role in bootstrapping the new medium. I created the feed to test my new podcatcher. Here's the story of that software, whcih is also documented in the archive of my blog.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a141702" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141949"></a>In 1999, at UserLand, we created a product called My UserLand, to compete with Netscape's My Netscape. Both were server-based RSS reader apps. This was the very beginning of RSS being used as a news publishing format. Then a we created a desktop version of My UserLand called, unimaginatively, My UserLand On The Desktop or MUOTD for short. It did what the server-based product did, but it ran as an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif">app on a user's desktop</a>. <i>The Grateful Dead podcast feed was there to test the podcatcher functionality in MUOTD.</i> That predated Adam's iPodder by over three years. Adam used it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a141949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154254"></a><b>Radio UserLand</b><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a154254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142241"></a>MUOTD was later merged with Radio UserLand, a desktop blogging tool, creating something that has yet to be matched by anyone -- a desktop blogging and reading app, all in one. It was pretty cool. I'm pretty sure the guys who later formed Twitter used it. It was more or less Twitter on the desktop, based on RSS, five years before Twitter. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">🚀</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a142241" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142349"></a>This was all part of an idea I loved that I called a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html">Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers</a>. MUOTD and Radio UserLand were full powered web servers that ran on the user's machine. Most probably weren't even aware they were running a server, because the user interface was so smooth. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a142349" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
