Journalism is evil. This contrarian view is brought to you by open media. You will never hear these simple ideas on closed corporate media.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/01.html#a185440" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190023"></a>The best podcasts are the ones with experts who simply share their expertise. So many podcasts begin with a long discussion about how everyone feels, with lots of chuckling and self-praise and inside jokes. No. One. Cares. The first time I noticed this was a podcast about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans">The Americans</a>, a great show that I loved, with cast members. That's cool. Talk about the characters you play. But I really don't care where you, the actor, grew up. Exceptions are obvious. If you're a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">Beatle</a>, go ahead and talk about yourself. If you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, yes please. I would like to know what makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Ernst">Joni Ernst</a> tick. But most experts aren't interesting as people. Your audience is looking to learn something, so teach us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/01.html#a190023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164119"></a>As was pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstorms/status/1345045516644659211">Brian Dear</a> on Twitter, it's now January 1, 2021, and I still haven't received a letter or email from the US government telling me how and when I'm going to get my Covid vaccine. As a user of Medicare, I am surprised they haven't yet sent me an email about this. This is actually the kind of thing they do at Medicare. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/01.html#a164119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
