<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162808"></a>Twitter should also disconnect Trump. This is hard for me to advocate, as one of the first bloggers and podcasters, I believe, at my core, in <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html">direct communication</a>. But this has gone far enough. Someone said the Constitution is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact">suicide pact</a>. Neither is blogging. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07.html#a162808" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Don't RT the fascists. That's why they stay on Twitter, to outrage you and your followers. If you weren't helping them, they'd stay on their own private social net. What's ironic is that some of the worst offenders are reporters whose pubs blame Facebook for the garbage news. Their own reporters are distributing the same stuff on Twitter. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07.html#a155309" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The House isn't coming back into session until after the inauguration, and the Senate is adjourned until January 19. When was this decided? On the other hand, hard to blame them. They were locked down, trapped in the Capitol with who-knows-what kind of <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2021/01/07/aide-says-trump-was-a-monster-during-capitol-siege/">monsters</a> with what weapons roaming around, and some nice officers with pistols pointed at the doors.

Yesterday, as the riot was developing, I posted on Twitter that this coup could be successful. They will try again. And remember there are 50 state capitals in the US. Any of them could be next. I hope they're preparing for it. Esp the swing states. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07/152745.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a152227" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152350"></a>Impeachment? How fast could it happen? The Dems certainly have enough votes to impeach. Could they must 51 votes in the Senate to have a real trial? Could they somehow get 66 votes to convict? It may end up being symbolic, but censorship is not enough. Trump being the first president to be removed from office through impeachment would be the warning we needed at the beginning of 2020. It could give the Republican senators another chance to do the right thing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07/152745.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a152350" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152534"></a>Communication. We need much better communication among all the American people. It's no longer acceptable that there be several versions of the truth. Radio Free America. It has to be less wish-washy and repetitive than Wolf Blitzer or as one-sided as Maddow. The NYT isn't it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/07/152745.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a152534" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
