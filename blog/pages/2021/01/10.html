Well, there's a deal stopper, no CNN.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154659"></a>Your access to all of the internet depends on the permission of a lot of big companies. Any one of them could break your illusion of independence.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155629"></a>A long time ago I wanted to try Google Cloud Platform. I had to give them a credit card. I quickly decided I didn't want the service, so I turned off my test project. Now the card has expired and they're sending me emails saying that I have to register a new credit card. But my bill is $0, has been forever. I don't owe them any money and I don't want the service. I have written them feedback using their support mechanism. Yet I still get the warning emails. The easy thing to do would be to give them a new credit card. This is the power of huge faceless corporations. Even small ones can threaten your credit rating. A foot doctor sends me bills for $40 every few months. Can't talk to the doctor, they won't permit it. Or Experian had a bug that caused my credit to be hurt. It has hurt a lot of other people, I hear. This is the background to the idea of Amazon shutting off an annoying customer because people, including their employees, are hassling them about it. You better stay popular with the people Amazon cares about or you'll be out on the street. I'm not going to give Google a new credit card. Let's see what happens.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/10.html#a155629" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
