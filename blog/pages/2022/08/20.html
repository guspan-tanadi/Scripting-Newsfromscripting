So here's the obligatory post that will help me not have to worry about this one more time. Reminds me of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/10/26/dontfeedthegeeks.html#3">time</a> I got a letter from my Scottish penpal saying "sometimes my mother writes these letters for me." Never a more potent sentence. But this is really me, Dave -- coming to you late at night. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/20.html#a031107" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a031400"></a>Turns out I did have something to say. I'm watching a great HBO series called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Friend_(TV_series)">My Brilliant Friend</a>. It got the highest <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/my-brilliant-friend">rating</a> on Metacritic, and it is deserved. Almost like watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> (who I love) in her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone">first movie</a>, and realizing there's going to be a lot more of this and being happy to be around to see all of it. There are three seasons, I'm only on episode 4 of season 1. I'm sure there will be a lot more to say about this.  In the meantime I'm just enjoying a beautiful film as a TV series about two children growing up in Naples in the 1950s. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/20.html#a031400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
