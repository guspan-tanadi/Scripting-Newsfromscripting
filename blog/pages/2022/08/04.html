<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151857"></a>A new <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=alitoist&geo=US">term</a>: "alitoist." He's a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/07/alito-rome-religious-liberty-foreign-leaders-secularism.html">politician</a> now. A neophyte. His name should be as infamous as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy">McCarthy</a> as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/04.html#a151857" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152505"></a>BTW, here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/04/alitoistTrend.png">screen shot</a> of what Google Trends returns for alitoist today. Let's see if anything happens here. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/04.html#a152505" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145602"></a>I am generally critical of the substance and format of cable news, but â€” the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bezgeMocFPU&t=270s">opening segment</a> on Joy Reidâ€™s show last night about women and abortion after Kansas was outstanding, deep, emotionally evocative, inspiring. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization">Dobbs decision</a>, however awful, enslaving and life-endangering of American citizens, has a silver lining. It can stir us to act in care of each other, across all supposed divisions, find the American within each of us. We are still unitable if you push us hard enough.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/04.html#a145602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145854"></a>Today I coined a new term -- News Product.   A product made out of news.  I keep looking for something better, but in this case needed a descriptive term.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/04.html#a145854" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've been programming <i>almost 50 years</i> if you can believe that. I do all my programming in an <a href="http://scripting.com/listings/pagepark.html">outliner</a> so I can put as much text as I want into the code and it's still as simple as it was at the beginning. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/04.html#a152345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
