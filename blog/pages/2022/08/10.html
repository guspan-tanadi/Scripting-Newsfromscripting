<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a212508"></a>The idea of putting <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> into the world of the browser was a mistake. The world of news is another world altogether. The web tried, in every way to turn RSS into the web. And it was very unsatisfying for a reason, the web was designed for documents. Things that have lasting value. The news is different. It's ephemeral. You want to keep a record of it for sure, but yesterday's news has no value as news, because it's not new. It's like the difference between music and podcasts. Music you may want to listen to many times, to cherish, to attach memories to, if it's good enough, over your whole life. A podcast is one and done. Pfffft. Off to the bit bucket. It's value is over as soon as the next episode is out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/10.html#a212508" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
