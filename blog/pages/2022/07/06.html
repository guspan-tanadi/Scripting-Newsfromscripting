What more could it possibly take? Why is he still walking around free? Not only is he making a mockery of the rule of law, the prosecutors are as well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/06.html#a225318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The pizza went flying, along with a fair amount of sauce and cheese, soiling the carpet in front of the passenger seat on my almost new Model Y, which is scary for a new car, for fear it'll <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/30/152537.html?title=howToFightMiceInCars">attract rodents</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/06/232835.html?title=carsNowRateTheirDrivers#a233233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
