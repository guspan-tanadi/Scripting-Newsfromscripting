There's no way as far as I know to talk to them (they sure talk a lot to me) other than posting this publicly. So -- I would absolutely switch to your service if you had <a href="https://www.msgnetworks.com/">MSG</a> and <a href="https://www.sny.tv/">SNY</a>. I need to be able to watch Knicks and Mets games. That's all that keeps me with Spectrum whose software is nowhere near as good as Google's.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/05.html#a185546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174451"></a>I was out and about this morning running errands and everywhere I went I was the only one wearing a mask. I wanted to ask people if they thought Covid was over, but of course I didn't. I got a few stares which I interpreted to mean they felt judged by me. True. And I by them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/05.html#a174451" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
