The whole world is in a way built around Twitter, and it works pretty well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/08.html#a222817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You are now breathing for two people. If you disconnect that's "abortion" and it's illegal. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/08.html#a213031" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I mean how could he know. If he asked 80-year-olds there's a pretty good chance they lie to him, I expect. I wouldn't trust them. Here's what I think, <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1545431247417139200">this</a> is what you'll regret at 80 -- that you aren't 20. Heh. And btw it's because sex is great at 20. So if you're 20 you should do a lot of that. At least it'll make you smile when you're 80 (I imagine).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/08.html#a155059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152320"></a>Every time I hear someone talk about podcasting in such a <a href="https://twitter.com/richardberryuk/status/1545385842956550145">mainstream way</a> I feel a sense of accomplishment. Podcasting made a difference. It worked. The thing that really gives me pride is that it can serve as an example to young developers that their work can make a difference, and it isn't all about making huge piles of money, and you don't have to work for a big corporation, if you think creatively and seek out others with a similar perspective.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/08.html#a152320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
