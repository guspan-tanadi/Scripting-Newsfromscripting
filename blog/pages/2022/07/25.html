If it isn't what would be? If he nuked a major American city? Would that be enough to put him in jail. Do people listen to their own words?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25.html#a171018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He dug up original <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/25/userlandFrontierDisks.png">Frontier disks</a> from 1992 or so and posted a picture to Facebook.

Then later I was cleaning up old stuff and found these discs, thought of you again. I hope youâ€™re doing well!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163238" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163501"></a>These disks brought up a story, which I shared <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid022PujwpmPkX8GVRYBFBbsbjsdtkJuFXuudew4G8TdR5pAAPzprJxxpgMfvts8vjV7l?comment_id=440585781308326">there</a>, and now here. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163501" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163600"></a>Frontier on the Mac  was about 30 years ago believe it or not. People born in that year, cute little babies in cribs, are now 30 years old.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163634"></a>That experience completely wrung out my last hope for corporate platform vendors. Not only did I get a close-up look at Apple, but I also got to know the platform people at Microsoft and Aldus. Corporations have too many conflicts to pull it off. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165629"></a>A wise Apple would have let us run scripting on the Mac, and let us put it where ever we wanted. What they ended up with was a pure corporate creation, runs only on one OS, and has its utility crippled by an idea that top execs understood -- "Programming in English."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a165629" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163808"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Corporation">Aldus</a> had a deal with developers, they'd wait two releases before crushing them (ie pulling the features of their plugin into the main product). At least they were up front about it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163808" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163833"></a>Microsoft people were mostly nerds and they gave their programmers a lot of freedom. I hooked up with one of the devs on Microsoft Word, <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DavidLuebbert">Dave Luebbert</a>, and we had a scripting party, and Word was the most scriptable app out there, even though no one knew. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163919"></a>After that experience, I left software. I realized there wasn't going to be anything left for me, because no matter what I did, i'd either have to work inside one of these beasts, and I didn't see that working out too well, or they'd just anihilate us if we achieved any success, even if we did it on their terms.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a163919" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163949"></a>A year later -- I got a demo of HTTP and I saw the answer. It's like being a devotee of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#R'hllor">Lord of Light</a> in Game of Thrones. Oh there's the answer -- Unix!

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164036"></a>I'm doing one more push folks, no one has been doing anything with RSS for many years, even though it's very much still out there. I've had a productive year. Really good software almost ready. We'll see if there's any hope for independent developers in 2022.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/25/163055.html?title=aScreedOfNoImportance#a164036" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
