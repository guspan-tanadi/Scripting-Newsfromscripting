<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a205312"></a>First major difference between the new iPhone and the old one -- the new one has 512GB of memory, the previous one had 64GB. That means that I can have all my apps loaded at the same time, where the system would always be swapping them out. That makes a big difference around where I live where cell coverage is very spotty. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/18.html#a205312" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174056"></a>I have a little web app that lets you view an RSS feed in JSON. It can be pretty useful when you just want to see what's in a feed, without the formatting. Here's an <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml">example</a>, viewing my feed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/18.html#a174056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/232">thread</a> about feed reader prior art. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/18.html#a145032" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
