I don't want DVD or VHS. It does appear to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=beatles+anthology">on YouTube</a> in some form. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02.html#a203819" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Great book, exactly what I had been looking for, highly opinionated writing about Beatles songs and their characters, from a fan. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02.html#a204616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

By nice I mean: 1. It covers all the functionality of the original. 2. The code is clearly written, not obfuscated, easy to build on. No amazing JS tricks, just straight boring code. I'd like to add a simple back-end, to automatically save your history, publish an RSS feed. Easily integratable into a community. Back-end is open source Node app. I'll just operate a server a few Wordler friends. A labor of love like the original app.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02.html#a181023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202523"></a>When you call 1-800-MYAPPLE, an intelligent robot answers the phone, introduces itself as as such and kept sending me to tech support when I had a customer service problem, and said so clearly in short phrases. I am trained at talking to Alexa, Siri and my Tesla, I know how to give them commands. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02/202512.html?title=applesBoastfulRobot#a202523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202609"></a>Then, on my way back to tech support, it asked me to identify myself, but didn't say what info it wanted. It paused and in a stern voice said I had not answered the question in enough time.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02/202512.html?title=applesBoastfulRobot#a202609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202651"></a>And then it connected me to customer service to talk to a human.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02/202512.html?title=applesBoastfulRobot#a202651" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202706"></a>To their credit, the human I spoke with was apologetic.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02/202512.html?title=applesBoastfulRobot#a202706" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a202744"></a>I also tried using their text chat service, it was worse. It repeatedly told me to use the self-help system. Why offer a chat service if you're just going to tell me to use the self-help system? (Interestingly the self-help system gave me information I did not have.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/02/202512.html?title=applesBoastfulRobot#a202744" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
