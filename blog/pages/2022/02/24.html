Don't forget that context. That's where Putin has fun. He can screw with our political system, but it appears we have no power in the other direction. We can't give him a problem at home.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/24.html#a174839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170222"></a>I haven't seen an outline overwritten in a long time. That was the big problem with the new tabs system in Drummer, contexts would get swapped incorrectly, and one outline would replace another. It's a hard problem to get data on, bug reports invariably are vague. You can't see the problem happen, the user typically doesn't see the problem until long afer the mistake was made.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/24/170155.html?title=drummerStatusReport#a170222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I was led to a problem in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/150">this thread</a>, on Jan 8, with steps to reproduce an outline overwrite. When I traced the problem to its source and fixed it, it occurred to me that this mis-coding could be the source of the remaining overwrites we were seeing. I didn't say that in the thread, but I did say it in a private conversation with Scott Hanson. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/02/24/170155.html?title=drummerStatusReport#a170414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
