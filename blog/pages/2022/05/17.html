<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164904"></a>Today I wrote a Node app that reads an OPML subscription list, loops over all the feeds and only passes on the ones that are reachable and parseable. Yes, I plan to share the code, because it's useful and also good example code for reading and writing lists, and reading feeds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17.html#a164904" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164703"></a>One of the coolest things about the web is that people do tutorials with videos showing how they do things like install a new antenna on your roof, or put together an Adirondack chair. When people bad mouth the web, they forget about miracles like that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17.html#a164703" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171003"></a>A thread from Twitter converted to a post. Someday I'm going to have to write a script to do this automatically.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a171003" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170647"></a>If Twitter had a Steve Jobs type leader he'd come up with a brilliant idea, akin to noise-cancelling headphones (and call it that), and explain how satisfying it can be to tell the trolls to shut the fuck up. Ahhhh nice and quiet. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170704"></a>I used to live on noisy streets in Palo Alto and Berkeley. I moved to NYC, even worse (I lived in the West Village, then the East Village) until I moved uptown and then ahhh nice and quiet. Moved to the mountains, even better! There's something to be said for a little peace. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170704" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170747"></a>Here's how I made my twtr quiet. At the first sign of trollish behavior, I mute or block. Works great. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170747" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170813"></a>The trollish behavior is basically anyone who wants to argue with you. People who say unfair things and you want to point out how unfair they are. If you find yourself protesting, the chances you're communicating with a troll approach 100 percent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170828"></a>To determine if the person conversing with you is a troll, look at your own feelings. If you feel they misunderstand you and want to correct them -- it's a troll. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170828" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170836"></a>We've learned so much about trolls. Trolls aren't nearly as frustrating as newbies who refuse to turn them off and insist on setting them straight <i>for all to see. </i>Ohhh, that's exactly what they want. It's like having a cat who brings home dead birds. I'm sure the cat meant well, but..<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170836" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170857"></a>And btw, in 2022, the entire Republican Party platform is trolling. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170857" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170932"></a>Whoever runs Twitter needs the sass of Steve Jobs with his incredible ability to make simple ideas simple. Noise-cancelling headphones for Twitter. Instead of focusing on trying to diminish the brightness of the sun, give everyone sunglasses. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170932" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170952"></a>A Lib is someone who thinks Repubs want to know why they're wrong. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170955"></a>One of the coolest things about the web is that people do tutorials with videos showing how they do things like install a new antenna on your roof, or put together an Adirondack chair. When people bad mouth the web, they forget about miracles like that. That said, there must be videos that demo how to shut down the trolls yourself.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/17/170641.html?title=makingTwitterQuieter#a170955" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
