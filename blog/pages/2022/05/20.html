<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a004540"></a>One my favorite things to tweet is that <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1527786609491464192">there are No Nets fans</a>, and wait for a Nets fan to show up and flame me. It never happens. I think even the Clippers must have some fans in NYC, or the Expos, but I can honestly say I've never met a Nets fan. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20.html#a004540" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Collins plays on our assumption that grandmothers who appear kindly are more likely to be fooled than shifty. She milks that for all it's worth. Obviously if someone rises to her level of the Republican Party, a multi-term senator from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states">blue state</a>, her reliable vote for Republican atrocities gets her a lot of deference, and we know it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20.html#a142709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133202"></a>One of the most important principles in programming is that you want to expose problems in code when you're working on it. The more time between when you did the work and when you find the problem, the more impossible it's going to be to implement a good fix. It's analogous to finding a flaw in the design of something buried under the foundation of a skyscraper, long after the whole building has been constructed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20.html#a133202" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was written in 2017. The fix required raising the structure and building in another layer below a previously middle layer of the onion, <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=rule%201&collection=scriptingnews">without breaking</a> anything. The job got done, but it was incredibly stressful. Required the moral support of a few users spread all over the world (that was the nature of the problem). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20.html#a003601" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133725"></a>I'm seeing this principle today because I'm adapting an app I wrote in 2020 to a new environment. I'm getting to fix problems in this code that would have been very difficult to fix if I weren't doing a complete from-the-ground-up rebuild. And there are no users of this stuff, so no compatibility to preserve. It's one of the reasons that an app doesn't really get done right until you fully implement it for the third or fourth time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20.html#a133725" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a184949"></a>Musk sent his acquisition offer to Twitter on <a href="https://qz.com/2167563/an-annotated-history-of-elon-musk-buying-twitter/">April 13</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20/184938.html?title=isThisWhyMuskGotColdFeet#a184949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a185039"></a>On that day <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%24tsla">Tesla stock</a> was trading at $1022.37 per share.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20/184938.html?title=isThisWhyMuskGotColdFeet#a185039" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a185130"></a>Today Tesla is selling for $645. That's about a 37% drop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20/184938.html?title=isThisWhyMuskGotColdFeet#a185130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a185252"></a>I don't know for sure, but I'd guess that Musk and his partners are all borrowing to buy Twitter. They certainly don't want to sell stock to raise the money to buy Twitter because that would be a taxable event. And if you take out a loan with your stock as collateral, you don't have to sell the stock, so -- no taxes. It's how rich people buy things. Even not-so-rich people do it. A moderately wealthy person who could afford to pay cash for a house, probably would just take out a loan, to avoid paying taxes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20/184938.html?title=isThisWhyMuskGotColdFeet#a185252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a190443"></a>But the huge drop in Tesla stock, and whatever stocks Larry Ellison is borrowing against to raise the money for his part of the deal, means that the bankers who are lending against that stock as collateral will want more stock. No problem you say, they all have lots of stock. But maybe he's already used that stock as collateral on other loans? Who knows how much of a stretch this is for Musk. He might not have enough stock to do the deal now. But he signed the deal, so.. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20/184938.html?title=isThisWhyMuskGotColdFeet#a190443" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a185457"></a>Musk and his partners are squeezed in a hard-to-have-foreseen way. The deal has become more expensive and harder to do. And maybe the market "correction" isn't done yet. Maybe Tesla will be worth half what it was, or less?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/20/184938.html?title=isThisWhyMuskGotColdFeet#a185457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a185653"></a>Unless the market and $TSLA recover quickly this downturn is hitting Musk a lot harder than it would have if he had not done the Twitter deal.
