In any case, this is a <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1531348351291113476">real low point</a> for Dorsey.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a195152"></a>In April 2014, I spent a month developing glue that would connect my browser-based apps to Twitter. I figured it would take a month to do the same with Facebook, but it took a couple of days because they had done all the work I had to do myself for Twitter. The idea is to factor out the things every app has to do and distribute it as JS code they can call when their app boots up. You don't even have to load the code yourself, it takes care of that too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/31/195048.html?title=twitterApiCouldBeBetter#a195152" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
