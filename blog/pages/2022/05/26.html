<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150435"></a>We like sports because they last beyond one person's lifetime. We don't bring our disagreements to ballgames (at least not amongst fans of the same team). We can hate the owner of the our team (and we do) but we know that no one really owns a team. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/26.html#a150435" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145303"></a>The mass shootings are a TV show we've all watched to the point where we're all prepared to be actors in the pageant if the show comes to our town. There was actually a report on this phenomenon on NPR when the Virginia Tech rampage happened. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/26.html#a145303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141816"></a>My adverse reaction to the second Covid booster (I assume, I had three vaccinations on Tuesday) got even worse yesterday. And the pain from the shots in both arms made it hard to sleep. But last night was much better. Hopefully I'll be able to get some programming done today, to get back on track with the current project.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/26.html#a141816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141252"></a>Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/25.html#a161417">wrote</a> that I am irony-deficient. It's kind of a joke, but it's also the truth, as all good jokes are. You could say something ridiculous, intending it to be humorous, but I won't get it. I take things at face value. That's why I find April Fools so disturbing. But if you do it a lot I'll be tuned in, and you'll never get me again. I think it's a good thing to be irony-deficient btw. The universe is amazing and amazing things actually happen all the time. Being ID just means you have an open mind. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/26.html#a141252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He was an inventive guy, so he built a windmill and water tower. They grew stuff, but when they got sick or traveled they rejoined the rest of us as part of the establishment. They smoked Marlboros, paid for those with money they made doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macram%C3%A9">macramÃ©</a> and sold to hippy dippy head shops through a distributor -- very establishment if you ask me. Turns out even if you're ready to make a full commitment to living an alternate lifestyle, it's basically impossible. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/26/205456.html?title=youAreTheEstablishment#a205615" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Stopping this juggernaut of civilization is something even the richest megabillionaire sad to say can't influence very much. We all die. We are all living beyond our means from a survival standpoint. And there is nothing any of us can do about it. That's why my younger friend was saying something idiotic. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/26/205456.html?title=youAreTheEstablishment#a205804" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
