Replicating the functionality of a system that’s huge in complexity and scale while changing its underlying design, think about any other field, imagine rebuilding the NYC subway in a year or two with one of the basic constraints changed. People expect miracles of software mostly because they don’t understand how it’s made but it’s pretty much like everything else, if it took a long time to make it the first time it’s going to take almost as much time the second and that’s assuming you’re cloning it."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/04/233047.html?title=chattingAboutBlueskyOnTwitter#a233146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

There's a big comment the top of each major routine, it’s like a blog, with reverse chronologic notes about each major change. At the end of the list in the first comment is an explanation of what it does, params, etc. And since it’s in an outliner, it’s all collapsed until you need to read it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/04/133606.html?title=outlinersAndBigCodeComments#a133814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135911"></a>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/listings/oldschool.html">read-only outline</a> listing of oldschool.js, the CMS that renders this blog. If you scroll down to <i>publishBlog</i> and expand it, you'll see a Changes sub-outline. Expand it to see the changes, and under each change are notes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/04/133606.html?title=outlinersAndBigCodeComments#a135911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140007"></a>This format goes all the way back to the 90s believe it or not when we started coding in an outliner in Frontier. It's the way to organize internal docs. And yes they are absolutely necessary if you plan to maintain and build on the code. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/04/133606.html?title=outlinersAndBigCodeComments#a140007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
