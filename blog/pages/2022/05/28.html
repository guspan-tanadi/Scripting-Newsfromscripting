	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170142"></a>But MORE was made in the 1980s on machines that had limited memory, storage and networking.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165257"></a>It's part of a top-to-bottom review of the feed ecosystem, almost 20 years after <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a165257" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162958"></a>So here's where we're at in 2022: <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a162958" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-isComment="false" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164057"></a>Feeds still work, that's the good news. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a164057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164105"></a>The bad news is that feeds have same junk in them as web pages. Spyware. Advertising. Stuff that's meant to call your attention to their stuff, and take it away from the other stuff. The problem is this -- as a reader I want these things to calm down and just let me skim, to decide what I want to read. That's the design, that's how feeds were meant to work, imho. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a164105" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163057"></a>So the question is what to do about the noise? Here's the plan. As with all my previous aggregators, I'm stripping the markup to provide a quiet reading environment. But I'm putting back the features I want, linking, bold and italic, by allowing the feed to provide the Markdown source of the post. If it's present, we'll use that to render the item in the reader, not the <i>description</i> element. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a163057" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a031051"></a>Here's an <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/85d4404b90b7bca59a24d77f0266acfe">example</a> of a feed item that include the source of the post in Markdown.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a031051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163715"></a>That's it. I think an elegant solution. One of the nice things about Markdown is it lets through the stuff we want, and doesn't let through the stuff we don't. Right? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üöÄ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a163715" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163832"></a>Basically the feeds can keep doing what they want, no problem -- but we'll just take the text. And if they want to add a link that we'll see, they can use Markdown. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/28/161438.html?title=cleaningUpTheFeeds#a163832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
