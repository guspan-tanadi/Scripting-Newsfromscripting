<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/30/quickley.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143940"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/30/quickley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One of many things that's great about the pairing of the Celtics and Warriors in the NBA Finals is that they're not the Lakers and the Nets. Both teams grew their own talent, formed teams in an artful way and patiently developed  their players until they found the right formula and nurtured it along. I also like that they have welcomed back Al Horford and Andre Iguodala, two heros of previous Celtics and Warriors campaigns. Not only is this a good way to build a winning team, but it also feels right to the fans. I don't want my teams' geography and legacy used, as if it were an airline, meant to take a couple of superstars somewhere, to host them -- but I see, all fans really -- a family, with generations coming and going, and a continuity all the way back to the beginning. I esp like that the Celtics <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hunterfelt/2022/04/21/why-boston-celtics-fans-will-never-forgive-kyrie-irving/">shook off</a> one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger">carpetbaggers</a> on their way to the Finals. The Knicks are my team, but I can appreciate other teams, learn from them, imagine what it would be like to be a Warriors or Celtics fan, and appreciate basketball well-done, which I hope to see in the Finals which start on Thursday. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/30.html#a143940" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222600"></a>I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Leader">Bread Alone</a> bread. I ate it even when I lived in Manhattan, it was the best bread <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/products/brands/bread-alone">in the Whole Foods</a> that was near where I lived. They had lots of brands. I tried them all, and Bread Alone was the brand I stuck with. It's really good. If you get a chance, try it out. I don't own any stock in the company, I'm just a <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=bread%20alone&collection=scriptingnews">satisfied customer</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/30/222455.html?title=iBreadAlone#a222600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222649"></a>Anyway the visit was eye-opening, so I wrote it up and posted it in a private group on Facebook.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/30/222455.html?title=iBreadAlone#a222649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222737"></a>I can't show you what people said, it's a private group. But most people were very nice and realized it wasn't a speech, and I wasn't saying the well-dressed yuppies don't belong where a Mountain Man such as myself, dressed and bearded as a Mountain Man might be, among all their fine Manhattan clothes, manners and youth. I wasn't saying they don't belong there, if anything I felt in that moment as if <i>I</i> don't belong! Yet a few people thought I was saying they should go away and that was what the (at times heated) conversation was about. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/30/222455.html?title=iBreadAlone#a222737" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222925"></a>It's always been thus. Ever since I ran my own BBS on an Apple II in the living room of my Menlo Park, CA apartment in 1981, online groups that give everyone an equal voice devolve into bullshit. It's just a matter of time. Always happens.
