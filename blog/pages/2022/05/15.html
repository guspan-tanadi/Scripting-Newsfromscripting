<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173620"></a>I've noticed my Spectrum bill inches up a few dollars every month. Not enough to make a stink about but it adds up. I have <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=StarLink&collection=scriptingnews">StarLink</a> now, but haven't mounted the antenna well enough to get good connections, so I can't turn off Spectrum, yet. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/15.html#a173620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The two games mean different things, to me at least. Either way, in the first game, one very deserving team will move forward and another very deserving team will go home. The other game will determine if future <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_players_in_the_Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul">Chris Paul</a> will get another shot at the championship, or if he's forever banished to being a great player who never got there. You get a sense this, at age 37, is his last shot. There's no shame in that, he has lots of company.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/15.html#a171621" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
