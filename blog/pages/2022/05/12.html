<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165701"></a>Think of all the places you write and read. Why shouldn't all of them understand RSS, and in and out, where ever possible?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12.html#a165701" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163145"></a>Twitter is like AT&T was in the 70s. Imagine trying to use the telephone in 1978 but you couldn't access AT&T's network. That's the role of Twitter in 2022.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12.html#a163145" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Because this is what the web of 2022 is. It's basically a lot of tweets and blog posts. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12.html#a145345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141110"></a>TL;DR -- there's a new <i>expandIncludes</i> function in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage#v0424----51122-by-dw">OPML package</a> for JavaScript.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a141110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134127"></a>As you know I'm working on a refresh of all the stuff I have related to <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a>, and part of that is the use of <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> for subscription lists. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a134127" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134255"></a>A <a href="http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">subscription list</a> is an outline containing nodes of type <i>rss</i> that have an <i>xmlUrl</i> attribute that points to a feed. Even though the type is rss, it can be used to point to feeds in any format, including Atom and RDF. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a134255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134355"></a>The lists can contain anything else you like, feeds, docs, and they can include other subscription lists. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a134355" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140613"></a>Example: You could maintain a list of people you follow and plug that into your reader's subscription list, and also offer it to friends, where they could include it in their list. And because you're using pointers, when your list updates, your friends are automatically updated. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a140613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135533"></a>To include a list in another, just insert a node of type <i>include, </i>with a <i>url</i> attribute that points to another OPML file which should include nodes of type <i>rss</i> and possibly other <i>include</i> nodes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a135533" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134528"></a>They work like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_directive#C/C++">includes in C</a>, which is where the name came from. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a134528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134648"></a>Anyway, the new thing is that the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml">OPML package</a> now has an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/opmlpackage.js#L322">expandIncludes</a> function that can be given an outline, in a JavaScript object, and it returns an outline with all the include nodes expanded. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a134648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134736"></a>I've had code that does this for decades in various environments. It's trivial in a language like C, Python, or Frontier -- any rational language that takes care of I/O under the hood, but it's a difficult problem in a language like JavaScript where you have to manage your own synchronization. This code first appeared in 2014 as part of PagePark, then moved to the daveopml package, and finally, today into the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml">opml package</a>. This is where it belongs, where everyone else can easily get to it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a134736" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135018"></a>The new version, 0.4.24 is <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage">on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml">in NPM</a>. There's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage#v0424----51122-by-dw">release note</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/tree/main/examples/includes">example code</a> with an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/examples/includes/includes.opml">OPML file</a> that illustrates. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/12/134211.html?title=opmlPackageUpdate#a135018" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
