<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151929"></a>Yesterday I wrote about a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js">utility</a> that takes an OPML list of RSS feeds and validates them. Only feeds that can be read and are parseable are added to the OPML file it creates. It's what I use to clean up old lists before putting them in a database. I can see from where I'm going next that I won't be swinging back this way for a bit, so I thought it was better to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js">point</a> to it now, in case people could use it. Important: It's a programmer's utility and meant to be example code. You have to be a JavaScript programmer to use it. If you have questions, post a comment in this <a href="https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/issues/1">issue thread</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18.html#a151929" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Lots of people asked what it was, and where could they get one. Since then I've bought speakers from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">JBL</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">Tribit</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFV59PY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">Ultimate Ears</a>, and others. None of them cost more than $100. My favorite so far is the Tribit, it's tiny, has a huge sound, and it's got a great feel in the hand.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131118" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132323"></a>Then the other day I figured out what I wanted for summer outdoor lounging -- a battery-powered speaker that had Alexa built in. So I did a little shopping, found there aren't many, and they're all really expensive. I asked for advice <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1524533392901083136">on Twitter</a>, and decided to blow some money, ordering a $400 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFKBQ3K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">Bose speaker</a>. The reviews were stunning. I had a hard time imagining how the sound could be that great, compared to how great the much cheaper models were, but I had to find out. They offered free returns. So all I was risking was a little time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a132323" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131132"></a>Here's the top line. It was a huge disappointment in every way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131147"></a>I had to download their app just to turn it on, and then I had to create an account on their service. I also had to check off their agreement, which of course I didn't read. So right off the bat, before it even says anything to me, I hate it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131147" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131235"></a>Then it takes ten minutes to download the updated system software. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131235" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131245"></a>To use Alexa, I had to go through another signon process which required me to remember the password I used for their system, which very luckily I did (I didn't try, I never plan on using that service again). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131337"></a>Okay now finally, I say "Alexa WNYC," our local NPR station. Nothing happens. Then the speaker upstairs starts playing WNYC. I yell ALEXA STOP upstairs. No good. So I go upstairs and tell it again to stop, and again it doesn't. So I pull the plug. Then I hear the Alexa in the bedroom is doing the same thing. I go in there and pull the plug. Go back downstairs. The Bose speaker is doing nothing. Okay I take a deep breath and try it again. "Alexa WNYC." Exactly the same thing happens. So I go upstairs again, pull the plugs on the speakers, this time, leave them unplugged, go back downstairs and try again. "Alexa WNYC." Nothing. I figure I'll try it again later.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131337" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131619"></a>I'm not done with the flaws of the product, but I want to pause here for a moment. I'm accustomed to setting up Alexas by plugging them in, waiting a few seconds while it boots up, then it looks around and somehow finds one of the other Alexas and asks if it's okay if it uses the data on it to configure this one. I always smile at this point, man that's good design, and I say YES of course, and in a few seconds I'm listening to NPR. The process involves no work beyond plugging it in and giving my consent. I imagine it needs to download updated system software, but wisely waits until late at night to do it. Why make the human wait while the robot does its housekeeping?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131619" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131824"></a>Okay the next day I figure enough with Alexa, let's see how this is as a speaker. So I press the Bluetooth button on top of the speaker, and I connect my iPhone in the normal way for Bluetooth. Then I play an old McCartney song. It sounds like any of the other speakers I have. I hit pause and start playing another song, and it never plays. I hit pause and play again, and it plays for a few seconds then freezes. I repeat the pause-play thing again and again, that's it -- it never plays another bit of music. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131824" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132043"></a>Conclusion: This is a piece of shit product. Maybe the Alexa problems are really Amazon problems, but if so, I can't believe they shipped the thing in this condition. But Bluetooth is mature technology. I've never had a problem with Bluetooth on any of the other speakers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a132043" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132132"></a>And there's no way this product is worth $400. Even if it worked it wouldn't be worth any more than $100, and probably a lot less because the idea is this is supposed to be a portable product and it's much less portable than the $43 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1">Tribit</a>, and honestly -- if it sounds better, I couldn't tell the difference. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a132132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
