<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/21/tesla.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a181200"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/21/tesla.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">All of Musk's Trumpy bullshit comes at a time when a flood of competition is coming for Tesla and it looks like they're copying the basic design. This is giving them a chance to rip out a lot of old crap, and turn their cars into computers with big batteries and wheels. I think Tesla has a huge problem in front of them, no Carplay or Android Auto support, therefore <a href="https://scripting.com/2021/12/03/141929.html">no app ecosystem</a>. There are a few apps that I miss not having on my Tesla that I can use on my Subaru (which I never drive because I love the Tesla so much). So Musk is playing Trump. How stupid and dull. I thought he was smart. I thought I was being smart buy buying his product. Ech. What a <i>stupid</i> waste of energy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/22.html#a181200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
