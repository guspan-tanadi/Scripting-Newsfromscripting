Ask Ukraine about that. Their first impulse was to let their equivalent of Fox News continue to poison them in the name of free speech. Ultimately they realized what Twitter did, freedom only goes so far. Countries can have free speech in their Constitution, but that's not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact">suicide pact</a>. The root of our problem is Fox. Every day they weaken us. It's time to say enough. Let Tucker Carlson find a new way to spread his poison.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/27.html#a152921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150629"></a>Whenever a pundit criticizes Biden on TV, an angry voice in my head asks: Compared to what?
