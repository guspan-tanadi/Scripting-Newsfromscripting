<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/21/beetle.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164137"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/21/beetle.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm doing more work on feed reading, and realize the problem has never been with my feed reading software, rather it's the mess that was created around feed reading with the lack of working-together among the vendors. I've written about this <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/18.html#a161837">before</a>. As I go deeper into this project, I'm becoming more resolved that I'm only going to support a subset of feeds. What will come out of it will not be a feed reader in the sense that people think of them for the last 20 or so years. They all try to read everything, and that makes it hard to go beyond the intersection of features found in all feeds. I don't see any point in producing yet another one of those. If people producing blogging software want to give this another shot, they should be ready to retool, a bit. Not very much. Maybe not at all (if you've been considerate in your feeds). And not breaking anything. This is absolute. I will not break anyone either with feeds I produce (I write a popular blog and make blogging software.) Which is a bit tricky because there are important features in my feeds that most readers don't support thanks to <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html">Google</a>. This is how everything got broken. I want to go back to before this all became such a mess, and slowly and carefully pull through something beautifully simple and easy to work with. And then go from there. Not leaving the past behind, but also not being limited by it. It's possible. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/21.html#a164137" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155648"></a>Joe, I think this would be an incredible political cause to raise a fuss about. Focus the spotlight on how we're subsidizing Fox. I think that law, whatever it is that makes this possible or necessary, needs to be changed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/21/155531.html?title=ifMoneyIsSpeech#a155648" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155723"></a>It's as fundamental as the First Amendment. I should not be required to fund speech that I find abhorrent. The Supreme Court ruled that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">money is speech</a>. Let's get some lawyers working on this! Make news. It's the kind of issue Repubs raise huge money on. And it pisses me off that my money goes to fund the destruction of our political system. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/21/155531.html?title=ifMoneyIsSpeech#a155723" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
