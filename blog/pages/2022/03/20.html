<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a223005"></a>Something I learned from reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811">Elie Mystal's book</a>. The Second Amendment’s original <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-slave-owners-dictated-the-language-of-the-2nd-amendment">purpose</a> was to enable slavers in Virginia to put down a slave rebellion without depending on the federal government. It wasn't put in the Constitution so people could protect themselves against robbers, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and if appropriate there could be laws that allow it specifically. But it isn't really a Constitutional right. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/20.html#a223005" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's free to play, as far as I know (I have a NYT subscription so if it weren't free it's possible I might not know). The diagram to the right is a standard, produced by the game. It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/20/142153.html?title=aWordleHack#a144423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142256"></a>Suppose you know the second and third letters, as above, and have eliminated a fair number of consonants, and are sure the first letter is a consonant…<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/20/142153.html?title=aWordleHack#a142256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142313"></a>Type one of the eligable consonants and the next two letters into a web browser and check out the auto completes. Repeat. That's how I figured out the answer to today's puzzle after I got to the situation in the third line. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/20/142153.html?title=aWordleHack#a142313" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142355"></a>I'm pretty consistently getting the answer in four steps. In the first two steps I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just gathering data. By the third, I constrain my guess by the information I've gathered so far, assuming I've got one or two hits.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/20/142153.html?title=aWordleHack#a142355" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142456"></a>In this case I got two green squares on the first one. I thought for sure I'd get the answer in three instead of four, but I hadn't eliminated enough consonants to be able to puzzle it out. I was surprised by how hard it was after step three, mostly because (I think) this was a weird word, letter-wise. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/20/142153.html?title=aWordleHack#a142456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
