My response: Amen. I think that should be in the Constitution. Sort of the inverse of the First Amendment. No one should be forced to support speech they find unsupportable. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11.html#a171631" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They think it'll give him a new platform, a new cause. He'll fundraise like crazy. Something to campaign on in November and in 2024. But I see a silver lining. Let him campaign in 2022, and make the issue about whether the US wants to go where Russia is. Do we want a Putinite running the US? If so, vote for Trump. Let's have an election about what it's really about for a change. Straight out, do you want to be ruled by an autocrat or do you want to keep trying to have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution#To_form_a_more_perfect_Union">more perfect union</a>? I think a very compelling campaign could be had. And if, in the end, the people want to be ruled by an autocrat, then that's where we're going next. I don't think it'll last very long, when Americans find out what it really means. There's a good chance it all falls apart when the Supreme Court overturns Roe.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11.html#a141137" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160750"></a><a href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/">Worldle</a> is the less famous of the two. It displays a map of a country at the top of the screen. As with Wordle you guess what the country is in a stack of six boxes. It tells you how close you are for each guess, what direction the correct country is in and a percentage representing how close you got, 100 percent is perfect, the furthest you can be is 50 (I assume). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a160750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/todaysCountry.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163250"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/todaysCountry.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">There's a lot of info you don't get, most important is the scale of the map. It could be 1000 miles or 3 miles wide. There are a lot of countries that are islands in the Pacific, Carribbean or Indian oceans. They have unique shapes just like the bigger countries. Although I think I have a good grasp of geography from having loved maps as a kid, there a lot more countries than I ever realized. For example, get out a <a href="https://geology.com/world/cia-africa-map.shtml">map of Africa</a> sometime and ponder. The names may be familiar, but I had little sense of relative position or the shape of most of them. It's also fun to try to figure out where the ocean is based on the shape of the borders. There are no straight edge shorelines as far as I know. Some of the puzzles are easy, like Indonesia or Poland, and some are surprisingly difficult, like Greece. Did you know there's an island country in the English Channel? I didn't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a163250" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162843"></a>Spoiler! Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/worldlerSolution.png">screen shot</a> of today's puzzle, I just guessed wildly in the last slot, knowing Spain was wrong. I basically gave up.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a162843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I was lucky, my strategy made it possible to solve this puzzle, though in general I get lower scores overall because of the way I do it. For the first two or three guesses, I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just trying to find out which vowels are in the answer, and to eliminate most of the popular consonants. So in today's puzzle when I had two slots left, I had the last four letters right (as did most people) but unlike the others, I only had two possible choices left for the first letter. I guessed incorrectly first, and then got the correct answer in the sixth slot. Wordle's comment was <i>whew.</i> Indeed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a161259" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
