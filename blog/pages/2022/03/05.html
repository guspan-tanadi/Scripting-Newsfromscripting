<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170242"></a>Journalism is self-governing. Responsible to no one but itself. Journalism is its own journalism, and not surprisingly that means no journalism. Imagine any other industry or organization that could make sure it never got bad press. That is the problem with journalism.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05.html#a170242" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

People thought we were being too idealistic when it was said that a benefit of syndication is that it helps route around censorship. Now in 2022, that's a very real thing. Such an inexpensive insurance policy to help make sure the news gets out.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05.html#a145534" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144110"></a>I've read your whole thread, and agree -- it's confusing because norms are being busted now, norms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">nuclear deterrent</a> that has been present for all our lives. Putin went first. A nuclear superpower, which Russia is (which until now most seem to have overlooked), is not supposed to provoke another nuclear superpower so blatantly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#a144110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145343"></a>Putin's complaint is he isn't getting the respect a nuclear superpower is entitled to. The expansion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> into the former Warsaw Pact was insult #1, but that wasn't enough, NATO then added former states of the USSR. And that wasn't enough, the US promised to add Ukraine to NATO, as I understand it that was one of the final acts of the Bush II presidency, no one noticed here because we were obsessed with the financial collapse of 2008. This happened in a NATO meeting in Bucharest. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#a145343" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151100"></a>But I think the US and NATO sitting out the war in Ukraine is probably the right thing to do, because either way Ukraine is destroyed, and we're giving up a chance for politics in Russia to stop the next more provocative steps, if we were to intercede before Ukraine is settled. The sanctions will hurt, and I bet the Russians who care know what a debacle this has turned to. Why not take the chance that could work? If we go into the war in Ukraine, the war all of a sudden isn't the war with Ukraine, it's a war with the West. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#a151100" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Also I have a dream however unrealistic that Ukraine will defeat Russia, and then cross the border into Russia and take a few towns and maybe destroy them just to send a message to the Russian people that Putin is bullshit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
