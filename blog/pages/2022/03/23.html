<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a015941"></a>When I signed on Twitter earlier this evening I was offered a chance to create a community, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506783411016450048">so I did</a>. Not sure how to use this.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152911"></a>Here's a wild idea. If Ukraine needs money and I bet they do, how about selling honorary Ukraine citizenships. Let us all sign up on their side, not just our political leaders. Maybe there are creative ways millions of people could help save Ukraine.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/23.html#a152911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So if I want to watch the Knicks and the Mets, I also have to pay for Fox News. It took me a long time to figure that out. But in the end that's how it works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/23.html#a141249" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135844"></a>Suppose someone you have invited into your house goes through your private stuff. Reads your diary, your financial records, calendar, contacts list. Looks in your medicine cabinet, your collection of drugs, legal and illegal, sex toys.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135800"></a>Should you be prevented from writing a tweet or a blog post about how it felt to be violated that way? Would it be fair to rebut the post by talking about the Constitution? Can you imagine someone actually doing that? (I can't, it would seem pretty cruel.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/23/135414.html?title=aPhilosophicalQuestion#a135800" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135929"></a>In this situation, with the question posed this way, it's ridiculous to think someone would be condemned for expressing their thoughts and feelings about being so violated. Note that I didn't say their rights were violated, in any legal sense. But their rights were violated in some sense.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/23/135414.html?title=aPhilosophicalQuestion#a135929" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
