I can't tell you why without spoiling it. But it is so powerful. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28.html#a154045" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143637"></a>That's the uneasy feeling that somehow the public discussion is missing the big picture. There's something that should be factored into every story but is being ignored. We're under Putin's thumb. Ukraine might be a mistake, or a distraction. But it's still true that the odds favor the Repubs, Putin's party, taking over everything by 2024. I can't imagine Putin thinking that the prize is Ukraine. The prize is the US Treasury.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/143552.html?title=underPutinsThumb#a143637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>There's a scene where Smith and his daughters are on a tennis court in Compton, all of his daughters, not just Venus and Serena. There are a bunch of asshole teenage boys nearby who are hassling one of his daughters who's trying to study. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/142743.html?title=kingWillSmith#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>After they're done practicing, Smith confronts the boys. They beat him up. He does nothing to respond, he just takes it (like Chris Rock last night).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/142743.html?title=kingWillSmith#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Later in the movie he's bullied by an agent and his response is to fart out loud at him (which I like, it's aggressive but nonviolent). The agent definitely had it coming.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/142743.html?title=kingWillSmith#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Later, the character tells Venus a story about him getting beat up as a kid, and his father was nearby and did nothing to help him.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/142743.html?title=kingWillSmith#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>The speech Smith gave in accepting his award could have been the speech the character in the movie would have made. About protecting people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/142743.html?title=kingWillSmith#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>It's odd how closely the events last night track the ones in the movie, but opposite. What the character did is hard. The character did it right. The actor was confused, life is not a movie, and he got it wrong.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/28/142743.html?title=kingWillSmith#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
