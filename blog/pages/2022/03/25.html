<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173644"></a>When I finish a programming session, the top note in my outline is always how I'm going to start the next session. Otherwise I get the "staring at a blank sheet of paper" thing. My judgement on the next thing is much better at the end than at the beginning of a session. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/25.html#a173644" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155151"></a>Wouldn't it be cool if we had a channel that could speak directly to the Russian people to tell them that many of us in the US are of Russian descent, we celebrate the culture, but we can't have you guys invading sovereign countries, and that's our main problem with Russia. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/25.html#a155151" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162150"></a>When we got to the bottom of why people hated us for hosting their blogs for free it was this. They thought that if they did a blog, people would listen to them. They thought we were promising that. We weren't, we had no illusions about that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/25.html#a162150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a212939"></a>I gotta say the <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tesla&collection=scriptingnews">Tesla</a> grows on you. I love driving it places. I'm using the driving assist more and more. Still keeping my eyes on it to be sure it's not driving off the road. But I really enjoy driving in a way I haven't in a long time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/25.html#a212939" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174442"></a>The idea that software is a process was the big idea in <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html">We Make Shitty Software</a> in September 1995.   Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/25/shittyQuote.png">screen shot</a> of the relevant portion. I got a lot of shit from devs who said they don't make shitty software, but in fact, they do. All devs do. Those that don't know they do don't know to set up a process that accounts for the shittiness of their software. A corollary -- some of the shittiest software is made by devs who think their software <i>isn't</i> shitty.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/25.html#a174442" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
