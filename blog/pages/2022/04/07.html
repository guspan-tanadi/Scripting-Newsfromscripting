We need interop for writers. For people to be able to use great writing tools and to publish to all the open networks, the ones with APIs. I want WordPress to be a peer of Twitter's. I want my blogging tool to work with it too, so that any document I can produce can flow through Twitter too. We're tantalizingly close to that. Twitter's leadership would be very important.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/07.html#a203216" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
