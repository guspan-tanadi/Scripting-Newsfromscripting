What I want is to be connected to smart people who want to work together to make cool things and solve important problems. That, emphatically, is <i>not</i> what Twitter is.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/27.html#a130033" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145604"></a>I love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)">McCartney album</a> even though at the time the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Contemporary_reviews">critics panned</a> it. It's a really interesting album because they're all Beatles songs. He wrote them to do with the Beatles. But they had already broken up. At the time no one knew. So he bought a tape deck and recorded them all on his own. He has a beautiful voice. And they're not big productions, though they would've been if they had been done by the Beatles. This is like blogging or punk rock, but it's McC. What's not to like? It's Paul McCartney man. Get over yourself. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/27.html#a145604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124659"></a>I want to add, I don't have anything against the Nets, I would probably be interested in them if they stopped trying to form superteams and win at all costs "this year."

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a124733"></a>I feel about the Nets the way Lakers fans probably feel about the Clippers. Sort of meh. Why do they even bother, for example.
