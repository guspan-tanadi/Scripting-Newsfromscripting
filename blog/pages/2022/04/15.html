<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/15/theEggman.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221205"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/15/theEggman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Like many fans of the Grateful Dead I thought Bertha was about a fan in the Dead office named Bertha, <a href="https://www.dead.net/features/greatest-stories-ever-told/greatest-stories-ever-told-bertha">but</a> it's the other way around, the fan was given the name of the song. On the other hand, the Beatles song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXawa90YU2s">Martha My Dear</a> <i>is</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_My_Dear">about</a> Paul McCartney's Old English Sheepdog <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=martha+mccartney">Martha</a>. Speaking of McCartney, I learned recently that he co-wrote the fantastic Elvis Costello song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-rF4COOd9c">Veronica</a>. It's definitely got the McCartney feel to it, another spin perhaps on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y">Eleanor Rigby</a>, which is <i>not</i> a good song to Peloton to, btw, imho. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/15.html#a221205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a222114"></a>I love all the Beatles songs, but get the most, these days, out of John Lennon's songs. I learned that Lennon only partially completed his songs, leaving a lot of the work to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">George Martin</a>. Keep that in mind when you listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10">I Am The Walrus</a> (my favorite Beatles song) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8">Strawberry Fields</a>, as examples. The orchestral bits are pure Martin. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/15.html#a222114" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221858"></a>I have the best <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&collection=scriptingnews">search engine</a> for a blog. I'm sure there's better search software out there, but no one else has the sheer quantity of blog-writing over so much time in a searchable index. There are bits missing here and there, and I'm determined to fill those bits in -- but the archive goes from October 7, 1994 at 11:27AM to the present day. A lot of stuff happened in that time, and some of it happened right <a href="http://scripting.com/">here</a>. I hope someday it proves to be a useful resource to people studying this period, with the usual caveat, assuming the human species survives. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/15.html#a221858" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220044"></a>Because the weather has been delightful here the last few days, I'm afraid I got no work done this week. I basically gave up today and spent time in the sun, reading, listening to music, went for a walk, did some shopping, took a long nap in the afternoon. I guess I was overdue for some downtime. It is a wonderful time of year, winter truly is over. We will still get some coldish weather, no doubt, but the glory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains">Catskills</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE">summer</a> is coming soon. It's the <i>best</i> place to be in the summer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/15.html#a220044" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And while my Knicks are not in contention this year, it does have the feel of an unusually good year. One reason it's so cool, no <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/04/06/lakers-eliminated-from-playoff-contention-suns-loss">LeBron James</a>! Hopefully at some point he'll stop trying to form superteams and finish his career with humility and grace, away from contention. I am rooting for teams with stars who have never won a championship, notably the Phoenix Suns and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul">Chris Paul</a>. I'm also glad to see the Warriors are back in the mix with the same big three and no Kevin Durant, who I will be rooting <i>against</i> every time he takes the court. I hope Boston blows the Nets out so that embarassment for the great city of New York is over for another year. Maybe they want him back in Oklahoma? I'm interested to see if James Harden can get it together to have a good long run, and while he has never won a championship, hmmm, I don't know. He played on the Nets this year, and for that reason I question his motivations. I do not like artificially created superteams designed to win championships. And of course they rarely do. So hopefully that chapter of the NBA will be over. One thing for sure <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/09/1363.html">sports is not arithmetic</a>, esp not basketball.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/15.html#a223515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
