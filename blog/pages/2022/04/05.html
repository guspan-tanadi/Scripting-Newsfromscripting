Why do they care so much? Such angst. His rockets work. I love the cars they make. Just ordered Skylink. There hasn't been a person since Steve Jobs who could get me to buy all their ideas. I respect that, even if you don't like him. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/05.html#a161245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134637"></a>I gave a talk at a class at CUNY yesterday and did an <a href="http://this.how/cunyClassNotes/">outline</a> beforehand. I didnâ€™t need to refer to it, because outlining it put the structure in my mind, and I could work from that as I lectured.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/05.html#a134637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

There's a fair amount of angst about this but he <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1511341423198670857">might</a> be really good for it. He's actually made software, himself -- and presumably knows how to write a bug report. And he uses the product. I don't imagine too many of the other board members at Twitter really use it. Leadership from users, what a concept.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/05.html#a135546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
