<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221751"></a>My guess is that every billionaire is going to try to compete with Musk, maybe some will join together. If you know how to write a TWTR get busy.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/26.html#a221751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a224144"></a>AWS should have, long ago, written a faceless TWTR clone, and let a million flowers bloom. As with many other things, I beat the drum ceaselessly for this, as far as I know they never heard me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/26.html#a224144" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a224206"></a>That's why it was interesting to see <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1518734031566778368">Jeff Bezos</a> poke Elon Musk  in the eye last night. That's exactly the kind of thing a competitor would say, and the fact that he said it so publicly, on TWTR, says he's going to do it. He wants to reserve the space in our minds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/26.html#a224206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a224222"></a>Another thought, making a federated twitter will be hard. No one knows how to do it. But I bet a lot of people know how to clone twitter. That's the way this will go. And we should make sure all these clones can peer with each other. I'm available to help with this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/26.html#a224222" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/26/quickley.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a121131"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/26/quickley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Last night the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/sports/basketball/nets-eliminated-celtics-sweep.html">Nets lost</a> and were <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/26/nets-got-it-all-wrong-and-paid-for-it-with-nba-playoff-flop/">eliminated</a>. The Nets might've fared better if at least some of NY's long-suffering Knicks fans were behind them. But this team has no idea what NY is, and our relationship with basketball, and our Knicks, who we love like family. It doesn't matter if KD thinks they're cool, and if you think that matters, <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518880919762919424">you can have</a> the Nets. But last night's crowd at Barclay were mostly pulling for the Celtics, and that's a shame. It tells you how much the owners of and players for the Nets have to learn about the city that they are supposedly playing for. And btw, forget about a cross-town rivalry. You might want to see if the arena y'all were using in NJ is still available. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/26.html#a121131" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a120119"></a>Why Musk bought Twitter: There’s tremendous value that does not show up on a balance sheet. He was smart enough to see it, gutsy enough to buy it, and had the means to do it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/26.html#a120119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a120251"></a>Twitter inherited the blogosphere, in a sense, and the chaos of the company hid the fact that it was owned, all that we put into it, we owned none of it.
