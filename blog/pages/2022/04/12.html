<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a031020"></a>I like the way all the <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=web3&collection=scriptingnews">Web3</a> people put .eth after their names on Twitter. I am <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/dave.rss.png">using .rss</a> because RSS is due for a bounce-back. It's got a strong foundation, and it has a simpler mission than the crypto folk -- simply, to get news to the people. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/12.html#a031020" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

As a user, once it's set up, you're just using wifi. I ordered it as a backup for my land-based net connection from Spectrum, which sometimes goes out where I live in the mountains in upstate NY. StarLink is made by <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>, which like Tesla, is a company run by Elon Musk. Anyway, I read how simple it was to set up, so I opened the box and put it together myself and it worked. These are my notes from the setup.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/163100.html?title=starlinkSetup#a025750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122141"></a>I'm looking for one or two service providers who are ready to offer users a choice of writing tools. To not force them to use <i>their</i> writing tools, their storage, and at best, offer a way to back up their writing. As a writer I want to use the tools I like best, and perhaps send them out through more than one channel. I don't want to be locked in, and forced to transcribe my writing for every possible service I might use.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/122139.html?title=whatIfWritersHadChoice#a122141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122204"></a>I'd like to see someone like Substack or Medium, for example, who says "Write your stuff in your favorite writing tool, export it in Markdown, and give us the link.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122241"></a>You could use more than one service, say use Substack to manage your mail list, and Medium to manage your web presence, and Facebook for discussion among your friends, Slack to discuss among your work colleagues.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122344"></a>Service providers could make custom toolkits to make it easy for tools to adapt to this interface. No need to master their whole API when all your users want is to shoot a story over for publication, indexing, rendering or storage.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/122139.html?title=whatIfWritersHadChoice#a122344" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a122512"></a>It's amazing that we have this incredibly powerful network, but the business models of service providers protect their services by not allowing writers a choice in writing tools.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/122139.html?title=whatIfWritersHadChoice#a122512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
