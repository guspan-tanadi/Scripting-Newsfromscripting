<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211140"></a>I got my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiwjvBSS_Wk">Nintendo Sports</a> and was pretty excited till I found out there's <a href="https://www.ginx.tv/en/video-games/nintendo-switch-sports-golf">no golf</a>. Oy. That was my favorite. But bowling and tennis are pretty good. They say golf is coming. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/29.html#a211140" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Journalism controls what we think about everything. The online world has become an echo chamber for what's talked about on cable news and podcasts. The journalists who control so much of what we all think aren't required to be transparent, there aren't any rules governing how they get paid, and worst of all, we didn't elect them and we can't vote them out.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/29/144811.html?title=weAlreadyLiveInAnAutocracy#a145525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150249"></a>They tell us how bad it is that Elon Musk owns Twitter (and I'm starting to see it that way too), but what do they have to say about the people who employ them? I guess we depend on their integrity, their good intentions. But what evidence is there of the goodness of their intentions. I turn off the "news" the first time i hear them overstating a case, leaving out important facts that would contradict the conclusions they reach. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/29/144811.html?title=weAlreadyLiveInAnAutocracy#a150249" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154146"></a>My friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monicalo68/">Monica Loredan</a>, an Italian who is vacationing in Venice, stopped to enjoy a nice ice cream with her husband Paolo, and posted this picture to her account on Facebook. I asked if I could publish it on my blog, because it reminded me of the <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/28/174509.html?title=theRichestYouCanBe">fantastic sushi</a> I had in Sausalito many years ago, that helped me understand what real wealth is. You can't be richer than Monica is, in the moment, with this fantastic creation sitting before her, ready to bring her soul the pleasure of eating it. I felt wealthy myself because I had the experience too, as a memory of past pleasure. Now I am sharing the experience with you. Enjoy!<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/29/154140.html?title=asRichAsYouCanBe#a154146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
