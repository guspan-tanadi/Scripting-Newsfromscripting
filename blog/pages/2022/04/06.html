<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170700"></a>A <a href="http://scripting.com/code/opmltojson/">utility</a> I wrote a while back that converts an <a href="http://scripting.com/code/opmltojson/?url=http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/?format=opml">OPML file</a> from XML to JSON. It's exactly the same outline either way. If people prefer to use JSON to XML for outlines, this is how to do it. I've written a lot of JavaScript code that assumes exactly this structure.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/06.html#a170700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I am head-down on another project now, something new, that of course will connect to Drummer. But I am still 100 percent on board for interop #TFT space. I want all of them to peer, based on an open format, so a healthy ecosystem of databases, renderers and editors can emerge around the basic idea of using computers for thinking and communicating ideas. This is why I got into software in the first place. Scott appears to understand how Roam works, and of course I know how Drummer works, so the goal is to get this going, one step at a time. I've written a <a href="https://github.com/phonetonote/tft-interop/discussions/2#discussioncomment-2512422">comment</a> on what I think a good first step would be. And the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage">OPML package</a> I wrote for JavaScript seems will play a role in this project which I hope happens, and I hope you can help with. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/06.html#a130236" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
