Or give them something nice to eat. I just realized it's so rare that we do this. Everyone's looking for a nice word of praise or reassurance.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152507"></a>Self-moderation is going to be a huge deal. Maybe something like self-driving Teslas. Which the driver controls, btw. It isn't a passive thing. If a Musk company can do that, yeah I think they can give users more control over the bullshit they have to deal with on Twitter. The thing is Twitter has been stuck since 2006 when it started. They hired people to make the system run reliably, which is fantastic, hat's off, but it needs a few more things to be able to realizae its potential as a world-scale notification system for all kinds of networked writing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/17/152458.html?title=letAThousandTwittersBloom#a152507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152516"></a>Maybe to make something workable you have to start something new, not in a half assed way..

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152617"></a>Look, Elon made buying a car a completely online experience, moving around huge amounts of money and metal and an explosion in demand. Buying a Tesla was like buying a Mac in 1984 or an iPhone in 2007, except they're doing it 365 days a year for years. And buying a StarLink is just as easy and just as much of a sensation. If this is easy to do why do so few companies do it?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/17/152458.html?title=letAThousandTwittersBloom#a152617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152735"></a>Seriously, if you think he can't run Twitter when he can run StarLink and Tesla, please. And why should Twitter be stuck in the mud like it has been since inception. It desperately needs some fixes, and at a minumum must be made easier to peer with. Developers can do all the work if they just add a few simple features that they probably already have implemented. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/17/152458.html?title=letAThousandTwittersBloom#a152735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
