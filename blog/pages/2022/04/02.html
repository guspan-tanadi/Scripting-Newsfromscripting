<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175247"></a>A user said heâ€™d be more inclined to use <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> if i planned for it to continue to work after I stop working. First, yes I did plan the best I could. All your files are in an <a href="http://opml.org/">open format</a> which can be read by most outliners. You can easily and quickly download all your files with a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/general.opml#1634478289000">single command</a>. You should do it frequently. If you want Drummer to keep going, help out next time there are new features, get involved in testing. Anyone can do it. It should be possible for me to introduce a new fix or feature and find out if there are any problems within a few hours. That's what the process needs from users, at least to be somewhat viable going forward. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/02.html#a175247" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125046"></a>I sat down at the breakfast table to solve the <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=wordle&collection=scriptingnews">Wordle</a> puzzle for the day. I was sad to solve it in less than a minute. Now what to do? Guess I have to get to work! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/02/125042.html?title=todaysWordle#a125046" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125136"></a>BTW -- I find that only my subconscious mind can solve the puzzle, to actually see the solution. I can analytically arrange for the clues to be available to my subconsciousl but the word pops into my conscious mind in an instant. I have no awareness of the process.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/02/125042.html?title=todaysWordle#a125136" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125212"></a>Usually I'm sure when I have the answer. Today I wasn't even sure the correct word was actually a word! What a nice surprise when all five letters came up green and then did their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdSa5kJb-yw">little dance</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/02/125042.html?title=todaysWordle#a125212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
