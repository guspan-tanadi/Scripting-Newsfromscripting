	<li data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/13/tinaTurnerBarbie.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133130"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/13/tinaTurnerBarbie.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I once asked a journalist who uses <a href="http://substack.com">Substack</a> how he felt about their editor. His response surprised me. He said he loved Substack and basically wouldn't say anything critical about it. I said I was asking as a software developer. I was wondering if there was any reason to try to put together a nice editor for Substack users, I wasn't asking a "gotcha" question the way a journalist might. I had no intention of quoting the person. My writing isn't like that. I don't quote people very often, and usually if I do, it's without saying who they are, as in this bit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a133130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134307"></a>It was kind of a hypothetical question anyway, because I <i>can't</i> write an editor for Substack users, they don't permit it. Writers have to use their editor. It's the only reason I don't use Substack myself. I have my own editor that suits my writing style, and don't plan on switching, ever. And I recognize that it's also a lock-in tactic. They make it hard to publish through Substack something you published elsewhere. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a134307" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133533"></a><a href="http://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, written by Manton Reece, who I've written about here <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/08.html#a155342">recently</a> makes it incredibly easy to publish stuff published elsewhere as part of your blog. I recently decided to learn how it works, again, after playing with it a bit when it first came out. It's an interesting product that I sense started out very simple, but over time got so many features that now it's hard to approach as a newbie. But after a number of sessions being somewhat confused, I think I now understand what the product is at its core. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a133533" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134519"></a>First it's a simple blogging tool. Posts can have titles. You edit in a plain text editor. The system supports Markdown styling and links. It supports outbound <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a>, and where it gets interesting is that it supports <i>inbound</i> RSS too. So I can give it the URL of my <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fradio3.io%2Fusers%2Fdavewiner%2Frss.xml">linkblog feed</a> and everything I post there appears as if I wrote it on micro.blog. In fact I did that a long time ago the first time I tried it out, and it must appear to some people as if I've been a regular user all along. People reply to my linkblog posts. I feel bad about that. It seems selfish of me to do that, to push ideas into a system, but to not be there to respond on behalf of those ideas. But I haven't taken the link out, at least not yet. :-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a134519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134117"></a>The interesting thing about it, and the reason I put the two products together in one piece is that micro.blog has the one feature that imho would put Substack over the top, and give it a shot at world domination. On the other hand, wouldn't it be nice if micro.blog added a newsletter feature to put a little pressure on Substack to open themselves up a bit more? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a134117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135628"></a>PS: I haven't described all the features of micro.blog. For example, in addition to each user having a blog, each user also has a timeline, like Twitter. You subscribe to other users. Not sure if you can subscribe to external RSS feeds (which would make it a feed reader too). Where the boundaries are is where the confusion is, at least for me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a135628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135756"></a>PPS: I think my presence there makes people uncomfortable, perhaps. While the product is a paragon of openness, the community seems kind of closed, basically part of what I think of as <a href="https://www.hover.com/domains/results?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=gruberville">GruberVille</a>. All things that emanate from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber's blog</a>. I am not part of that world, but I have an account. I am harmless, I have no desire to interfere with micro.blog -- I think it's wonderful that someone is doing what Manton is doing. As I've tried to say a number of times, <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">my product is interop</a>. I am 67 years old and am aware that every time I start a new product it could be my last. I am not trying to conquer anything, however I am trying to shake at least one part of the web out of the deep sleep it has been in ever since Google Reader took over and then was axed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/13/133536.html?title=substackVsMicroblog#a135756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
