<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213308"></a>The first segment on <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-countdown-with-keith-olbe-99705496/episode/make-the-commercial-before-its-too-103467900/">today's</a> Countdown with Keith Olbermann asks where are the Democrats' commercials warning of what happens if we lose the legislature in the upcoming election. It's going to be tragic, people ought to have a chance to know the consequences of voting Republican.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19.html#a213308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143504"></a>I'm writing FeedLand docs today, preparing for some new users. My hope is they'll actually read the docs, but -- well at least I hope they read the Getting Started docs. I try to make the writing interesting, with lots of screen shots and side-stories. Easter eggs where possible. Once I get going I do actually enjoy this kind of writing. I've only been doing it for 35 or so years. Heh. Ooops. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19.html#a143504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125325"></a>Imagine if journalism really did their jobs, and to be fair this includes Fox News and their kin. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19/125323.html?title=imagine#a125325" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125444"></a>Perhaps a lot less than a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">million Americans</a> would have died from Covid. But even if they had all died, people would know that incompetence of the US government response was largely responsible. That who you choose to run the government very much matters. It could be life and death for you and your family and friends. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19/125323.html?title=imagine#a125444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125530"></a>People would also know about the game the Repubs play with the debt limit, holding the wealth of the US hostage, in return for concessions that make their benefactors richer, and support the empire that Putin is trying to reboot. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19/125323.html?title=imagine#a125530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>And on and on. So many huge problems we only begin to deal with when there's a Democratic government, and sometimes they survive the Repubs, but one of these times they won't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19/125323.html?title=imagine#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a125716"></a>People don't understand the role government plays in our lives. Journalism should be helping them figure it out, instead it only reinforces the errors, telling the people only what they expect to hear. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/19/125323.html?title=imagine#a125716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
