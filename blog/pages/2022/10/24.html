Hopefully a foundation for building out the user side of feed reading. It should be every bit as empowering and useful as podcasting. And <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/18.html">happy 20th</a> to RSS 2.0, many happy returns for 20 more. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/24.html#a153433" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154128"></a>I highly recommend reading the <a href="http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml">Starting Up</a> doc. It shows how to find feeds to subscribe to, read the news, and find other users. FeedLand is all about people, feeds and news. It's not like any other feed reader that you've seen -- in fact it's very useful in conjunction <i>with</i> feed readers, thanks to the OPML subscription list standard. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/24.html#a154128" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154711"></a>There's a newly public <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport">support repo</a> on GitHub, with a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport#readme">readme</a> on the home page and a long list of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues">issues</a> we've discussed going back to mid-summer. It's for support only. If you're stuck, can't figure out how to do something, or something appears to be not working. But please read the home page first, before posting. It's a small community, all volunteers, so use the resource carefully. And absolutely no speeches, or even feature suggestions. You can use the open web for all that. After all this time, we're not naive about how to keep peace in these groups, it's by having absolutely no tolerance for abuse. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/24.html#a154711" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
