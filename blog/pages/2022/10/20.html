	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142714"></a>This is a core feature of the product. It's how we share new feeds to follow, both inside and outside of FeedLand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a142714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142617"></a>It's a very porous product, since it's about feeds, it's all about moving ideas all over the place. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a142617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140111"></a>To subscribe to a feed, just click the checkbox. It's automatically added to your list and its stories will show up when you read the news.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a140111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135943"></a>The most basic rule of FeedLand is that everything is visible to everyone. Except for your login info, there's absolutely no privacy in FeedLand, which keeps things really simple. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a135943" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134558"></a>I wrote up a <a href="http://scripting.com/futureNews.html">design</a> for this in 2007, calling it <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/checkboxNews.html">Checkbox News</a>, hoping someone else would do it. No one did, so as often happens, I did it myself. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a134558" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141856"></a>FeedLand is not yet released. It is currently being used by about twenty people, since early August. I don't want to add more yet, because this product is about community. We're not ready yet for a lot of new people. We're going slow and deliberately. I remember from past experience how community cultures develop. I want to get this right.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a141856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143507"></a>To people who make (and use) feed readers, the lists people create in FeedLand can easily be shared with feed readers that support OPML import. Here's <a href="http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner">my feed list</a> in OPML. It changes as I add and remove feeds from the list via the checkboxes. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList#a143507" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
