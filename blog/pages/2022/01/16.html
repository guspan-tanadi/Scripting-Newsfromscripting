This is a seat-of-the-pants preview. I hope to release the app tomorrow so people can see how it works for themselves and hopefully it'll give developers and users some ideas. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/16.html#a203454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They start out easy at the beginning of each week, and get harder progressively until the Sunday puzzle which only great crossword solvers can do, like my mom. It was one of the things we could do together. I'd fill in a few of the answers and come back later to find the whole puzzle solved. She said she didn't mind that I did the easy ones.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/16/142808.html?title=wordGames#a142813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143232"></a>The Washington Post recently started publishing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/crossword-puzzles/daily/">free crosswords</a>. Even though I'm a paying NYT subscriber, their crosswords cost more, even for me. I find the Post crosswords are just as satisfying and clever as the NYT ones, and the price is great. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/16/142808.html?title=wordGames#a143232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142847"></a>Now we turn to <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>. At first I looked at it and thought it was too much trouble, but then I read a <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/01/13/164646.html?title=solvingWordleWithLetterFrequency">piece</a> by my friend Ken Smith, the English professor from Indiana, who explained how to approach it mathematically. The idea is that your first word should have as many of the most likely characters as possible, which are the vowels and N, R, S, T etc. Then I don't know the best approach for the second word or third. What I've been doing is taking the matches from the first word, and there are bound to be one or two, and use them in the second word. If the position is correct, use that letter in that position, to make it a bit like a crossword, except there is no clue. Repeat in the third, fourth, etc.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/16/142808.html?title=wordGames#a142847" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
