But that'll change quickly if it's seen that all podcasts emanate from big companies.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/31.html#a173405" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152905"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/230">Brain trust query</a>: I reported a problem with my Mac keyboard configuration, now I can't do screen captures.  As I do more searching on each of these problems what's implicated in both cases is a problem of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=com.apple.screencapture.plist&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=com.apple.screencapture.plist&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61.1759j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#cobssid=s">corrupt</a> plists. I don't know very much about these files, but I do understand what they're for. It's possible I did something that blew out some of these files. I've started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/230">thread</a> to ask for help getting to the bottom of this.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/31.html#a152905" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They used the term podcast over and over. These are radio shows, not podcasts. When you sign an exclusive deal, it's no longer a podcast. Of course they don't care. But if you ever say they're not journalists they get hysterical.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/31.html#a144246" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145155"></a>Lots of great advice <a href="https://twitter.com/jsavin/status/1487682130763464708">from Jake Savin</a> about getting studio monitors set up for listening in my work space. I once had <a href="https://meyersound.com/">Meyer Sound</a> monitors in my work space when I lived in the valley. I think it's time to get some good sound in my mountainside workspace now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/31.html#a145155" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
