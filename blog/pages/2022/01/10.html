The thought is that should be enough to get the iPhone to stop trying to find a cell connection and thus stop draining my battery. If this works, all I'll have to do is remember to turn off Airplane Mode when I return to civilization.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/10.html#a143446" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
