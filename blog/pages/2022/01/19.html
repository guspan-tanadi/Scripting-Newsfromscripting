	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153027"></a>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Virginia_gubernatorial_election">election for governor in Virginia</a> was an excellent example. Journalism could have said that despite what the candidate is saying this is what Repubs do when they gain control of a state government, esp one in the South. So when you vote for the Republican, no matter how you feel about Critical Race Theory, he's doing to do X, Y and Z which are things that most Americans find hideous. And btw, the Democrats could do that too. They are awfully nice to their Republican friends. And the result is we're doomed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/19/142000.html?title=whatThisMeansToYou#a153027" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153103"></a>When Trump was first running in 2016, only <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/01/173412.html?title=bestJournalismOfTheDecade">one reporter wrote a story</a> explaining what a Trump presidency would be like. They should have all been doing it. All the time. <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/18/125952.html?title=weMustSaveOurselves">Saving ourselves</a> begins with telling ourselves <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=occam%27s%20news&collection=scriptingnews">the truth</a>, and realizing that journalism and the Democrats are not doing that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/19/142000.html?title=whatThisMeansToYou#a153103" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145931"></a>Summary of the above. Journalism should always clearly answer the question: What This Means To You. Don't run the piece until you can answer it. And maybe consider getting some new reporters who can. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/19/142000.html?title=whatThisMeansToYou#a145931" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
