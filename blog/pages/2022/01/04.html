Yesterday I released a version of the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage">OPML package</a> that didn't work. There's a new version, that includes new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/tree/main/examples/markdown">example code</a> illustrating how to use the new Markdown variant format for outline-based interop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/04.html#a183209" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

For me it was <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=unix&collection=scriptingnews">Unix</a> in the late 70s. That's what really opened my eyes to how things could be both very powerful and very simple. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/04.html#a231056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a221308"></a>I rarely listen to the Daily podcast but today I listened to one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/podcasts/the-daily/omicron-variant-hospitalizations-cdc-isolation.html">about the Omicron variant</a> of Covid, and I don't think the person they interviewed really understood the science, or they were dumbing it down. How I miss <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Donald%20McNeil&collection=scriptingnews">Donald McNeil</a> who used to tell it like it is. Too bad he said the n-word when talking about the n-word instead of saying literally n-word he said the word the n-word is standing in for. How tired is that. Think of all the things we have to fight for to just get back to where we were and this wasn't one of them. Such fools at the NY Times.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/04.html#a221308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191921"></a>The cable industry is just as responsible as Facebook for the garbage information people are getting. Both Facebook and Twitter remove the bad actors, why can't cable do the same. Even worse, we have to pay Fox money, even though we abhor what they do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/04.html#a191921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165139"></a>And no one seems to understand that there is a format that ties all this stuff together.
