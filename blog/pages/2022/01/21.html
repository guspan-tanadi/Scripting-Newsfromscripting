Why can't they use the damned portal. Everything has to be on the phone. I almost never answer my phone these days. It's not something many of us do. There was a time when we did.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/21.html#a155712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
