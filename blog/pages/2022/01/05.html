Lots of other good stuff on the new <a href="https://github.com/scripting/docServer">DocServer site on GitHub</a>. Another great OPML application, this time one that allows you to author man pages in an outline. Very easy to work on and publish.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/05.html#a160731" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191833"></a><a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/148#issuecomment-1005923035">Ken Smith</a>, our English professor advisor on outliners, sees how the new DocServer can be used to present any kind of writing, not just "man pages." He's absolutely right. There's nothing in there that limits its uses to only tech stuff. Intentional. In fact I <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/09/28/162837.html?title=yourOwnDocserver">wrote a post</a> about this on 9/28 of last year. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/05.html#a191833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It would be as big a breakthrough as S3 was in 2006. Actually it'd be more like the introduction of the floppy disk to the Apple II in 1978 or so. Really it's amazing how long this niche has been left unfilled. User-owned storage that their apps can use, provided by Amazon please. It has to be Amazon. I understand finally that's what all the <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=web3&collection=scriptingnews">web3</a> michegas is about. The Blockchain vendors insist they have the solution to this festering sore of a problem. Of course tehcnologically -- far from it. But for some reason Amazon has been unwilling to fill the need. I think rushing to one form of storage rather than providing a cloneable API is foolish. We can have it all, and we should insist on it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/05.html#a163044" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

So many services value your time at zero.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160932"></a>So when the language gets a new way of doing something that is only slightly better than the previous version, or not better at all, I always stick with the way I was doing it before.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161308"></a>There are exceptions. Sometimes they add a feature to a language that is so sensible you have to use it. For example, initial values for parameters to functions in JavaScript. Or not having to say <i>name: name</i> in an object definititon, just <i>name</i> will do. Another one, the forEach function in JavaScript is more sensible than the equalent for version.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/05/151848.html?title=theTwowaysRule#a161308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
