<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a191906"></a>It has been pointed out that poor people have it harder than rich and famous people. Some things are so obvious they don't need to be said. I've been exploring this topic for all the years I've been blogging (27+), the difference between (say) Steve Jobs as a person and Steve Jobs as the superstar. I'm figuring things out at a whole new level, in the difference between who the Beatles were as people and how the Beatles were part of my personal foundation. I watched the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show. When I was in the hospital recovering from a ruptured appendix, She Loves You was #1 and played all the time on the hospital PA. And on and on. To have the clouds lifted on all this history in the Get Back documentary calls for some recalculation. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/30.html#a191906" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/30/revolverCover.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144143"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/30/revolverCover.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">My mind, when it comes to Beatles songs, is like one of those old computer monitors that's been sitting in a clerical office for 20 years, and the default prompt is burned into the screen so you can read it clearly even if the monitor is turned off. I never listen to the actual words of Beatles songs. When I first heard them, I'm sure I had no idea what they were talking about, and I played the songs so many times, as a child, and all through my life. It's like the Beatles are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS">ROM BIOS</a> of my music brain OS. Now that I've been reading about them as songs with meaning and connected to the musician's lives when they were writing them, the words all of a sudden are there. Fantastic. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/30.html#a144143" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
