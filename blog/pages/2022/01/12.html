<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183634"></a><a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/mylogseqblog/">This is a blog</a> that I am writing in <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=logseq&collection=scriptingnews">LogSeq</a>, using their outliner, and publishing through Drummer's CMS. This is, my friends, is interop. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/12.html#a183634" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a225517"></a>I changed the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/12/goldenSpike.png">header graphic</a> on Scripting News to an artist's rendering of the completion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad">Transcontinental Railroad</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promontory,_Utah">Promontory Summit</a>, Utah on May 10, 1869 and the ceremonial driving of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spike">Golden Spike</a>. I always loved the imagery of this event. A cooperative venture, one team building from east to the west, and the other from west to east, meeting at a middle point, and thereby creating one great thing. Working together. Built during the Civil War.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/12.html#a225517" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162759"></a>At some point, people we think of as independent software developers today will be thought of by Apple and Google as terrorists. The people won't know what to believe. In the future, even saying what I said here will be seen as terrorism. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/12.html#a162759" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/26/rjBarrett.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150204"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/26/rjBarrett.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I wonder if there's a Howto document for LogSeq outlines, like the <a href="http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/">Outliner howto</a> I did for Drummer (and all my outliners going back to ThinkTank on the Apple II). I find I can't do the most basic things in <a href="http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=logseq&collection=scriptingnews">LogSeq</a>. I know there must be keystrokes for basic actions like creating a new subhead or moving a sub around structurally. The menus don't have anything for outlining (that I can find). I was able to get by because I can now edit LogSeq documents in Drummer (!) -- it took me about 1/2 hour to realize I could do this. Oh the wonders of interop. I'm on Day 2 of my quest to hook up LogSeq to Drummer blogging. The first product of this work will be a JavaScript app that converts a LogSeq journal folder into a calendar-structured outline in OPML. We're creating a new idea universe here, and it's coming together quickly. I love being in the middle of these projects. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/12.html#a150204" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151740"></a>Another thing I have to figure out is -- having indented, how do I outdent so the next line I type is at the parent's level. When I outdent the list I indented moves out. Not the intended effect. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/12.html#a151740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145432"></a>I'm watching <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-queens-gambit">Queen's Gambit</a> again. It's so refreshing. The lead character, Beth Harmon, is so attractive, appealing, I want to see everything she says and does. She totally commands attention. And admiration. I once had a girlfriend who was as beautiful and brilliant like the character, smart and clever and ambitious. The show is such a fantasy, and very motivating. It makes me want to do brilliant work just to get her approval. I know it's just a story but it's also real in a sense, as my inner life. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. And it's good as a re-binge as well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/12.html#a145432" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
