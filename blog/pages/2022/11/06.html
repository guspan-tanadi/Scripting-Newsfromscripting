<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a045755"></a>So maybe we need to get fascism out of our system in the US. Yes, millions of people could die, but we've been through that before and survived as a country. Maybe after going through the whole fascism mess we'll have a greater appreciation for basic freedoms.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/06.html#a045755" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
