I look at it and I see that even though I've never met them, somehow their feed ended up looking a lot like the feeds I make now, <i>20 years later.</i> It's like there was this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">game of Telephone</a>, and you'd expect by now, after passing through so many hands, esp people who were <i>trying</i> to break the chain, what came out the other end is correct. Thanks due in part to <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton Reece</a> who persuaded the Masto folk that feed items are not required to have titles. Finally we have a massive maker of feeds who I hope will force all feed readers to support this feature that has been <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt">in RSS</a> since v0.91. Item titles are optional. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/21/specshot.png?nodialog">It's in the spec</a>. In fact it's so important that I said it twice in two different ways in case anyone was confused. I think this is just a matter of programmers looking for an easy way out and most of them not being writers. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/21.html#a145001" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133040"></a>In late 2021, I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">this piece</a> which has turned into a manifesto in my mind. "Drummer is more than a piece of software -- it's an interop bomb." The same is true of FeedLand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/21.html#a133040" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
