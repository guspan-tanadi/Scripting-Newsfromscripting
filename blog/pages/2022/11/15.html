They did a very nice job, even on the docs for the API. I think people who have experience working on software commercially are working on this project. It doesn't suck (surprised). The experience of going through this is unlike any experience I've had in software and I've been doing this a long time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15.html#a213114" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a212512"></a>A designer of software working now, who hasnâ€™t used Facebook and Twitter, and built on their teachings, is like a current musician having not experienced Coltrane or Beatles. How can you make art thats relevant w/o understanding the art people already know.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15.html#a212512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a212536"></a>Iâ€™ve been reading a lot of music history. When a new album came out, every musician would listen, in the first days. Theyâ€™d go to their shows.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a212613"></a>In software years and years go by and no one looks. Can you believe a book about innovation in languages came out, and no chapter about Frontier. All the new ideas, still not in the vocabulary of designers, decades later, I hope not lost to history.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15/212442.html#a212613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a212727"></a>The idea that we will end up in the ovens is pretty well-ingrained from all those talks.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15/211613.html#a212727" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211647"></a>So when a comedian, singer or NBA player talks in dog whistles of their Jew-hate, it pretty much freaks us out. You may hear us laugh but inside we're revisiting our parent's fear and pain, and in their own way, love.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15/211613.html#a211647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211700"></a>Now a delicate subject -- when the singer, comedian or NBA player is black, this has a special sting because we heard the stories your parents told you about encounters with the police. It's an incredible perspective-shift. Some of us are listening and let it sink in. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15/211613.html#a211700" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211712"></a>Now maybe you can appreciate that <i>our</i> parents had the same kinds of talks with us. Our fear is not just of our own personal deaths, but genocide. In the Holocaust they came to kill all the Jews, whole families, neighborhoods. Everyone who was wearing a yellow star. They would line us up in front of ditches and shoot everyone. Then bring in another group and shoot them so their bodies fell on the bodies that were already there. This <i>actually happened</i> to people of our parents' generation. This wasn't some plot to fool you. It fucking happened. It was only luck that kept them from dying this way, kept them alive so they could be our parents. And to warn us of things happening that are exactly what you are doing. We aren't stupid and we haven't forgotten. We know where you are taking us.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15/211613.html#a211712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a211915"></a>I believe if this genocide happens in America they will  come for blacks too, so what you all are doing is not just morally indefensible, it's not going to keep you and your family out of the ditches and the ovens. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/15/211613.html#a211915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
