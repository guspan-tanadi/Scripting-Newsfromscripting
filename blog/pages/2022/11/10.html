It contains all the code I use to talk to Twitter from all my Node apps. I want to do everything I do with Twitter for Mastodon. I don't have the ability to do this myself, for quite some time -- I'm the only person working on FeedLand and there's still a lot more to do. The package is MIT licensed, so anyone can do this work, and I don't need all the functionality. Looking for someone to take on this project. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/10.html#a181757" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

All the big news brands lied about the most basic fact about the country we live in. Why should anyone pay any attention to the garbage that journalism tries to feed us?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/10.html#a174931" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I just read a bunch of them, all humorous and written in a certain style that's not really mine. I love my own writing, I have to say. I imagine most writers do. Put me in a good mood.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/10.html#a141848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
