Just followed some people and posted some notes. It's a lot faster today than it was the other day. I guess I have to figure out their API so I can post my linkblog items there. Or maybe someone else can help with that? Mastodon should support inbound RSS. Then we could just use RSS to hook the two worlds up. Bridges are very good things. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/07.html#a233839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a002407"></a>Just went through the prefs system <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/109305331340609145">on Mastodon</a>. Very professionally done, as good as anything anywhere. This doesn't feel like open source software, or put another way, it's nice to see open source software with commercial-level user interface.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/07.html#a002407" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153348"></a>The big value of Twitter is the social graph, and that's what will keep you coming back. Same thing with FB. I never built a graph on LinkedIn or Instagram, so I don't give a shit, personally, about those networks. Of course many others do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/07.html#a153348" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1589628912723951618">replied</a>:  We would sue them. Americans are individuals. If that means anything, I must be the ruler of myself. There is a border, beyond which no one goes w/o my permission, including the government. That border is my body. Even a Republican should understand that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/07.html#a152941" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

But that's more or less what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore">happened</a> in 2000.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/07.html#a142114" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
