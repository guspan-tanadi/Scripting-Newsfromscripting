<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135814"></a>I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1587794609828159488">thread</a> on Twitter today documenting how Chrome was <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/mangledrssscreen.jpeg?nodialog">mangling</a> RSS feeds, had been for many years. I didn't know this was Google's plug-in. As far as I knew this was the way Chrome shipped. It's possible I installed it myself, it would have had to be a long time ago. But I just right-clicked on the XML icon in the browser's chrome and chose to uninstall it, and I viewed an RSS feed and it came out "literal" -- here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/rssInChrome.png">screen shot</a>. All that wasted time. I didn't need to write the xmlviewer app. Oy. I wonder what else I am missing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/02.html#a135814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
