The fact that you can see this in my Mastodon account means that it's working at a new level.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/23.html#a214817" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161210"></a>The blogosphere which was absorbed by twitter for $0 was eventually turned into a Nazi frat party for Elon. That was the end result, that and billions for Ev, Jack, Biz, Union Square and Spark, and weâ€™re back where we were when they took over. 16 years wasted.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/23.html#a161210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a142055"></a>I can't tell you how convenient it is that Mastodon has the same name as my first real internet presence on CompuServe in the early 80s, also Mastodon. I have a whole language already designed to go with that name. Mastodoctor, for example. For a while we were all adding "bunny" to our names, so I became Mastobunny and then Mastobun for short. Most of these names are available, so I'm tempted, but so far I've resisted. I have bought a couple though. Like most domain names I buy, I'll probably never use them. But it's nice they're there. I keep hoping someday to come up with a service that deserves the name <a href="http://ou.rs/">ou.rs</a> which I've been renewing for many years. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/23.html#a142055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141918"></a>I had a great talk with Doc Searls yesterday. They're always expressive and irreverant. We had fun at the expense of New Jersey, Kevin Durant, The Nets and of course the current mess at Twitter. I keep thinking we should do a podcast. If there was anyone in the world I want to do one with it would be Papa Doc. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/23.html#a141918" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
