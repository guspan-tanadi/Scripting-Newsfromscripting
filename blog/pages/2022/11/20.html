After a year, I still love driving it. but it's funny -- no Nazis or smelly wanna be dictators show up in the passenger seat when I'm driving . I think Elon should get Twitter to run like a Tesla and in the meantime just stfu. I hope he knows what stfu means. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/20.html#a013146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's this approach that would make it possible to have indefinite length posts in Masto or Twitter or whatever, without dominating the feed.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/20.html#a142627" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>First thing he did after signing, he had a press conference where he dis'd the Knicks. I guess he was thinking there was some kind of rivalry. There wasn't. No one had any feelings at all for the Nets. A complete zero among NY basketball fans. And the Knicks, well we have a lot of heart there and for the most part it's an ache. The last thing we have any energy for is an idiot who has no idea of the place he's entered, and where we're at, basketball-wise.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/11/20/165013.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
