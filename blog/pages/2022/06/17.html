DeSantis is a younger, more attractive, ambitious and not quite so openly hostile to non-whites version of Trump. Asked to comment, DeSantis makes a <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3525627-desantis-on-musk-tweet-i-welcome-support-from-african-americans/">Musk-like joke</a>, he welcomes African-American support (Musk is from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/world/africa/elon-musk-south-africa.html">South Africa</a>). If this is what Musk means by free speech, well we're free to walk away from a Musk-owned Twitter. Where will we go? Probably nowhere. It's not possible for a service to take Twitter's place, it was formed a long time ago, and morphed into what it is now. I don't think any system will show up where there's a consensus that <i>this</i> is the new Twitter. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/17.html#a132248" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a133201"></a>The US is openly white supremacist, but for sixty years has been trying to become less so. That peaked when we elected a black president in 2008. There is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Oprahs-Book-Club-Discontents/dp/B085VXLKRJ/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcSLpCIAggnuGi0Z8ZnGrwIc2tg4021vRgIxgUdxMA9dZMDLYLoUCr4aAvPrEALw_wcB&hvadid=552574215490&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1023511&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16381147703423192585&hvtargid=kwd-938508291970&hydadcr=7438_9611178&keywords=caste+the+origin+of+our+discontent&qid=1655516954&sr=8-1">caste</a> system here, and blacks were the bottom rung, and still are, largely, but there has been progress away from that, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society">laws</a> passed in the 60s, and supporting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education">Supreme Court</a> decisions. All that is turning around. DeSantis, a smoother Trump, will be more careful about arousing his opposition. He will seem to be a likeable Republican and many will overlook his racism, or worse, quietly support it. I have no idea what the answer is, the racism is deeply ingrained in America. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/17.html#a133201" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151549"></a>Trump supporters like this about him: He tells them they are important, but if things continue as they have been going, with elites promoting black people, they will matter less and less. That's the connection.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/17.html#a151549" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
