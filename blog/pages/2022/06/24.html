If you haven't seen it yet, now's the time. The last minute.  This is what the majority said: Basically the right to an abortion is nowhere in the Constitution. If you want a right to an abortion, get Congress to pass a law. Or, I suppose it could have been more extreme, that the reason it isn't in the Constitution is the same reason murder isn't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/24/134142.html?title=theDemocraticPartyMustChange#a134149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I'm interested in developer-level feedback. I'm about to move on, and haven't heard much back. Eventually there will be a set of blocks that can be used to build all parts of a feed reading and writing system. What we're doing now is the lowest level of the stack. A good place to start is the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feeder/blob/main/README.md">readme</a> for the feeder app, which is the current top level of the reallysimple stack. Try giving it some feeds you know, maybe even your own, and see what it give you back. Also the docs for <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feeder/blob/main/docs/templates.md">feeder templates</a>, another building block.
