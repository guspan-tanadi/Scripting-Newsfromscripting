If that rubs you wrong, there's your racism, right there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/29.html#a162419" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a171649"></a>BTW I always put "web3" in double quotes because it's an illegitmate name and hugely disrespectful. You shouldn't get to self-declare yourself the 3rd coming of something as hugely significant as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">world wide web</a>. I don't think we should have used the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>, but don't blame me for that one.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/29.html#a171649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144645"></a>Scienceites have an effectionate name for ourselves, but it's not really printable. Let's see if I can telegraph it. We didn't have a football team, but we did have a math team. We had a computer in the early 70s when I went there, which was amazing. A block away was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a> which was all-boys and definitely had a football team. We were under no illusions about who would win if we fought, so they didn't pick on us. Sort of an honor thing, I guess. Anyway we called ourselves (and as far as I know still do) The Science Fa**ots. Maybe they <i>don't</i> say it these days, this was before political correctness. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/29.html#a144645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
