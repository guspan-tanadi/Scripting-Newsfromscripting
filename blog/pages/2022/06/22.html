<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213304"></a>I got an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp">Echo Studio</a> a couple of weeks ago, now I'm ordering a second.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134701"></a>I had broken the mailbox template for the feeder app. It's back. Here's a <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadamsinger.substack.com%2Ffeed">demo</a>. I'm also making sure that we don't break urls as we go along and I change things. For example, this is a <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmailbox?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml">request</a> that changed in two ways. It should still work, getting us a mailbox view of the feed for this blog. I'm probably the only person who cares about this. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22.html#a134701" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153213"></a>Have you noticed how some feeds look great in a mailbox-style reader while others don't. For example, <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffallows.substack.com%2Ffeed">feeds from Substack</a> are <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadamsinger.substack.com%2Ffeed">good</a> in mailbox readers because their items are full-text titled essays. But <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnytimes.com%2Ftimeswire%2Ffeeds%2F">NYT feeds look terrible</a> in mailbox readers, as <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml">does Scripting News</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/154607.html?title=mailboxstyleReaders#a153213" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154725"></a>The mailbox reader, which was popularized by <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/03/12/154157.html?title=googleReaderNineYearsLater">Google Reader</a>, is designed for titled full-text feeds. The NYT has titles on its feed items, but not full text, just a synopsis. There's so much <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/22/wastedSpace.png">wasted space</a> in the display. It feels unbalanced. I like whitespace, but that's not what this is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/154607.html?title=mailboxstyleReaders#a154725" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160353"></a>The incredibly useful <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=https://news.ycombinator.com/rss">Hacker News feed</a> looks pretty weird in a mailbox-style reader. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/154607.html?title=mailboxstyleReaders#a160353" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154654"></a>In <a href="http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&feedurl=http://scripting.com/rss.xml">my feed</a>, and feeds of <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer blogs</a>, some posts have titles, but most don't. A mailbox reader can't deal with untitled posts, I've given up on trying to make it work, it just doesn't.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/154607.html?title=mailboxstyleReaders#a154654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154751"></a>The NYT and Scripting work much better in a river-style display, which is the pattern that Twitter and Facebook use, as examples. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/154607.html?title=mailboxstyleReaders#a154751" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155756"></a>The bottom line: We have to move away from mailbox-only feed readers. Mailboxes are great when the items are like email messages. But that's far from all there is. We have to try out new ideas, lots of them. And to do that I'm making it easier to try new ideas out. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/154607.html?title=mailboxstyleReaders#a155756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162139"></a>I have the same attitude about <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> in 2022 as I did in 2002. I wanted to move, to clean up the mess, start with a fresh new foundation. It worked then, and I believe now twenty years later it'll work again.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/162133.html?title=echoesOf2002#a162139" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162205"></a>So much has changed. There was no Twitter or Facebook in 2002. None of the writing systems we use now existed. I think RSS 2.0 even predates Wordpress.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/162133.html?title=echoesOf2002#a162205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162218"></a>I have found a way to make it much simpler and easier to evolve feeds on the web, and I'm not waiting for permission I'm just going ahead. That's in fact what happened after RSS 2.0 with podcasting. We just did it, no one objected, and off we went. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/162133.html?title=echoesOf2002#a162218" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165546"></a>The theme is totally opposite of the one in 2002, when I was basically finishing RSS, and giving it over to everyone to do with as they please. The roadmap said it clearly. This is it. No more new stuff in RSS itself. If you want to add to it, you can, but to get support for your ideas you're on your own. I wasn't signing up for another stint as notetaker for this particularly community. It was too thankless a job. But guess what, not much happened. The RSS people are using today is pretty much what they were using 20 years ago. There have been some new applications, and there are some respectful projects to add a new namespaces. That's more or less what the roadmap called for. So without any leadership, it kind of took care of itself.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/162133.html?title=echoesOf2002#a165546" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165752"></a>Anyway, RSS as they say is what it is. There's also Atom and RDF, these exist and are in use. Very little if any innovation across the whole market, all of the new stuff has been in the individual products, but there are severe limits on what they can do because the format isn't moving.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/162133.html?title=echoesOf2002#a165752" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165917"></a>My thought is that I can write some new software, as everyone else is, but with the thought that I want people to do the same as I am doing. At the same time, I don't care if you do it or not, if you pick up the ideas or don't. All I'm looking for is a critical mass of people who want to experiment with a new cleaned-up simplified feed system built on what was built before. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/22/162133.html?title=echoesOf2002#a165917" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
