All I have are JPGs, so I posted them in a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1538603213175365633">thread</a> in Twitter, and in a <a href="http://this.how/leonsIdeaProcessingArticle/">page</a> on this.how.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/19.html#a192339" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a220934"></a>My father was a real outliner user. You know them when you see them. They want to make lists and figure stuff out. Very much into concepts. My mother on the other hand was a NBB or <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html">Natural-Born-Blogger</a>. She always had something on her mind and had to tell the world about it. So of course I, their first-born child, wrote outlining and blogging software, all together in one package. My mother once said that I was a good investment. She thought that way too. My father if you can believe it, said every day is Father's Day, thanks to my outliner. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/19.html#a220934" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
