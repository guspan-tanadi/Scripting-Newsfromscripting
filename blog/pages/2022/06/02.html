They had a conference call that I dialed into, and the conversation turned to my big wish for the Twitter API, that we organize the API so that from a browser-based app you can communicate directly with twitter.com, without having to run a server app as an intermediary. This has always been a big opportunity, but now there's communication. I've been developing apps using the Twitter API since 2006. There's lots of <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/07/07/comparingApis.html">potential</a> here, and their back-end is an incredible network resource. Lots to do here. Here's my <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1532382742851244034">followup thread</a> posted earlier today. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/02.html#a223523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160620"></a>I'm trying to get a new Mac OS partition set up for VMWare and nothing is working as it should. Just installing Chrome on the new instance is fraught with problems. I've never seen anything like this. Click the mouse somewhere, the thing 19 pixels down from it gets selected. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/02/crazyChromeOnVMWare.png">Chrome's display</a> is all garbled and nothing I click on works. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/02.html#a160620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
