<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a194216"></a>What did Trump imagine he would do if he got to the Capitol? Was there a plan? Was there a team of Proud Boys waiting for him. Would he have presided over VP Pence's lynching? Did he imagine giving a speech to a joint session of Congress? Too bad SNL isn't in season.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/28.html#a194216" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192528"></a>Biden is keeping the seat warm for DeSantis. Unless he steps aside after the November election and lets the next gen of Dems duke it out. I'd like to see the governors of <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/18/140211.html?title=whatPeopleWantInAPresident">California</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/28/1107881079/michigan-abortion-gretchen-whitmer">Michigan</a> in the mix. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/28.html#a192528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135827"></a>My blogging ethos came from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog">Whole Earth Catalog</a>. They moved from technical howto-type stuff to whatever was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand">SB's</a> mind. If the ideas come from the same mind, and the pub is a product of that person's mind, it's perfect. I remember reading it at my uncle's house in Florida, totally off the grid little geodesic he made himself. I loved the Whole Earth book because it seemed like my uncle. an engineer and hippie. He was another big influence in my path to eclectic, jumping where my mind wanted to go, even if it took years.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/28.html#a135827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162155"></a>One of the miracles of the web. I sent a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1541813885870788608">question</a> to Heather Cox Richardson, and she responded. Even though I'm not a historian. I love it when the quality of an idea makes a difference, not the qualifications of the person asking the question. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/28.html#a162155" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/28/lincoln.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131737"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/28/lincoln.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">We should have settled slavery after the Civil War by rewriting the Constitution to take out everything that was there to protect slavery. I wonder if Abraham Lincoln had plans for this before he was assassinated. Instead we left the Constitution virtually unchanged, and as a result a slight variant of slavery rebooted right after the war and has continued since. We have yet to cleanse ourselves of slavery. Until we do that, honestly, we cannot be a country. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/28.html#a131737" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

After you read the book, it programs you to think you're <i>in</i> the book.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a223245"></a>Here's the idea, a TLD for the feed-o-sphere. I'd like to have a feed named <i>dave.feed.</i> When you access my domain it returns the content at a URL you specify and can change.
