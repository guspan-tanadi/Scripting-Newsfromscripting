<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132001"></a>Ted Nelson was a mentor for all developers of my generation. We studied his book and were both thrilled to find other people thought the same way we were thinking, before we came along, and pissed (a little) that we weren't the great inventors we imagined ourselves to be. I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/06/19/thehypertextman.html#1">piece</a> about Nelson in 1995.
