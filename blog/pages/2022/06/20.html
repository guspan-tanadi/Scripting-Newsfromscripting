Next step is to write a Hello World template and document it. It's not complicated and it's fun.

The chickens have come home to roost and it's now time for the bards to write. To write about the <a href="https://twitter.com/TommyBeer/status/1538889310224666624">foibles</a> of would-be kings of basketball, such as Kevin Durant. He did the NBA a favor by leaving Golden State. There was no room for both KD and Steph Curry on the same team. This is the year that the idea of the superteam was completely debunked. Perhaps KD should hook up with LeBron and hmm Russell Westbrook and Melo. James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker. If there were an NBA team in Pittsburgh I'd say that's where they all should play. Otherwise Sacramento or Orlando. However this is the time of year when my attention turns to the Mets. If all goes as planned you should get a few months of reprieve from basketball.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/06/20.html#a142649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
