<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a231109"></a>I asked OpenAI why <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/06/whyPodcastingIsOpen.png">podcasting isn't owned</a> by a single tech company and it got the right answer.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/06.html#a231109" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183525"></a>It's probably very good for the world that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Butterfield">Stewart Butterfield</a> is leaving Salesforce. After he gets time to rest and recharge, something brilliant and open is probably going to come from his mind. A very capable and creative person, Slack is an amazing product and he evolved it well.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/06.html#a183525" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/06/jimiHendrix.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172424"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/06/jimiHendrix.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The most interesting episode so far in the <a href="https://500songs.com/">500 songs</a> series is the one about <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-147-hey-joe-by-the-jimi-hendrix-experience/">Hey Joe</a> as performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>. I'm not listening to them in any particular order. I felt kind of bad about it, but I got over it. One idea he talks about was there was an idea of white drugs and black drugs. I can vouch for that. I was blown away a few years ago to find out <i>everyone</i> smokes weed. I thought it was just a white boomer thing. Everyone does it. The sound of eyes opening. I asked Alexa to play me some Hendrix music. First she played Hey Joe which I'd been bingeing on. Then came his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TgbWOy6Buk">opening</a> at Woodstock. And then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY">All Along the Watchtower</a>. It was really emotional for me. It's already been a heavy duty emotional day. Let's go deeper! After that he asks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZHGJxv3qQ">Are You Experienced?</a> Hey for such a young man, he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix#Death,_post-mortem,_and_burial">died</a> at 27, he was very self-aware and surroundings-aware. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/06.html#a172424" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173301"></a>I asked <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">Openai</a> to "invent a fictitious twitter timeline with tweets only from cool people who are not in any way famous?" Believe it or not <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/06/happyBoringtwitter.png">what it came up with</a> was pretty relaxing! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/06.html#a173301" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

All of a sudden I can read everything. No more mysteries or relying on memory. Another interesting weirdness, as I've been working on software this week I can now see that I have been mis-spelling the names of things all over the place. I have a practice of copying and pasting names when I want to refer to a value or call a function, so as the mis-spellings propagate, my code still runs without errors. I really have been transformed into an able-eyed person in just one little operation. My dreams, also amazingly, have become more vivid and memorable and also gratifying (no more information forthcoming in re this). I think perhaps when one's vision improves it improves in many dimensions. Did I mention that the screens in my life reveal details heretofore unappreciated! The retina display I'm typing this into has many subtleties. Amazing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/06.html#a171445" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
