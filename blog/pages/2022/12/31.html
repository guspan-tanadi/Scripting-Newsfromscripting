<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155536"></a>Every app should have a Bookmarks menu, for organizing all your work, esp writing and esp if you're writing publicly on the web and the documents are automatically accessible on the web. If you spot a mistake you want to make it as easy and quick as possible to fix the error. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31.html#a155536" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170006"></a>It's amazing that the Macintosh desktop doesn't have a Bookmarks menu. It was first released in January 1984, almost 39 years ago. Look at all the other crap they've added to the Finder, and the single most useful feature possible is missing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31.html#a170006" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172702"></a>This is what <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/31/myFeedlandBookmarks.png">my bookmarks menu</a> in <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a> looks like after a year's use. That's just one section expanded. And it's just one app. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31.html#a172702" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180223"></a>I have a strong feeling that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> can be factored to a relatively simple programming interface with a few basic operations. Probably something equivalent to the <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md">MetaWeblog API</a> we had back in We Blogging Days of Yore. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31/180217.html#a180223" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180415"></a>To find out if the intuition is correct, I'd have to do it, and it looks like a snake pit to me, and I expect I'd get lost in there for months, trying to find the right strings to pull to get interop with other apps that use ActivityPub.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31/180217.html#a180415" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I would love to use such a package. I work in Node.js.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172515"></a><i>Thanks</i> to users who helped me develop <a href="http://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> in 2022. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31/172503.html#a172515" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173638"></a>At the beginning of the year it was just an idea that something new could be done for feeds. There were a couple of projects half-developed, one called FeedBase and an SQL version of my River series.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31/172503.html#a173638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>It all came together nicely as a social environment, something I think of now as a Feed Management System, as different from a feed reader. I want to do more with feeds than read them.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31/172503.html#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172542"></a>Anyway if you're using FeedLand, your participation has helped make FeedLand a success. Thank you.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/31/172503.html#a172542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
