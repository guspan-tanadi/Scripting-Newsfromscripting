<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150537"></a>Just got a note from Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1603767093739941889">saying</a> they're going to support <a href="https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto#titlelessfeedshowto">titleless feeds</a> in WordPress. Couldn't be happier.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a150537" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/09/jessica.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151016"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/09/jessica.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It's worth mentioning that <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> already does a good job of items with or without titles. Here are screen shots of NNW displaying a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/16/titledPostScreenShot.png">titled post</a>, and an <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/16/titlelessItemScreen.png">titleless post</a> from Scripting News.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a151016" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154501"></a>Also on their <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">site</a> they say "it's like podcasts -- but for reading." That's brilliant. Probably leaves a bunch of people scratching their heads. But this is where we're going. Making the world of text work as smoothly as the world of audio. Next step is to work on interop. So I can copy a full-featured <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcast</a> item from an app that doesn't support all the features (like Twitter or Mastodon) and paste it into one that does (like NetNewsWire or FeedLand), and voila -- everything is there. It's a simple change that would make it impossible for any participant in the network to lock you in. Your ideas would be free to move instead of being locked up. Feeds get us most of the way there, but there's a little more to do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a154501" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151816"></a>Twitter would do better with competition than without. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a151816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

No bans, no algorithms, just dutifully spits out what I'm following each time I Iog in." That's because if someone tried to lock you in you'd just switch. Having something like <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> under an industry keeps it honest and respectful of users.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a153653" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a161358"></a>A weird thought. Musk gets upset and calls a timeout. Twitter goes off the air for 24 hours. As Judy Tenuta <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE">says</a> -- It could happen. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a161358" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135835"></a>Last night I posted a <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/15.html#a023149">note</a> here announcing a new feature in <a href="http://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> that lets you connect an email address to your account. I just wrote a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/151">more detailed explanation</a> of what's going on with a place to ask questions if you're having trouble. This is important, it's a backup against a problem with Twitter. Better safe than sorry! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a135835" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155342"></a>BTW, it's worth noting that your subscriptions are public info, so even if for some reason you couldn't log onto your account you could still access your subscriptions, because anyone can. For example, <a href="http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner">my subscriptions</a> are here. You can even get them <a href="http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=podcasts">by category</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a155342" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
