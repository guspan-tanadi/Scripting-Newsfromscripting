I have no idea who else is involved, how big it is, and how much power it has. But I find it interesting and believe it's well-intentioned, so I participate. They ask you to look at posts and rate relevance, sources, context. None of the messages have profanity or are abusive or personal (some contain assumptions that are). I think there must be filters in place that see the items before people like me do. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/10/communityQuestion.png">screen shot</a> of something they asked me to look at. I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to disclose so I'll stop with that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/10.html#a161213" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175856"></a>First, credit and respect to <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton Reece</a> for helping steer Mastodon to titleless feeds. That's a mega-contribution to moving toward turning the web into a functional writing environment instead of the utterly broken mess stemming from when Twitter and Google Reader couldn't come together on micro-blogging and feeds. Imagine if they had worked it out. We'd be so much further ahead. That was in 2007. Writing on the web has been broken since then. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/10/175837.html#a175856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180006"></a>Anyway, now most feed readers imho are broken, even the beloved products we depend on every day. We can love them even though they're wrong. I can't be mushy about this. Wrong is wrong. But we can fix it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/10/175837.html#a180006" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180023"></a>In this <a href="https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto">document</a> that is both code and prose, I say what I think the purpose of feeds are, to serve writers and readers, and there is no room for the wants of programmers, esp when it's so easy to do what the writers want us to do.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/10/175837.html#a180023" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a180055"></a>I've been nice about this for a long time. We need to get together, users and developers and get this fixed so we can start adding more features to the <a href="http://this.how/whatIsADocument/">common feature set</a> of writing environments for the web. We can easily get unstuck if we decide to get unstuck.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/10/175837.html#a180055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
