Apparently a lot of people on Masto didn't know about it and the response has been resounding. And the numbers are very lopsided. The piece has been "boosted" (the Masto equiv of RT) 1.1K times, yet I only have 3.7K followers there. Meanwhile on Twitter, where I have 69K followers, it has been RTd just 17 times. My feeling was previously that Mastodon was more alive, it's good to have a number to put behind that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/03.html#a152558" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a041123"></a>For my friends Geraldine and Peter, this is a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">chat system</a> where you ask an AI that really is amazing to write stories for you, or answer questions, or even <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/sqlcode.png?nodialog">develop software</a>. Everyone, including me, is smitten by this invention. I asked it to <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/trumpstory.png?nodialog">write a story</a> about Donald Trump admitting he is a troll and tells everyone to just ignore him, and it'll be good for everyone including him. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/03.html#a041123" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
