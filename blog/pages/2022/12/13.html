I have <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/163100.html?title=starlinkSetup">Starlink</a> installed as a backup, and it wasn't working very well last time I tried it, presumably because it didn't have a good view of the sky. I thought this might change in the winter when all the leaves are gone, and I'm happy to report that it did. The service is <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/13/speedtestscreen.png">fast</a>! Of course people will think I'm a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-11-28/column-elon-musks-engagement-with-nazis-and-the-far-right-on-twitter-is-out-of-control">fascist</a> because not only do I use Twitter and drive a Tesla, I am also a happy SpaceX customer. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a134228" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a134833"></a>BTW, yesterday we paused new signons to <a href="http://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a>. There were a lot of reasons for this. First, I didn't want a lot of users. I think of FeedLand as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22">fractional horsepower</a> global feed management system. Not wanting in any way to compete with the huge systems, to create yet another <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1602663488157089795">monster</a> like Twitter. I felt that we already had too many users for my liking. At some point the load on the server is going to be a problem, I wanted to stop well before we got to that point. Also, I want to do some development that would be harder with new users coming online. Remember this is not a corporate site. I am the only person working on the software and I'm responsible for keeping the service running at a technical level, and dealing with trolls, spammers and abusers, which thankfully have not been a problem yet, but I know from experience that it's just a matter of time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a134833" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141000"></a>There's this great line in Sleeper where the character played by Woody Allen was asleep for 100 years and when he woke wanted to know how the world was destroyed. They said a guy named Albert Shanker got a nuclear weapon. That's a 1970s NYC joke. If you knew Albert Shanker, you'd get it. If they were remaking the movie now instead of Albert Shanker it'd be Elon Musk and instead of a nuke it'd be Twitter and instead of being science fiction it'd be true. Now that's still an Albert Shanker joke, but soon there will be plenty of Elon Musk jokes. Lots of them. I'm never wrong about things like this btw. ;-)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/12/13.html#a141000" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
