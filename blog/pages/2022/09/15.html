I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1570424640647974913">explain</a>. "I manage the music myself. It's okay I <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/28.html#a195031">got</a> a nice new Android <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6">phone</a>, and they let me use the Finder to copy music onto the phone, and I'm happy -- I'm gradually weaning myself off Apple. And <i>simple</i> does not equal 'breaking users and forcing them to use services they never asked for, for good reasons.' If I got in my car and tried to go somewhere and it said sorry we don't go there any longer, well since I drive a Tesla I do expect that day to come."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/15.html#a161837" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170518"></a>They have an "easy" schedule in Sept, so they were "expected" to cruise into the post season without a care. And on top of that, they took a series from the great Dodgers, boosting the team confidence even more. Then they lost a series to the Marlins and now were swept by the Cubs, both sub-par teams this year. The Mets might still win, because the Braves, their main competitors in the NL East, are slumping too.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/15/163044.html?title=sorryButYouDontKnowShit#a170518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163148"></a>This is why people who really engage with sports laugh when the politicos on TV say they know how elections will go. Fuck you, you don't know shit a Mets fan might say. A Dodgers fan probably would be more polite but the sentiment would be basically the same. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/15/163044.html?title=sorryButYouDontKnowShit#a163148" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
