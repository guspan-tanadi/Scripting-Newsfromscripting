I haven't forgotten. I'm going to try to ship something appropriate on that day. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/08.html#a174315" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Right now it's only in Node. It makes reading feeds of all flavors easy to just drop into an application. It lives up to its name, it's a simplification of RSS (and Atom and RDF) behind a single JSON interface. So you can put feed reading support into anything without taking on a huge project. Tools are so important.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/08.html#a174630" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174210"></a>I got a big new feature topped off today. Can't say what it is yet, but I think it'll be shipping within a few weeks, or so. Software comes when it's ready, like everything else. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/08.html#a174210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

What? Unreal. Then it came to me, this is normal. Itâ€™s why even when the temperature in California is over 100 in lots  of  places,  we're  still pumping carbon into the atmosphere. Pakistan is drowning, and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Powell#21st_century_drought">Lake Powell</a> is drying up. Business as  usual. What was abnormal was the brief period when many made sacrifices to fight Covid.  Now we just  shrug  it  off, I guess?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/08.html#a212645" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Awww. I'd love to use it, its user interface is way better than Spectrum but -- the only way to get the Mets and Knicks games is from Spectrum. Let me know when I can watch my teams on YouTube TV and I'll be back right away.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/08.html#a213628" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
