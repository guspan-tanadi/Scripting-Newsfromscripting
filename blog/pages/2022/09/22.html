	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154421"></a>I find this so disturbing. I always have -- I'm not sure what to do, am I supposed to give them an accounting of my life, here's the good and the bad. If I do that do I have to make my story sound like their story, mostly very good but just a little bad to make it seem real.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/22/154250.html?title=hopeAllIsWell#a154421" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154500"></a>Now that I'm older it's disturbing for other reasons. Who cares whether it's good or bad, nothing is either good or bad, or everything is bad, and everything is good. It's hubris to be in the business of judging good or bad. The universe is billions of years old. Everything you think is good or bad actually is irrelevant. See that's the joke. What you think matters, only matters to you. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/22/154250.html?title=hopeAllIsWell#a154500" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154620"></a>"Hope all is well" is just a nicety, it doesn't require a response, it isn't competitive -- if you want to expand it -- it means life can be a drag I know but I am thinking good thoughts about you, so at least that is something you don't need to add to your worries. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/22/154250.html?title=hopeAllIsWell#a154620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Watch Chris Hayes when he talks about Trump. He's not grim, he's usually laughing, and so are his guests (not all of them, I've never seen <a href="https://twitter.com/ElieNYC">@elieNYC</a> laugh at this kind of stuff). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/22/134654.html?title=itsASitcom#a142952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
