I've been watching a lot of Mets baseball. The Mets are breaking a lot of records this year, including being <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/hit-by-pitch">hit by pitches</a> more than any other team ever (almost). This taught me something important, along with watching the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-us-and-the-holocaust">Ken Burns documentary</a> about the Holocaust and the US (must-watch). I see Trump in Hitler now. Pretty revealing perspective. Now I wonder how my ancestors got here at all, given the antisemitism in the US then, which I can attest to (and provide proof of). You're wasting time watching MSNBC, much better off watching baseball and Ken Burns.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/20.html#a153504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The country isn't that conservative. The Electoral College gone wild. The Repubs got too good at tuning it up and it will lead to a revolution.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/20.html#a143352" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I literally have nothing to say, except I guess <i>that</i> I have nothing to say. Keep checking back I'll let you know if something comes up. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/20.html#a132254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
