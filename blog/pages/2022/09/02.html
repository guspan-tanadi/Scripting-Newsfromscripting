Because the Marines <i>are</i> behind him. He is the commander in chief of the US military, in addition to all the other things he is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/02.html#a213616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Still lots of kinks to work out for the new EV platforms." <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1565700930389118979">I responded</a>: "Not sure which kinks you're talking about, but my <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">Tesla</a> as a car works flawlessly. The computer system can be pretty <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/03/134450.html?title=whyNotDriveATesla">fucked up</a>, the same way Macs are because Tesla did more than make an EV. I also have a ICE, a relatively new <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subaru">Subaru</a> and as you say it's incredibly reliable too. That said, I never drive the Subaru. It's sitting there waiting for winter, my thought is that it might work better in the snow than the Tesla. But I literally never drive it because the Tesla is so much more fun to drive."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/02.html#a170141" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Instead they'll groom their own superstars. There are so many good young prospects already playing for the Knicks. Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, RJ, Sims. This is team, the one they already have, is worth being patient for. And the current Knicks management, by hanging tough, remains a powerhouse for future deals and there will be more deals. Mitchell is a fine player, but far from the only one. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/02.html#a151026" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
