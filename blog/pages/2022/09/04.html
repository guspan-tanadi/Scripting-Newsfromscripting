<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173816"></a>Inside your head is a thing called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious">subconscious</a> that's primitive, has little understanding of the world. It mainly sees you, and projects all its memories on you. It's looking out through your eyes the same way you view the cosmos. WIth awe but little actual understanding. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/04.html#a173816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a160428"></a>I had a doctor who retired recently who always referred to me as a friend. I never doubted her sincerity, and it was a really good thing to do because it reminded me at a conscious <i>and subconscious</i> level that there was trust between us. It's a given. If you can't trust your doctor, you need to get a new doctor. So I've started to do that in my own mind as I narrate projects to myself. Okay that's done <i>my friend. </i>Let's figure out what's next friend. <i>My friend</i> this is a hard problem. I just add the punctuation to remind myself that I trust myself, I'm doing something I'm good at, and know it. It really does manage the mood of my subconscious, it's reassuring. I got this, really means <i>we</i> got this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/04.html#a160428" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144249"></a>People think so linearly about the Knicks. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/04/144243.html?title=theKnicksAreTheUnnets#a144249" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020312"></a>There are quite a few players out there with the potential of Donovan Mitchell to lead a team to dynasty. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/04/144243.html?title=theKnicksAreTheUnnets#a020312" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020338"></a>Think of what the Knicks have to offer a potential trader. The Knicks bench is filled with potential like few others are. We've got a stockpile of draft picks. And the Knicks and the Garden and the talent are starting to get interesting to players. Like the way they want to go to Duke or Kentucky. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/04/144243.html?title=theKnicksAreTheUnnets#a020338" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020339"></a>The Knicks are the un-Nets. The Knicks are building, not trying to buy a post-season powerhouse.  Look where that approach got the Nets. What a <a href="https://netswire.usatoday.com/2022/09/03/shaquille-oneal-agrees-that-nets-star-kevin-durants-career-is-a-failure/">mess</a>! ðŸ˜€<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/04/144243.html?title=theKnicksAreTheUnnets#a020339" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a020520"></a>So sit tight, this is not the end of the dream of what those <a href="https://www.nba.com/knicks/roster">kids on the bench</a> could become.
