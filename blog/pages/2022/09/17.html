<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a181345"></a>At the beginning of this year, with the 20th anniversary of RSS 2.0 coming up, I asked myself a question -- why aren't you working on RSS? In some ways it was the most successful project of my career. Why not do more with it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17.html#a181345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173649"></a>It’s so funny, when I was a kid, when marijuana was illegal, I used to smoke weed in my car on long trips or short. I don’t know what I was thinking. It was nuts. There were always roaches in the ashtray.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17.html#a173649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

You probably have to log off and log back on if you're using it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17.html#a140149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135647"></a>The frontier in new models for social networks are systems that work wonderfully with small numbers of users. The size of a PTA or bowling team. And to limit forms of expression so that it can't devolve.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17/135643.html?title=pioneeringSocialBehavior#a135647" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135710"></a>For the last 50 years we've been building social networks that grow without limit, and give the users power to say anything. We keep repeating this, and being shocked when they devolve to the most crude form of human behavior. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17/135643.html?title=pioneeringSocialBehavior#a135710" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135716"></a>Instead let's pioneer of new forms of social behavior. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17/135643.html?title=pioneeringSocialBehavior#a135716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a135915"></a>Hopefully something better than devolution, more useful at solving the problems we have. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/17/135643.html?title=pioneeringSocialBehavior#a135915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
