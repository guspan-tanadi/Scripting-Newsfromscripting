He asked if I thought we'd ever see Trump indicted and prosecuted for all the terrible things he's done to our country. I said I have no idea, but it could happen. I asked if, when we were in our 20s, he thought we'd live to see marijuana legalized. He gave a vague answer. I said that's it! That's how it is with Trump facing justice. I have no idea, but it <i>could</i> happen. Stranger less likely things have happened. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/05.html#a131039" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140332"></a>One more thing. I am a lifelong Mets fan. My friend is a lifelong Cubs fan.  We understand the concept of hopeless causes that turn out not to have been completely without cause for hope. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/05.html#a140332" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a140540"></a>Wait there's more. Tell me the odds that the Giants and A's would both be in the World Series and that while the third game was getting started there would be a devastating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghAvIJ76WVo">earthquake</a> in the Bay Area. Please explain that one to me. So yeah I think there's a chance that Trump will go to jail, but I expect the truth will turn out to be much stranger than that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/05.html#a140540" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
