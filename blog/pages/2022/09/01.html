<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a131435"></a>When <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/08/kevin-durant-new-york-knicks-are-not-cool-anymore/">Kevin Durant said</a> the Knicks weren't cool, the Knicks immediately became the coolest team in the NBA. As a Knicks fan who couldn't care less if KD thinks they're cool, I just <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/reports-kevin-durant-requests-trade-from-nets">love</a> how it turned out. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/01.html#a131435" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a132117"></a>The beginning of the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2022/08.opml">month ritual</a> is done. I can't believe it's already September, on the other hand, it's freaking me out how cold it is this morning. I might have to put on a sweatshirt. It feels like summer just started. Maybe I need to move to Florida or Palm Springs. Oy. I love the mountains, but I dread the winter. Maybe it won't be so bad this year. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2022/09/01.html#a132117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
