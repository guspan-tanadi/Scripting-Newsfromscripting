He has advice about organizing, something he knows about, has had enormous success with. I actually read his <a href="https://nader.org/2020/07/31/ralph-nader-letter-to-aoc/">letter</a>, which is something I expect most of his critics didn't, because if they did, they would stop and think and maybe just maybe <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=get+a+grip">get a grip</a>. For liberals, Nader should be considered a pioneer of the stature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis">John Lewis</a>. He successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed">fought</a> to reform the auto industry, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Laura__Antonini/status/1294307355232894978">so much more</a>. I bet when AOC reads Nader’s letter, she will respond because she’s the real deal, as is Nader.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/15.html#a141013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141746"></a>BTW, I also write publicly to petition people in power to help the causes I believe in. You should do it too. Stick your neck out. It's easy to be a critic, much harder to stand for something. You'll find the assholes try to shame you.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142316"></a>Underlying all the bitterness, the liberals are angry that Nader elected Bush. That's the crazy part of their argument. The people who elected Bush are 1. The people who voted for him and 2. The Supreme Court. Illustrated in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIE0cT54yU">beautiful scene</a> from The West Wing. Josh, to Amy who is working for a third-party candidate. "He's taking the president's votes," says Josh. Amy responds: "Listen, I'm not indifferent to this situation, but that right there, that's the crazy part of your argument. They're not his votes." She's right. Nader ran for president. Gore lost (technically he gave up). Get over it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/15.html#a142316" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
