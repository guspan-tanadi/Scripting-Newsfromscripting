<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160110"></a>Here's a wicked idea.  Let Trump put <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/10/politics/donald-trump-mt-rushmore-kristi-noem/index.html">himself</a> on Mt Rushmore. Hopefully to be announced before the election, hopefully with great fanfare. That would get all the Democrats to turn out, and quite a few Republicans, now they can clearly see where Trump is going.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10.html#a160110" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140301"></a>It doesn’t matter to me personally who Biden picks, that said, the best choice imho is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/michigan-gov-whitmer-met-biden-running-mate-announcement-nears-n1236213">Gov Whitmer</a> of Michigan. Mainly because I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer">she'd</a> be a good president. She’s been tested in Michigan. I was impressed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/podcasts/the-daily/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-protests.html">this interview</a>, in April, at the height of the tensions in Michigan re their lockdown.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10.html#a140301" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I like it that way. I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075H32ZFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Logitech keyboard</a> which I like, but the keys are getting sticky, and it's blowing my concentration. I spend so much time at the keyboard. The keyboard should be transparent, I should never have to think about it while writing. As I look <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=backlit+keyboard&crid=1CCAK8VV2F5JV&sprefix=backlit+%2Caps%2C164&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_8">on Amazon</a> there aren't many keyboards that are illuminated, at least from companies I've heard of, and the prices are suspiciously low. I would buy one from Apple if they had one. The model that I have now has been discontinued, it seems.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10.html#a140753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a145429"></a>My two cents on Kamala Harris and baggage.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10/145153.html?title=ifBidenDoesntChooseHarris#a145429" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145200"></a>She has the worst kind of baggage. She's already tried to humiliate Biden, unfairly, in public. It didn't work. My experience in life is if you let something like that go, they do it again and again. The relationship is over. She took a calculated risk and it didn't work. That's the way business and politics work. You don't often get do-overs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10/145153.html?title=ifBidenDoesntChooseHarris#a145200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145248"></a>She can run for president again, maybe she'll win, but it would be a sign of weakness and ignorance, even naiveté for Biden to choose her. There are so many other possibilities. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10/145153.html?title=ifBidenDoesntChooseHarris#a145248" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145304"></a>He may just have to weather the nonsense from Harris supporters, and there are many and they are vocal, and pushy (not her, her supporters, some of whom I consider friends), and then we can tell the people who are trying to raise hell that they're playing with our lives and their own lives, and they should just let it rest. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10/145153.html?title=ifBidenDoesntChooseHarris#a145304" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145341"></a>That said, she's also from California, which won't get you a lot of votes in Iowa or Wisconsin.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/10/145153.html?title=ifBidenDoesntChooseHarris#a145341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
