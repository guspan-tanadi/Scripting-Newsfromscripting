<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a181058"></a>I wonder why the DNC didn't create an actual crowd for one or two speeches. It can be done safely. Look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4">eulogy</a> Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Maybe they'll create such an event tonight for the presidential nominee. I went to Obama's acceptance speech in Denver in 2008 in a football stadium. Quite an event. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/20.html#a181058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm sure they've thought it through, but next year we'll know a lot more about living with the virus than we do now. Look at how much we've learned in the last six months. Net-net, we'll do better in terms of human lives, if we give it more time. Work up to it slowly. Maybe have conferences on campus but do everything else online. Create projects for people to do collaboratively. I know the economics are dismal. But I think it's better if universities die to keep students alive rather than the other way. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/20.html#a143547" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
