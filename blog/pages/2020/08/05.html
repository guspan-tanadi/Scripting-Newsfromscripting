I remember as a kid being really pissed off that so much of my youth was wasted sitting in rooms with my hands foldeed, with my mind anywhere but in school, learning nothing and being bored out of my mind. I thought of school as very lazy, unimaginative, typical of adults. It wasn't really until grad school that school started working for me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/05.html#a142329" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-collapse="true"><a name="a145542"></a>I saw a comment by longtime friend <a href="https://twitter.com/gartenberg">Michael Gartenberg</a>. He has a good speaking voice. I love radio btw. It's my second favorite medium. I wanted to chime in, to expand on what he said, but I also saw he wasn't the founder of the channel, so I opted not to. He was talking about how these platforms might involve if rich individuals started them as pet projects. Thinking of Benioff and Time, or Omidyar and the Intercept, Bezos and the Washington Post. Also the cautionary tale of Thiel and Gawker. He basically bought Gawker with a lawsuit, then destroyed it. I wanted to add it could be even worse, there are a fair number of super-rich individuals who could buy Twitter. Its stock is cheap. How that would rock our world. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions#a145542" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Think of it as a radio station or a venue like an arena or stadium. I'm sure that's what their business plan calls for. And also probably proprietary rights for all of it, i.e. no competition allowed unless you have good lawyers. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions#a150059" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150753"></a>Back in the 90s my friend Sylvia had a series of Cybersalons, open discussions for random Silicon Valley people. It was funny how every discussion very quickly became How Do Artists Get Paid? It was the only issue that ever got discussed. At <a href="http://bloggercon.scripting.com/">BloggerCon</a>, a few years later, the question was How Do Bloggers Make Money? I'm guessing something similar will happen here. But what will the subject be. It'll have something to do with people getting paid, probably. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions#a150753" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
