Mail lists, Facebook groups, GitHub threads, Clubhouse chatrooms. People in these flat structures always behave the same way over time. After 40 years of being part of online groups, I see there are no new tricks in the human species, these things always evolve the same way. That's what this podcast is about. Might be a chapter in a book someday. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/25.html#a155605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It takes a special kind of racism to act on it the way they do. I think it's best described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy">white supremacy</a>. All kinds of things freak them out but the one that they can't live with is equality for "others." Strips their gears. Not negotiable. They'll <a href="https://twitter.com/mluckovichajc/status/1298027757990010881/photo/1">tear the country down</a> before they let that happen. As long as all they have to do is vote. They're not very strong, and as soon as hard times really hits them they'll crumble. They've lived sheltered lives for generations, feel entitled.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/25.html#a153708" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't even like it when people inadvertently get the facts wrong. But geez these people aren't even trying to be truthful. Let's do something constructive instead.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/25.html#a132832" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
