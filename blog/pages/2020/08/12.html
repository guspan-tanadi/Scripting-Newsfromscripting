Might still be able to resurrect it. But there's going to have to be a very deep cleaning. And some people are going to jail.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/12.html#a154550" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a113331"></a>No debates about the Democratic ticket. The choice is do you want to die. If you want to live vote Democratic. If you want to die vote Republican.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/12.html#a113331" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150255"></a>The Democrats should be able to have a limited kind of rally. Flying in and out of airports, to outdoor gatherings, masks required, good distancing.

Perhaps they should outsource marketing to the <a href="https://lincolnproject.us/">Lincoln Project</a>. On the other hand, I would have preferred for this one ad, that Trump be left out of it.

Transferring data from my iPhone XS/Max, after many tries because the old phone has four times the memory of the new phone. I had to delete a lot of stuff. But now it seems to be chugging along. It's quite a bit smaller than the original phone. First thing I want to do is take some pictures to see how well the camera works. Update: I gave up on the over-the-air update, and used an iTunes backup I took last night. Most of the data appears to have been preserved. All my music and photos are gone (but backed up on my Mac).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/12.html#a125146" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a130341"></a>And since you can mention no one, you can make it so that no one can respond to a post. This is a good feature because people can still comment on your tweet by RTing it, but they can't speak to everyone who reads it unless you let them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/12/130240.html?title=twittersLatestChangeIsGood#a130341" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a130923"></a>It's the Twitter equivalent of what I say to people who want to comment on my blog posts. Start a blog, I advise, and say what you have to say and link to my post. Of course what they really wanted was to use my flow to (very often) zing me personally in some way. I consider that spam. Or hijacking. It gets so insidious so quickly that I haven't had comments here for any duration for many years. It starts off collegial, but quickly devolves into abuse as the trolls take over. And that's exactly what has happened on Twitter. Completely predictable.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/12/130240.html?title=twittersLatestChangeIsGood#a130923" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a131023"></a>People like to say Twitter is about conversation, but that isn't my experience. Very little illuminating conversation.
