I did this podcast as an adjunct to the piece, <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt">below</a>, on packing the court. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09.html#a213516" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182213"></a>Whenever you eat something with some mass to it, a big Diet Coke is great because it gets in underneath all that and moves it around. I don't know why that feels so good but it does. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09.html#a182213" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a180652"></a>Why do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/nyregion/ny-police-unions-racial-disparity-trump.html">police unions support Trump</a> when Repubs aren't funding local governments. I don't see how that's good for police.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09.html#a180652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161253"></a>If I had a column in a publication that people respected and read, my first piece would be about this. The power in the United States comes from the people. When we make everything about the parties and their personalities we lead the country to authoritarianism. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09.html#a161253" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

His supporters should see him in his all his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekChFdIe00">Captain Queeg</a> paranoia. Explaining the strawberries and how no one listens to him. Calling for a former president who many of them voted for to be put in jail, or perhaps worse. Maybe some of them will be shaken out of their entertainment stupor and realize this is the president of the United States, a formerly great country that is being flushed down the toilet because people in the middle of the country feel unappreciated, bored and purposeless. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09.html#a131405" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a151210"></a>The court at 6-3, if it gets to that, will be far out of sync with the people they're meant to govern.

	<li><a name="a151249"></a>Further, if it is a huge win for Dems, they will be mandated to do something else. Change the Constitution so we have a democracy, not something that can be so easily hijacked.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt#a151249" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a151256"></a>The press has a lot of gall trying to pin the Dems to "packing" the court. The press are citizens too, and voters, and have an interest in how the country works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt#a151256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a151306"></a>They should ask themselves, before trying to make a controversy, in alliance with the Repubs, do they accept a 6-3 conservative majority?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt#a151306" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Now is the time for the press to stop and think, am I in favor of the United States? That is not too big a conflict of interest to carry. Then you should be careful when you try to create controversy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt#a151317" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
