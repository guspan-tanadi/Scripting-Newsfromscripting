In January, if he weren't insane and deaf he could have gotten his approval ratings to 90% simply by doing exactly what science said to do. He would be coasting to a landslide election at this point.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/06.html#a135037" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Good performance and pricing too. I've migrated all of my network apps to DO. Started using their database platform a year ago, and it "just worked." I don't like all the jargon in the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-digitalocean-app-platform-reimagining-paas-to-make-it-simpler-for-you-to-build-deploy-and-scale-apps/">writeup</a> of their new <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?i=e2ff93">app platform</a>, but it's probably pretty good. Glitch is here too, but I don't think "real" developers get that it'll be useful for them, but it is. The core idea is put your app on GitHub, connect it to a node on the host (Digital Ocean, Glitch, etc), and deploy changes by updating on GitHub. I expect Microsoft will be here too. Imagine a button on the repo that says Deploy (MS bought GitHub recently). We're about to see a huge simplification of writing apps for the net. There's no reason it can't be a lot easier. Note that AWS or Google aren't remotely here, their systems are labyrinthine, designed for the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22priesthood%22&t=h_&ia=web">priesthood</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/06.html#a160626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
