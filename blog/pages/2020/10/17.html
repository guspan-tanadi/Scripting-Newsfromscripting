<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a022030"></a>Just watched <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moneyball">Moneyball</a> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70201437">Netflix</a>. Iâ€™ve seen it before and read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818">book</a>, but itâ€™s good to get a refresher. Everything, not just baseball, needs a fresh look, because weâ€™ve been doing so much the same way we always have, without thought, not questioning out-of-date assumptions.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/17.html#a022030" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/17/kranepool.png"><a name="a180320"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/17/kranepool.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I am usually interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball">MLB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association">NBA</a> playoffs, but this year I practically ignored them. The reason, in retrospect, is that sports is all about the ritual, the continutity, the historic connection. Novelty feels wrong. For example, I still haven't gotten over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter">Designated Hitter Rule</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal">three-point shot</a> in basketball still seems like an innovation. I like sports because they connect to the past. I went to games as a kid with ancestors who are now gone. "What did the Mets do?" was the beginning of every kitchen table conversation in the house I grew up in. It was the default. To this day my brain says those words when it's idle. This season was a heroic effort for both sports, esp the NBA with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble">bubble</a>, but the only heroism that gets me to pay attention to sport is what happens on the court and on the field.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/17.html#a180320" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
