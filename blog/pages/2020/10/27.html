<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a205801"></a>I was driving up <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rock+City+Rd,+Woodstock,+NY+12498/@42.0451038,-74.1204888,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89dd074a1c5d71cd:0x26f6555bfe042b4b!8m2!3d42.0451038!4d-74.1183001">Rock City Road</a> earlier, and there were all these cars parked on the side of the road, and I had no idea what they were there for. I thought maybe someone famous had died, but no, they were all there to vote. The line was very long.

I voted <a href="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/10/23/letter-vote-yes-on-woodstock-library-bond-issue/">yes</a>. This is a very hot local issue. I see signs all over town on the <a href="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/10/23/letter-vote-no-on-woodstock-library-bond-issue/">issue</a>. I read the posts in the local Facebook groups. And while I'm new here, I am a taxpayer, and I will have to pay more property taxes to support the new library.  Here's why I voted yes. If the librarians want a new library, give it to them. They know what the town needs. They are the most selfless, idealistic people, by profession. Librarians <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html#a125814">helped me</a> a lot when I was a kid. I think this is what taxes are for. Funding libraries is directly related to the quality of life in a town. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27.html#a200053" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a160212"></a>First a story... <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160212" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a160209"></a>I once lived on a narrow road, so narrow there was barely room for two cars. When approaching an oncoming car on this narrow lane, at first, when I was a newbie to the neighborhood, I’d do the neighborly thing and move to the right to make room. Always, the other car wouldn’t budge, so I’d have to pull off the road and slow to a stop. I found this frustrating of course, an example of selfish, Republican-like behavior.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160209" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160327"></a>Then I altered my procedure. When I saw a car approaching, I would still move off the to right, but if they didn't mirror my move, I'd veer directly into their path. This makes my car look bigger, and more of a threat to them. No need to honk my horn. The action is enough. Immediately, the other car <i>always</i> moves to the side, and I then move to my side, and we pass each other, both fully on the road, and going at normal speed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160444"></a>I assume these are otherwise good people who are selfish, like most people are, and will see your offer to get out of their way as weakness, and they'll just plow through you. Like Republicans. If you show you are selfish too, they'll negotiate for a win-win. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160444" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a160518"></a>Soooo, this is where we are. The Repubs walk all over the Dems. But if you love America, you have to vote Democratic, because the Repubs are crazy fascists. We have to teach the Dems how to be hardass motherfuckers, and insist that they have a head-on collision with the Repubs so they respect them, and in doing so, respect us. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160618"></a>We are right now poised to lose our system of government. Okay, we accept that. Let's go all the way. The Supreme Court is already tainted. Let's just go ahead and call them illegitimate. The line was crossed not with the new justice but with Kavanaugh. The moment he <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png">spouted</a> Clinton conspiracy theories in his confirmation hearing was the moment I realized the enemy isn't just in the Oval Office, but in the Supreme Court too. We need to either get Kavanaugh and his ilk off the Court, to re-establish its legitimacy, or so dilute their vote as to make them irrelevant. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160618" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Fine. So we'll stack the court for them too. Instead of just adding four or six new justices, let's add <i>1000</i>. All of them card-carrying members of the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party. The Repubs will ignore their decisions when they're in power, and the Dems will ignore the current 6-3 court which, I would like to add, in no way represents the people of the United States. We don't like Citizens United, we want the Voting Rights Act back in force (obviously) and we want the three justices appointed by the criminal traitor Trump removed immediately, or else we'll add <i>100000</i> new justices, starting right now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160809" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a161048"></a>If you don't like crazy, dear Republicans, then stop being crazy. And fuck off, we don't give a shit what you think. We love your tears. When you cry we are happy. Thank you very much.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a161048" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
