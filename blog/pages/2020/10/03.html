And you can tell he doesn't actually do anything, because the only thing he came up with for what he does is Make (sigh) America Great Again. Oh really. Is that what we're doing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/03.html#a005055" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150557"></a>Imagine you're a kid in a house where they love Trump. It's weird because they're admiring a bully, yet trying to make sure their kid knows bullies are bad. Every family has to deal with this one way or another. I wonder how they do it.

See, even the bully needs help from other people.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/03.html#a150557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Woodrow Wilson in 1918, got the Spanish flu and was disabled for the rest of his life as a result.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/03.html#a005329" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

For a moment at least the world seems to be straightening itself out. I might take a well-deserved break.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/03.html#a141639" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
