I just realized that Joe Biden may be <b>The Politician from Nowhere</b>. I can't think of a single issue that he's associated with. Oddly I think that's exactly what we need from a president in 2021.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/10.html#a202853" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153826"></a>New blog feature. There's now a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/06/bidenHarris2020.png">Biden/Harris ad</a> on the home page of my blog. In a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingDesktop.png">desktop browser</a> it's in the right margin. It was tricky on a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingOnPhone.png">phone</a>, so I just had the ad overlay the page, at .5 opacity. You can still read the text underneath it, but it's better if you scroll it out of the way. A blog version of a lawn sign. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/10.html#a153826" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155344"></a>I also changed my Twitter profile picture from a 2003 OPML Roadshow <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/daveTwitterProfilePicture.png">picture</a> to the Biden/Harris ad.

He calls it radical. It's the kind of judgment courts issue all the time. Look for ways to set things right.  Make everyone whole. The web should have remained open. Google and Facebook didn't respect that. So undo what they did. It's the way a programmer looks at things, and imho that's the right way, because it's tech we're talking about setting right. Usually they don't consult techies in these things, however. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/10.html#a144756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They interview Trump supporters in the middle of Pennsylvania. They don't think Trump is racist, and that he did the best he could with Covid.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/10.html#a150600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
