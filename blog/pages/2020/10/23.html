<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a161534"></a>I added a note to my <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/k5">status outline</a> with an update on my work on pork.io, which is getting a new name.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/23.html#a161534" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165440"></a>I like promoting other people's products when they're good. I am unhappy when I see bad products promoted by people I respect. If I think a product is not good, unless I think people will be hurt by it, or if the badness can be fixed and the product would then be useful, I'll generally say nothing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/23.html#a165440" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think that's been missing ever since we got to the moon.

And a way of measuring public opinion. No personal attacks allowed. Strict control via Mute button. This week the debate would be about the merits of approving a new radical Supreme Court justice in the middle of an election when everyone's attention is focused elsewhere. Some actions are so important they deserve everyone's focus. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/23.html#a141149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134051"></a>I am so exhausted from US politics, this state going back to the summer of 2016. I made it through about 15 minutes of last night's debate before I couldn't stand it. All it took was one gaffe from Biden to shred all hope of a reprieve from this <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22shitshow%22&t=h_&ia=web">shitshow</a>. Then I had a thought, what if Amazon released the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-delivery-of-prodigious-bribe-to-american-regime-for-make-benefit-once-glo">new Borat movie</a> a few hours early? Wouldn't that be great. So I looked. And they had! So I watched the first half, returned to the debate, which still was not over, and went back and watched a bit more, and returned to the debate just in time to hear the wrapup. Then I listened to Maddow's review of Trump's lies about Covid (the part  I had heard) and I felt better so I went to bed. Only to wake up this morning and find that the feeling if utter misery was even worse. The election is 11 days from now. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/23.html#a134051" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I laughed all the way. Out loud. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/23.html#a134654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
