You wouldn't have to go hunting for him. The public needs a pulse for guidance about what's going on. Not getting him on the podcast network at the time that say Cuomo was booting up was a mistake. I think it would have saved a lot of lives. I don't know, maybe he's being so effective inside the government that they can't spare him. But I've seen his main value this year as a reliable communicator.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/05.html#a142045" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This is why the world should pity us. We have a no-president president. Can you imagine how much Obama would know by now if he were president. Oy.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/05.html#a142357" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141541"></a>It's hard to believe but Repubs plan to challenge every absentee ballot in swing states. When they say it might take months to get a result, that's because they plan to make it take months.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152324"></a>You know how sometimes your brain as it scans sees one word but the word that's actually there is something else? It happens every time I see NakedJen's logo on Twitter. It says "nakedjen anarchist & agitator." But my brain always sees "antichrist" in place of anarchist. It keeps happening, finally I had to mention it. Sorry Jen, I have no idea what it means, if anything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/05.html#a152324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a150354"></a>One thing overshadows all other considerations. They swapped out the old user interface in favor of a new more modern-looking one. It is more attractive, better use of fonts, the text is generally more readable, and it has a brighter look. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/05/150332.html?title=whatsWrongWithFacebook#a150354" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
