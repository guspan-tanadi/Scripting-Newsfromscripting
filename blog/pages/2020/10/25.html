HBO was the <a href="http://www.tjwaldorf.com/brand-positioning-the-ladders-in-our-head/">#1</a> brand. Needed to be a little more like Netflix, but really it was pretty good as it was. Now the <i>max</i> part has coincided with it being a lot harder to use, virtually impossible if you use the popular Roku platform. At least for me. Looks like an epic mistake. At a time when the market is overloaded with lots of big brands (Disney, Apple etc) trying to diversity into a market already dominated by HBO, it's a really curious time for them to knock out their own legs. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/25.html#a171318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162200"></a>One thing that's so disappointing about the people I've met in tech is that they are mostly motivated by what they can take from others, rather than what they can build working with others. So often they could make so much more money by doing the latter. Stupid. (And of course money is far from the most motivating motive.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/25.html#a162200" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a172622"></a>I've now made it through the first two episodes of <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-queens-gambit">The Queen's Gambit</a>, and it is really good.

He writes about an "impenetrable wall of text." I wrote up some tips, and of course felt they should be public. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/25/173645.html?title=usingStructureInOutlines#a173653" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a173714"></a>Re the impenetrable wall of text -- try collapsing things, where the detail isn't of immediate concern, so you can see the structure. It would help me too as a reader, to see the old stuff collapsed, and be able to expand it as I need to. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/25/173645.html?title=usingStructureInOutlines#a173714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a173805"></a>Also hoist and dehoist are there to help manage complexity. You can hoist a section, by placing the cursor on a head with subs, and click on the pushpin icon in the left margin. It'll be the one that's enabled. Then when you want to return, click the other one. It's like a stack (it actually is a stack, of course).<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/25/173645.html?title=usingStructureInOutlines#a173805" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a174123"></a>Imagine a bookshelf of notebooks. You don't have every notebook open to all pages at the same time. It doesn't even make sense. You'd go crazy trying to find something. Same idea here. You've got tools to manage clutter, they take time to learn to use. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/25/173645.html?title=usingStructureInOutlines#a174123" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
