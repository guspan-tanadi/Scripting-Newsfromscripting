<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174118"></a>Kara Swisher's new podcast interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-alexander-vindman.html?action=click&module=audio-series-bar&region=header&pgtype=Article">Colonel Vindman</a>. He tells a good story. Honorable person in a corrupt administration. Very worthwhile. He answers the questions. I saw John Bolton on MSNBC last night, and he evades them. Vindman worked for Bolton. Vindman would make a good software tester, imho. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/01.html#a174118" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175834"></a>I installed <a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-alert-ny/">Covid Alert NY</a> on my Pixel 4a. It uses Bluetooth to collect IDs of phones I spend ten minutes within six feed of and remembers them for some period of time. If one of them reports positive with Covid, I get notified. It's contact tracing with phones that we've talked about for a while. Does it work? I guess I hope not to ever find out. Yes I know it probably is a huge drain on the battery and privacy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/01.html#a175834" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a174324"></a>I've been using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029">Podcasts app</a> on my iPhone, it's using a whopping 20GB for old shows I'm never going to listen to again (or maybe never listened to at all). I assumed it garbage collected, but it doesn't. Podcasts should age-out, user configurable.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/01.html#a174324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142427"></a>Trump can condemn white supremacists, but it doesn't matter, he still is one. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Occam's News%22&t=h_&ia=web">Occam's News</a>. What would a white supremacist say, now, if cornered on whether he's a white supremacist? They'd deny it.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142004"></a>During the Mueller investigation, I assumed they had Trumpâ€™s tax returns.

He didn't even make it <a href="http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler">to 60</a>. I'm sure he's happy on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">hippie</a> beach in the sky.

	<li><a name="a135749"></a>BTW, people may not know that <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/28/212326.html?title=uncleKenAndAuntDorothy">Ken</a> was an early blogger. He, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a>, were the first two users of <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a>, outside of UserLand. In 1998 or 1999. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/01/135725.html?title=happyBirthdayUncleVava#a135749" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135812"></a>He was my mother's brother, and nephew of German novelist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">Arno Schmidt</a>. He was the first member of my family born in the US. I was the second. He was only 10 years older than me, and was as much a brother as an uncle. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/01/135725.html?title=happyBirthdayUncleVava#a135812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135802"></a>It seems so weird that he could ever be as old as 75, but it's even more weird that he's been gone so long already. He died in Jamaica, in 2003, a few weeks before the first BloggerCon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/01/135725.html?title=happyBirthdayUncleVava#a135802" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
