<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9eAshaPvYw"><a name="a152945"></a>Did you see the movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9eAshaPvYw&feature=emb_logo">Death of Stalin</a>?

He talked for several minutes uninterrupted. Riveting. No doubt he's the best communicator the Dems have. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez">AOC</a> is great too, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi">Joe Trippi</a> (he should run for something). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> excels, esp the last few weeks. But Franken is tops.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04.html#a142750" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142845"></a>Also, I tried listening to <a href="https://alfranken.com/listen">Al Franken's podcast</a>. He has a long ad at the beginning, and I don't do that. He should find a different revenue model. He's got a long road ahead to come back. The podcast should be instrumental in that, but the advertising disgusted me, and I won't listen to it. Too many people with something to say do this. Shame. Podcasting wires you directly into people's brains when they have the attention to really listen. Don't waste that selling some cheesy house ornament or utility. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04.html#a142845" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<div class="divTitle"><a name="a135949"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter"><span class="spTitleLink">Checking in on Twitter</a></a><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
	<ul class="ulLevel0">
	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a135955"></a>I started writing in Twitter just now and it turned into a short list of where Twitter is at from my point of view. Likes and dislikes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a135955" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel1 ulBulletedSubs">
	<li><a name="a140032"></a>One thing I dislike in Twitter is seeing links to interesting stories that I can't read because they're behind a paywall.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140032" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel2">
	<li><a name="a140052"></a>This is happening more, it seems. I expect it is because the pubs are getting better at building circulation that way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140052" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a013907"></a>It seems Twitter could do something to help here. Either work out a deal with publishers that would allow Twitter users to read articles on a per-story basis. Act as a distribution platform. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a013907" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel3">
	<li><a name="a013947"></a>Or give users the ability to say "I don't want to see links to these pubs, because I don't subscribe to them." If we can't have the former, I want the latter. I'm tired of seeing links to stories I can't read. And subscribing to all the pubs with paywalls is ridiculous, of course. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a013947" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	</ul>

	<li><a name="a140121"></a>I also dislike that Twitter is so hierarchic. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140121" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel2">
	<li><a name="a140556"></a>People decide whether something is important based on who the writer is. There doesn't seem to be much room for ideas to circulate on their own merit. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140604"></a>There is a circle of commentators and you're either in or out. I'm out and you are probably too. (And I have a blue checkmark and tens of thousands of followers.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140604" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140617"></a>You can say all you want, but if it's outside your perceived area of expertise, no one will hear it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140617" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel3">
	<li><a name="a014202"></a>I'm an expert in using and building the kind of networks we use today. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a014202" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a014216"></a>But everyone thinks they're an expert in this, so that expertise counts for little. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a014216" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140654"></a>Having money automatically conveys value to your ideas. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel3">
	<li><a name="a014226"></a>It's the most transportable form of expertise, because (I guess) people think you can buy whatever expertise you personally don't have?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a014226" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	</ul>

	<li><a name="a140211"></a>I like writing in Twitter, and that makes me think a tool something like this for offline writing might be good.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140211" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<ul class="ulLevel2">
	<li><a name="a140740"></a>It's a lot like an outliner. Chunks of text. Twitter has fuzzy ways of navigating the structure. Hard to feel it. Outliners are pretty clear about the structure. And the structure is editable in an outliner. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140740" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a014426"></a>I've often wondered if an outliner wouldn't make a good writing tool for Twitter. I don't do it that way, so obviously at that level it's not there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a014426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a140243"></a>I dislike how hard it is to find something I wrote on Twitter. I pretty much have to get an idea into my blog so it can be indexed by the search engines. That's the only way I have any hope of finding it in the future. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter#a140243" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
