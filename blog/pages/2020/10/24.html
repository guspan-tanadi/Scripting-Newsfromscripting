<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144437"></a>I posted a very short question on Facebook. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1361834694023932">Do you know anyone like Trump? </a>I asked because I do. I grew up in Queens, a couple of miles from where Trump grew up, only ten years after. So there were lots of Trump-like people in my area. I'm constantly reminded, by something Trump does, of someone I knew in childhood. Anyway, after a dozen or so predictable responses, a former Apple exec, one who did a very good thing for my troubled company back in 1986, said yes he's had golfed with Trump, voted for him in 2016, and was going to vote for him in 2020. He lives in California, so his vote is symbolic, as is mine (I live in NY). It was jarring. No debate has followed, thankfully, and I hope it doesn't. I'm just going to leave it there.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/24.html#a144437" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urltweet="https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1320026106494332928"><a name="a154556"></a>A couple of hours later, the thread is still peaceful. Thankfully. My friend from the past refers to Trump as a businessman, which causes me to write this screed, which I did not add to the thread. I was curious to know, how does this businessman see the <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1320026106494332928">retired people packed</a> into his audience, no distancing, no masks. Are they his customers? His team? His employees? Competitors? Serfs? Prisoners? Slaves? What kind of animal do you treat the way Trump is treating these people? To Trump are they even people?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/24.html#a154556" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Recent <a href="https://www.wbur.org/npr/903512647/senate-report-former-trump-aide-paul-manafort-shared-campaign-info-with-russia">revelations</a> about Manafort say that pretty clearly.

Or do we remove the three Supreme Court justices he nominated, tear up all his executive orders, remove all the regulations passed by his agencies. Undo anything that can be reasonably undone. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/24/151634.html?title=willWeUndoTrump#a151820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
