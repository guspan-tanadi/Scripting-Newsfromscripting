So if one person in a crowd of thousands wears a mask, unless it's certain that person has the virus, it's not doing much to protect anyone.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/18/155605.html?title=correctingMediaErrors#a155612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a155652"></a>It has been said that if the Dems win the Senate and hold the House, it doesn't matter if Trump is re-elected, Congress will remove him. Not possible. It takes a 2/3 majority in the Senate, or 67 votes, to remove the president, and there aren't enough Republican seats at stake in the election to give the Dems that big a majority, even if they swept the Repubs. However there would be enough Democrats in the Senate to require a full trial, including testimony. Recall that the Senate not only didn't convict, they didn't allow an actual trial with witnesses and compelled testimony.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/18/155605.html?title=correctingMediaErrors#a155652" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a160021"></a>Repeating Russian misinfo, even to question it, is journalistic malpractice. It's the biggest mistake journalism keeps repeating. Journalism wields a lot of power, and that power is accountable to no one. It may be a bigger problem than Citizens United or court packing by either party.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/18/155605.html?title=correctingMediaErrors#a160021" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
