<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154149"></a>This <a href="http://scripting.com/">blog</a> started <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001509.html?title=26YearsBlogging">26 years</a> ago today. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKKLIrOGfUo">the song</a> for that occasion. I was so much older then I'm younger then that now. Of course when I woke up I had no idea. Totally spaced it out. Thanks to my friend Geraldine, one of my constant readers, for pointing it out. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07.html#a154149" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It was so good, one of the best shows ever. But a lot of people stopped watching the show during the second and third seasons, which dragged on, were slow, arduous at times and always dark. This also happened with The West Wing, it languished in its late seasons, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing_(season_7)">final season</a>, the campaign for Bartlet's successor, was riviting, emotional, idealistic, optimistic. A lot of people missed it. I rated both shows tops on <a href="http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/">my BingeWorthy list</a>. The finale of Mr Robot was a joy. I know it's hard to believe. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üí•</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07.html#a125649" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131640"></a>From December of last year, which feels like a decade ago, my <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/23.html#a120326">writeup</a> of the very last episode of Mr Robot. It's so vague and general it's not really a spoiler. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07.html#a131640" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Amazing. Please rate it, it should be among the top programs, even if the first season was better than the subsequent seasons. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07.html#a132321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a171658"></a>When they contemplate breaking up a tech company, this is how you should do it. Find the component of the company that really is open tech. Something that was open before they came along, that they foreclosed on, and used their monopoly to put everyone else out of business.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171658"></a>That's where you draw the line of separation. The core should be spun off into a new company that's well funded, with a charter to commercialize the tech while maintaining zero lock-in. Totally replaceable. Defined APIs that don't break.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171658"></a>If the company is viable with these constraints, great. If not, they have enough money to plan their own demise. The key thing is they cannot use their dominance to launch new products. Just the open tech.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171658"></a>You would find people willing to staff such a company, there are lots of idealistic developers, still, who believe in the open internet.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171659"></a>In Microsoft's case, in the 90s this would have meant spinning out the browser. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a001827"></a>Today with Facebook it would mean spinning out the open graph.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a001827" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171659"></a>With Google, it would have to be at least the core search engine. If Alphabet wanted to run ads on search, they'd have to get in line and compete with others who did. This is the price they pay for trying to use their dominance in search to control everything.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171659"></a>Google would also have to spin out Chrome, same way Microsoft would have spun out MSIE in the 90s.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a171659"></a>That's the basic idea. Look for the old open tech buried in the company, that is the source of their monopolistic control, and extract it. Hopefully it's <i>very</i> painful, to keep successors from tying to do it in the future.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies#a171659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
