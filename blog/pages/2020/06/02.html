<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211003"></a>Haven't heard this discussed on Twitter or in the news. Police are in trouble, their salaries are paid by localities whose tax base has crashed. We canâ€™t take them for granted. I have no agenda, other than a need to be safe, and know that the police are an important part of that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02.html#a211003" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

His enemy comes into focus, it's the people out there, complaining, again, like everyone else. They can't see how smart he is. He's got to do something about this. His speech on Saturday welcoming a new wave of space exploration didn't replace the protests as the top story. Alone in the dark White House, ignored, he hatched a plan to get the spotlight back on him.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/143200.html?title=trumpInChargeSoThere#a142400" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142623"></a>One of his aides had discovered that he could order the military into DC, due to a loophole in some law, so he was going to use that to bust out of the bunker, and get back in charge. I'll show him (er them) he said to himself (the <i>him</i> he was referring to was his long-dead father). I'll bring in the military and have them do something spectacular, even better than the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/blue-angels-thunderbirds-trnd/index.html">Blue Angels</a> flying over the cities to get all their attention (another of his spectacular plans that didn't win him the adulation he feels he deserves). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/143200.html?title=trumpInChargeSoThere#a142623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a145228"></a>Timed to perfectly coincide with his speech, like the music playing in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30QzJKCUekQ">Apocyalypse Now</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pByJkuv0q3Y">Rocky</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg6MqWYyts0">Patton</a>, the soldiers, on horseback, zoom in and clear the park for Trump's dramatic escape from the bunker! Super Trump. Accompanied by his sidekicks, The Law (Barr), The Gun (Esper) and The Troop (the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). Wonder Woman, of course, and the The Boy Wonder (Ivanka and Jared). Should we bring the dogs? Nahh that's too much he thought to himself but accidentally said out loud.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/143200.html?title=trumpInChargeSoThere#a145228" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a143106"></a>He spent two full days planning it out, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlV3oQ3pLA0">Captain Queeg</a> and the strawberries. He would prove conclusively he was really in charge, even if his father didn't think he was good for anything. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/143200.html?title=trumpInChargeSoThere#a143106" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a151918"></a>BTW, after Elizabeth Warren pulled out, we could have had a  discussion about why her candidacy failed, but every time I tried to speak, I was told I couldn't understand because I am not a woman.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a151918" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a151948"></a>Too bad, but 1/2 the electorate is male, and if you want to win, you'll need a lot of male votes. It's the same old shit, drive a wedge in the electorate, <i>your own electorate,</i> as a supposed winning strategy? It's nuts to think that could work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a151948" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152038"></a>Warren appealed to imho the worst in women, based on the belief that men should shut up and do what we say. Not unlike the flavor of the #blm discussion, btw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a152038" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152056"></a>The women wanted some uninterrupted time to wallow about how fucked up the world is and how women would never gain full equality. There will never be a woman president, they explained, because Warren was the best, and she didn't get the nomination. But Warren wasn't the best, and that was not the message of the Warren failure. They didn't want to hear it, and some of them, people I (used to) respect were incredibly abusive about it. These people don't want to win, they want pity. They were pretty clear about it. But I don't offer my pity in situations like this, because I don't accept the premise. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a152056" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a152054"></a>Warren wasn't a good-enough candidate. We aren't doomed to never having a woman president. But it isn't going to be Warren, until she's ready to be president for everyone. Obama did that, he didn't try to be the president for blacks, though blacks were rightfully proud, as I was, that our country had finally broken through on race, or so it seemed at the time. I will cry the day a woman is elected president, as I cried the day Obama won. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a152054" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154107"></a>I supported the hell out of HRC, and at first supported Warren, until she started dropping in nasty bits about men into her speeches. At that point I knew if she got the nomination, she'd never get enough votes from men to win. She would've gotten my vote, but I wouldn't have liked doing it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a154107" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a154108"></a>Yet my women friends in politics still don't see the wedge they're putting in the electorate, and possibly haven't considered the idea for next time there's a woman candidate with something to offer. Listen when a friend says you've made a mistake. You have to do it to win. If you won't do it, don't blame the world, take the blame yourself because you don't deserve to win.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/02/151909.html?title=warrensCandidacy#a154108" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
