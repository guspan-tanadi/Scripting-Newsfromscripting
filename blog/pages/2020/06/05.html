<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131544"></a>Maddow had a good point last night. If militia-like police are deployed by the government, without any identification, what's to stop civilians masquerading as police to start acting like government police? Maybe that's the point, if what you want is civil war. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/05.html#a131544" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Congratulations, <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/05/unsubAthletic.png">they made it easy</a>. As a result I will consider resubscribing if my interest in sports is re-kindled.

If you put people with all the flaws of normal people in uniforms like that they're going to act like pigs. 2.

	<li><a name="a135505"></a>I was raised by parents who reacted as if criticism was an attack. If you don't deflect it, you will be hurt. They taught me that. I learned later in life that listening to criticism is the key to success. Alan Kay revealed a truth. We criticize something because we want it to be better. We are invested in it being better. Listen because you want to learn how to be better.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/05/134346.html?title=listenToTheCritics#a135505" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134606"></a>In software, we call such critiques <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/06/30/writingGoodBugReports.html">bug reports</a>.  Some problems only happen on the users' machines. Or you may have learned to not do something that they do because they never learned not to do it. Or they use features in a way you would never think to, that seem natural to them. Or they don't read the docs (and btw, neither do you). People see facets of your creation that you can't see because your point of view is different from theirs. If you want to improve, if you want to see things that are possible that are invisible to you, you must pay attention to criticism and brush aside the fear it invokes.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/05/134346.html?title=listenToTheCritics#a134606" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a134849"></a>So there's a huge hole in the perception of the NY Times of the world it is contained in, the point of view of their community. What a loss, for all of us. We are smart, educated, thoughtful people. We, collectively, know and see far more than the people they employ. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/05/135759.html?title=theNytAndCriticism#a134849" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
