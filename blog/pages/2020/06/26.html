<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a175831"></a>This may be the last I write about Trump. Suppose Trump were a brilliant political strategist. On hearing of how awful the virus was, in January, he would have thought to himself, "I just won re-election." How could that be you ask? Simple. He waits a bit until it's obvious to the press that it's an emergency then he gives a big Oval Office speech announcing the emergency and what we're going to do. It's exaclty what the CDC says to do. "This is going to hurt," Trump reads off the teleprompter, "but we'll get through it together." Then guess where his approval rating would be? 95%. Because that's how it works. We rally behind the leader in a time of crisis, even a douchebag like Trump. Who is more dumb than a sack of nails. I'm sure one of his advisors saw this as a political gift. All Trump had to do was listen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/26.html#a175831" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I just like to know where the <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=depravity">depravity</a> comes from, and were there any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissar">Russian commissars</a> in the room giving the orders?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/26.html#a134504" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

In my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens">neighborhood</a> in Queens, they said it about Jews, when we moved in. Many years later, same neighborhood, it was Chinese and Koreans. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York">Ulster County</a> it applies to people from NYC.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140412"></a>BTW, when the Chinese and Koreans moved in, <a href="https://ny.eater.com/maps/flushing-chinatown-nyc-best-restaurants">the food</a> got a <i>lot</i> better. Funny story. A few years ago my mother and I went out to eat at a popular Chinese <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-flushing">dumpling place</a> near Main St. The waiter asked if we were tourists. I said, no -- we're natives. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/26.html#a140412" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
