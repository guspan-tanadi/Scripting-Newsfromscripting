But we can listen, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html">empathize</a>, and try to do what they ask us to do to help. That would be success imho. Last night <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Melber">Ari Melber</a> asked a panel what victory looks like. It's a good idea for everyone to ask and answer that question. Let's find common goals and work together to achieve them. You have to figure out what needs to change to make America safe for blacks. We can help. One of the big lessons of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html">1619 podcast</a> was that the struggles of blacks for equality gave us all greater guarantees. This will happen again and again.

I'm sure she put as much care into the packages as I did in savoring them. Until I experienced the summer smell of camp, here and now, at age 65, mom gone, I never recalled those packages.
