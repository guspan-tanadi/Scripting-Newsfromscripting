<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a014528"></a>BTW, I never made software for iOS. I remember clearly when I decided not to. The day they announced the iPhone. I was expecting it to run Mac software. I had a great scripting environment for the Mac. I thought this is it, the perfect platform for me. Then I heard it was going to be nothing like the perfect platform for me. Now, 14 years later, give or take, the big story in tech is that it's an awful platform for developers.

Your ideas only have value if you have credentials to back them up. This method makes reporters easily replaced by algorithms, and keeps us from hearing the most interesting  even eclectic idea stimulating ideas. Of course no one in journalism will hear this because heh I lack the proper credentials. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/21.html#a174735" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165111"></a>The <a href="https://www.who.int/">WHO</a> had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/20/the-pandemic-is-accelerating-who-warns-of-dangerous-coronavirus-phase-video">something to say</a> that we all must hear, but they didn't get much coverage. We were all too busy focusing on Trump's shenanigans, as always. There should be a daily briefing with Dr Fauci, broadcast on all channels, treated as news, I don't care if he has to quit the government to do it. The WHO message is this -- the virus is spinning up to a new level, and it's going to cost us hugely to get it to quiet back down. This has to be said clearly and repeatedly with authority. In America the only one who can do that is Fauci. Without Trump, obviously. Maybe Wolf Blitzer, who clearly has a rapport with Fauci should take a leave from CNN to be his partner in this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/21.html#a165111" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
