The police may loom large as the biggest problem, but imho, they are far from the biggest problem. That's the virus, and the broken political system. We have to work together. That's the only way out.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/14.html#a201041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
