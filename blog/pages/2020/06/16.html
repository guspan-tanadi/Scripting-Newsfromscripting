Is this true? What is their protocol like? How do you get your data out if you decide to switch?

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a220326"></a>I'm thinking of providing free email too.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141638"></a>Every once in a while, Siri in my back pocket says "Sorry I couldn't hear what you said." I didn't say anything. Or my Alexa says it doesn't recognize my voice, would I like to register. It was Andrew Cuomo talking in a YouTube video. Little unforseen consequences. It's like being in an episode of Westworld. I'm sure it's already happened that the two have had conversations, being confused about what the other said. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16.html#a141638" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141944"></a>In the piece below I mention the two local papers in Madison in the 70s. I remember their names as the Crap Times and the Wisconsin State-Urinal. One of my roommates put that in my head.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16.html#a141944" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143308"></a>I'd love to get a picture of Neil Katyal's study as he appeared yesterday on Ari Melber. It looks like the room of someone who spends all his time online and in his mind. I recognize it, I've existed in such a space as long as it's been possible. Also the interview with Fauci with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday which by luck I watched live. They've known each other a long time, clearly are friends. Blitzer asked him a personal question, Fauci answered. He said he spends all his time writing emails. He puts so much in, and he must have so much frustration, given how badly we're doing, and how he's prevented from speaking. I keep wondering if we, online media tech makers, couldn't do more to help him communicate, given the limits of TV.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16.html#a143308" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143756"></a>I was a paper boy as a kid. I had a route. I delivered <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/sn84031844/">Long Island Star-Journals</a> to neighbors in Flushing on my bike. I was emulating the net. <i>Very</i> slowly. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16.html#a143756" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a133632"></a>When I was a grad student, I'd grab a copy of the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/">Chicago Tribune</a>, <a href="https://madison.com/ct/">Capitol Times</a> or <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/">Wisconsin State-Journal</a> and hang out at the <a href="https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/">Memorial Union</a> and catch up on the news, do the crossword or read the cartoons. The good old days in the 1970s. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a133632" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140913"></a>Today, I'd still want to hang out at the Union but I'd get out my laptop or iPad and read the news via Twitter and my <a href="http://scripting.com/river/">RSS river</a>. Key difference: Today  no single publication delivers the full news experience. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a140913" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a133920"></a>Looking back, they could have seen this happening, and done more to bind themselves to Twitter or RSS, or even produced their own hybrid and add their expertise as users of news. And if they had let it evolve it might have been, by now, a fantastic news reading and interacting experience, far better than what we use today. They didn't so this is where it's at now, an unbundled, Ã  la carte reading experience. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a133920" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134019"></a>But today the news industry is still set up as a business as if I'm going to get my news the way I did in the 70s. And how are they going to convince me to do this? A paywall. The price for reading the article that's caught my eye is to give them my credit card and the right to charge me $10 per month for perpetuity. No. The answer is no. Always no. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a134019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141402"></a>I wonder how many subscriptions the CEO of the Atlantic and Mother Jones have bought this way? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a141402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135438"></a>I'd like to see a bar graph with online subscription revenue for the top 15 pubs. I imagine it looks something like this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a135438" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a134117"></a>If you're a person who thinks about business models of news, ask yourself, how many subscriptions can one reader afford? Feel good about? Feel like they aren't being ripped off by? For me the answers to the three questions are: 3, 0 and 0. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a134117" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142330"></a>I'm paying about $30 per month for this, and am not happy about it. In contrast I pay <i>$200</i> per month for TV. And I'm ready to spend more. But, get this, I spend a lot more time every day reading on the net. And I know the news orgs don't think very much of us readers, but I'm not reading crap, I'm learning, getting information about a lot of local stuff (despite the belief there is no local news, there is). And I can afford to pay much more than I am, I'm just waiting for some part of the news industry to wake up and realize it's not the 1970s anymore. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a142330" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135655"></a>Another thing I spend a lot more money on that might be closer to news is political campaigns. As Election Day approaches, I'm giving out $100 gifts to candidates to help save the world, the same way I would like to throw money at news orgs who help to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&t=h_&ia=web">save my life</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a135655" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a142502"></a>Subscriptions? I don't think so. I don't commit to vote for the governor or mayor beyond the next election. It sounds stupid to even put it that way. I'm sure the politicians would like that. And there are good arguments for it. But we get to choose again and again. And that's how I like it. It keeps them interested in communicating with me, maybe even slightly, to listen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a142502" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a135839"></a>I've read so many stories about how news orgs feel about their role, maybe it's time for the news orgs to try to find out how their readers see their roles? Basic business. Know the people who pay your bills and do things that delight them. Not much of that going on with news. Too much talking to be heard by other news people. I visualize it as two barbers passing the time cutting each others hair. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a135839" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a134509"></a>BTW, I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626">wrote</a> about the news experience I want back in May.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a134509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
