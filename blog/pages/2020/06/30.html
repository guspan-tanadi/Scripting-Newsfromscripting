<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160629"></a>How many people died in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">atomic bombings</a> of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, vs the number of people who have died so far in the US of Covid-19? The numbers will surprise you.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a130349"></a>Little-known feature on Scripting News. You can read a whole month's worth of posts on one page. For example, here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/">page</a> for June 2020. I think you can see how the URL is formed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/30.html#a130349" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134622"></a>It would be interesting to make a list of people whose lives, net-net, matter and don't matter, and to what extent, and how that changes over time. For example, American soldiers' lives in Afghanistan didn't matter much before the latest scandal, but now we know their lives matter even less than we thought.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/30.html#a134622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a150843"></a>Cleaned up the row of icons to the right of every post. Now we have three, a link to the tweet, an icon to edit the post, and one to delete the post. There used to be icons that linked to Facebook and Wordpress versions of the post, but support for both products hasn't worked in a long time, so I disabled it in this release. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/30/150324.html?title=radio3WorkContinues#a150843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a150926"></a>BTW, I'm trying an experiment, editing the actual running copy of Radio3, so when you see a note appear here, you can immediately try the feature in the software. It's like climbing a mountain with no safety net. When I make a change that introduces a bug, you get to see that too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/30/150324.html?title=radio3WorkContinues#a150926" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
