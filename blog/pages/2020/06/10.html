<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a135058"></a>If blogging didn’t exist we’d have to invent it.  “People writing what they know, fluidly, publicly, with an archive for the future.”  <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1269645604159991808">That’s it</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a135058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Will this event actually happen?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a181714" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Create a website that's organized like the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/10/index.png">index</a> in the back of a book. It digests my new stuff every day (or hourly, even better), and adds each item under topics in the index.<i> </i>I'd like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs. But not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend hours reading a book via its index. A bootstrap. I'd love to help drive such a project. We need this. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a135456" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134856"></a>I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a135424">predicted</a> something like this. Yesterday at the supermarket, I glanced behind in the checkout line, saw a woman who had pulled her mask down. She seemed very naked, as if she had pulled her pants down and you could see everything. Sexual. Very forbidden. A month ago, it wouldn't have been a thing at all.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a134856" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I’ve been <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649">using</a> DuckDuckGo in my blog archive, thinking it’ll hold up better over time than Google searches, but I overlooked this, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/08/apple-acquire-duckduckgo-analyst/">Apple could buy them</a>, and I tend not to trust their links over the long haul. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a135137" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141119"></a>One thing that's needed is a canonical place to point about news that isn't behind a paywall. I want to point to something definitive from my blog for Defund The Police. All that Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=defund+the+police">finds</a> are news articles on paywalled sites, or ones infused with spyware, or ones whose archives won't last.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a141119" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I got a lot of suggestions, but I should have been clear about what I want.
