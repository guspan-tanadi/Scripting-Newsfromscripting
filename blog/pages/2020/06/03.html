<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a130814"></a>I use my iPhone when I ride my bike, for <a href="https://abvio.com/cyclemeter">Cyclemeter</a> and to play a podcast, so it’s not easily available to take pictures. I want a relatively inexpensive phone mainly to use as a camera. There doesn’t seem to be such a thing. I considered getting a regular camera, btw -- but it isn't what I want. I want a small, cheap phone with a decent camera.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a130915"></a>There shouldn’t be a season for causes. So right now anything other than #blm is off-topic. Until it's knocked off the top rung by a mass killing. Or a #metoo scandal. A climate crisis catastrophe. Or something Trump said (actually that doesn't seem to work anymore, thankfully). The virus is going to break that, because it's not going away, and it kills and disables more people, every day, than anything we've seen, ever. The suffering it causes is off the scale. But we should be able to see the thread that connects all these things. A lack of collective consciousness. An unwillingness to listen. We don't think, we only feel and feelings are easily manipulated.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/03.html#a130915" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131317"></a>Watching the behavior of American police this last week betrays the theory of a few bad apples.

It’s the people who use Facebook that matter. The company is run by pigs. Not sure what’s redeeming about the NYT. Well they did make RSS possible.
