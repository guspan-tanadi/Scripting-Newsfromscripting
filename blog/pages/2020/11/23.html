<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a183256"></a>Increased air travel for the holiday is a form of national suicide. But on CNN they give a lame version of the story. Trying to find normalcy flying to a big family dinner on Thursday is crazy.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/23.html#a183256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I have no idea what that means. For me, the function of an outliner is to let me record ideas and events to flow to different places over time. Flow is the big word. It's the <i>fluidity</i> of the outliner that makes the difference. I think of it as <a href="http://textonrails.com/">text on rails</a>. Paper and whiteboards are not so flexible because of limited space. Outlines have unlimited space. I can always add a note and the software automatically makes room. And I can move something without erasing it (a weakness of paper). Fluidity. Are outlines linear? Not in any obvious way, to me at least. A linear tool would force everything to be on one line, at one level. The point of an outline is that you can go infinitely deep. The work has <i>structure.</i> A line is unstructured. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/23.html#a171512" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163739"></a>As far as I know, no columnist or editorial board has called for the House and Senate to remove Trump before he can do more damage. There is a provision for it in the Constitution.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162042"></a>A big unreported problem in the political universe of the US is that our journalists are: 1.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a162107"></a>I'm about to give up on the holiday cards. All the sites are impossible to use. I want to put a picture on the front. A two-word message in front of the picture. Open the card, it says something like Happy Holidays, with my name, and enough room for me to write something. On the back it should <i>not</i> have an ad for the company. It should be just as simple as I've said here. I shouldn't have to figure anything out. Four questions, click Submit to preview.

The cool kids, including President Barack Obama, occasionally mocked him behind his back for his cornball earnestness." They're talking about Joe Biden, who is about to become our president. So maybe the idea of people inside and outside isn't serving us so well. I can't believe how long it takes our stupid political system to neutralize a <a href="http://this.how/trolls">troll</a>. If journalism weren't so walled-off from those of us with our faces "pressed against the glass" we might have avoided a lot of the still-unknown <s>damage</s> carnage of the Trump years. Two consecutive uncool presidents. Maybe it's time to air things out a bit, open the window. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/23.html#a155154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The bad news is that the <a href="https://substack.com/">new incumbent</a> is yet another tech startup. If we want the net to work, we need some institutions that are not-for-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> is a good backstop.

The author makes a good point. There is a coup built into the Constitution in the delay between the election and inauguration. Too much time for a president who has been voted out to do damage. Previous presidents have limited the damage because they were goodfellas, and wanted to be seen by history as such. But now we have a mad king who doesn't give a shit what you think.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/23.html#a154602" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154332"></a>Has anyone considered that the Trumps want to delay the transition because the Bidens will then find out that they’ve gutted our government. And that there’s actually no plan for distributing the vaccine. In other words it's a coverup. Hoping some catastrophe comes along that makes it unnecessary to do a transition. Think about how long Trump has stalled the release of his tax returns. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/23.html#a154332" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
