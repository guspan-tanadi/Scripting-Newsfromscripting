They can keep talking, that’s their right. But I can choose not to listen. There’s a limit to respect. I don’t listen to people when all they have to say is how they hate me.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/06.html#a143620" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153013"></a>The news should reflect what the Trumps are really doing with the lawsuits. They're going to pitch state legislatures that the election was stolen and they should appoint different electors. The lawsuits just have to get press coverage and show up in opinion polls. They wouldn't have to flip too many states with Republican legislatures. For example: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/06.html#a153013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Seal it off but, everyone but Trump can leave, send him food and water and people can visit to see the imprisoned former president. When he dies embalm him.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/06.html#a143637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They should have people entering the numbers that the announcer says from a keyboard. And the performance is awful. Get a higher-rated CPU.
