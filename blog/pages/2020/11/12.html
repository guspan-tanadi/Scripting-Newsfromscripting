The Dems will use the power of the US government to be sure the Georgians get through the winter of the pandemic in as good shape as possible. The Repubs will not. It's really simple. And when they save the lives of thousands of Georgians, they will also be saving the lives of many thousands of people in every other state of the union. That's power! Thanks in advance to Georgia for helping us out. We won't forget. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12.html#a215410" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't like riding a stationary bike, I tried mounting my street bike on a Zwift device, and yuk, I didn't like the simulated racing, I don't ride competitively. And the street scenes were primitive. Unlike my regular real-world rides I always was impatient for the exercise to be over. When I'm riding outdoors, I feel very differently.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/213708.html?title=homeExerciseInWinter#a213715" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213903"></a>A friend suggested getting a rowing machine, and somehow that seemed better. But when I looked into the devices I started feeling it might be the same. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/213708.html?title=homeExerciseInWinter#a213903" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a213929"></a>We just had five unusual warm November days, I rode all of them, outdoors, and was thinking that the difference may be the feel of the ride. Real bike rides you almost never are straight up and down. You lean one way then another, and shift your weight to different sides. Maybe that's the diff. Then I saw an ad for <a href="https://www.bowflex.com/bikes/velocore.html/">this Bowflex bike</a> that leans! It looks in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DseC78ShNc">video</a> like it may be more fun to ride. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/213708.html?title=homeExerciseInWinter#a213929" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a214048"></a>I posted a bit about this <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1326968117579436037">on Twitter</a>. Megan McCarthy sent a <a href="https://twitter.com/Megan/status/1326968332717789196">pointer</a> to a review of the <a href="https://www.reviewed.com/health/best-right-now/best-stationary-exercise-bikes">category</a> and a <a href="https://www.reviewed.com/health/features/echelon-review-cheaper-spin-bike-good-peloton">specific bike</a> I asked about. I might get a Peloton, but it seems I might not have it until January. I'd like to start riding daily asap. But I'm concerned I'm going to spend a lot more money and still not have something I want to use. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/213708.html?title=homeExerciseInWinter#a214048" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

I did a little investigating, and found that it already supports them. So I thought it might be a good idea to explain what they are and how they work, maybe other people will find it interesting and/or useful.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/151519.html?title=includesInLittleOutliner#a151528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151637"></a>The idea comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language</a>. It had the ability to include one file in another. When you included a file, it was as if its text was present in the file doing the including. The C compiler couldn't tell the difference. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/151519.html?title=includesInLittleOutliner#a151637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flCodeSubs="true" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172933"></a>This is what a C include statement looks like. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/151519.html?title=includesInLittleOutliner#a172933" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151814"></a>In an outliner it works similarly. A node is an <i>include</i> if it has a <i>type</i> attribute with the value include, and a <i>url</i> attribute that points to an OPML file with the outline to be included. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/151519.html?title=includesInLittleOutliner#a151814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151938"></a>When you expand an include in LO2, the text from the included outline is expanded below the node. You can edit the text, but none of the edits will be saved to the included file. You should think of it as read-only, even though LO2 doesn't enforce that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/151519.html?title=includesInLittleOutliner#a151938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a151909"></a>Here's <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/mi">an outline</a> that opens in LO2 that illustrates. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/12/151519.html?title=includesInLittleOutliner#a151909" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
