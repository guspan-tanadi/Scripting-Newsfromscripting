If Democrats marketed to white people, just a little, they could pick up another ten percent, because they donâ€™t do any now. That could make a big diff. I've been wanting to talk about this for most of 2020, but wanted to wait for things to settle down a bit. It worked, we voted Trump out, but we can do much better, and be much stronger. This is a 20-minute manifesto, a plea, an idea that's worth listening to imho. PS: The rep I was thinking about was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/13/elissa-slotkin-braces-for-a-democratic-civil-war-436301">Elissa Slotkin</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/17.html#a190035" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Previously I had used <a href="https://twitter.com/nycjim/status/1328696592711503872">CVS</a>, and their online service was awful, and their in person service was spotty. I expect Amazon's drug store will work work like Amazon, i.e. as you would expect given that it's 2020 not 1990. I wish Amazon would go into competition with banks, so I could do my checking with them. I have an Apple credit card, btw -- and it works way better than the ones the banks issue. Perfectly integrated with my iPhone. And I use Google Fi, again, way better than T-Mobile et al. I don't know why the banks, drug stores, airlines, credit cards, you name it, can't just copy the online services, but clearly they can't. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/17.html#a143156" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
