<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131511"></a>My parents weren't perfect, but they had democracy down. Each year my mother or father would take us voting with them. We went into the booth, watched while they flipped the switches in the old style voting booth, and then pulled the big lever that opened the curtain, logged the vote and we went on our way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/03.html#a131511" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131541"></a>When I was 17 I was too young to vote, but I really wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election">McGovern</a> to win. I was campaigning for him, going door to door <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Rockaway,_Queens">where</a> ever the campaign sent us. My father didn't have a strong opinion, so he let me have his vote. One of the nicest most memorable gifts he gave me.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/03.html#a131541" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131421"></a>It's weird that Trump doesn't have a big ballroom reserved for tonight filled with supporters, exchanging their viruses. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/03.html#a131421" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a133900"></a>The <a href="https://soundcloud.com/twistartups/twist-e1133">interview</a> I did with Jason Calacanis is out.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132321"></a>I'm loving <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/better-things">Better Things</a>. It's smart, funny, classy, nutty, loving and lovable, and sexy. The characters are great because they all remind me of someone dear to me. It's not Le Grand Binge, it's more like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuse-bouche">amuse-bouche</a>, something to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser">cleanse the palate</a>, before going onto more serious fare. Right up there with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock">30 Rock</a>, another of <a href="http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/">my favorite</a> shows. I'm still in Season 1 on Better Things. Savoring each episode because it makes me feel good, in times when feeling good isn't the norm. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/03.html#a132321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
