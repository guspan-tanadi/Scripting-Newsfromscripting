If you or someone you love gets the virus, probably never. Because no one knows what the lingering effects are. We know some people are devastated by the symptoms. And we don't know if people who appeared to have been symptomless really were, or people who appear to have recovered really are recovered. This is a new disease. Not much is known about it. It's weird and different. If you roll the dice, the cost of a losing bet is unknown. One Thanksgiving dinner of apparent normalcy isn't worth risking the rest of your life being crippled, disabled or in pain, or seeing someone you care about similarly affected.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21.html#a171334" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Create a deck of cards with the images of each NBA player. 2. Throw away 2/3 of the deck at random. 3. Arrange the teams around a table. 4. Deal the cards out as if it were a card game.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21.html#a160011" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141535"></a>I've watched Maddow the last two nights. It's great that she's back. In quarantine because her partner, Susan, got Covid and Maddow was exposed. So she did an incredible job of setting up a studio at home, by herself, yet she was so apologetic for the lack of makeup and the homeyness of the surroundings. I wanted to ask her to stop. We don't tune in her show for the makeup or the studio.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a141535" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143259"></a>She should take care of herself, because she's as essential to our sanity (speaking mostly for myself) as her partner is to her (as she explained on Thursday night so eloquently). She doesn't know it apparently, but a lot of us rely in her continued presence as a signal that we're still ourselves, no matter what we're asked to accept.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a143259" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141613"></a>I've been hearing from readers of my nightly email that sounds a lot like what I just said about Maddow. It's kind of a heartbeat. Not so important whether we agree or not, just the continued presence of the email that arrives in the minute after midnight Eastern time, every day, as long as my heart is beating. That means something to people, and that means a lot to me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a141613" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141712"></a>I've been planning on re-arranging my office for the last few weeks, bought a new office chair, cleared a larger space than I was using previously -- re-purposing the old desk I used for writing, at the one-bedroom Manhattan apartment for most of the 2010's. It has enough room for two monitors. And now I'm using it. It feels weird. Like I'm writing from a foreign country. Maybe as Maddow feels, being separated from her team, trying to believe her home office is just as powerful as the one in Manhattan. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a141712" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145140"></a>My new desktop, like hers, is in the country. Funny thing is, I always assumed Maddow was coming, during the pandemic, from her home in the Berkshires. I guess she was still commuting to the city to do her show? These days you just don't know. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a145140" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a141959"></a>Anyway, after watching last night's Maddow, the overwhelming thought is that we've way gone too far in tolerating the Republicans. It isn't enough to replace them in the White House, there has to be punishment for what they're doing. If Biden won't do it, we must do it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a141959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a145317"></a>The humiliation that this country is suffering at Republican hands is unacceptable.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152917"></a>Yet a minority party, with no honor, no sense of American pride, not an molecule of humility, stands in the way of our president starting to do our work, the work we chose him to do. Nothing trivial, just saving our fucking lives. For crying out loud. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a152917" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The air travel system must be shut down now, as it was in the aftermath of 9/11. It's carrying something much more lethal than terrorists. We need to care for the sick, and stop creating more sickness, and get ready for distribution of the vaccine. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/21/141242.html?title=maddowIsBackImStillHere#a142816" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
