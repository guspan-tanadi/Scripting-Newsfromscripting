The virus would be like AIDS, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_HIV/AIDS">transformed sexuality</a> in the 80s and 90s. There wasn't much of a "safe sex" concept before AIDS. Back then, if we were as crazy as we are now, people would say "it's my right not to wear a condom. You're infringing on my civil liberties!" A condom to protect against STDs is fairly analogous to wearing a mask to protect against Covid. There is no vaccine for AIDS, roughly 40 years later. So we had to transform and learn new societal norms. We apparently will not have to do that for Covid-19. Shame. Because we really do need to learn how to work each other, for many other reasons. This is not the last crisis we're going to be facing collectively, and a new understanding of what our rights are is called for. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/27.html#a164348" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a173045"></a>I'm going to get the vaccine as soon as I can. If I get vaccinated, now you aren't my problem, not personally. I might urge you to get the vaccine or wear a mask because I care about other people, but it's not about me anymore.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/27.html#a173045" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165523"></a>In the early days of the virus I said it would <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+virus+smarter">make us smarter</a> because there's no way out that doesn't require us to be smarter. It was true, we did get smarter. But we didn't have to work together. We will be able to get out of this, individually, even if people are in it only for themselves and some immature misguided sense of what their rights are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/27.html#a165523" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Then I thought, is he really the president of the United States? He plays golf and other than that probably not much more. Can you say you're president of the United States if you aren't doing the job?  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/27.html#a160112" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Do you still live rent-free in Trump's head? I always wondered why campaigns stop entertaining us with videos when the election is over. That's when the fun starts, esp if you won. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/27.html#a155548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
