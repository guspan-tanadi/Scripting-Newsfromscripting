<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153135"></a>As I was writing the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/18.html#a143633">bit</a> below about Emily Murphy, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/politics/biden-transition-trump-delay/index.html">CNN published this story</a> about her and the transition she's holding up, and why. She says she didn't sign up for this, but that's the way it goes sometimes. She's being called on to save her country. This is about as must-read as anything I've ever seen.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/18.html#a153135" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a154041"></a>I'd like to see a graph of all the people I follow, to see how many are connected to Trump, via a "follows" arc. I'd like to be able to disconnect from all of them. I'd like to exist in a Twitterverse that is completely disconnected from Trump. Even better if it's dynamic, so I can automatically re-follow them once they disconnect from Trump.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/18.html#a154041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/18/chessKing.png" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a144423"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/18/chessKing.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(novel)">Chess is on my mind</a>. If we were playing chess with Trump, he hasn't knocked over his king yet, and he's right not to, given the rules he plays by, he still has a shot at winning. Losing as we know is a terrible <i>personal</i> outcome for him, not just the ego stuff, but practically speaking, he's been caught doing crimes that you go to jail for. Ask <a href="https://apnews.com/article/7fa7f6d50c0aa6eae648a56b14065615">Michael Cohen</a>. Most of us would accept the outcome, concede, show up for trial -- but not Trump. So even after the Electoral College votes, until he actually leaves the White House, it isn't over. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/18.html#a144423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a143633"></a>Why is no one talking about <a href="https://twitter.com/GSAEmily">Emily Murphy</a>, administrator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_W._Murphy">GSA</a>. She's the single government official who could turn this situation around, yet she <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_W._Murphy#Refusal_to_begin_presidential_transition">refuses</a>. Why haven't there been any interviews? She has more power in this matter than any governor, or secretary of state, or McConnell even. Later it won't be so clear, once this situation has <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=fester">festered</a>, but right now she alone has the power to turn the corner. I suggested on Twitter the other day we send her flowers with cards that say "Write the letter."<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/18.html#a143633" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I think Claire Foy's queen with Lithgow as Churchill was the best combo. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw">reminder</a> of how wonderful she is. The current season so far is good, a must-watch, but not as compelling as previous seasons.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/18.html#a150550" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
