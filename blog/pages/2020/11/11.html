He says we should be out in the street protesting now. "Coups are defeated quickly or not at all. While they take place we are meant to look away, as many of us are doing. When they are complete we are powerless. In an authoritarian situation, the election is only round one. You don't win by winning round one. Peaceful demonstrations after elections are necessary for transitions away from authoritarianism, as in Poland in 1989, Serbia in 1999, or Belarus right now." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/11.html#a151616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a174247"></a>More exploration into the world of Fargo blogging. Here's the <a href="http://this.how/kimParkerBlog/fargo.opml?format=opml">OPML source</a> for <a href="http://bloatware.org/users/kim/">Kim Parker's blog</a>. Kim Parker is a fictitious person, a support person at a tech company called <a href="http://bloatware.org/">Bloatware</a>. Her blog was the example I used in the docs for Fargo's CMS. Not sure why I used #attributes instead of using outline attributes, which are hidden and out of the way. But there you have it. A 2013 blogging system, does it differently than Old School. It's more like Frontier's CMS. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/11/11.html#a174247" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
