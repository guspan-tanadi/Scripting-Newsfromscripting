<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a204637"></a><a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1590698591000">Bug fix release of LO2</a>. For a new user, one who has never logged onto LO2 before, there was a problem with the initialization code that creates your first outline. It's possible that you would get a blank screen instead of a new outline. Not a very good user experience. It should be fixed now. If you had previously tried to create an account and failed, it might be a good time to try again. If it works. please <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1266109713667821588">let me know</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28.html#a204637" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

And then the problem got even worse. As I was about to go out for my afternoon ride, my iPhone informed me that it had disabled Bluetooth for everything but my AppleWatch. No explanation of why it decided to do this. On my way out, with no music or podcasts to fill my mind, I thought how ridiculous it was that I had spent over $1000 on this device and I still don't own it. Apple says "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." They should change the name of the company to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE">Hal</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28.html#a130254" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a133210"></a>I was an entrepreneur in my youth.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28/132200.html?title=journalismHasToTakeChances#a133210" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a202252"></a>Journalism needs to be entrepreneurial. And that means taking risks. And challenging your assumptions. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28/132200.html?title=journalismHasToTakeChances#a202252" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a132316"></a>As a user, I don't trust subscriptions. It's incredibly hard to change your mind. How many times have you found out that you have to jump through endless hoops to cancel a subscription. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28/132200.html?title=journalismHasToTakeChances#a132316" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a132351"></a>Anyway, every time I try to start a discussion about this, the users agree, and the journalists that show up tell me why they don't have to to listen to scum like me. It really feels like that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28/132200.html?title=journalismHasToTakeChances#a132351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132406"></a>They have to take chances. That's the way of business. And money and business are kind of the same thing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28/132200.html?title=journalismHasToTakeChances#a132406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a132232"></a>The biggest chance they have to take is recognizing that their users are sentient and smart and are good people who they are not treating very well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/28/132200.html?title=journalismHasToTakeChances#a132232" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
