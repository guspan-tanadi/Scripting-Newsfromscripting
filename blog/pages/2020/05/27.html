<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a183347"></a>I get this <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/27/iTunesErrorDialog.png">cryptic dialog</a> when I try to update my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_XS">iPhone XS/Max</a> using iTunes.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140246"></a>I picked a good time to leave the city for the country -- March 2019. Just enough time to get established.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140124"></a>I think it's going to turn out the virus isn't as infectious in the summer than in the cold months because it doesn't transmit well outdoors, and people spend more time outdoors in summer than winter.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/27.html#a140124" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This was before they started recorded sitcoms in front of a live audience. As a little kid, I thought they must have little microphones in the TVs, maybe only some of them (not mine of course) and they could pick up the sounds made by people at home. The laugh track and other audience sounds were real, little Dave imagined. So you gotta wonder why they don't do actually that for <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/05/27/sports-poll-fans-prefer-natural-sound-in-telecasts/">live sports events</a> in the upcoming seasons for basketball, baseball, hockey, football, etc -- when there won't be any fans in the stadiums and arenas. You could even pipe the audience sounds into the venue so the players can experience them. The technology is totally up to it. Why not have some fun with it?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/27.html#a124622" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125558"></a>BTW, what do you think the odds are that one of the sports players contracts Covid-19 during these new experimental seasons. I figure it's a near-certainty. And what happens then? Do they keep playing? <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/27.html#a125558" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flBulletedSubs="true"><a name="a130907"></a>I wrote a tweet that was too long to fit in 280 chars that lists the steps that led to what we think of as RSS today. It wasn't an <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/11/didYouInventRss.html">invention</a> as most people think of invention, it was more of a synthesis, one idea leading to another and then another. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/27/130806.html?title=whereDidRssComeFrom#a130907" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a204854"></a>Then we turned them into <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> feeds. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/27/130806.html?title=whereDidRssComeFrom#a204854" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
