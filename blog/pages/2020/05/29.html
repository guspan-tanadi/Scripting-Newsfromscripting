They're as easy to make as masks, and really make a statement.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a144031" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/29/train.png"><a name="a135626"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/29/train.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here's the news experience I want. As I read Twitter or my <a href="http://river6.scripting.com/">river</a>, and I see an article I want to read, I click the link. I get a preview and a price. Click the button and I pay the price, read the article. No spyware, no ads, nice big font. It's in my story list so I can go back and re-read it any time. This requires a centralized payment system, it could be <a href="https://scroll.com/">Scroll</a> or something similar to it. The tech is not a problem, the problem is the news orgs giving users what they want. Now questions come up -- what's the price? The news orgs set the price. They have to experiment. They could run specials. They could drop the price to $0 after a story has reached a certain threshold, giving readers a further incentive, to help a story they think is important to circulate. Lots of possibilities. We should get on this train asap. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
