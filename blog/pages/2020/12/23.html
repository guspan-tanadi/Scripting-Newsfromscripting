One of the skills the virus has is it can mutate. So it's in our collective interest to reduce the virus to almost nothing before it can mutate to something our vaccines can't deal with. The more virus is out there btw, the more mutations there will be. The way we're doing it now, it's like we have all the time in the world. So a million people travel by air to go to family gatherings and then a month later do it again, and fly home, spreading all mutations of the virus everywhere. We don't have a lot of time. We don't have time to worry about who Trump pardons. We need to worry about what the virus mutates to and how it might not be very human friendly, even compared to the virus as we now know it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a012405" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

"Some men just want to watch the world burn." We've known Trump was one of them from the start. That's why there was so much dread about him being elected. Somehow we pushed that fact to the side. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a180138" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a175501"></a>I turned on the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-justify-nets-championship-hopes-but-focus-must-remain-on-present/live/">first NBA game</a> of the year last night, Golden State v Brooklyn. I had less than no interest. I couldn't even leave it on while I nerded around on my iPad. It was stealing energy from me. I don't like what happened there, in Brooklyn, nor in the NBA at large. It isn't a league of teams, it's a league of superstars and a weird form of narcissism. I lost the tune of the NBA. Maybe I'll get it back. It does come and go. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a175501" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Trump, whatever else you can say about him is quite comfortable that way. Hillary and Joe are not. Trump lost because enough people woke up and realized that wasn't a good enough reason to vote for someone. Whether or not the candidate is a sociopath and would-be tyrant should have some weight. Imagine a candidate with the confidence of Trump and the depth of knowledge of HRC.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a162007" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a155208"></a>I wish my <a href="http://www.greatvavavoom.com/">hippie uncle</a> had lived to see legalized cannabis in the US. He also would have loved smart phones. He was always looking stuff up in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please">Information Please almanac</a>. The idea of having all the information in the world in his pocket is something he could have imagined, as a voracious science fiction reader, but I don't think he would have seen it as coming so soon. He was born in 1945, would have been 75 now if he lived, but he died in 2003 at the age of 57.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a155208" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153442"></a>I remember reading about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a> during WW II. A quote stayed with me, from one of the Jews imprisoned there (paraphrasing). "We make money for the Nazis, so why should they kill us?" They figured as long as they were useful they'd be kept alive, as if there was reason to the way things are. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23/153318.html?title=trumpKillsAmericansBecauseHeLikesIt#a153442" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153150"></a>Sometimes the answer is obvious. Once, when I lived in <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/425-Manzanita-Way-Woodside-CA-94062/181464824_zpid/">California</a>, a neighbor called and said she was getting baby goats, and they would be making a bunch of noise for a while. I asked why are you getting goats. She said she always wanted goats. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23/153318.html?title=trumpKillsAmericansBecauseHeLikesIt#a153150" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153450"></a>And sometimes there just is no reason. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23/153318.html?title=trumpKillsAmericansBecauseHeLikesIt#a153450" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a153313"></a>Anyway, perhaps it's too much for people to consider Trump wanted to kill Americans because he liked it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/23/153318.html?title=trumpKillsAmericansBecauseHeLikesIt#a153313" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
