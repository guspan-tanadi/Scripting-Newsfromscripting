I've never used Asana -- I don't qualify, but apparently it's used for managing projects the way I described. I have used Trello. What I described apparently is "Agile" -- which, to me, means paying attention to how your product is used and making it better based on what you learn. Scrum is where you apply what you learned when being agile. I've always done this, made software for myself first, paid attention as it was used by myself and then others, and devised methods to get users to tell me more about their experience. Interestingly the BTQ itself is a form of agile, I'm trying to learn how to evolve <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">my outliner</a> to make it better for people doing this kind of work, and to make its advantage more obvious.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/01.html#a155623" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163403"></a>OK, here's a free idea. I just read an audiobook written by a living author. I loved the book, and think he's a great writer. The author of the book could say what three books he recommends reading after his book and why they would be good choices. Having just read the book, I have an idea of what I'd like to learn about next. And the author's opinion would have a lot of value. I'd just spent a bit of time reading what they wrote. And of course the author could update the list, change which three books they recommend, and why.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/01.html#a163403" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The government would have to define journalism. 2. Journalism will be forever frozen as no more than it is now. 3. Journalism is bound to politics. So it can't change either. 4.

Any clues much appreciated. [On Twitter, the <a href="https://twitter.com/obelixtwit/status/1333791755230035970">best advice</a>, which I used, was to delete the app and re-install. It saves the subscriptions but throws out the data. I had 31GB of downloaded podcasts. I needed none of them. Podcasts aren't like music, if you don't listen to one after a week (say) the app should just delete it.]<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/01.html#a151247" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
