He plays a serious role, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbLIYEXqWeA">sings a song</a> that's so incredibly sweet. Viewing young love forty years later. I'm there right now.

This time it's pretty obvious that his Russian owners are <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/201213/p71#a201213p71">hacking the shit</a> out of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html">US government</a>.

I used to like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant">KD</a> when he was at Oklahoma but lost interest when he went to Golden State, which was already a dominant franchise.

They lost. They're having a hard time dealing with it. Meantime we're in the middle of a pandemic. Let them get over it on their own. My mother understood this. When my little brother was complaining about something, very unfairly, and loudly, my mother would say if you just ignore him he'll stop.

I've been watching CNN the last few weeks. I find it mind-numbing. (A good thing, for now, I play video games and watch Twitter while CNN is on.)

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163921"></a>It happened in <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/10.html">October 2000</a> in NYC. I met with Adam Curry over a couple of days at a hotel in midtown on the west side. I mention the meeting in a <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/12.html#myUserlandOnTheDesktop">post</a> on December 28, 2000. Here's an excerpt. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a163921" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164132"></a>It helps to have a user in mind when you're developing. In NY, when I met with Adam for two days he kept trying to explain what he wanted, but he's not a software developer, so to my ears it came across like hodgepodge. But I listened anyway, I kept trying to feed back what I heard, but we weren't connecting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a164132" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170241"></a>When I got back home I did what programmers do, I iterated, and kept showing it to him. Is this what you wanted? Eventually we got there, this software hits his button. It's also a framework for his vision for last yard connectivity. You can move huge pieces of content without any waiting and using the bandwidth that you don't use. When you're home sleeping in your bed your desktop system can get the big stuff, you won't even know it's there until it's fully downloaded on your hard disk.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a170241" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a170329"></a>This is how video and music are going to move over the net in 2001. Who would have thought RSS would play a role in this? Adam did.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a170329" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164203"></a>This was the key idea on podcasting. How to distribute large bits of audio and video without having to wait for them to download. At the time, it was the slowness of the net that stood in the way of what we now call podcasting. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a164203" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a164258"></a>The significance of this is that it was 20 years ago. It led to a new version of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html" title="The official RSS 2.0 spec.">RSS</a> which supported enclosures for the first time. I also <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/12/27.html">wrote this up</a> on the blog that month. And the software called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MUOTD%22&t=h_&ia=web">MUOTD</a> became Radio UserLand, which was a two-way blogging and reading app for RSS. It's something the software industry hasn't replicated, not because it's so hard technically, it isn't. Not sure why. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a164258" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a165423"></a>The two-day meetup was on <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html">October 25</a> and <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/10/26.html">26</a>. It still took a couple of months from then before we had any real demos. It was competing with other projects we had at UserLand at the time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=theMomentPodcastingCameIntoBeing#a165423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
