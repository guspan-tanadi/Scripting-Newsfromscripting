I had a bug in a script I use to backup various files from my blog in a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">GitHub repository</a>. It was simple enough to fix, but the script stopped working 27 days ago, so now I have a hole in my repo with all the missing days. This is the kind of problem you solve with a scripting language. Doing this in standard JS is going to be a pain in the ass. But I'll do it because I care. But things could be so much better. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/10.html#a164452" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
