I was there. <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html">Here are my notes</a> from the last night of the campaign, the Iowa Caucus in 2004. I was at Dean HQ in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont">Burlington</a>. I was blogging on <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html">Scripting News</a> and on the main Dean weblog. We also rolled out <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html">Channel Dean</a> that day, basically a linkblog managed by campaign people, linking to articles and blog posts their community would find interesting. These were all precursors to the social nets of today.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/15.html#a164823" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The nice thing is how the mom and her three daughters have open affection for each other, it's their baseline. They get pissed off, mostly the kids with the mom, but they quickly get back to hugging and being motherly to each other, across generations. It's sweet. Nothing at all even remotely like the environment I grew up in btw, just sayin. Anyway, I'd kind of like to see Donald Trump as a guest on the show. They would listen to his sad stories, and try to help him. I think there could be some good jokes in there.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/15.html#a185014" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He's a vampire we've managed to lock in a crypt, and I worry that just showing his image here might wake him up. He's now got the smell of loser on him, like an old version of Sarah Palin. She was pretty charismatic too, in her day. And about as talented as the lame duck. Better to let him fade away. Think of him as a dead relative. Maybe he was an asshole, it's hard to remember, it's been so long.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/15.html#a185814" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

That happened yesterday. I was writing about <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv">my new TV</a> and all of a sudden there's a paragraph about how screwed up journalism is. And then there was a post that I thought I had deleted and didn't. Oy! That was pretty disturbing. I left it there, but edited it a bit so it made more sense. Yesterday was a good day in general, but a <i>bad</i> day on the blog. Anyway, I've corrected it <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html">on the web</a>. Ooops. I'll try to do better in the future. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/15.html#a142323" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
