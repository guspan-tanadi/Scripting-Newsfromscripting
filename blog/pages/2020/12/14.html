He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html">biggest media buyouts</a> in history (at the time). I wanted to know when he/she was going to write about it. Never. That opened my eyes to something I should have been able to see much earlier. We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us. Yet they feel transparent to us, the mere conveyors of information, or so they would have you believe. We need <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory">triangulation</a> here. A source of news that is <i>totally disconnected</i> from the media industry.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html#a145959" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150509"></a>BTW, a disclaimer. Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton">Nick Denton</a>, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story. And Apple, btw is the perfect example of a tech company that should <i>never</i> have a say in what stories get told. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html#a150509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
