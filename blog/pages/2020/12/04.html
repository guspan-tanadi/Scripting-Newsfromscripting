<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a193729"></a>Gotta say it's not news when a Republican <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2020/12/04/kellyanne-conway-acknowledges-bidens-win/">acknowledges</a> that Biden won. Unless you report it as how pathetic the Repubs are. Even that's not news, but at least it's another way they are pathetic. For the time-being. They'll think of something else.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/04.html#a193729" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The answer is eluding them. It's the commercials on the telly, dummy. Happy families giving each other hugs and presents. And the virus! Commercials are engineered to perfection to make you think of doing the things in the commercials. They're selling the illusion of an idyllic holiday with love and friends. It may work next year, but this year it ain't love that's being transmitted at these gatherings. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/04.html#a170425" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a172318"></a>Imagine both Dems win the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_runoff_elections_in_Georgia_(January_5,_2021)">Jan 5 runoff in Georgia</a> because the Repubs self-suppress their vote with all the michegas about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Perdue">Purdue</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Loeffler">Loeffler</a> don't deserve their votes because they're not giving it up for Herr Trump. The shock they feel when they realize the Dems now control both houses of Congress and the White House. The conspiracy theories. The sadness. Self-loathing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/04.html#a172318" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a150205"></a>I like to evolve funny names for things. Just ask my close friends and family. Anyway, for a while I was pronouncing Facebook's name as a Dutch person might. Fasch Boke. You say it without opening your mouth very wide. It makes people laugh for some reason I can't figure out. Anyway, now I've evolved that to be more American: Fast Buck. Which oddly enough is what they are all about! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/04.html#a150205" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a192307"></a>If I could go back in time and explain to my exes why they had so much trouble understanding me I would say that I was just beginning to learn that there are women who are nothing like my mother. So please be patient with me. I meant well. And btw, I'd suggest that perhaps they have me confused with the men they grew up around and to consider the possibility I'm not "just like them." (An accusation I've heard many many times.)<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/04.html#a192307" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
