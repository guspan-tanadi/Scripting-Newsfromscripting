Even better if there was a preference where you could say which services you care about. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/24.html#a210755" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He wonders why the US government is doing nothing to restrict air traffic from the UK. Made me think what Cuomo will do, as a Democrat, when the president is a Democrat on the 20th of next month. Also, I wonder if Biden offered him a position in the government. He's been an incredible crisis leader for New York State. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/24.html#a185551" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I was thinking of an app like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>. I was already a programmer when it came out, but it taught me so much about the interconnection of systems. Something like that with the virus and people interacting, and people dying or the virus dying (better outcome of course) would probably save lives. And even more important it would teach us the value of working together. Since gaming is something people do in all states, red and blue, it might also help us find common ground. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/24.html#a155441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
