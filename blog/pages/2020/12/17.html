They have a <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/">web interface</a>. So you can go there and edit your preferences, menus, program your DVR, whatever. Roku should do that too, as should <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/02/211604.html?title=hboMaxIsAHistoricMess">HBO Mess</a>, or the arcane UI of LG-land. Set up your watch list. Integrate with <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/">BingeWorthy</a>! (i.e. have an API). Connect your world to mine. It's amazing how much of the design of the LG television assumes their TV is the center of our world. It's for watching. Not controlling. Relaxing, meditating, self-medicating with boredom. Not a place where you get big ideas, and if you do it's a lost cause because the UI tools are limited to what a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1475971-REG/lg_an_mr19ba_magic_remote_control_with.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6zq6C-7XppTkISht-dKLTIKU4-C25MtD4GvWbqQurqJkDVJ8RRRUOhoCRH4QAvD_BwE">remote</a> can do. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/17.html#a200335" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a201625"></a>My <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2003/campusTourApril/DSC00609.JPG">friend</a> and former colleague <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22John Palfrey%22&t=h_&ia=web">John Palfrey</a> just <a href="https://twitter.com/jpalfrey/status/1339583199974883335">announced</a> that his parents are retiring as deans at Adams House at Harvard. I had heard of <a href="https://adamshouse.harvard.edu/people/types-people/faculty-deans">this role</a>, and wondered what it was about. They have a great <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/17/deanDescription.png">description</a>. Sounds like a good way to bring a bit of home into a young person's college experience. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/17.html#a201625" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I really should write a book with some of these projects and the philosophy behind them. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/17.html#a164654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a201548"></a>Trump wants to be "president" not president. This came out during the 2016 campaign when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/magazine/how-donald-trump-picked-his-running-mate.html">offered</a> the job of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/17/excerpt.png">real president</a> to Kasich. So he'll go to Mar a Lago, take the "presidential" oath while Biden takes the actual oath, everyone's happy.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/17.html#a201548" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
