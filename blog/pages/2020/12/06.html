I think people could have understood, but they didn't make the effort to listen. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/163322.html?title=weHaveToWorkTogether#a163326" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a163423"></a>It does take effort to listen, I've seen it in myself. We just have our heads down and are focused on what we do.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152140"></a>When it's windy, as it was last night, my house makes a really jarring loud sound, and I haven't been able to figure out what it is. So I took out my iPhone, and opened the Voice Memo app and recorded the sound.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/152130.html?title=myHouseMakesThisSound#a152140" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152214"></a>You can hear it clearly at 2 seconds, then 8 seconds and then at 10 seconds.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/152130.html?title=myHouseMakesThisSound#a152214" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="a152303"></a>In real life it's a lot louder than it sounds in the recording. Sounds like a metal door slamming. You can't sleep through it, and it sounds like it might be doing damage to the house. Last night was particularly bad.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/152130.html?title=myHouseMakesThisSound#a152303" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>The sounds always come in pairs.

	<li data-flInCalendar="true"><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>I've had a couple of contractors look into it, but of course never when the it's making the sound.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/152130.html?title=myHouseMakesThisSound#aNaNNaNNaN" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
