Spoilers, so beware. Two of my favorite movies: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)">Amadeus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets">As Good As It Gets</a>. Why? Because I identify with almost all the characters in some way. Such incredible story-telling. So much truth about our failure to understand our own struggles and beauty, try as hard as we can, and to accept the beauty in others. Also a short interruption as I got a spam call that I answered. I leave this kind of stuff in my podcasts. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸš€</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/12.html#a183749" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

They're all expecting that if Biden takes office, they will be soon be implicated openly with something horrible, likely treasonous. And what that is is not really a mystery. They were all working for Russia. Either for money or because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat">kompromat</a>. There's an old <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_for_a_penny,_in_for_a_pound">motto</a>, "in for a penny, in for a pound" that applies here. And who is <i>not</i> implicated? The governor and secretary of state of Georgia and a few other Republican state officials who stood behind the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan. And very oddly -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr">US AG Bill Barr</a>. Amazingly, he didn't go along with the coverup. He appeared to be the most corrupt of them all, except for the Trump family. Go figure! <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/12/12.html#a162605" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
