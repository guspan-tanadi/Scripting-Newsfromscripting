<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a195806"></a>I've been smelling burned ash everywhere, esp at night. Everywhere I go. I'm thinking this must be a symptom of the virus, so I'm afraid to ask if anyone else smells it. Then on my bike ride I saw a bunch of spent fireworks on the road. Yeah that's the smell. July 4. That should be over soon enough. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a195806" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a154130"></a>Why more white people understand <a href="http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/">Black Lives Matter</a> now. We're realizing that <i>our lives</i> don't matter, and now all of a sudden Black Lives Matter makes a different kind of sense. It's a bit too subtle for some people. But the virus and our society's response to it is making the lights come on, gradually at first, eventually for everyone.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a154130" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124318"></a>Dear <a href="https://lincolnproject.us/">Lincoln Project</a> people -- how about forking off a new PAC to convince more Americans to wear a mask. Use your marketing smarts to crack this nut.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a124656"></a>I like how they have a <i>Get Involved</i> button on their website. But when you <a href="https://lincolnproject.us/get-involved/">click</a> they don't say what being involved means, beyond giving them money and your email address and zip code, presumably so they can spam you. I'd love for a campaign to define involvement as solving a problem we have in America, right now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a124656" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125658"></a>I like listening to audio books, but I have two peeves. 1. When a book provides numbers for comparison, repeat the numbers at least once. 2. Put the introductory material at the end. Authors go on and on, assuming you won't read it. Oops. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a125658" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/03/tenTonWeight.png"><a name="a130938"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/03/tenTonWeight.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Another peeve. I was watching a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> show on Netflix. He is really funny. Great comic. But he uses the N-word a lot. And get this -- he uses it to talk about white people. Like this: You my &lt;N-word>. I've been told, not by Chappelle, that it's a term of endearment. To me, that's ridiculous -- it's a threat. Because if I use that term of endearment, a 10-ton weight comes down on my head. I don't like it. We're also told this is a word African-Americans use among themselves, and we wouldn't understand what it means. But many of the people in Chappelle's audience are white. We're his N-words. I'm watching it, and reminded every time I hear the world, and he says it a lot, that this is something I'm not allowed to like. The more I listen to him use the N-word, my inner voice, constantly yapping about nothing, repeats what he says, and I'm concerned that will eventually come out of my mouth, without thought because that actually happens in real life. It's a painful word, not just for African-Americans. I saw <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb">Jelani Cobb</a> write <a href="https://twitter.com/jelani9/status/1278607474921267200">on Twitter</a> the other day about the possible capitalization of the word <i>black</i> when used to talk about people of African descent. "Does anyone feel strongly about upper-casing the B in black? Iâ€™m generally opposed to this because it turns race, a nonexistent category, into a proper noun." Maybe we should use words everyone can say, and try to stick to words that have meaning, and preferrably <i>one</i> obvious meaning, so we all can understand wtf you're talking about. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a130938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
