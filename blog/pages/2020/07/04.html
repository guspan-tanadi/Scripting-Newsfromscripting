<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a162616"></a>Here's a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/settings/davewiner/packages">list</a> of the 37 Node.js packages I've made available through NPM. I was just planning a project and was sure I must have created a package for reading to and from a GitHub repo. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davegithub">There it is</a>. Two entry-points, getFile and uploadFile. Voila. Not much in the way of docs. But there is an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/github/tree/master/example">example app</a>.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/04.html#a162616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I totally concur. The US welcomed my family in the 1940s. My parents were children, their parents were running for their lives. All of our love of country is being tested, but as it is, it is revealed. It takes on new meaning. We'll come back from this. There are a lot of reasons for the trouble we're in, some habitual, some technical. I've heard Americans say they wish they had left when they could, but there's a reason we didn't leave. This is our country. We can't abandon it in its time of need. We're the ones who stayed. We will make it work.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/04.html#a160457" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a153912"></a>The <i>infinite scrolling</i> <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a161833">feature</a> on the Scripting News <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> wasn't a good idea, because it made it difficult to reach the bottom of the page which has useful stuff on it. I just turned it off. I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kRl-Qy7_I">video demo</a> of the feature so we can remember how it worked, and if needed I can turn it back on. And the <i>More</i> button remains, so you can use that to scroll back, one day at a time.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/04.html#a153912" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a152236"></a>Today's song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BgzrfUA8lo">He's Gone</a> by the Grateful Dead. No special reason. No one specific died. I just have this song rolling around in my head this morning. <i>You know better but I know him.</i><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/04.html#a152236" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
