Grab <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Wolf">him</a> off the street, into an unmarked car with DC plates, fly him back to Portland, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-justice-department/index.html">lock him up</a>, and put him on trial for kidnapping. He's a nice looking guy, he'd probably look great in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Penitentiary">orange</a>. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/21.html#a110407" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Did he see the protests just a few weeks ago.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/21.html#a113705" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
