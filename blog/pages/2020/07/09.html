<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a195410"></a>I discovered a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/09/featureInGitHub.png">new feature</a> in GitHub. If you create a public repository with the same name as your account, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/scripting/blob/master/README.md">readme.md</a> file in that repo is displayed on your <a href="https://github.com/scripting">GitHub home page</a>. Of course it's Markdown. Might be interesting to integrate some of the status-editing features I'm working on into this. It supports basic web stuff, as you would expect from a techies site like GitHub. Okay this might be fun. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸŽˆ</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09.html#a195410" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

First we watched a woman die. She was infected at the funeral she held for her husband who also died of Covid. Then they interviewed a patient who explained she was being careful, yet caught the virus anyway. This is how it works when the density of infection goes up, you encounter more virus as you move around, and with more density the chance of you getting infected goes up. That's what they're dealing with in Houston. It was excellent, but they were all Democrats. It would be helpful if they interviewed a banker type, in trouble, in a ward, worrying about the horrible death looming in front of him. Let them see a Republican dealing with an unavoidable awful reality. Might scare them into wearing masks and thereby decrease the density of the virus and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&t=h_&ia=web">save my life</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09.html#a153820" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a170919"></a>Many <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-national-convention-rnc-coronavirus-gop-senators-jacksonville/">Republican senators</a> are apparently <i>not</i> going to Trump's convention in Jacksonville.

	<li><a name="a161924"></a>Following up on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript">yesterday's post</a> where I talk about striving for simplicity in using JavaScript, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/awbjs">Allen Wirfs-Brock</a>, who has been involved in JavaScript language design for many years, and was editor of the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">ES6 spec</a>, responded thus:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2#a161924" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a162730"></a>Because of JavaScriptâ€™s "donâ€™t break existing code" policy, often the only way to fix an existing problematic features is to leave it alone and add a better alternative. This inevitably leads to profiles that include the better features and leaves out the deprecated ones.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2#a162730" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162757"></a>You probably donâ€™t use <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> , but most commercial JS devs seem to. There are probably thousands of configuration profiles for it that enforce various style guides and and subset preferences. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2#a162757" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162852"></a>For example <a href="https://standardjs.com/">JavaScript Standard Style</a> is popular but controversial both because of its self-assumed name and because of the positions it takes on semicolon usage and other conventions.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2#a162852" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a162956"></a>Regarding choice of function forms, my preference is to use the <code>function hello () {}</code> form in most situations where I wanted to define a named function, both global and local.  Iâ€™d generally reserve arrow functions for cases where Iâ€™m passing an anonymous function as an argument or otherwise using it as a first class value.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2#a162956" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a163019"></a>Iâ€™d probably only use <code>const hello= () => {};</code> in situations where I need to name a function that needs to reference the this binding of its surrounding environment.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2#a163019" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
