Fine with me. I bought $25K of Twitter stock a few years ago. I don't mind putting money behind my use of Twitter. What would I pay for? No character limit. Titles, simple styling, links. Basic <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html">blogging features</a>. It can carry multi-megabyte images and videos as payloads. A blog post is no big deal. Add a <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html">More link</a>. People still don't click links in Twitter. That's why threads are so popular. That's why <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1286641900825575425">image posts</a> are popular. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pave_the_cowpath">Pave the cowpath</a> and let's go unlimited-length. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/24.html#a122058" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

America has to look up to Italy. We have huge advantages, but have terrible leadership, that's why we're failing to deal with the virus. Italy is back online, America is still crashing.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/24.html#a124454" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125912"></a>During the Vietnam war, protestors had a slogan, Bring The War Home. Except for war casualties, the country didn't feel any pain from the war. That was optimized in subsequent wars, in Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan. No draft. Tax cuts. What's new, what's so shocking to Americans, is that the same chaos we brought to other countries is now coming home. Karma is a bitch. We deserve this. Now let's hope we can overcome it. We're like the people who work at Facebook today. We know we're doing shitty stuff, but not all of us are bad. Too bad. We <i>all</i> pay the price for our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=acquiescence&t=hk&ia=definition">acquiescence</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/24.html#a125912" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a130530"></a>Earlier, Jillian York on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jilliancyork/status/1286554054731141120">said</a> she is tired of having her ideas stolen. Rebecca MacKinnon <a href="https://twitter.com/rmack/status/1286593320924348419">says</a> that's the way it is. I <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1286607323687981058">agreed</a>, having had many ideas used, which is okay but sometimes against itself. Example: the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+unconference&t=hk&ia=web">unconference</a>. Our conception of it, the original, was usurped by a format that we were opposing. This shit happens. I hit a particularly ugly form of this later, when I was trying to find a reference to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Bring+The+War+Home%22&t=hk&ia=shopping">Bring The War Home</a>, as a Vietnam War protest slogan. It's been usurped by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bring-War-Home-Movement-Paramilitary/dp/0674286073">White Power</a> movement. Oy. See how ideas flip. Some ideas stick, others get absorbed, and others are perverted. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/24.html#a130530" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
