It was mostly about what's in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting">gaslighting</a> post below. Expanded, and starting with an observation by <a href="https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html">Ken Smith</a>, English prof at Indiana University, that students deserve to be shown how to use <i>the power tools of our culture.</i> Teachers should say that to them, out loud. I tried saying it loud and felt the power. Led to a story or two. The title of this podcast is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD_1Z8iUDho">Don't Cry For Me Argentina</a>. Wish I had thought to play that song during the podcast. Next time. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02.html#a210923" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211709"></a>Really interesting discussion going on globally on what <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/873172499/the-debate-over-objectivity-in-journalism">objectivity</a> means in journalism, esp in re <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click">#BLM</a>. I spent <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">many podcasts</a> with Jay Rosen talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere">his idea</a> of the mythical <i>View from Nowhere.</i> You must disclose who you are, and disclaim that your writing comes from who you are. This came up in another discussion yesterday about <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3">integrity</a>.  "A [person] has integrity if he or she is what he or she appears to be. That's why integrity commands us to disclose conflicts, so that what we say, and who we appear to be, are in sync. Change the appearance if necessary." It's material if the editors of a publication are predominantly of one race. Until this year, however, as far as I know, the subject had never been raised. Times are changing.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02.html#a211709" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I know what that's like, I've been a columnist at a big pub. I've had the name of a big university on my business card. This is different. I want to see us survive the virus. I want to survive it myself. Otherwise I don't have any great personal aspirations. I think I can help. That's it. I don't honestly see how, in this moment of crisis in the US, anyone could be worried about getting ahead. Our concern has to be for keeping our system going. It's falling apart, right now, before our eyes. Any idea should be considered, no matter where it comes from. But the gates are really high right now. The keepers are struggling to hold on, and that's exactly what's wrong with discourse.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02.html#a175509" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a135520"></a>I think that's pretty straightforward. The only emotion I mention is <i>enjoy.</i> It's true, when I'm writing a long post that organizes something I've had in my mind for days or weeks, and it comes out well, I do enjoy the process. I imagine people reading it, and thinking man this is a great idea or I don't know, I see a problem with it, and then either passing it along as-is, or expanding on it. Either way, I would be happy, because I made a contribution.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a135520" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flNumberedSubs="true"><a name="a135659"></a>This last week I've written two pieces like that. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a135659" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a140924"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/28/125635.html?title=ourOpportunity">One which says</a> let's not waste this moment of political action around BLM, at the same time the government is going to spend $10 trillion (a number I made up) to keep the US from collapsing. Instead of having the money go to the 1% which is the default, let's have the money solve the real problems that are behind <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click">#BLM</a>, and in the process help everyone. It was a strong piece, and it contains ideas you never hear among pundits. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140924" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a141002"></a><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo">The other</a> was about the virus and what's in our immediate future, and how, if we eased up on some of the rules of how politics work, if Biden were to appoint Andrew Cuomo as his primary virus advisor, we could start to have a national response to the virus <i>before January 2021. </i>That we're frozen, can't act, scares the shit out of me, both for my own existence, that of my friends and family, and my country, and honestly the world. The US is too important a part of the world for us to just let it go. We have to do something. I put my plan in writing. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a141002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	</ul>

	<li><a name="a140002"></a>The response to both these pieces, predictably -- crickets.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140002" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140013"></a>Now I may or may not be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/arts/gaslight-movie-afterlife.html">upset</a> about this, I didn't say, but that's not the point. It's not wrong to be upset. You don't have to talk someone down from being upset, assuming I was (I wasn't, it was more frustration). You know what would be better? Ask how you can help. If one person had asked that, I would have said, in glee -- <span style="font-size: .9em">READ THE FUCKING STORIES AND IF YOU LIKE THE IDEAS, PASS THEM ON WITH ALL YOUR POWER</span>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140013" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

It's so predictable that we'll just let the moment pass and settle for a few symbolic gestures. Monuments come down. A black person is on the $20 bill. Maybe Biden nominates a black woman for VP. But that money -- that's where the power is, and it goes to the friends of Trump and McConnell, Pelosi and Schumer. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140134" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140316"></a>In the second case, obviously we need and can have, a national response to the virus. We do not have to wait for Trump to leave the White House. And you know what, combining the two, BLM and the response to the virus, there's real power in that, too. If putting these ideas out there resulted in real power and real change, your friend Dave would be over the moon. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140316" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140403"></a>If you want to know what I really think -- there's no point in continuing to write these pieces on my blog. They accomplish nothing and leave me with a lot of frustration. I can ride my bike, work on the garden, read books, and enjoy my retirement (I turned 65 this year). I don't want to do just that, but geez if nothing happens when I pour my best ideas into the blog, why bother.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140403" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a140557"></a>Let me try to put it in perspective. I think Andrew Sullivan is a great thinker and writer. I don't agree with everything he says, but every time I read one of his pieces in <a href="https://nymag.com/author/andrew-sullivan/">New York</a>, I get lots of ideas. I feel compelled to act. I think I'm in that class of writer, and I think my talent and experience and ideation process are wasted in this space. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting#a140557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
