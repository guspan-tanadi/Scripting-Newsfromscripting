<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a182041"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep">Steve Inskeep</a> seems like such an affable fellow on NPR, but he's a <a href="https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep/status/1276320073809100804">bit of a snob</a> on Twitter. <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html">Platform</a> is a real concept. Yes he has one, even if he thinks it's just a "buzz phrase" that's "oft-parroted" (his phrasing). It's bad enough the AG lies about important things, the problem is squared when a supposed neutral news org lets him do it without correction. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/16.html#a182041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134843"></a>I like to ask questions like this:  "In a sane world, X would be Y."  I'm not saying I have a plan to turn X into Y, just that it would be ideal if X were Y.  It pays to know what success looks like, that way if it ever shows up by chance, you know immediately to say yes. (Example, in a sane world Fauci would be president.) <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/16.html#a134843" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a210824"></a>We have to change how we think of Trump. He’s the enemy and he’s president. If you can’t resolve that apparent contradiction, the half to give up on is that he’s president.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/16.html#a210824" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'm determined to find the most invigorating beer for summer consumption. I've discovered I like beer. This is a new thing for me. If you see a favorite let me know. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/16.html#a181223" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
