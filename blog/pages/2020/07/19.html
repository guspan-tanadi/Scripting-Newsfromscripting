<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtEX2-n2Hc"><a name="a165957"></a>When did we first get an idea that masks work? This is <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/30.html#a143207">when</a> I got the message. March 30. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtEX2-n2Hc">Watch the video</a>. I got <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/31/004710.html?title=putASmileOnIt">my mask</a> on the 31st. Imagine if we had all listened. How many people would be healthy who are sick. How many people would be alive, who are now dead.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19.html#a165957" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I don't think there's much debate that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken#Aftermath">Al Franken</a> got canceled. <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/18.html#a135951">Woody Allen</a>.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144306"></a>The tech industry is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_selling_pharmaceutical_products">pharma</a>, they only make products that have huge financial upside. That means there are lots of drugs for cancer, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic diseases, ones that might not kill you right off, but require lifetime use. This is like virality and lock-in in tech. Tools that don't bring in other users, or get you addicted can't make a ton of money. They might be worthwhile though, they might help someone figure something out that saves humanity, for example. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19.html#a144306" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144716"></a>The reason came to me in a dream. The politicians and their masters arenâ€™t saving our lives because thereâ€™s no money in it for them. But pharma sees big bucks in a vaccine and even more in a treatment. I hear the vaccine might require a booster every few months. They must love that. Every human on the planet would need it. Think of the enormous cash flow for the holder of that patent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19.html#a144716" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145154"></a>I went back to <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">UW-Madison</a> for a visit a few years ago and got a tour of a <a href="https://discovery.wisc.edu/">new building</a> created to generate <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/tag/patents/">patents</a>. But it didn't appear it was used for much. Extravagant and luxurious. Very unlike a typical utilitarian campus building at a large state school. I learned they built it to recruit a professor who generated billions from patents, and I guess they felt was likely to continue to do so. The money apparently flows to the university, but the professor gets to work in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> of campus buildings. Not sure. But it was <i>very</i> impressive, and surprising. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19.html#a145154" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

People say Twitter is bad, and of course they're right, but it's also good. It's an integral part of how I write this blog. Of course the really important stuff shows up here too.

	<li><a name="a203812"></a>Where <i>possible</i> might be a new keyword that's something like a <i>try</i> but not as serious. In other words, don't get upset if this doesn't work. On the other hand, it's not much more concise than the original expression, and it doesn't say anything about what you expect not to work about it. Really for anything other than <i>undefined</i> I probably want an error to be thrown so I can find the problem and fix it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19/151508.html?title=aNewCodingConstruct#a203812" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a203958"></a>I'm not an Applescript type person, I think programming can't be a spoken language, but I also don't go so far as to say programming is like linear algebra or differential calculus (both of which I took in college). I like words that mean something when I read them, both in human language and programming language.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19/151508.html?title=aNewCodingConstruct#a203958" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flCodeSubs="true"><a name="a204041"></a>Another random thought, not a big fan of using <i>let</i> as a new kind of declaration. I imagine they chose it because that's what BASIC used, but why would a nice Algol-like language use BASIC as prior art. I actually like how we did it in Frontier:<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/19/151508.html?title=aNewCodingConstruct#a204041" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a204541"></a><i>local</i> is the keyword for declaration. It says fname is declared here, in this scope, and it is only accessible here.
