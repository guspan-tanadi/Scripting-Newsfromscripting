<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a002813"></a>The thing that makes fiction interesting is if they take you to a world with characters who feel real who you connect to. And their world, which might be very different from yours, feels real too. The whole thing hangs together. It makes sense what they do, and say, and <i>some</i> of it isn't exactly what you guessed. This is all a long-winded way to say is it gives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">good suspension of disbelief</a>. That's why a show like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)">Succession</a> works so well. The people are mediocre and foolish. Their world is vastly different from the one we live in. The people are colorful and interesting, educated, but also frail, simple and kind of disgusting, and really stupid at times. But you keep coming back for more because you feel it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/28.html#a002813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

This restart of everything is ridiculous. We're damaging ourselves in obvious ways that we're in denial about. A pandemic is nothing to fool around with. We need to start over with a new lockdown, only this time do it right. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/28.html#a113950" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

If you must reply, try a little humility, as in ‚Äúimho.‚Äù Better to RT with a comment so everyone can feel your attitude.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/28.html#a103611" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a155004"></a>Living in the country, part 3071. Some animal, apparently, has made a nest in the air conditioning system of my car. This includes a fair amount of animal urine. So when I drove into town today, about 1/2 hour in each direction, I was inundated in the smell. Ugh. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/28.html#a155004" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
