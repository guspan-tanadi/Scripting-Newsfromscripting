That's because we haven't set up our radar yet. We know how to do it.

	<li><a name="a152245"></a>We should stop discussing it. It's out of the question. What may happen is they will try to open the schools in a few of the Republican states, and close them within a few days as the rate of infection goes even higher. Cause and effect. You do something stupid and a week later the infections go up, two weeks later the hospitalizations go up and two weeks after that, the death rate goes up. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/12/141733.html?title=reopenSchoolsNotYet#a152245" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a144941"></a>Meanwhile stand up national testing and contact tracing. Open source the data so the public can help analyze it.

	<li><a name="a155926"></a>Meanwhile teach the kids at home that they're living the consequences of having a poorly educated electorate. Help them study the math and science of viral infections.
