For me it was the <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/odessa-restaurant-late-night-east-village-oasis-close">Odessa</a> on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7263911,-73.9833187,3a,75y,301.34h,92.34t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjZYPzLkIfakUz6jzf8gGnw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjZYPzLkIfakUz6jzf8gGnw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D36.482285%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192">Avenue A</a>, across from <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tompkins-square-park">Tompkins Square Park</a>, in the East Village. I used to meet my <a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/momorderingfromodessa">mother</a> and grandfather there in the 80s. My uncle lived nearby in the hippie days, the late 60s and 70s. When I lived in NYC in the last decade, the teens, I'd <a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2010/june/odessa">take</a> an out-of-town visiting friend maybe once a year. It wasn't the best of the Old World diners, but it was the last original one. <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/05/lunchWithNakedjen.html">Veselka</a> now is the goto place for that kind of food. The links to the old generation are disappearing, no surprise because the generation itself is gone. Not surprising that a place like Odessa can't survive just on takeout, when there are so many other great choices in the Village. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/13.html#a141414" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a143711"></a>This is why you take pictures of your food. A picture of a <a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/odessadinner">dinner at Odessa</a>. I don't know what all of it is. The sausage is probably a kielbasa. And the dumplings are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi">pierogi</a>, and come with fillings like sauerkraut, mushrooms, potatos and various meats. The pancake on top doesn't look familiar. I think that might be stuffed cabbage on the right at 2 o'clock. There's some kind of soup at the upper right. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/13.html#a143711" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
