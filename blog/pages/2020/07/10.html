Okay we know Trump wouldn't let him, and as long as he's employed by the US govt, Trump can probably stop him. But what if Fauci decided he would be more effective outside of government? Who would bankroll such a venture, as a public service? <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&t=h_&ia=web">#savemylife</a> <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10.html#a170551" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a150256"></a>There's a new <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">trend</a> in programming -- we must change our software so as not to, internally, invisibly to users, use terms like black or white, master or slave, etc. I'm editing some code now that has the concept of enabled and disabled. Can you imagine if we have to purge this from our tech vocabulary? The economics of such changes are mind-boggling. And the breakage. What if we used such a term in one of our standards? A frozen one? An ancient one? What then?    <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10.html#a150256" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142938"></a>Roadmap. Do not re-open schools. Run Trump out of town, asap. Temporary acting President Fauci announces a nationwide lockdown. All manufacturing directed to produce PPE, food, shelter for homeless Americans. Elections to be held on Nov 3, mail only.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10.html#a142938" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a184345"></a>The problem with journalism exposed in the age of Trump is they don't do anything. You say oh they're not supposed to. Voice from nowhere, etc. But they rarely carry stories of people who do things. Mostly Trump. Occasionally <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click">#BLM</a> or but just for a while. That's it. Why does it matter now? Because we've been needing to do things since November 2016. We figure it out when it's too late. It's a repeating pattern. Maybe we need national activism more than we need journalism? We need something different or else we're hosed. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10.html#a184345" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a230543"></a>The EFF started, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">30 years ago today</a>, with the right idea, defending speech on the then-nascent net.

Subsequently I <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366">objected</a> to how they defended podcasting from a patent troll, and ultimately the effort to give <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">control of the web to Google</a>, that was the absolute last straw. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10/225547.html?title=anEffToWatchTheEff#a182329" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
