That was incorrect. A neighbor is having work done on trees. I live in a forest, where trees are a big deal. They're always falling over, and then you need to cut them up and haul the wood away or chop it into firewood. When you cut trees with a chain saw the wood burns, and it doesn't stop burning when the cutting is done. And that adds a stink to the air, like a fire that was put out with water. That's what I was smelling. I know this because I had some trees cut last year, and the stinky smell stuck around for a week. It's the sad smell of a dying creature. On the other hand, when you wake up on a summer morning with dew on everything, and a nice warm feel to the air, with a bit of residual chill, the forest smells like life. It's a wonderful smell. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/05.html#a132946" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a121328"></a>After Trump is gone we have to get rid of the cancel cult. It’s an ugly side effect of the power of online communication.
