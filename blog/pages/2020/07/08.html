<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/08/saveMyLifeMask.png"><a name="a123159"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/08/saveMyLifeMask.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;"><a href="http://nakedjen.com/">NakedJen</a> works in a place where people must wear a mask, so she gives out a lot of masks every day. She's going to make custom masks that have a message. That's the first part of this story. Second part, we both started a campaign called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&t=h_&ia=web">#savemylife</a>, where we promote stories and ideas that save people's lives in this age where lives have all of a sudden become cheap, something our government is promoting (the cheapness, not the saving). So Jen has designed a mask that has the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&t=h_&ia=web">#savemylife</a> message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png">MLK</a> instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to <a href="http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/">#blacklivesmatter</a>. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save <i>your</i> life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08.html#a123159" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134312"></a>Yesterday, I was at a store, did my shopping, but when I took the mask off in the car one of the straps broke. I went back to the store and asked if they had an extra. They gave me one, with a smile. No reason that mask shouldn't have had a message on it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08.html#a134312" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Labels are 1/2 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a> statements, which we know are <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">harmful</a> to readability and maintainability. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a131609" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150642"></a>I'm pretty sure when I try to grok someone's code that uses this feature, it'll be hard to figure out how it works.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a150642" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a131813"></a>I've been developing software for a long time. The functionality for users is always at the top of my mind. Getting software rock solid and ideally not requiring any maintenence, that's what I'm aiming for. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a131813" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150815"></a>I'm <i>never</i> thinking about how I can use some new cool feature in the language. I want my code to be as boring and predictable as possible. To look exactly like what it does. Sometimes I get there. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a150815" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a150826"></a>I'm using software that I wrote 30 years ago right now, as I write this. That's pretty good for standing the test of time. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a150826" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a131925"></a>Anyway, I'm thinking the right thing to do for JavaScript is to define a profile, a subset of the language, which if you stick to it, will enhance maintainability and readability, and therefore is more likely to work. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a131925" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li data-flCodeSubs="true"><a name="a150908"></a>An example, right now I can think of three syntaxes for defining a function. The profile would allow one. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a150908" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

	<li><a name="a132117"></a>I would like to see all example code stick to the profile. Of course once there was one such profile, there would be N.
