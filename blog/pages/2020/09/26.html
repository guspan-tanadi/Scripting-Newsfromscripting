<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a213804"></a>Last time I listened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> was a great time of my life. I can tell because the way it makes me feel today. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bonfire_of_the_Vanities">Master of the Universe</a> type feeling. This is mine. I made it, I own it, I can make it do what I want. It's the feeling in a young man's heart. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/26.html#a213804" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a171904"></a>BTW, here's something obvious but unthinkable. Trump is having all these rallies, larger and larger, knowing the deaths they cause won't be obvious until after the election. Now in a way it's much better not to live in a swing state.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/26.html#a171904" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a170621"></a>It's <i>all</i> going to change. If we emerge from these days, the world will be very different. We have to be different too.

	<li><a name="a170704"></a>I'm reminded of a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">talk</a> by Bruce Sterling that I keep coming back to. When something radical changes in your life, that's a good time to make other big changes. Death of a parent or spouse. Stock market crash. Major illness. Divorce. A time when you start over. When you have to start over. No choice. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/26/170539.html?title=shakeYourselfUp#a170704" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a170741"></a>Now, we <i>all</i> have been through that. We've had a major change not just on an individual basis, but on a <i>global</i> scale. Global. Everyone changed. So we can do it. We can change our lives radically. Trump demands it. Covid demands it. The climate crisis demands it.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/26/170539.html?title=shakeYourselfUp#a170741" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
