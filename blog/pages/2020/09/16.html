You see someone who you think you could be friends with because inside you're 19, and they call you sir, and you remember what it was like when you were them and you saw someone who looked like you look now.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/16.html#a212402" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Elect Democratic legislatures and governors, and then ratify a constitutional amendment that eliminates the Electoral College. Then everyone can move where ever they like, since all votes will matter the same. Now with remote work being more acceptable, and the cost of living generally lower in the low population states, why not relocate? It's a relatively simple hack, and the red state people can't do it to blue states. Heh. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/16.html#a133206" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131902"></a>Yesterday I was out and about doing errands, and instead of wearing my usual blue Mets cap, I was wearing my <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/16/daveWithWisconsinHat.png">red Wisconsin hat</a>. It has a big W on the front, and on the back it says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Badger">Badgers</a>. I was getting some dirty looks, and at one place a woman commented that I shouldn't wear that hat because people might not understand. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/16.html#a131902" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
