<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160426"></a>Reporters forget past atrocities, so they can re-discover them, so it's (as far as they're concerned) news -- again. This makes their job approachable. Anything beyond this would require them to adapt, risk, improvise, grow. In software, ideas from users can be confusing, but also incredibly valuable. Users have nothing invested in the way you do things. They just know what they want. Knowing what users want is valuable, but news doesn't incorporate that, because they never listen to users, they only listen to each other, and often not even that.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25.html#a160426" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a002657"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1309647969889779712">Poll</a>: Why do Trump and the Repubs do what they do?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25.html#a002657" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/25/sorry.png"><a name="a160316"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/25/sorry.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It's true that in 2016 Trump said he wouldn't honor the vote if he lost, but there is a big difference between then and now. Now he's the president, and he lives in the White House and is commander in chief of the armed forces. There's a lot of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Time Trump can really fuck things up for us, beyond how fucked up they already are. Everyone thinks Trump is going to lose but refuse to leave. I think he has another plan. When I was playing a board game with my little brother when we were kids, if he didn't like how it was going, well you know what little brothers do. That's Trump. A snotty ass little brother if there ever was one. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25.html#a160316" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Is there a music-playing Android app that can access files in Google Drive? I've been using that to transfer photos and movies from the phone to other devices and onto the web. I could easily do the same with music if I could play the MP3s from GD. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25.html#a132241" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a152255"></a>I remember reading this piece, carefully, word for word and beling relieved that there was a way to fight the virus. It's a summary of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html">podcast</a> McNeil did on March 12. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25/152249.html?title=trumpPlusTheVirus#a152255" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel." <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25/152249.html?title=trumpPlusTheVirus#a152557" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

Before listening, I had no idea how we fight this. After listening, I understood how it works. And that it had worked, in China and South Korea and other places. It would have amazed me then that here it is 6 months later and only a few states have done it remotely this way. Our efforts in the Northeast are primitive in comparison, but they worked. A lot of people were made very sick, and a lot of people died, but we got the virus under control. But it's raging out of control elsewhere in the country. You know when the Dems say the election is about health, they're talking about the ACA, but that's wrong. There's a pandemic raging through our country and it's growing again. We have to connect with this. And we won't have any hope, any hope at all, if Trump remains president.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/25/152249.html?title=trumpPlusTheVirus#a152607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
