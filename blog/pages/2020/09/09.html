Well, it might have saved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99oE_Yw4YA&feature=emb_logo">this woman's father's life</a>. "His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life." We've got to start caring about each other. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a214327" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a211029"></a>I bought two Biden/Harris lawn signs on Zazzle for about $50 including shipping. They let you <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/co/cart?rnd=637352537975121016">share your cart</a>, nice feature. Wish the price were a lot lower though. I want to see Biden signs everywhere.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a211029" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We're finding out in September. He's as bad as Trump.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a182518" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a203818"></a>I'm wondering what's new in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Glitch%22&t=h_&ia=web">Glitch</a> since I last <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/168">took a look</a>, back in April, over four days.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a203818" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/04/mrMet.png"><a name="a170423"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/04/mrMet.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm guessing the smoke is choking people who live in rural parts of Oregon, California and Washington, who say they have nothing in common with people who live in LA, SF, Portland and Seattle. Just want to point out they all breathe the same air. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a170423" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160437"></a>About mail-in ballots. 1. Why not count them as they come in? 2. When people say they take longer because they have to verify your signature, that's exactly what they do when you vote in person, at least everywhere I've lived (lots of places). By definition that process takes 24 hours. I'm guessing it takes longer to count mail-ins because they have fewer people doing the work?<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a160437" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a160527"></a>Re the trick Trump is openly planning to play on Election Night. Obviously the thing to do is not report returns for seven days after the election. We already have rules about calling an election before all the polls are closed. Well it takes longer now. BFD. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a160527" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

No political interference.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a140448" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142455"></a>If you haven't listened to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html">1619 podcast</a>, I highly recommend it. It's not often that a podcast has such lasting value. Opened my eyes about my own country.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a142455" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140425"></a>I would prefer if there were no debates this time, but if there have to be debates: 1. It should be done virtually. I don't want Trump giving Biden the virus. 2. No interruptions. After your time is up, your mike is turned off. They should practice this so it works perfectly.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/09.html#a140425" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
