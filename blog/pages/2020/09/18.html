<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a165010"></a>The wires are the problem, and Jobs fully understood this. I talked about this in <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17.html#a211718">yesterday's podcast</a>. They had the Mac office, school, backpack, pocket, the living room should belong to Apple. Not with a dongly thing and "content." It should be the Apple experience at room scale. I want a full scale Apple/Pixar experience in my home. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/18.html#a165010" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-urltweet="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1306963691028578305"><a name="a164204"></a>Gotta wonder if Trump and Barr are planning on disrupting the <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1306963691028578305">huge turnout</a> for early voting in Virginia. Actually I don't wonder, I'm sure they will. These are all antifa's, some very fine people, but some very not fine people too.

Every time I hear a new recording of Trump talking, in April, about how horrible the virus is, I want everyone to think how much different it would be if those recordings had come out in <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/04/">April</a>, not <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/">September</a>. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/18.html#a134916" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I desperately want it to run on Linux so I can get out of this situation. In the meantime, I bought a new iPhone, and just updated it and got <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/18/softwareUpdateDialog.png">this awful dialog</a> when I plugged it into my Mac. I clicked on Learn More hoping to find out which version of the OS it wants to install, but it <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208831">doesn't say</a>. I am running High Sierra, 10.13.8. I'm not going to update the Mac. I guess that means I'll be relying on the new Pixel 4a more and more, because I can't give up my ability to run Frontier on my desktop. Not a good situation, but as they say it is what it is. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/18.html#a130233" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

I'd like to see it run on Ubuntu, both in the graphic environment and headless. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/18.html#a130934" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
