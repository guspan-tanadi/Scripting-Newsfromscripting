<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/27/pandemicBook.png"><a name="a161612"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/27/pandemicBook.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">There's some good news about Covid-19 that you don't see in the news -- eventually it will become less deadly. Most viruses in that family do, the virus mutates, and a strain that kills fewer victims comes to dominate, and that process repeats. The virus spreads out to find new victims and over time it weakens. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">1918 pandemic</a> ended after two years, with no vaccine, but the virus didn't go away, it became seasonal. It still pops up, to this day, but it's nowhere near the problem it was in 1918. That will probably happen with Covid-19 too. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/27.html#a161612" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a144441"></a>I haven't been in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Clubhouse%22&t=h_&ia=web">Clubhouse</a> in a couple of weeks. I've been lurking a bit the last few hours. People talk like they're in therapy, and they're the therapist. Or like they're in the United Nations and they're from a small country, afraid they're going to start a war. Everyone is very cautions, non-committal. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/27.html#a144441" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Is 6-3 so different? Our big immediate crisis is how we turn the corner on the Nov 3 election, coupled with the ongoing Covid catastrophe.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/27.html#a140651" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

The only runner that matters is the one on third. The guy on first is trying to get you to pick him off.
