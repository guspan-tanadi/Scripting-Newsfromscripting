I've never been able to find it streaming. Just stumbled across it <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70302482">on Netflix</a>.  <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/07.html#a151932" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a141840"></a>BTW, re the pandemic, everyone who thinks Trump has done badly up till now, it's about to get much worse. He's found his Bill Barr for managing the pandemic. His name is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/04/909348915/president-trumps-new-covid-19-advisor-is-making-public-health-experts-nervous">Scott Atlas</a>.

It looked just like it did the day before. Nothing changed about the city. But I felt like people looked at each other differently. Did this person vote for Trump? Do they think I voted for Trump? I wanted to wear a button that said "I voted for HRC." Or better, I'm on the other side. I came up with the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MLK button%22&t=h_&ia=web">MLK button</a>. I bought a thousand of them, and gave them away. I still wear it some days when I'm out in public. It was a more general <a href="http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/">Black Lives Matter</a>. It said people are sacred and differences should be celebrated. And we're scared, so let's be there for each other. Today almost four years later, I suspect if you walk around Manhattan things are visibly different, and it's at least indirectly because Trump has been president for four years. Four more years? Hard to imagine how transformed this country will be then.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/07.html#a145050" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a202712"></a>Has anyone tried using polling to find out where the Covid-19 hot spots are?

	<li><a name="a160848"></a>Also if you accept the premise that they're also hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and I do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini#a160848" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

They're already doing it, for example forcing schools to open. That translates into death and disease, as you know.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini#a160853" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
