<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a131304"></a>The number of dead, for purposes of the election, should be the projected number as of Election Day. And a question should be part of the discussion.

Here's the question I asked, at the core of my case, and I'd ask it to Jay Rosen too, and to you dear reader, if you think what Woodward did was understandable and/or excusable. Why do you care about winning the election? What are you trying to prevent? Think about it. If you're listening and not arguing, you'll get it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/13.html#a131952" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132339"></a>I had to write a piece about this before I realized that <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs">Woodward</a> is probably the best/worst example. Had it been a random reporter at the NYT, I think people would have looked at it differently. The Times brought us many terrible things like WMDs in Iraq and Hillary's Emails. Holding on to such an important bit of information about the president, and the snake oil he was selling about the disease, would be less excusable perhaps if it were a reporter no one heard of, instead of the most famous reporter in the world, possibly the most famous reporter ever. Who feels qualified to criticize The Great Woodward, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter">St Peter</a> of the Church of the Savvy. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/13.html#a132339" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132607"></a>Someone on the NYT op-ed page has to call <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs">Woodward</a> out. But journalism always covers up the sins of journalism. Please let me know if you see journalism <i>not</i> doing this, I'll give them an award. It never happens. If only Rachel, Chris, Al, Joy, Wolf, Erin, Jake, Brian or Anderson looked at the Woodward case, and broadcast a message loud and clear, <b>if any other reporter does this, we're going to crucify them.</b> They do it regularly for Facebook. Someone has to do it for them. We pay too high a price for their inability to admit the most costly errors. They've all set a terrible precedent by remaining silent. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/13.html#a132607" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
