<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142840"></a>The <a href="https://lincolnproject.us/">Lincoln Project</a> is in a bind. As Repubs, they want to own the Court for the indefinite future, and here's their chance. Now the work they're doing to elect Biden is against their own interests. It's time for them to decide whether they really think we're going authoritarian, i.e. if the Supreme Court still matters if DJT wins. This may be nothing more than an election issue, only of symbolic value, if Trump has no intention of listening to the Court in the future, assuming he <s>wins</s> stays in power. The Lincolns seemed damned either way.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/19.html#a142840" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

Works fine. I'm afraid to update this computer, because I don't know what Apple is going to do to it. I use Frontier to write my JavaScript code, and also to keep around as an archive for about 20 years of work, that's still unmatched elsewhere. I don't want to lose my ability to run Frontier. Anyway I had a thought. Why not run Frontier inside VMWare, using 10.13.6, and then I could run it on any Mac. I think this would work and I could stop worrying about Apple breaking my work environment. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/19.html#a134911" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
