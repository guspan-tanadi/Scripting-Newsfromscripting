<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134324"></a>I applied for an <a href="https://absenteeballot.elections.ny.gov/">absentee ballot</a> in New York State. It seems to me they could allow me to download and print a PDF of the ballot, instead of mailing it to me via USPS. The first half of the process could be electronic. At least they didn't require you to send them a printed request to send you a ballot. They didn't ask for an email address. That's a shame, because that could be used to debug problems with the system, or provide confirmation when they receive the ballot. Also note they don't ask for your mailing address. This is good. However, they display the person's physical address in the form, once you provide information that isn't that hard to guess. <i>Not</i> a good idea. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05.html#a134324" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a132748"></a>No matter what this Thanksgiving is going to be a shitshow because in the US the virus is not contained. Christmas and New Years are lost as well. Instead, hunger and homelessness. Let’s hope we have the good sense to fix the problem on  Nov  3.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05.html#a132748" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

He had started a shoe company, very successful, sold it. I tried to have a conversation, but he mostly ignored me. He said something I remembered. You can't get by on less than $20 million a year. I looked to see if he was joking. He wasn't. I said you know that's not true. I live quite well, but I don't even spend $1 million a year (an understatement, I probably didn't spend $100K a year). I said there are lots of people who get by on $30K a year (it was a long time ago). He didn't say another word the whole meal.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05/132817.html?title=howTheSuperrichThink#a133351" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133416"></a>All that ignorance because he made shoes a lot of people liked. Shoes. I've seen it many times. Vast wealth doesn't make people smarter, though a lot of people including the super-rich think it does. It actually makes you stupider.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05/132817.html?title=howTheSuperrichThink#a133416" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133420"></a>A guy like Trump has no idea what it means to be president. Yet for some reason he decided that's what he wants to be. And he is. And he probably doesn't understand why people are so upset with what he said about suckers and losers.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05/132817.html?title=howTheSuperrichThink#a133420" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a133425"></a>I could imagine one of my roommates at UW-Madison saying something like what Trump said in the 70s. But a president not only can't, but a president can't even think it. A president has to send people to their deaths. That's a very big responsibility.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05/132817.html?title=howTheSuperrichThink#a133425" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>

The first thing you want to do when you come to Facebook is find out what’s new, so you pull down the menu with all the new stuff in it. In the old version in that menu were links to all of the comments, posts, likes of people I follow. Perfect. That’s exactly what I’m looking for. In the new version most of the new items are friend requests. I get huge numbers of spam friend requests. I can’t tell in this menu which are spam and which are real so I just delete them all. And it’s hard to find the new comments posts and likes of my friends. Usually new interfaces are upsetting in the first few days and then you get used to them and that’s it. That isn’t happening with this interface. It’s just wrong. Facebook you should fix it. I know this because I still have the old interface on my iPad and it’s much much easier to use. I apologize for typos in this. I recited it using voice recognition on my iPad, and it’s not perfect. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/05/210231.html?title=onFacebooksNewUi#a210237" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
