If it were bats, for example, that might mean more Covid-19 type viruses. Human-killing viruses come from bats because they have more powerful immune systems.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a215157"></a>On the west coast, every town has a few hot tub rental places. You pay a fee, about $10 or $20 an hour, and you get a private room with a hot tub. Soak for an hour. Come out a new person. Here's the list for <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=hot+tub+rental&find_loc=Berkeley%2C+CA">Berkeley</a>. In Palo Alto there's the grand <a href="https://watercourseway.com/tub-rooms/">Watercourse Way</a>. And if you want the best, go to <a href="https://www.esalen.org/page/esalen-hot-springs">Esalen</a> or <a href="https://harbin.org/">Harbin</a>. Of course you might want to wait until the fires are over. Nothing like this exists in the east. In all of New York City, the closest you could get was a communal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/nyregion/after-124-years-the-russian-and-turkish-baths-are-still-a-hot-spot.html">Russian bath</a>, that's like 100 years old. And no it's not the same thing. Once they legalize cannabis in NYC, they're going to need to open up some hot tub places for people to mellow out in.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14.html#a215157" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

We talked about lots of stuff, esp philosophy of maintaining networks of software. We both agree <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">deprecation</a> is a bad idea. I didnâ€™t know that there have been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=2020+riots+in+Madison%2C+WI">riots</a> in Madison. We talked about Kenosha in that context.

<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a142408"></a>A NYT reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1305244745917063169">asked</a> about early/mid 00's bloggers. There was a lot of response. I thought this was weird, a throwback to the thirst for recognition in the early blogosphere. The names offered were some of the famous ones, and I felt the same frustration I felt back in the day when the style sections of pubs like the NYT <i>made</i> those bloggers famous, and ignored the ones who weren't as young, but had deep experience in something other than blogging. The story always was here come the bloggers, look at how weird and stupid, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs">Microserfs</a> way, they are. If they looked a little deeper and more optimistically, they'd discover that their sources were going direct, and now they can do a different less superficial kind of journalism. That would have been powerful, instead we got the fearful story. Over and over. Blogging is and always will be <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources go direct%22&t=h_&ia=web">sources go direct</a> to me. I want to know what you know.

If you have information that can save lives, err on the side of disclosure. I was hoping that Ben Smith would do it in his weekly column, instead he went after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/business/media/the-intercept-source-reality-winner.html">The Intercept</a>. Reporters do that, go after safe targets, believing perhaps they'll never work with someone from The Intercept, or need a quote from the owner. As far as I know not one op-ed writer has said what Woodward did was bad. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14.html#a135430" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a140253"></a>BTW, I've written about The Intercept several times, including this important <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/12/04/theSnowdenLeaksAndTheBillionaire">follow-up</a> in 2013, that's actually still outstanding as far as I know.

	<li><a name="a193406"></a>A few weeks ago my Mac stopped going to sleep when I left. Not only will this burn out the monitor, it's a security problem. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14/193346.html?title=chromePlayingVideoHaltsScreenSaver#a193406" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a193511"></a>I tried rebooting. No help. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14/193346.html?title=chromePlayingVideoHaltsScreenSaver#a193511" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a193514"></a>Tried quitting all my apps. Then the screen saver would start. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14/193346.html?title=chromePlayingVideoHaltsScreenSaver#a193514" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a193528"></a>Now to figure out which app was the culprit. I figured it was Dropbox, my first guess for anything going wrong. Sorry. But it wasn't Dropbox. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14/193346.html?title=chromePlayingVideoHaltsScreenSaver#a193528" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a193534"></a>Turns out it was Chrome. If it thinks you're watching a video, it will keep the Mac from going to sleep. I had a window from <a href="https://www.agora.io/en/">Agora</a> open, because I was interested in it and planned to go back to learn more. Well it has a video on the home page. It didn't even register with me. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14/193346.html?title=chromePlayingVideoHaltsScreenSaver#a193534" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="a193616"></a>So I closed that window, waited a minute, with Chrome running, and the screen saver kicked in. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/14/193346.html?title=chromePlayingVideoHaltsScreenSaver#a193616" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
