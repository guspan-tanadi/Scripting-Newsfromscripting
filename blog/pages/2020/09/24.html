In today's language. We re-commit to re-form our government, so it can't be abused as Trump has.

Campaigns need slogans. For example, with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ThinkTank%22&t=h_&ia=web">ThinkTank</a> we had See What You Think. Of course Trump has many. MAGA. Mexico will pay for it. Fine people, on both sides. We'll have to see. Just a few. It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY">Yes We Can</a>. That's pretty good, hard to refute and doesn't really commit to anything in particular. I liked <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1840981_1840998_1840901,00.html">FDR's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvk_uLnv4uo">Happy Days Are Here Again</a>. That campaign happened long before I was born, but in a sense, I remember it. The same way I guess today's kids remember the Beatles. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/24.html#a134321" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a125451"></a>Why does the browserâ€™s Back button not work in Facebook? When you hit the Back button you're taken to a random place. You have to remember to look for a link to the previous comment, or the post, and usually you forget. No other website works like this. And once you erroneously hit the Back button the Forward button doesn't work either. The place you were at is lost. This is pretty bad for software that's ten years old, and the bug persists even in the new version, suggesting it's a deep flaw in the design, or worse, it's intentional.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/24.html#a125451" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
