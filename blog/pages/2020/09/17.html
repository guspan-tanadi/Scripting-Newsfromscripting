The tech has advanced so much, you could blow people away with elegance, ease of use, and power, and so what if it costs three times as much as the competition. We're accustomed to paying for the best. I should note that I have some $AAPL stock, purchased in 1997 and held since then so when Apple screws me in software at least I make up for it in my brokerage account. I'm so puzzled why I'm not using Clubhouse these days. And I'm totally maxed out on new services. OMG no more please. Also a story about hanging out with <a href="https://www.mixonline.com/recording/don-pearson-1942-2006-377439">Don Pearson</a> who did the sound for the Dead. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17.html#a211718" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a145926"></a>An idea for a business. Home entertainment system makeovers. I have so many friends with obsolete entertainment systems. They work fine. You get used to them. It was exciting when you got it 10 years ago and you still feel that. But. Things have gotten so much better and so much cheaper. Now, for very little money, relative to the amount of time you use it, you can have something much nicer. You could make people really happy and make a good living doing it, I think, at least for a little while until word gets out you just have to buy a new screen and then work out from there. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ’¥</span><span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17.html#a145926" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline"><a name="a134949"></a>I have a series 5 Apple watch, reading <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21440604/apple-watch-series-6-impressions-photos-video-blood-oxygen">this review</a>, can't see a reason to get the series 6. I use it mainly for timing my exercise, and to see what the temperature is outside and of course the time. I charge it every night, but it never gets less than 1/2 battery. I already have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08925BSQJ?gclid=CjwKCAjwkoz7BRBPEiwAeKw3q5aZ6H8UhO9-Mvimosqj09gb1Ieg576mrwkZy5zwD6s0GzfEl1wdQRoCBssQAvD_BwE">pulse oximeter</a>, and I take a reading once a day, and record it. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17.html#a134949" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>
<div class="divSingularItem" data-type="outline" data-image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/17/forester.png"><a name="a132203"></a><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/17/forester.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I have a new iPhone SE, new Pixel 4a, and a new Subaru, which supports both kinds of phones. I love all three very much. I previously had a super high end iPhone, but I'm a middle class kind of guy, and the SE is much more my speed. And for the first time I've been able to use an Android phone for navigation and listening to podcasts and audio books. I took a drive to Albany on Tuesday, and was able to test it out. It all works, in an unsurprising manner, except Google Maps on the Android has one feature that the iPhone version desperately needs. The map re-orients so that the direction you're heading in is always up and to the right. On the iPhone it's kind of random. Hard to parse. And the layout is much better for a driver, who can't spend any time puzzling out what the computer trying to say. If you have a turn in 2 miles, there's a box that says Right Turn in 2 Miles. And it counts down as you get closer. Next time I'm driving I'll try to take a picture (obviously with the iPhone). <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17.html#a132203" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

It's essential that you put a comment at the opening left curly brace to say what the block does. If that's not easy to do that indicates a refactor is needed, imho.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17/143659.html?title=selfexecutingFunctions#a144408" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
