American lives. People like you. If you can rationalize their deaths then you're part of the problem, as is Woodward and Trump. A chain of depravity.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/10.html#a165948" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

No more control group. No more placebos. It's ethical. Sometimes the information you uncover makes a difference, and holding onto it has an unacceptable cost. Same in journalism.

About 40 minutes. You can't hear the interviewer's questions, but it's not too difficult to figure it out.

Youâ€™re not a pundit on CNN. How do you know if you do it? Here's an extreme example. I say geez it would have been so easy for the reporter to save a few thouand American's lives. And you say, but I don't think his base would care. So perverse, even depraved. Yet I had that exact exchange repeatedly on Twitter last night. Think about how dehumanized you've become. These are people. Their families and friends were devastated by their deaths. They suffered terribly before they died. And they died! Geez Louise. Where is your humanity. And btw, no one, and I mean <i>zero</i> people give a shit about your punditry. You should factor that in as well. <span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/10.html#a132148" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></div>

	<li><a name="a231011"></a>Iâ€™m starting to hear conspiracy theories about the fires. Although I understand the appeal to the part of our brains that longs to believe someone has control, they are still quite disturbing. Today, I heard that people believe this is all intentional, intended to destroy rural America. I canâ€™t help but think this puts us far closer to civil unrest or war than Iâ€™d ever have imagined possible.<span class="spPermaLink"><a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/10/230646.html?title=nickArnettCaliforniaFireFighter#a231011" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></span></li>
	<li><a name="aNaNNaNNaN"></a>Equally scary is how entrenched the beliefs are, even though we know that the rumors are conspiracy theories promoted and encouraged by enemies who wish to bring about our downfall.
