# Checking in on Twitter
I started writing in Twitter just now and it turned into a short list of where Twitter is at from my point of view. Likes and dislikes.
* One thing I dislike in Twitter is seeing links to interesting stories that I can't read because they're behind a paywall.
* I also dislike that Twitter is very hierarchic. 
* I like writing in Twitter, and that makes me think a tool something like this for offline writing might be good.
* I dislike how hard it is to find something I wrote on Twitter. I pretty much have to get an idea into my blog so it can be indexed by the search engines. That's the only way I have any hope of finding it in the future.
