# News business models, again
Another thought re news business models.

As far as I know I can still buy a single issue of say The New Yorker at an airport news stand. 

Why not offer the same product online. Pure profit. No manufacturing or distribution cost. 

Important: I can buy w/o credit card, no commitment.

PS: On the web, not a Kindle.

PPS: I don't mind paying with a credit card, but I don't want to give the card to the news org.  Use Venmo or Paypal, for example. Or Apple or Google's wallet.
