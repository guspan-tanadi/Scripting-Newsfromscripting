I mostly write without typos, but they get introduced when I edit. I've noticed more typos than usual in the last few days. I think it's the changing of the seasons. Swimming is over until late spring. Still bike riding but some days it's too cold or wet, so I walk instead. And I'm no longer good at walking. This summer was the first time since I left California in 2003 that I was swimming every day. It's very good for me. And its absence is very unsettling. I thnk that's why I feel a bit off now.
