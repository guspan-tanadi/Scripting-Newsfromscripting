So here's a question for <a href="https://twitter.com/davenewworld_2/status/1316398093877772288">Trump supporters</a> who enjoy making <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libtard">libtards</a> cry. Do you think they're crying because you hurt their feelings? Is that what you're into? Do you also like to hurt yourself? Because the thing the libtard probably is crying about is how you're going to lose your health care, or job, or freedom, in other words how your injured dignity is going to hurt <i>even more.</i> If you make me sad it isn't because you called me a name, it's because our once-great country has been reduced to jealousy as a popular form of political expression. I wish you were happier with your life, I really do, but I don't think trying to give your pain to others is actually going to make you feel better. I think if anything it'll make you feel worse.
