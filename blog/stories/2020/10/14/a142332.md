So here's a question for Trump supporters who enjoy making libtards cry. Do you think they're crying because you hurt their feelings? Is that what you're into? Do you also like to hurt yourself? Because the thing the libtard is crying about is probably how you're going to lose your health care, or job, or freedom, or whatever. If you make me sad it isn't because you called me a name, it's because I'm sad our once great country has been reduced to jealousy as a popular form of political expression. I wish you were happier with your life, I really do, but I don't think giving pain to others is actually going to make you feel better. I think if anything it'll make you feel worse.
