I'm doing a phone interview/podcast with Jason Calacanis later today. I often blog about these things before doing them, so I fill my head with ideas that might be worth discussing. He and I have some interests in common, notably how to include universities in the tech development process. I think there's more to it than what Y-combinator does. Anyway, I just spewed (not kidding) a bunch of ideas into a <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1318919848240570368">Twitter thread</a>. Wanted to be sure it was linked into the blog.
