I had way too much to eat and drink at dinner yesterday, but it was great. A local restaurant has a great patio, set up to serve excellent food. That's the great thing about Woodstock, it's a small town, but it has the amenties of a place like a town in the Bay Area (e.g. Berkeley, Palo Alto). But I did eat too much and I'm paying the price for it today. Oy!
