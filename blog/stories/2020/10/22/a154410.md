One outcome from our recent back and forth is that I'm re-recommending <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/howtosInLittleOutliner.opml">my.this.how</a>. It's nice connection between "LO2" and the FAQ-type pages I've been doing, like <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp">Google and HTTP</a> and the <a href="http://this.how/trolls">trolling</a> faq (and many others). Blogs aren't enough. You need a place to put long-lived docs that you're going to work on over time.
