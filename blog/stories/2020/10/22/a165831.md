Since Andrew is working on a new version of the <a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a> server now, he asked if it would make sense to support "OPML" in rssCloud. That would mean adding a &lt;head> element that had all the info that's in the rssCloud element in an RSS feed. It's a good idea, but.. (sorry) -- OPML already has a realtime notification service, it came after rssCloud and is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">web sockects</a>. It's the core tech behind the [%search: Instant Outliner%], a protocol that "LO2" implements.
