# Watchlist feature for BingeWorthy
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/14/greenAcres.png" border="0" align="right"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnL1eMCKQgk">Quick video demo</a> of the new BingeWorthy <i>watchlist.  </i>

When you see a program you want to watch, look for the + icon in the upper left corner of the program box. Click it. The program is added to your watchlist, displayed just below the box. The icon changes to a checkmark. Click again, it's removed from the watchlist and the check icon changes to a + icon. 

The icons are weird, imho, but they are the ones Netflix uses for their watchlist, and Amazon Prime video copied them. So I went with Netflix's icons. As usual thanks to Font Awesome there was no work to finding the icons. 

I have a few more projects in mind for BingeWorthy. This one was a relative quick hit, took three days from beginning to end. Of course when I started I thought it would take one day. I think there might be another API layer possible for SQL databases that would make such a job much quicker, but I'm not ready to approach that yet.
