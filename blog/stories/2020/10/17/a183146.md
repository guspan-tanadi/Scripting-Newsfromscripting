# How Repubs get reporters to repeat their dirt
Repub says opponent X beats his wife.

<a href="https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1317302308112302080">Reporter</a> asks X "Do you beat your wife?"

The viewer just remembers X beats his wife. 

There is a science to this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK9KCG05HFw">Linguistics</a>. 

Shame our reporters are either complicit, naive, ignorant, greedy, or Republican. You pick.
