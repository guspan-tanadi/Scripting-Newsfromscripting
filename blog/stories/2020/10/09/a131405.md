<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/28/trumpOnTheRun.png" border="0" align="right">I hope Trump does his rally in Florida tomorrow. His supporters should see him in his all his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekChFdIe00">Captain Queeg</a> paranoia. Explaining the strawberries and how no one listens to him. Calling for a former president who many of them voted for to be put in jail, or perhaps worse. Maybe some of them will be shaken out of their entertainment stupor and realize this is the president of the United States, a formerly great country that is being flushed down the toilet because people in the middle of the country feel unappreciated, bored and purposeless.
