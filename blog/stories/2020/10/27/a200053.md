There was one question on the local Woodstock ballot, whether to fund a <a href="https://www.woodstock.org/planning/">new library building</a>. I voted yes. This is a very hot local issue. I see signs all over town, most of them saying Vote No. I read the posts in the local Facebook group. And while I'm new here, I am a taxpayer, and I will have to pay more property taxes to support the new library.  Here's why I voted yes. If the librarians want a new library, give it to them. They know what the town needs. They are the most selfless, idealistic people, by profession. Librarians <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html#a125814">helped me</a> a lot when I was a kid. I think this is what taxes are for. Funding libraries is directly related to the quality of life in a town.
