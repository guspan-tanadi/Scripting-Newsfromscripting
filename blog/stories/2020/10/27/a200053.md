<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/21/tree.png" border="0" align="right">There was one question on the local Woodstock town ballot, whether to fund a <a href="https://www.woodstock.org/planning/">new library building</a>. I voted <a href="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/10/23/letter-vote-yes-on-woodstock-library-bond-issue/">yes</a>. This is a very hot local issue. I see signs all over town on the <a href="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/10/23/letter-vote-no-on-woodstock-library-bond-issue/">issue</a>. I read the posts in the local Facebook groups. And while I'm new here, I am a taxpayer, and I will have to pay more property taxes to support the new library.  Here's why I voted yes. If the librarians want a new library, give it to them. They know what the town needs. They are the most selfless, idealistic people, by profession. Librarians <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html#a125814">helped me</a> a lot when I was a kid. I think this is what taxes are for. Funding libraries is directly related to the quality of life in a town.
