I was driving up <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rock+City+Rd,+Woodstock,+NY+12498/@42.0451038,-74.1204888,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89dd074a1c5d71cd:0x26f6555bfe042b4b!8m2!3d42.0451038!4d-74.1183001">Rock City Road</a> earlier, and there were all these cars parked on the side of the road, and I had no idea what they were there for. I thought maybe someone famous had died, but no, they were all there to vote. The line was very long. Proud of Woodstock.
