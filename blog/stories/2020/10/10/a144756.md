Happy to see <a href="https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/friday-9-october-2020">John Naughton</a> quote my <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies">howto</a> on breaking up tech monopolies. He calls it radical. It's the kind of judgment courts issue all the time. Look for ways to set things right. The web should have remained open. Google and Facebook didn't respect that. So undo what they did. It's the way a programmer looks at things, and imho that's the right way, because it's tech we're talking about setting right. Usually they don't consult techies in these things, however.
