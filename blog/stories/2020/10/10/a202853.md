Yesterday I did a <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/theViewFromNowhere.m4a">podcast</a> and <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt">blog post</a> about the View From Nowhere. I just realized that Joe Biden may be <b>The Politician from Nowhere</b>. I can't think of a single issue that he's associated with. Oddly I think that's exactly the kind of president we need in 2021.
