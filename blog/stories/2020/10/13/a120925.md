<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/29/racehorse.png" border="0" align="right">I object to the title of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/podcasts/the-daily/abortion-rights-amy-coney-barrett.html">this podcast</a>. "Why The Left is Losing on Abortion." Once again it's a horserace. Winning and losing. And the subject is wrong. I guess "The Left" is losing but really it's the people of the United States who are losing. This is a terrible disease in American discourse and until we train ourselves to stop ignoring ourselves and realize that <i>we</i> are the government, and insist that our journalists do the same, we will all keep losing, left, right, center, all of it.
