BTW, a Supreme Court justice is part of the government, and therefore governs, and since we are the government, the justice represents us. Who among us do Alito, Roberts, Kavanaugh, Thomas and Gorsach represent? Not me, not anyone I know. Probably not many Trump supporters either. So should we really be adding <a href="https://fedsoc.org/">another one</a>? This is the way journalism should be approaching this story, imho. But who am I. Just a voter, citizen, taxpayer. According to our rulers, insignificant.
