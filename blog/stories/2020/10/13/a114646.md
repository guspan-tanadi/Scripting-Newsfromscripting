I'd be impressed if the <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1315979874427904001">Democratic Party</a> urged us to join a social network for voters, one that would continue to influence (both ways) after the election. From there, we could be informed of how to vote. And so much more. It would be as revolutionary as the Declaration of Independence.
