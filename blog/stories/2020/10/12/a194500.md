I was writing enthusiastically about [%search: Clubhouse%], then I stopped, because I stopped using it. At first, for no particular reason. I wasn't finding conversations that interested me, and when I started them myself, usually nothing happened. Then came the antisemitism meltdown.  It was depressing to find out that fighting for equality, to the extent that it works, would not end the hatred for my people. After that I looked at every conversation there differently. Never spoke again. I still have the app, am still a member, so this all could change, but I thought it was good to update.
