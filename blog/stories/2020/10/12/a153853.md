Seems a good defensive move, in case this <i>is</i> the future, would be to start a few shows with characters who are powerful <i>Democratic</i> ideals for president. We have Martin Sheen, but he's a little old, and he is doing Trump-like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3yi41gfgA">cheezy commercials</a> now for cheap drugs. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geena_Davis">Geena Davis</a>. She played the first (and only?) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)">woman president</a> in a TV series in the US.
