Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27.html#a200053">wrote</a> about the vote for the new library building in Woodstock. I voted yes. Michael Hunt, who also reads this blog, and emailed me about the vote a couple of days ago, posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/iwrDgwUSCco">video summary</a> of the case for voting yes. It's a much better argument than I could make, so I thought it belonged here.
