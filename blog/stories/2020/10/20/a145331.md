Started a web and voice conversation with <a href="https://blog.andrewshell.org/rethinking-blogs/">Andrew Shell</a> about ideas for rethinking blogs and feeds. I found, as others have, that I need another kind of document to include in my personal CMS other than a story that's part of the blog. Everything about blogs are set up to be written, then lightly edited, and never touched again. It's <i>temporal</i> writing. But there are other things that I want to develop over time, keep coming back to, revising. A few years back I started this.how to hold those docs. It's worked out really well. I wrote the Google and HTTP faq as a <a href="http://this.how/">this.how</a> doc. We also had this in Manila, right from the start. We wrote, published and maintained the <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">docs</a> for Frontier using the same CMS we used for blogging. In the end the data structures are the same, what's confusing is how we think about them. But once you make a decision to put non-temporal docs "over there" then things start working.
