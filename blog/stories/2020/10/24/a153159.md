I wanted to send an <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/trailblazersPodcastAboutPodcasting.mp3">MP3</a> of the <a href="https://cdn.simplecast.com/audio/8b65b9/8b65b975-4895-4f5c-a140-81398900f4af/ff089f73-0e44-465b-aa58-a05a037fda46/trailblazers-s10e06-podcasting-vfinal-with-metadata_tc.mp3?aid=rss_feed&feed=excgs68S">Trailblazers podcast</a> about podcasting, but couldn't easily find it, and then realized I'd better download a copy and upload it to <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/trailblazersPodcastAboutPodcasting.mp3">my server</a>, because who knows how easy it'll be to find in a year or more. The web is pretty ephemeral.
