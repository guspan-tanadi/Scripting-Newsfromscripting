I've been using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029">Podcasts app</a> on my iPhone, it's using a whopping 20GB for old shows I'm never going to listen to again (or maybe never listened to at all). I assumed it garbage collected, but it doesn't. Podcasts should age-out, user configurable.
