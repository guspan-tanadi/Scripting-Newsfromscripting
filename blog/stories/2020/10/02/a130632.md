When people said it was virtually certain that the new Supreme Court justice would be confirmed, you have to question it, because now it's anything but certain. All it took was for the White House to get infected. It's a central node in the US government. Seems likely its infection spreads to Congress and even the Court. Hard to imagine orderly business taking place in DC for a while, but who knows anymore. Can't wait to hear what Mitch McConnell has to say, and if he was exposed.
