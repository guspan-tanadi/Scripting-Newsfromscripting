When people said it was virtually certainty that the new Supreme Court justice would be confirmed, you have to question it, because now there is no such certainty. All it took was for the White House to get infected. It's a central node in the US government. Seems likely its infection spreads to Congress and even the Court. Hard to imagine orderly business taking place in DC for the forseeable future, but who knows anymore. Can't wait to hear what Mitch McConnell has to say, and if he was exposed.
