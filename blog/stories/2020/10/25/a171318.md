<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/04/17/roku2.png" border="0" align="right"><a href="https://www.hbomax.com/">HBO Max</a> is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke">New Coke</a>. HBO was the <a href="http://www.tjwaldorf.com/brand-positioning-the-ladders-in-our-head/">#1</a> brand. Needed to be a little more like Netflix, but really it was pretty good as it was. Now the <i>max</i> part has coincided with it being a lot harder to use, virtually impossible if you use the popular Roku platform. At least for me. Looks like an epic mistake. At a time when the market is overloaded with lots of big brands (Disney, Apple etc) trying to diversity into a market already dominated by HBO, it's a really curious time for them to knock out their own legs.
