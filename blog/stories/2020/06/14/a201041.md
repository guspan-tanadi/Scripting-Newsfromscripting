There's going to be massive starvation and homelessness, because the economy isn't going to stay open, and the virus isn't going to "spike" -- that's wishful thinking. It's more likely the curve is going to go up and up and up, getting steeper all the time, until we stop the party and get serious about saving lives. Let's find ways to help each other. Black lives mattering can help save all our lives. We're all in the same boat now, believe me, and the police may loom large as the biggest problem, but imho, they are far from the biggest problem.
