We need to come together, not split apart. For example, health care is a BLM issue. With all the trillions of US government money that's going to be spent trying to keep the economy alive in the next year, and it's going to happen, we could use part of that money to convert the American health care system into a single-payer system without paying the insurance industry their unearned cut. They aren't doing anything for us except wasting our money. There's going to be massive starvation and homelessness, because the economy isn't going to stay open, and the virus isn't going to "spike" -- that's wishful thinking. It's more like the curve is going to go up and up and up, getting steeper all the time, until we stop the party and get serious about saving lives. Let's find ways to help each other. Black lives mattering can save all our lives. We're all in the same boat now, believe me, and the police may loom large as the biggest problem, but imho, they are far from the biggest problem.
