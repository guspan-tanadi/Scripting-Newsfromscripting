# JavaScript: Promises vs callbacks
In JavaScript, what do promises make possible that callbacks don't?

i've been writing large pieces of code in JavaScript for about seven years, all flow is via callbacks because: 
* That's all that existed when I started.   
* I like them, I think in terms of them.   
* My editor is proficient at managing them. 
* All this proficiency didn't come cheaply. A lot of time went into it.

I'm a big believer in this: one way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. Why? Because I'm going to end up supporting both.
