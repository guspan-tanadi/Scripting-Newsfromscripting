# Promises vs callbacks
What do promises do/make possible that callbacks don't?

i've been writing large pieces of code in JavaScript for about seven years, all flow is via callbacks because: 1. That's all that existed when I started. 2. I like them, I think in terms of them. My editor is proficient at managing them. All this proficiency didn't come cheaply. A lot of time went into it.

It's unthinkable to convert all the code, there's so much of it, I use and build on all of it.

I'm a big believer in this: one way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. Why? Because I'm going to end up supporting both.
