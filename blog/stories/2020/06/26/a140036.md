Everywhere you go people will tell you we don't like your type here. In my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens">neighborhood</a> in Queens, they said it about Jews, when we moved in. Many years later, same neighborhood, it was Chinese and Koreans. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York">Ulster County</a> it applies to people from NYC. It's bullshit.
