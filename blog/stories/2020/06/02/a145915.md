# We wedge ourselves
We have to stop being so modal about the big social issues. 

We should be fighting to stop mass killings with guns -- all the time -- not just after a mass killing. 

Same with #blm and #metoo and fighting against the virus.

Asians are blamed for the virus, btw.

Letting the news cycle control our lives is ceding too much power to the media corporations, platforms, political parties.

We can see the wedges the Repubs create to try to separate us, but we don't see the wedges we put between ourselves.

We can mourn a black man killed by a cop at the same time we mourn a country music fan killed by a shooter in Las Vegas or a school teacher killed in Connecticut. And we can stand between a mob and Asian-American doctors trying to save us from the virus.
