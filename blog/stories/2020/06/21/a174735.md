A bug in journalism is that it tries to put people in boxes. Your ideas only have value if you have credentials to back them up. This method makes reporters easily replaced by algorithms, and keeps us from hearing the most interesting  even eclectic idea stimulating ideas. Of course no one in journalism will hear this because heh I lack the proper credentials. 🤪❤️😂😜
