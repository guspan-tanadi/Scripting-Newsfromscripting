So they had 800K signups, with room for only 19K fans. Only 4 million live in Oklahoma. So the numbers were fishy. Even so Trump and the campaign hyped them. They seem to have believed them, they planned for overflow. They must've wanted to. Ethan Zuckerman <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanZ/status/1274685979182485505">says</a> it was activism, it was, but it's surprising how well it worked.
