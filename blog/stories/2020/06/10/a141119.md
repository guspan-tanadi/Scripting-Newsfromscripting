One thing that's needed is a canonical place to point about news that isn't behind a paywall. I want to point to something definitive from my blog for Defund The Police. All that Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=defund+the+police">finds</a> are news articles on paywalled sites, or ones infused with spyware, or ones whose archives won't last.
