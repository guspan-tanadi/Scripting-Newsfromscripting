<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/03/alice.png" border="0" align="right">I still want an automatic blog indexer. I would pay you $50 a year to do this for my blog. Like the index in the back of a book. It digests my new stuff every day, and adds each item under topics in an index, like the index in the back of a book. From there, I could human-enhance it. I'd really like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs, but not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend a few hours reading a book via its index. Once the technology is finished, it could also be adapted for the news. Bootstrap it. I'd love to help with such a project. We need this.
