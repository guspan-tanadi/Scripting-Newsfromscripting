# Radio3 work
A bulleted list in reverse order of stuff I'm looking at.
* Have to test to see if it still works with Slack. I suspect it does. Here are the <a href="http://radio3.smallpict.com/2015/05/25/pushLinksToSlack.html">docs</a> for posting to Slack from Radio3.  
* I'm removing the UI for the features that ping updates for the feed in custom ways. You can use rssCloud, which is specified in the feed Radio3 keeps for you. If you've built a system that depends on this please let me know. 
* OPML <a href="http://radio3.io/oldsettings.opml">archive</a> for the original settings dialog is here. 
* I'm removing Facebook and Wordpress from the user interface. Trying to preserve as much of the code as possible, so if we ever can resume the connection with one or both, it will be as painless as possible.
