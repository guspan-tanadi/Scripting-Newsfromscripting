# Radio3 work
A bulleted list in reverse order of stuff I'm looking at.
* Have to test to see if it still works with Slack. I suspect it does. 
* I'm removing Facebook and Wordpress from the user interface. Trying to preserve as much of the code as possible, so if we ever can resume the connection with one or both, it will be as painless as possible.
