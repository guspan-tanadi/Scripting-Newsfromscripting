# The NYT and criticism
<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/29/train.png" border="0" align="right">In all mess around the Cotton op-ed -- to me, a lifetime reader, subscriber and former partner of the NY Times, someone with a complicated long-term relationship, the most important flaw in the pub that is its unwillingness to listen to criticism.

So there's a huge hole in the perception of the NY Times, the point of view of their community. What a loss, for all of us. We are smart, educated, thoughtful people. We, collectively, know and see far more than the people they employ. 

This has been the opportunity of blogging and news -- a way to tap the minds of the world in a way that supports journalism. An opportunity news people gave up on before they even understood that the net gave it a new life. 

We need journalism to be much smarter than it is. We know a free source of smarts. Use it. 

PS: Also we have <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626">more money for you</a> if you can listen.
