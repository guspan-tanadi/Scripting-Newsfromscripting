Watching the <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1268716877355810818">Buffalo police shove</a> the tall 75-year-old man to the ground yesterday I was struck by two things.  1. If you put people with all the flaws of normal people in uniforms like that they're going to act like pigs. 2. Seeing an old white dude be almost killed that way was jarring, as an old white dude myself.
