I just cancelled my subscription to <a href="https://theathletic.com/">The Athletic</a>. Congratulations, <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/05/unsubAthletic.png">they made it easy</a>. As a result I will consider resubscribing if my interest in sports is re-kindled. I will now add another pub to the two I still subscribe to. (NYT and WP.)
