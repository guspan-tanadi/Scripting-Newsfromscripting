I just cancelled my subscription to The Athletic. Congratulations, <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/05/unsubAthletic.png">they made it easy</a>. As a result I will consider resubscribing when and if my interest in sports is re-kindled. I will now add another pub to the two I still subscribe to. (NYT and WP.)
