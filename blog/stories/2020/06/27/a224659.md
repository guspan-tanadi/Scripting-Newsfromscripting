They donâ€™t have the imagination. The Democrats could do it too, same prob. Or a startup could. Hire a former head of the CDC, and do the hourlong briefing Cuomo did, a weather report for the virus, and make recommendations for business and people. Huge piece of blue sky here. JC is an angel investor, with experience in journalism. He would be a good person to do this. I wish <i>someone</i> would. We need it.
