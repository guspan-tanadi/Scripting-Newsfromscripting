I read that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/">GitHub</a> is going to get rid of the concept of master for repositories because it's a reference to slavery. According to their <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">docs</a>, "By default your repository has one branch named <i>master</i> which is considered to be the definitive branch." A search of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+master">github.com</a> finds a lot of uses of the word master. And in the rest of the world, there are master bedrooms and master's degrees. Courts appoint special masters. There are a lot of <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=master">synonyms</a> in the thesaurus.
