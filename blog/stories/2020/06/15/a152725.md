A <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/15/foreverAndPagepark.m4a">podcast</a> about how I merged "PagePark" with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever-monitor">Forever</a>. A few weeks ago I did a podcast where I explained how the pieces <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/01.html#a204659">came together</a> for Frontier in the late 80s and early 90s. I was thinking about that then because a similar thing was happening with PagePark and Forever. I was putting the two of them together and had an aha moment where the pieces snapped together. PagePark has a very simple idea of what a website is, it's a sub-folder of the domains folder. The name of the sub-folder is the domain that maps to that content. The aha was realizing that you could also put a Node app, to be managed by Forever, which is a package you can integrate into an app, in one of those folders too. Not only did it work at a technical level, but it also provides Frontier-like integration. It's very nice. I've been managing apps in this little world for a couple of weeks now. Anyway that's what this podcast explains.
