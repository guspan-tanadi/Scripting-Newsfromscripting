I make a point of RTing people who are:
1. Smart.
2. Creative.
3. Have no stake in returning to how things were before Trump, Barr, Covid-19. 

Most people who do have a stake fill the pipe with punditry that confirms their desire to return to the G.O.D's. *

People who are unemployed and either insolvent, approaching insolvency, or who have "essential" jobs, have every right to tear down the system because it has written them off as expendable. 

If the system had no use for me, and I had the strength to tear it down, I would too.

That's why this struggle is no longer just about race. Which is good for blacks, in a perverse way, because now a lot more people are in the same boat, with lives that don't matter. And given the Repubs' unwillingness to fund local government, that includes cops too, btw.

*good old days
