A <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/30/pleaseRT.m4a">podcast</a> voicemail to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc</a>, who reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen">Martin Sheen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley">Wilford Brimley</a>. He has a piece today that he wants you to read. And I thought of a way to make that happen automatically. That's what this <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/30/pleaseRT.m4a">podcast</a> is about. 26 minutes. Rambly. :rocket:
