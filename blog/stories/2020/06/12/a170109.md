I got an email from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22the+correspondent%22+site%3Ascripting.com&t=hk&ia=web">The Correspondent</a> this morning, the first communication since they disappeared. I contributed $25 so I could find out what contributors got. Did it ever amount to anything? TheC didn't make sense, didn't come close to earning the universal acclaim it got, or the money they raised from the people. They claimed they would open a new kind of news org in America, and when they met their money-raising goal said that was never their intention.
