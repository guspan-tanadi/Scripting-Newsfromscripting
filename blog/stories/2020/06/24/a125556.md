<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/01/pigeon.png" border="0" align="right">I haven’t had any interaction on my Facebook posts in the last week. No comments, no likes, nada. It’s like it just ended. The people are gone, or Facebook algorithm isn’t showing anyone my posts. Meanwhile it’s rock and roll on twitter and on my blog. Later: Well it turns out, I have been posting mostly-private messages on Facebook since May 23. Not sure how it happened but only a few people were seeing them. I just posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1263656047175131">something public</a> and it's as if the lights turned back on. Now I'm going back through the last months' posts and changing the privacy setting on them. Whew.
