# JavaScript: The language of the web
<a href="https://twitter.com/glitch/status/1275809005093429249">Glitch asks</a> a very interesting question. 
* <i>If you could rename JavaScript what would you name it?</i>

Let's talk this through.

First what is JavaScript. Let's make a list of things it is. 
* It's a single syntax that works in the browser and on the server. A lot of the built-in routines work in both place.
* It's a vastly too-hard-to-learn language, but it's what we got. 
* If you were going to design one language that everything should be translated to, it would never be JavaScript, but once again, it's what we got. 
* Every toolkit shows up as a package in the server runtime for JavaScript. It's the default platform. If you want to write software that integrates lots of back end services, JS is your best choice. 
* It was created by the immediate competitive need of Netscape's visionary, and a future venture capitalist, combined with the longevity of a standard syntax that has grown a lot especially in the last couple of years. 

In every one of the answers to What Is It? you could summarize it by saying Worse Is Better. In every category, given a choice between elegance and simplicity, performance and ease of use, JavaScript picks the worst of the options. And since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse is better</a>, that's good! That's why it wins. It doesn't worry about being better, does it work, if so, let's use it and go forward. 

Let's go back to the beginning when Marc Andreessen didn't (presumably) want Java to run away with the web. That's the position Java had, and they were pressuring Netscape to bundle it with the browser, and he didn't want to do it, but he had to have something to put in his place. Pretty sure that's why he asked Brendan Eich to write it,  the legendary 10-day project. So what was <i>that</i> product? Maybe that should be the name? 

Even though they weren't thinking of server-side language that JS would become, really JS is the language of the web. That idea fits both the original vision and the current use. 

It's the language of the web. 

If the web's name is WWW, then this is WW/L.
