# My two cents about Hey
In an email to <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">John Gruber</a> --

John -- A few things bother me about Hey.
1. They're doing what they say they don't like about Apple. If I want to make a product for their platform, something that does something different with their email, I can't even pay them 30% of revenue. I'm locked out. 
2. Email already means something, and having choice in clients is part of that. So maybe they shouldn't call it email, that might alleviate my concern.
3. It's another Twitter. Five years from now people will get it. They're in a silo and there's no way out and no one can offer the features they offer without cloning the whole thing, which is kind of pointless, because the people you want to reach are still over there.
4. This will definitely be a blog post. ;-)
