<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/09/reaganHead.png" border="0" align="right">The biggest problem in police in America are the unions. You want to reboot the police? Knock out the unions. Redefine them. Limit their power. Then the voters can pass new laws about police. Until then, anything Congress passes is powerless. <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/reagan-fires-11359-air-traffic-controllers">Reagan</a>, when he took office, outlawed the Flight Controllers union. So you can do it. No more police unions. Police, you don't like it? Resign.
