<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/176">Dear friends</a>. I want to buy a couple of lounge chairs for the patio, to relax in the summer sun. It has to be sturdy and comfortable, but I don't want to spend a huge amount of money. Maybe $300? Do you have any favorites to recommend?
