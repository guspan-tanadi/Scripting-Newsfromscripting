Yesterday I read a post from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/annamasera">Anna Masera</a> in Italy who was going out to eat at a real restaurant. Not outdoor seating. Inside. Then I realized how great it's going to be to re-experience all the things we took for granted just a few months ago. If we survive this it'll have been worth it from that standpoint.
