Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrianbluestein/">Richard Bluestein</a> for doing the audio. Learned a lot from it, and also got to listen to some good leadership. I wonder who's going to fill the void. I hope the Democrats see there's a vacuum, maybe they could get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci">Dr Fauci</a> to do something like what the Governor was doing. Or a former head of the CDC? We need a trusted source of advice and scientific info to keep going. Not just in New York, but around the country, and elsewhere.
