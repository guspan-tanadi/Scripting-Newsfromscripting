I started to record a voicemail to <a href="https://om.co/">Om</a> about his <a href="https://om.co/2020/06/18/dropbox-is-a-total-mess/">recent piece</a> about Dropbox (it's short, you should read it before listening) but I kept going on, so I decided to make it a <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/19/toOmReDropbox.m4a">podcast</a>. 13 minutes.
