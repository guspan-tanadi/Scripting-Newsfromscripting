The episode on <a href="https://radioopensource.org/reviving-reconstruction/">Reconstruction</a> of Radio Open Source is a must-listen, esp the interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw">Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw</a>. I got goosebumps listening to her, and at the end I was fistbumping <i>YES</i> out loud on my bike ride. We are close to breaking through. The pandemic presents a huge opportunity for change that must not be wasted. Working together is required. I say something she didn't, white people will never know what it's like to be black, but we can work together, we must, we will.
