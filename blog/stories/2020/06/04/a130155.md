I dreamed last night I came across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a> riding a bike. We talked. I said wow I'm so surprised to see you. I told him to stay here and not try to find out what's going on in the world. I don't know why I said that, but it seemed real. He's been gone for a couple of years now.
