I started reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States">People's History of America</a>. It was just what I was <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1275054640393007113">looking for</a>. After this, I want to read the equivalent book about the Jews in Europe. I have very little idea what that was about other than it was rough and didn't end well. ;-)
