# An EZ-Pass for news
I want an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-ZPass">E-Z Pass</a> for news.  

Not micropayments. Tolls instead of paywalls. 

If I don't have an E-Z Pass, no access. If I do, it's seamless.

Suppose one month I spend $84 to read stories on The Atlantic. They can make me an offer to subscribe. Look dude, you're wasting money. Let us help you.

That's a lot nicer than -- hey asshole you can't read this article unless you subscribe. 

This is called marketing. A little romance with your sales pitch. ðŸŒ»
