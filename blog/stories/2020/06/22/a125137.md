I asked a friend who’s Jewish, as am I, how he’d feel if a statue of Hitler was in the middle of his town. He said it’s different. It’s not. Imagine, after surviving the war, getting your freedom, the people you lived with, who controlled the town you live in, celebrated your enslavers. The people who flirt with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan">KKK</a> tactics, use the intimidation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws">Jim Crow</a>, we can’t cleanse their minds, but we can force them back into the shadows. Blacks are every bit as American as any of us. Stop worrying about the feelings of the evil people, start caring for their victims.
