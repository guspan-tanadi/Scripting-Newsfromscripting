Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/21.html#a161133">linked</a> to a Joni Mitchell song, Twisted -- not knowing it was a cover for a song written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Ross">Annie Ross</a>. A reader, Richie B, sent me a link, and I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6OYSDYuvoA">this version</a> even better. Very sweet, twisted, jazzy. :boom:
