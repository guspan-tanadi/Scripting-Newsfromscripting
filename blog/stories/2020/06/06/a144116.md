# What about bad apples?
We could probably get by with a lot fewer police, something the police might not want to ignore. When they beat up citizens they are not only hurting the citizens, they're burning our money. We are literally paying them to do this.

If we can't find the bad apples, we could just start firing  police randomly. Maybe at that point, they'll see the value in helping find, remove and prosecute the bad ones.
