<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/26/purell.png" border="0" align="right">I’ve always thought the word <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=leftist">leftist</a> was silly and meaningless and made the people using it seem like idiots. People like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannity">Hannity</a> who is a known idiot. Anyway, I’ve decided to change it to “Left Tits.”  And Hannity is a “Right Tit.”  God gave us two tits.  Thank you.
