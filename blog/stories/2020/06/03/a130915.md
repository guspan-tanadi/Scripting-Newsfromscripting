There shouldnâ€™t be a season for causes. So right now anything other than #blm is off-topic. Until it's knocked off the top rung by a mass killing. Or a #metoo scandal. A climate crisis catastrophe. Or something Trump said (actually that doesn't seem to work anymore, thankfully). The virus is going to break that, because it's not going away, and it kills and disables more people, every day, than anything we've seen, ever. The suffering it causes is off the scale. But we should be able to see the thread that connects all these things. A lack of collective consciousness. An unwillingness to listen. We don't think, we only feel and those feelings are easily manipulated.
