I use my iPhone when I ride my bike, for Cyclemeter and to play a podcast, so it’s not easily available to take pictures. I want a relatively inexpensive phone mainly to use as a camera. There doesn’t seem to be such a thing. I considered getting a regular camera, btw -- but it isn't what I want. I want a small, cheap phone with a decent camera.
