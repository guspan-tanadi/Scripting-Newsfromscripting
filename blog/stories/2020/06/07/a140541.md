# A case study in readable code
I just wrote a JavaScript function that pads a string to a certain number of places, with a character you supply. You call it like this:
* pad (8, "0", 4)

That would return:
* 0008

It's a useful thing to have around.

Now how would you write it?

I bet you could do it in a single expression. It might be hard to understand, but in a way that's what you like best about it. You have to be smart to understand it. 

However, imho as a less spectacular coder, I would write it in eight lines of the most boring code possible. For example, 
* function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {

I can quickly read it and see what it does. I don't have to spend any time thinking about it, so I get on with my project that much more quickly.

Now this might strike you as inefficient. Look at all that code, and the looping. Oy. For fun, write a benchmark script. Call it a million times and see how long it takes. I'm pretty sure you'll see that it's fast enough. 

PS: It tooks 0.04 seconds to call <i>pad (8, "0", 4) </i>one million times on my iMac. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/07/oneMillionLoops.png">screen shot</a> of the code.
