This morning I changed <i>racism</i> in the title of yesterday's post to <i>white supremacy. </i>I think that’s what we’re going through now in the US. Totally unanticipated that the joy of <a href="http://scripting.com/2008/11.html">2008</a> would be followed by such upheaval. The US wants to shed racism, or does it? I didn’t realize we were still having this argument until recently.
