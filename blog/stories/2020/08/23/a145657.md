Heard a report this morning on NPR, interviewing older Trump voters, and while they say his behavior is awful and he lies, and he's botched the virus response, they're still voting for him. Why? They don't like #BLM. In other words, white supremacy. I don't think the Democrats are going to say this but it needs to be said. White supremacy is on the ballot this year. It may be the single decisive issue. Not the virus, not the Constitution. But the right of whites to dominate. I wrote about it <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/135804.html?title=whiteSupremacyIsOnTheBallot">yesterday</a>. The idea is hard to explain, but imho important. I'm going to work on better ways to explain, but for now you have to read slowly, carefully.
