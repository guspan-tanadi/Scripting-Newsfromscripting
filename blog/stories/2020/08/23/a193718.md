I'm working through the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial.html">Nice White Parents</a> podcast from the NYT. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial-2.html?action=click&module=audio-series-bar&region=header&pgtype=Article">episode 2</a> they're talking about efforts to integrate schools in NYC. They say it never happened. But, I remember, my family was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ps+149+qieems+ps+92+pairing">part</a> of a <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/03/19/106947848.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0">pairing</a> of <a href="https://www.ps149q.org/">two</a> <a href="https://www.ps92q.org/">schools</a> in white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens">Jackson Heights</a> and in black <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens">Corona</a>. My brother went to the Corona school, and I stayed in the Jackson Heights school. Of course I was a kid, so I wasn't really aware of what was going on beyond there were more black kids in our class. It also occurs to me that we moved not long after this happened, further east, to an area where there were no black neighborhoods to pair with. I don't know what motivated my parents to move, and it's too late to ask them.
