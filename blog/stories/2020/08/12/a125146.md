I've got my new iPhone SE. Transferring data from my iPhone XS/Max, after many tries because the old phone has four times the memory of the new phone. I had to delete a lot of stuff. But now it seems to be chugging along. It's quite a bit smaller than the original phone. First thing I want to do is take some pictures to see how well the camera works. Update: I gave up on the over-the-air update, and used an iTunes backup I took last night. Most of the data appears to have been preserved. All my music and photos are gone (but backed up on my Mac).
