<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/12/141733.html?title=reopenSchoolsNotYet#a152521">On July 12</a>, I posted a plan for (not) re-opening schools. "It's out of the question. What may happen is they will try to open the schools in a few of the Republican states, and close them within a few days as the rate of infection goes even higher. Cause and effect. You do something stupid and a week later the infections go up, two weeks later the hospitalizations go up and two weeks after that, the death rate goes up." It goes on from there.
