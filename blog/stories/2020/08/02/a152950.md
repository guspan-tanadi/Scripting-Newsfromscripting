Ken Smith has been indulging me, <a href="http://instantoutliner.com/ki">commenting</a> on stuff, blog-style, using "LO2", even though LO2 is not (at this time) a proper blogging tool. Yesterday he commented on my <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/01.html#a143905">process</a> for archiving content on Scripting News. Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/02/kenSmithPost.png">screen shot</a> of Ken's post. I don't yet have a proper way to point to it. I know a lot about this. <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/10/futuresafeArchives.html">Future-safe archives</a>. An organization has to have a strong commitment to creating a lasting record, because there are so many ways to lose it. My backup to GitHub is actually an offline archive. I try to keep the URLs working on scripting.com, if not other domains I've created. My focus is on scripting.com. Even so, I've broken a fair number of links over the years. a big source was in the switch to S3. A very rational thing to do, no regrets, but their server is case-sensitive, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSTAR">server</a> I had been using previously was not. It's too bad something like that was not mentioned in the founding documents of the web. I try to fix broken links when I find them. But keeping even one site unbroken is an impossible job. You do the best you can. :rocket:
