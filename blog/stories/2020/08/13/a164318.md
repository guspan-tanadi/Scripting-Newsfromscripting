I'm in a funny place with the new BingeWorthy. Started testing it with people who had rated a lot of programs in the previous version, and am getting good feedback. I'm getting ideas other than bug fixes and tweaks, and today I implemented one of them, which leads me to believe I should just make the new version public and start rolling out the new stuff here on the blog in public view. If you want to see what the new feature is, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZKjlklkU6Q">video</a>. Have a look. And if you think you could contribute to the testing, send me a message on Twitter.
