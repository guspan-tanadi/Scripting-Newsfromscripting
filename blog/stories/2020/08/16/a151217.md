But not in the time of Covid. I haven't had a gathering at my house since last winter, but last night we chanced it. These are lovely people who I speak with them frequently online, but it was so much better to eat and imbibe in person, outside, under the stars. With the animals and bugs. Ideas flowed. We made new jokes, new memes. I promised to do things that I have since forgotten. What I will never forget is how much I enjoyed their company.
