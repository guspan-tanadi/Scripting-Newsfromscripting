Can't wait for the election. Trump's plan to steal the election <i>will work.</i> First, do not vote by mail. Do not vote by mail. Not sure what you should do if you live in a state like Utah, Washington or Oregon where vote-by-mail is all you can do. Second, Congress has to come back. We must protest in the streets. Esp in <a href="https://twitter.com/KolbieReports/status/1294615470004469760">DC</a>. They must feel our ire. Now, not in November. That will, for sure, be too late.
