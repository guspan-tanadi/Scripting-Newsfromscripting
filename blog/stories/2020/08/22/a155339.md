Facebook, now that you've merged friend requests and notifications of new posts from friends, the fact that spam friend requests are out of control has become a more serious problem. I don't want to deal with the spam while checking out what my friends say. And there's a small chance a friend request is not spam, and there isn't enough info in the list to tell. So I just delete all of them. I get about 10 spam friend requests every day, or at least that's what it was before they got merged with other stuff. Either get the spam under control, or re-separate them.
