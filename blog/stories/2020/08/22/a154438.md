<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/184#issuecomment-678655918">Small change</a> in "BingeWorthy". The rank now displays the rank in the hotlist as displayed in the second panel, where each program has a minimum of five ratings. Previously, for example, <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-west-wing">The West Wing</a>, which is currently third, would show a rank of 15 because there were programs with less than five ratings that averaged higher than The West Wing with 141 ratings.
