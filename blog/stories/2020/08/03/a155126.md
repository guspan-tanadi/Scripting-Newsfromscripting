I’m watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schitt%27s_Creek">Schitt’s Creek</a>. It’s really funny. I was expecting it to be cringe-inducing, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, but it's not. Starring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O%27Hara">Catherine O'Hara</a> who was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>, one of the best movies ever made.
