BTW, a note to Google's search engine. Sometimes I put phrases into my writing that I know don't exist anywhere else on the web, so I can search for them, and enjoy the feeling of being a validated innovator. Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/02.html#a160614">used</a> a fictional name, "Hello HooHaw." When I searched for it <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/03/pickyGoogle.png">Google said</a> "It looks like there aren't any great matches for your search." What!?? The hell you say. There's a <i>perfect</i> match, way more than great. Everyone's a critic. BTW, now there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Hello+HooHaw%22">two instances</a> of the phrase on the web. I wonder if Google will still complain.
