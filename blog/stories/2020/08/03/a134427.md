John Naughton wrote a thought-provoking piece yesterday in his Memex 1.1 newsletter entitled <a href="https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/sunday-2-august-2020">Nostalgia isn't what it used to be</a>. (Note to the Substack devs, there should be permalinks on sub-sections of the web versions of newsletters, so I can point directly to the bit I'm talking about.) Naughton says there was a point in human evolution where we decided we were above nature, and that's where things started to go wrong. It's why we think we can return to some kind of normal once the pandemic is over. But every time we try, we to hit a wall and more suffering and death results. I've observed something similar. Our troubles with the environment started sometime in the last 100 years when, through technology, we were able to make our presence felt on the ecosystem to the point where human activity could melt the polar icecaps. So in a destructive sense, we are above nature, but that's not a good survival strategy. In fact, we live infinitesmally short lifespans on an insignificant speck of dust in space, with delusions of grandeur, when the best we can achieve, which is pretty good, is friendship and love. We're going to get smart now, and learn to be the mortals that we are. Or we're going to cease to exist. In other words, it's time for the human race to grow up.
