<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/15/chihuahua.png" border="0" align="right">John Naughton wrote a thought-provoking piece yesterday in his Memex 1.1 newsletter entitled <a href="https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/sunday-2-august-2020">Nostalgia isn't what it used to be</a>. (Note to the Substack devs, there should be permalinks on sub-sections of the web versions of newsletters, so I can point directly to the bit I'm talking about. Might as well put them in the email versions too.) Naughton says there was a point in human evolution when we decided we were above nature, and that's when things started to go wrong. It's why we think we can return to some kind of normal once the pandemic is over. But every time we try, we hit a wall resulting in more suffering and death. I've observed something similar. Our troubles with the environment started some time in the last 100 years when, through technology, we were able to make our presence felt on the ecosystem to the point where human activity could melt the polar icecaps. So in a destructive sense, we <i>are</i> above nature, but it's not a good survival strategy. In fact, we live infinitesmally short lifespans on an insignificant speck of dust in space, with <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html#3">delusions</a> of grandeur, when the best we can achieve, which is pretty good, is friendship, love and to a small extent, self-awareness. We're going to get smart now, and learn to be the humble <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html">mortals</a> that we are. Or we're going to cease to exist. In other words, it's time for the human race to grow up.
