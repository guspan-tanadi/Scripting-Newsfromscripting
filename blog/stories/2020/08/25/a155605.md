A <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/25/flatDiscussionGroups.m4a">podcast</a> on flat discussion groups on the net. Mail lists, Facebook groups, GitHub threads, Clubhouse chatrooms. People in these flat structures always behave the same way over time. After 40 years of being part of online groups, I see there are no new tricks in the human species, these things always evolve the same way. That's what this podcast is about. Might be a chapter in a book someday.
