Over the years I've resisted characterizing the Trump voter. It's more than racism -- it's white supremacy. All kinds of things freak them out but the one that they can't live with is black equality. Strips their gears. Not negotiable. They'll tear the country down before they let that happen. As long as all they have to do is vote. They're not very strong, and as soon as hard times really hits them they'll crumble. They've lived sheltered lives for generations, feel entitled.
