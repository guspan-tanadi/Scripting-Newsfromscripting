I replaced the picture in the Facebook and Twitter metadata, so when you paste a link to bingeworthy.io, you'll get a more meaningful <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/24/bingeworthyScreenShot.png">image</a>. The place holder in the first version was a picture of <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/11/breakingBad.png">Mr White</a> from Breaking Bad and in version 2, the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/16/schittsCreekCast.png">Rose family</a> in Schitt's Creek.
