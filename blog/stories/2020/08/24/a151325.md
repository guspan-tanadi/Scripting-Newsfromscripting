If Trump is re-elected, I think the country has to split in two. I don't think we, in the so-called blue states, can handle another four years of Trump. We'll have to find a way to opt out. I feel for all the people of color, immigrants and Jews in the red states. We have to provide for their migration. Either that or we rebel. But the Constitution, if it allows a man like Trump to be elected and then re-elected, is not worth preserving imho.
