More on Friday's <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bidens-acceptance-speech-election-interference-steve/id1514968525?i=1000488856251">Lincoln Project podcast</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Schmidt">Steve Schmidt</a> said everyone in 2016 in DC knew Manafort was a Russian spy. He called the Clinton campaign to give them a heads-up, they said they already knew. This reminded me of when when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier#Publication_by_BuzzFeed_News">Buzzfeed published</a> the Steele Dossier, and the rage of other journalists that they had disclosed unverified information to the public, even though the dossier was being widely circulated in DC at the time. I was glad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)">Ben Smith</a> took the side of the people. There should be little difference between what insiders know and what the public knows. Some things are so important, people should take risks, esp if they want the rep of being a patriot as Schmidt clearly does. Anyway it turns out "collusion" was too polite. The Trump campaign in 2016 was actually run by Russia. This is now an established fact. This should get huge headlines.
