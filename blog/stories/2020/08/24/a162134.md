<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/21/tree.png" border="0" align="right">"BingeWorthy" continues its march to perfection. There's now an <a href="http://bingeworthy.io/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> that lists all the recent ratings and program additions. It supports <a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a> so you can get instant notification of updates. I expect to plug this into other stuff I'm working on. Comments or questions <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/184#issuecomment-678798955">here</a>.
