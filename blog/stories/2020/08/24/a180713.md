At times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/opinion/jerry-seinfeld-new-york-coronavirus.html">like this</a> I like to say: NYC is not dead because it was never alive. Words like <i>dead</i> should not be thrown around casually. Death is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)">heavy</a> <a href="http://thesaurus.land/?word=death">word</a>, and should be reserved for real death, not an imaginary stupid metaphoric death.
