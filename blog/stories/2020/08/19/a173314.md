I've had a report that commenting on Scripting News doesn't work. I just signed off and then signed back on, and commented and <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1296139456307695618">it worked</a>. If you're experiencing a problem please write it up in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/185">this thread</a>. Include as much detail as you can so I can try to reproduce the problem. As I said, I just went through the basic operation and it worked.
