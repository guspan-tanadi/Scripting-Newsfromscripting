I finished John Barry's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491">book</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">1918 pandemic</a>. I would <i>not</i> recommend it, if your goal is to learn as much as you can about the pandemic itself. In the afterword, Barrt explains why the book isn't really about the pandemic, it's about how scientists collaborate. He used the pandemic as an example. I had pretty much already figured that out. So much information about the lives of the individual scientists. It went on and on. I skipped whole chapters. Now, I like a good story as much as anyone, but nothing about his tale made me care about them as people. And that isn't why I picked up the book. I want to learn as much as I can about influenza pandemics as possible, because I'm living in the middle of one. To his credit, the book was published 15 years ago, long before Covid-19. I'm going to keep looking for a book that focuses on the science.
