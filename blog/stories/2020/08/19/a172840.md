# Mouse invasion
Over the last year, I've had two of mouse invasions in my car. One where a mouse chewed through a vent in my air conditioner, and the latest where a family of mice made a nest in the air conditioner and then proceeded to die! 

Ay ayay.

I had the mouse family cleaned out by the local Subaru dealer, but the smell lingers, and now I have to figure out what to do. It's not a nice problem to have! 

Oy.
