* Peppermint oil and peppermint tea bags in glove compartment, in and around passenger side doors. 
* Peppermint oil on cotton balls stuck in the battery cozy.
* Poison or traps.
* Seal the garage.
* "I run car with AC full on, then squirt peppermint oil down the outside air intake at bottom of windshield. After a minute you can smell it inside the car and I stop. You have to keep doing it every week or so."

Notes --
* Drive your car every day. 
* They hate strong smells. 
* In new cars the wires are soy based and the mice like to eat the wires.
* Late summer and early fall is when mice are looking for their winter homes?
* If you poison mice, you poison their predators.
* Mothballs may be poisonous for people to breathe.
