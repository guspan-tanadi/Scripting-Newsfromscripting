Since people are moving out of cities, it would be so cool if they moved to swing states. In case we manage to get rid of Trump and restore the rule of law, it would be helpful to better-distribute blue state voters to places their votes are needed. Even better, move to low population red states, like Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, the Dakotas.
