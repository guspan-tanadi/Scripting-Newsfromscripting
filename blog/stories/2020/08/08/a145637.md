BingeWorthy 2 tease #1: I want to watch something. I ask my friends what to watch. A bunch of responses. A few of them I want to watch, I choose one to watch, forget the others. A month later I ask the question again, the loop repeats. I know I'm skimming the surface, there are better shows out there, and my friends know where they are. Ths is the wrong way to do it. There's got to be a better way, right?
