<img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/12/stooges.gif" border="0" align="right">I heard yesterday on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions">Clubhouse</a> that people stopped reading my blog because of RSS. Interesting story. They <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/12/thingsAreCrystallizing.html">subscribed</a> in "Google Reader". Stopped reading on the web. Then they shut down Google Reader. The people who were reading my blog before RSS, lost track of the feeds they were reading in Google Reader. There were other choices, but that doesn't change what happened. We are rebuilding slowly, because blogging is still a useful form of communication. My <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly email</a> is the best way to get it, probably always was, even in the heyday of RSS. I have to admit reading <i>this</i> blog in RSS was never a great deal. I write one day at a time. I'd prefer if you read what was on the home page at midnight. That's how I write it. Since RSS is something I'm well-known for developing, I didn't want to say this too loudly. But RSS should have had a chance to grow, and it didn't. So it got stuck. Not really a surprise.
