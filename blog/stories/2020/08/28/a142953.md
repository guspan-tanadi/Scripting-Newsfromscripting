<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/28/pickup.png" border="0" align="right">I bought a compact Nissan pickup truck in 1991. 4-cylinder, drove like a golf cart or lawn mower, excellent mileage, great for trips to hardware or garden supply store. They donâ€™t seem to make them anymore. Pickups are monster size and up.
