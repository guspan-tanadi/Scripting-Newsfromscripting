# What if Biden doesn't choose Harris?
From a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1300841583456577?comment_id=1300853373455398&reply_comment_id=1301136613427074">thread</a> on Facebook.
* My two cents on Kamela Harris and baggage.
* She has the worst kind of baggage. She's already tried to humiliate Biden, unfairly, in public. It didn't work. My experience in life is if you let something like that go, they do it again and again. The relationship is over. 
* She can run for president again, maybe she'll even win, maybe I'll vote for her, but it would be a sign of weakness and ignorance, even naivete for Biden to choose her. He can't say any of that, because she's popular. 
* He may just have to weather the bullshit from Harris supporters, and there are many and they are vocal, and pushy (not her so much, her supporters, some of whom I consider friends), and then we can tell the people who are trying to raise hell that they're playing with our lives and their own lives, and they should just let it rest. 
* That said, she's also from California, which won't get you a lot of votes in Iowa or Wisconsin.
