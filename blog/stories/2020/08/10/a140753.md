<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/10/logitechKeyboard.png" border="0" align="right">I need a backlit keyboard because I write at night and the room where I work is pretty dark. I like it that way. I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075H32ZFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Logitech keyboard</a> which I like, but the keys are getting sticky, and it's blowing my concentration. I spend so much time at the keyboard. The keyboard should be transparent, I should never have to think about it while writing. As I look <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=backlit+keyboard&crid=1CCAK8VV2F5JV&sprefix=backlit+%2Caps%2C164&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_8">on Amazon</a> there aren't many keyboards that are illuminated, at least from companies I've heard of, and the prices are suspiciously low. I would buy one from Apple if they had one. The model that I have now has been discontinued, it seems.
