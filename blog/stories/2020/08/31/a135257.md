<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/13/michaelJackson.png" border="0" align="right">Dan MacTough sent a note last night saying he had listened to the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/01/howFrontierGotStarted.m4a">podcast</a> I published on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/01.html#a204659">June 1</a>. He had an <a href="http://this.how/frontier/howFrontierGotStarted.opml">automatic transcript</a> made. It's the story of how Frontier was developed between 1988 and 1990. I had two years to get back into fulltime programming after selling Living Videotext to Symantec. It was totally an iterative process, I didn't know where I was going to end up. Started by building components, then puzzled out how to integrate them. It's the way I've always developed, before and since. Made for an interesting but somewhat exhausting read. I had forgotten the details, for the last 30 years I've been <i>using</i> the software. It's taken us to interesting places, blogging, podcasting, XML-RPC, RSS, etc. Lots of food for thought. :boom:
