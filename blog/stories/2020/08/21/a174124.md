Wouldn't it be great if people from the cities migrated to places like <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/wyoming_rb/">Wyoming</a> and <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/idaho_rb/">Idaho</a>, where very few people vote, yet they have two senators and extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College">Electoral College</a> oomph. Might not even be too late for the November election in some states. And btw, Zoom works in Wyoming too. It's almost like a bug fix for the Constitution. :boom:
