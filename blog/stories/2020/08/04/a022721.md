<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/04/melo.png" border="0" align="right">I watched an NBA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble">bubble</a> game this evening between the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trailblazers. I didn't realize how much I missed live sports. It's good but I think they should get rid of the fake things.  Iâ€™d like to hear what the sport is like with just the player sounds, no simulated fans.  The screens with fans supposedly reacting to the play is pointless. I remember that high school and college basketball had charm, because the fans weren't so much a part of the action. Please put the player names on their uniforms. And.. When Melo scores the announcer has to say  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo+Annnnnnnnthony">Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo Annnnnnnnthony</a>. Please. Also Melo must wear a white headband. How else can I find him on the court?
