<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/04/melo.png" border="0" align="right">I watched an NBA "bubble" game this evening between the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trailblazers. I didn't realize how much I missed live sports. It's good but I think they should get rid of the fake things.  Iâ€™d like to hear what the sport is like with just the player sounds, and no simulated fans.  The screens with fans supposedly reacting to the play is pointless. You can't see very much of what they're doing. And put the player names on their uniforms, please. I remember that high school and college basketball had charm, because the fans weren't so much a part of the action. I think the NBA could be good that way. And..  When Melo is playing the announcer has to say  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo+Annnnnnnnthony">Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo Annnnnnnnthony</a> when he scores. Please. Also please Melo needs to wear a white headband. How else can I find him on the court.
