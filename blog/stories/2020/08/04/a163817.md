I'm reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Influenza#:~:text=271407049-,The%20Great%20Influenza%3A%20The%20Story%20of%20the%20Deadliest%20Plague%20in,the%20worst%20pandemic%20in%20history.">book</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">1918 pandemic</a>. And it's amazing how much the 2020 pandemic is a replay. The president at the time, Woodrow Wilson, did nothing about the outbreak. Cities were on their own. People said Oh it's just the flu. Then they got it and died.
