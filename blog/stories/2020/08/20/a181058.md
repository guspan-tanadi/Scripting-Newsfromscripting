I wonder why the DNC didn't create an actual crowd for one or two speeches. It can be done safely. Look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4">eulogy</a> Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd.
