I’ve praised Andrew Sullivan in the past, so I have to say <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-trap-the-democrats-walked-right">his latest</a> is just propaganda, garbage, filled with lies. I guess this is what he’s like unchained from NY Mag. I didn’t read his stuff before he moved to NYM. He’s like a Fox commenter. Vile. And because he's smart, he must know what he's doing. My friends said I was wrong about him when I <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/10/commentsOnSullivansPiece.html">praised him</a>, writing from his <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/andrew-sullivan-president-trump-and-the-end-of-the-republic.html">NYM pulpit</a>. They were right.
