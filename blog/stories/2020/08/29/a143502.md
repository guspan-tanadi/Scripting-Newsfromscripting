BTW, the Pixel 4a has a headphone jack. At one time that was a <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/10/28/appleMakingRoomForPixelAndSurface.html">big deal</a> for me, but not no mo. It feels weird. I wonder if I'll find a use for it. Basically Bluetooth works reliably now. At one time, not too long ago, it did not.
