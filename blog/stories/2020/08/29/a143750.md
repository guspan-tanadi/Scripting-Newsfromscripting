I had the car fumigated, but sadly, the stench is as bad as ever. I'm going to find out what I can get for the car in trade, and move on. A <i>very</i> expensive lesson. On the other hand, I asked my fellow Woodstockers how they deal with mice and cars, and I have learned so much. I'm going to make a list of all the ways people keep the mouse damage to a minimum, and I'm going to practice it. I was very lax, liberal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> even with the local mouse community. No more. I am on the warpath. It's them or me! :boom:
