# Who will do journalism?
Most of the people my age when we were in school never imagined computers would be used by normal people to communicate. They resisted the idea. 

So what are most of us missing today? I think it has to do with who will be doing our daily journalism. Imho, we all will. Why?
1. A void is being left as professional journalists focus on fewer stories.
2. We’re learning how to do it with blogging and social media.
3. We need and want journalism.
4. It’s like jury duty, it’s uplifting, gives our life purpose and meaning. It’s its own reward.
