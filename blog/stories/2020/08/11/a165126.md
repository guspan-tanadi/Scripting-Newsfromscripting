JavaScript, which I love in the way a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Hearst">hostage</a> loves his or her hostage-taker,  fails the test of "Does the code look like what it does." It requires you to stand on your head with every finger in some random orifice to get simple stuff done if it involves any waiting. On the other hand if no waiting is involved, the code is perfectly understandable. If they invented JavaScript in the 70s, in the 80s we'd invent a language the fixes this colossal design error. With all respect to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan</a> and his <a href="https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/">10-day</a> moon mission project.
