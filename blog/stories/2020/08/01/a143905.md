Every month I archive the OPML source for the blog, including all the metadata, to a public GitHub repository, so you can see how the data flows. There are lots of conventions in the form of attributes on &lt;outline> elements. This is the data that <a href="https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog">Old School</a> uses to render <a href="http://scripting.com/">the HTML</a> you see on the web.
