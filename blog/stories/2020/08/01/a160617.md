I once had a "deal on my desk" for the company I started to be acquired by Microsoft.   How bizarre that in 2020 the so-called president of the United States has such a deal on his desk. What's his cut. Did Microsoft agree to limit criticism of Trump on the new TikTok. How does the US government control it vs China. How bizarre that the great wall appears to be going up in the US. Will loyalty to Trump be part of the terms of service for the US-owned TikTok? I can't imagine China would object.
