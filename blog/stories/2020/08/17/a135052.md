A little secret. Begin every reply with one of these: 1. Thank you. 2. I'm sorry. 3. You're right. It puts the reader in a receptive mode. As they skim they're looking for one of these. When they find it, they relax. You can always find something to be thankful or sorry for. Or you can find something that the other person said that was correct. You can thank me now. :boom:
