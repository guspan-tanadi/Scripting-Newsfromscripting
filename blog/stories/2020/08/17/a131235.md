I'm going to watch the DNC tonight, but there's real competition in the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-playoffs-bracket-2020-standings-projections/15owf3ue8ug1g12k7jgud2b11w">NBA playoffs</a>, which starts today with games between the Nets and Raptors and then the Sixers and Celtics, two hot matchups. The basketball has been excellent this summer. I'm also super excited that <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2020/08/nba-world-reacts-to-carmelo-anthonys-dagger-to-send-blazers-to-playoffs/">Melo made</a> the playoffs, finally, with his new team the Portland Trailblazers. I knew all along that he wasn't a team leader, like LeBron or even Damian Lillard who leads the Blazers. He's a Hall of Fame supporting player. Too bad he was miscast all those years as an alpha. Imagine if Melo had been LeBron's sidekick. At least he's found a happy home now, and that's cool.
