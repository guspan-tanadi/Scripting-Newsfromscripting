Fill the void. Extra funding from foundations, individual support. Think of it as de-nationalizing the CDC. It's time for journalism to perform a <i>vital</i> function that used to be done by government. <i>Don’t let truth become partisan. </i>News has a new bigger job now. Our survival depends on it.
