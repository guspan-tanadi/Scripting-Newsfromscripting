# More about opening schools
They aren't correctly analyzing the opening school situation on CNN. A couple of points.
1. We understand very little about the virus. Can't be sure it doesn't affect young kids. It might just manifest itself in different not obvious ways, and it might not manifest immediately.
2. Opening schools is like opening a gas station in the middle of a wild fire. Adding more virus-infected people, regardless of their age, in an out of control virus fire is  as stupid as it gets.

We have to think in terms of the big picture. The president is an idiot, but that doesn't mean we have to be too.
