# Mussolini vs a second chance for America
You always have to think about what you're trying to accomplish in the big picture before going into the weeds. Do I really care, right now, whether X is the VP choice. 

Heard Jim Clyburn on the radio this morning. He correctly said we're desperately trying to get rid of Mussolini right now. That really is the only thing. Anything that takes us off the path to doing that decreases the odds that it'll happen.

So before you complain about Biden, rememeber that not only is Clyburn right, he also chose Biden. 

We need the biggest landslide win this time. It needs to include every possible voter of either party. A black man decided that. And he was <i>right.</i>

It's Mussolini or a second chance for America.

That's what's on the ballot.
