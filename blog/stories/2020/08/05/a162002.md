# Mussolini vs a second chance for America
Heard Jim Clyburn on the radio this morning. He correctly said we're desperately trying to get rid of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/02/clyburn-trump-mussolini-390500">Mussolini</a> right now. That really is the only thing. Anything that takes us off the path to doing that decreases the odds that it'll happen.

We need the biggest landslide win this time. It needs to include every possible voter of either party. A black man decided that. And he was <i>right.</i>

You always have to think about what you're trying to accomplish in the big picture before going into the weeds. Do I really care, right now, whether X is the VP choice. Not if you want to live in a relatively free America, one that responds to the challenges we face, instead of trying to paper them over with PR.

It's Mussolini or a second chance for America.

That's what's on the ballot.
