It doesn't surprise me that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/202008/survey-reveals-children-coped-well-school-closure">kids do well without school</a>. I remember as a kid being really pissed off that so much of my youth was wasted sitting in rooms with my hands foldeed, with my mind anywhere but in school, learning nothing and being bored out of my mind. I thought of school as very lazy, unimaginative, typical of adults. It wasn't really until grad school that school started working for me.
