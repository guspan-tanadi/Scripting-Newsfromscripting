I listened to the first episode of the <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://feeds.megaphone.fm/trippishow">Joe Trippi podcast</a> yesterday. I met Joe when he was running the Dean campaign in 2004. First campaign to make use of blogging, opened up politics to the people. He made an important point in the podcast, that politics is additive. Of course we want to have Republicans speak at this year's DNC in support of Joe Biden. This is one of the <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html">benefits</a> of having Biden as the candidate. We need to re-form the political system in the US, the opposition are the people who don't follow the Constitution. Republicans who believe in the rule of law are our friends, our fellow Americans.
