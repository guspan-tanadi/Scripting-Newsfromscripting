<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/27/pandemicBook.png" border="0" align="right">I'm reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491">John Barry's book</a> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">1918 pandemic</a>. I'm up to the part where they're deciding in Philadelphia whether to hold the war bonds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Liberty_Loans_Parade">parade</a>. Seems like where we're at now with <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/sports/the-marlins-covid-19-outbreak-is-really-bad-and-exactly-what-mlb-signed-up-for-160751017.html">MLB</a>. At least then the US was at war, not sure what the excuse is today. Basically we're the most spoiled country, not serious, can't think, reason, don't listen, take pride in pissing other people off (the Fox watchers) and couldn't save our own lives if all it took was wearing a mask and staying home for a few months, all of us at the same time.
