How did the flower children of the 60s become the Boomers of the 90s and 00s? Not a good question, because that isn't what happened. Hippies were a very small part of the Boomer generation. George W. Bush is a Boomer, but not a hippie, then or now. And sure, some hippies didn't drop out, but then a bunch of them did. My uncle, for example. He really did live the dream of the hippies. As I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me">Lies</a> book, I come to appreciate that there are people applying the scientific method to history, and not accepting the simple and wrong stories of heroes and villains, weak and strong, the savages and the civilized. BTW, some of the hippies became programmers. That's a whole other thread to pick up. That's why the freedoms of the net and the web <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">persist</a> to this day. A fair number of people believe in them, still, and follow the grain, instead of trying to build forts.
