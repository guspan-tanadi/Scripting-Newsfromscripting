One more thing, my disappointment in the EFF, as I discussed <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10/225547.html?title=anEffToWatchTheEff">yesterday</a>, is that they started off with the hippie ideal, the three founders were immersed in it, I hung out with all of them, but as the EFF grew, they let the billionaire monopolists set their agenda. I wanted them to tell the story of how podcasting as it was created by following the grain of the web, not by throwing huge money and installed base at the idea. Sometimes soft power is the way to get something done. They wouldn't even listen, that's how little respect they have for the individual. Why should they, the most I can contribute is a few thousand, Google can contribute millions. Imagine what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69w_CXFR7tE&feature=youtu.be&t=8">Bernie Sanders</a> would say. The EFF is a prime example, imho, of flower children losing their way.
