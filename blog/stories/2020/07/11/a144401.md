One more thing, my disappointment in the EFF, as I discussed <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/10/225547.html?title=anEffToWatchTheEff">yesterday</a>, is that they started off with the hippie ideal, the three founders were immersed in it, but as the EFF grew, they let billionaire monopolists set the agenda. I wanted them to tell the story of podcasting as it was created, by following the grain of the web, not by throwing huge money and installed base at the idea. Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction">soft power</a> is the way to get something done. They wouldn't even listen, that's how little respect they have for the individual. Why should they, the most I can contribute is a few thousand, Google can contribute millions. Imagine what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69w_CXFR7tE&feature=youtu.be&t=8">Bernie Sanders</a> would say. The EFF is a prime example, imho, of flower children losing their way.
