# Really Simple JavaScript, day 2
Following up on <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript">yesterday's post</a> where I talk about striving for simplicity in using JavaScript, my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/awbjs">Allen Wirfs-Brock</a>, who has been involved in JavaScript language design for many years, and was editor of the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">ES6 spec</a>, responded thus:
* Because of JavaScript’s "don’t break existing code" policy, often the only way to fix an existing problematic features is to leave it alone and add a better alternative. This inevitably leads to profiles that include the better features and leaves out the deprecated ones.  
* You probably don’t use <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> , but most commercial JS devs seem to. There are probably thousands of configuration profiles for it that enforce various style guides and and subset preferences. 
* For example <a href="https://standardjs.com/">JavaScript Standard Style</a> is popular but controversial both because of its self-assumed name and because of the positions it takes on semicolon usage and other conventions.
* Regarding choice of function forms, my preference is to use the the <code>function hello () {}</code> form in most situations where I wanted to define a named function, both global and local.  I’d generally reserve arrow functions for cases where I’m passing an anonymous function as an argument or otherwise using it as a first class value.  
* I’d probably only use <code>const hello= () => {};</code> in situations where I need to name a function that needs to reference the this binding of its surrounding environment.
