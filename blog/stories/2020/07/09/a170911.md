# Senators, go to Jacksonville!
Many <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-national-convention-rnc-coronavirus-gop-senators-jacksonville/">Republican senators</a> are apparently <i>not</i> going to Trump's convention in Jacksonville. Why?

<i>They should go!</i>

Also hope their children and grandchildren will be going back to school in the fall.

And there's a <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/decision-2020/trump-to-hold-outdoor-rally-in-portsmouth-nh-this-week/2154220/">rally</a> on Saturday in New Hampshire. <i>They should  go! </i>No masks, social distancing, lots of ways to get dead. Hey if it's good for Americans, why not the senators? And of course their families.
