I discovered a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/09/featureInGitHub.png">new feature</a> in GitHub. If you create a public repository with the same name as your account, the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/scripting/blob/master/README.md">readme.md</a> file in that repo is displayed on your <a href="https://github.com/scripting">GitHub home page</a>. Of course it's Markdonw. Might be interesting to integrate some of the status-editing features I'm working on into this. It supports basic web stuff, as you would expect from a techies site like GitHub. Okay this might be fun. :balloon:
