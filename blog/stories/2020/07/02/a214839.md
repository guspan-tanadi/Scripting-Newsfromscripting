# Idea for science fiction story
a virus hits the world.

far east then europe then the americas.

they know what to do in the far east, they've been here before recently.

europe learns fast.

but in the americas, it's a disaster. the rest of the world walls itself off. isolating the two americas.

within months almost everyone has died of either the virus or starvation or in the various civil wars that break out all across both continents.

after a few years, expeditions are sent from europe and asia to survey the remains. they found pockets of former americans, mostly naked, living off the land, many practicing cannibalism.

the story, from there is about how the natives adapt or don't and the murderous cruelty of the colonists.
