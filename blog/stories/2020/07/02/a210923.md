<a href="http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/dontCryForMeArgentina.m4a">A 25-minute podcast</a> I did this morning. It was mostly about what's in the gaslighting post below. Expanded, and starting with an observation by <a href="https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html">Ken Smith</a>, English prof at Indiana University, that students deserve to be shown how to use <i>the power tools of our culture.</i> Teachers should say that to them, out loud. I tried saying it loud and felt the power. Led to a story or two. The title of this podcast is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD_1Z8iUDho">Don't Cry For Me Argentina</a>. Wish I had thought to play that song during the podcast. Next time. :boom:
