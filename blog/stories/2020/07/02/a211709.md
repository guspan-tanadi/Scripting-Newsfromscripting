Really interesting discussion going on globally on what <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/873172499/the-debate-over-objectivity-in-journalism">objectivity</a> means in journalism, esp in re #BLM. I spent <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">many podcasts</a> with Jay Rosen talking about his idea of the mythical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere">View From Nowhere</a>. You must disclose who you are, and disclaim that your writing comes from who you are. This came up in another discussion yesterday about what <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3">integrity</a> is.  "A human being has integrity if he or she is what he or she appears to be. That's why integrity commands us to disclose conflicts, so that what we say, and who we appear to be, are in synch. Change the appearance if necessary." It's material if the editors of a publication are predominantly of one race. Until this year, however, as far as I know, the subject had never been raise. Times they are changing.
