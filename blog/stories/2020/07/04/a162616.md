Here's a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/settings/davewiner/packages">list</a> of the 37 Node.js packages I've made available through NPM. I was just planning a project and was sure I must have created a package for reading to and from a GitHub repo. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davegithub">There it is</a>. Two entry-points, getFile and uploadFile. Voila. Not much in the way of docs. But there is an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/github/tree/master/example">example app</a>.
