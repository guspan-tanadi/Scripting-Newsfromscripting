The <i>infinite scrolling</i> <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/10/17.html#a161833">feature</a> on the Scripting News <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> wasn't a good idea, because it made it difficult to reach the bottom of the page which has useful stuff on it. I just turned it off. I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kRl-Qy7_I">video demo</a> of the feature so we can remember how it worked, and if needed I can turn it back on. And the <i>More</i> button remains, so you can use that to scroll back, one day at a time.
