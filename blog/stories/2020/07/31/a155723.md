BTW there is an <a href="http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rssNightly.xml">RSS version</a> of the nightly email. Not sure how well it will display in most readers, it has CSS that depends on definitions they won't have. Probably could fix it up if anyone is actually reading this way.
