One of the founders of the wicked Federalist Society says <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/07/30/politics/federalist-society-trump-election-mail-in-voting/index.html">Trump has gone too far</a>, and is sort of calling for his impeachment and removal. The Repubs might want to, now, take a risk they might be punished for crossing Trump, and earn the loyalty of Americans who are not insane and want to live. If not loyalty, perhaps a bit of forgiveness. A tiny bit. A miniscule, infitesmal bit. Okay maybe they won't be tried for crimes against humanity along with Trump.
