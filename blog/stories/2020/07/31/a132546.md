Our epitaph: We could imagine, then create, a world that we couldn't manage. That's what I think when I hear the current government didn't care if massive numbers of people in blue states died from the virus. That's a form of genocide. We couldn't protect ourselves from this. We couldn't even lock-in this a basic of sanity. Our system was open to this kind of abuse. It's hard to imagine a system of government that could. Conclusion: human civilization doesn't scale to the level we're at. It's even worse than it appeared before Trump and the pandemic. I guess because Trump could happen and so could the pandemic. That didn't factor into our thinking. No one dared to be that pessimistic.
