Our epitaph: We could imagine, then create, a world that we couldn't manage. That's what I think when I hear that Kushner didn't care if massive numbers of <a href="https://twitter.com/JHWeissmann/status/1288930877213417474">people in blue states died</a> from the virus. That's a form of genocide. We couldn't protect ourselves from this.
