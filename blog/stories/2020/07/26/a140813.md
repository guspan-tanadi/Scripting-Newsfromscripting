I'm having a debate with myself. Should we encourage or discourage people from wearing <a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/swastika">swastika</a> masks? On one hand, it's a <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectLincoln/status/1287388507519025152">disgusting symbol</a> of race hate. They tried to destroy my people, forced my family to emigrate to the US (not a bad thing btw). We fought WWII against the swastika people. We won. On the other hand, swastika masks probably do as a good job as any other mask, so if that's what they want to wear, maybe we should say okay that's fine, wear your swastika. We may think you're miscreants, desperate for attention, <a href="http://this.how/trolls/">trolls</a> of the first order, but at least they're not spreading the virus. Maybe we should even <i>give</i> them swastika masks??
