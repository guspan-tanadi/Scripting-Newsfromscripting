I love reading local real estate ads and imagining who would live in such a place, who did live there, what kind of life I would live if I lived there. Here are two local properties. One has four cottages, as the ad says, one cuter than the next. You could start your own art colony for a mere <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11-Tannery-Brook-Rd-Woodstock-NY-12498/2084428274_zpid/">$825K</a>. Another, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/48-Raycliffe-Dr-Woodstock-NY-12498/54151995_zpid/">$650K</a>, is land only, 6 acres, but it's pretty amazing land. It gives you an idea why artists like to relocate to the mountains on the east side of the Hudson Valley. Definitely a site to dream about.
