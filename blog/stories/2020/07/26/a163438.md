<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/19/beet.png" border="0" align="right">I love reading local real estate ads and imagining who would live in such a place, who did live there, what kind of life I would live if I lived there. Here are two local properties. One has four cottages. You could start your own art colony for a mere <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11-Tannery-Brook-Rd-Woodstock-NY-12498/2084428274_zpid/">$825K</a>. This listing gave <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/19.html#a141211">NakedJen</a> all kinds of ideas.

Another listing, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/48-Raycliffe-Dr-Woodstock-NY-12498/54151995_zpid/">$650K</a>, is land only, 6 acres, but it's pretty amazing land. It gives you an idea why artists like to relocate to the mountains on the west side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley">Hudson Valley</a>. Definitely a site to dream about.
