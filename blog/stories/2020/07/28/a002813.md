The thing that makes fiction interesting is if they take you to a world with characters who feel real who you connect to. And their world, which might be very different from yours, feels real too. The whole thing hangs together. It makes sense what they do, and say, and <i>some</i> of it isn't exactly what you guessed. This is all a long-winded way to say is it gives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">good suspension of disbelief</a>. That's why a show like Succession works so well. The people are mediocre, and foolish, and their world is vastly different from the one we live in, and the people are colorful and interesting, educated, but also frail, simple and kind of disgusting. But you keep coming back for more because you feel it.
