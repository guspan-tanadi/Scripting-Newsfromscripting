The problem with journalism exposed in the age of Trump is they don't do anything. You say oh they're not supposed to. Voice from nowhere, etc. But they rarely carry stories of people who do things. Mostly Trump. Occasionally #BLM or somesuch. That's it. Why does it matter now? Because we've been needing to do things since November 2016. We seem to figure it out when it's too late. It's a repeating pattern.
