I blogged about my first <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff">break with the EFF</a> in 2005. Subsequently I vehemently <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366">objected</a> to how they defended podcasting, they didn't even respond (how arrogant is that) and ultimately the effort to give control of the web to Google, that was the absolute last straw. When they do that, they are no longer defending electronic freedom, they are protecting the rich monopolists. Ugh.
