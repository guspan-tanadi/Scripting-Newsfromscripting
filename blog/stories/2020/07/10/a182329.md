I blogged about my first <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff">break with the EFF</a> in 2005. Subsequently I vehemently <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366">objected</a> to how they defended podcasting from a patent troll, and ultimately the effort to give control of the web to Google, that was the absolute last straw. They are no longer defending electronic freedom, they are protecting the rich monopolists. Ugh.
