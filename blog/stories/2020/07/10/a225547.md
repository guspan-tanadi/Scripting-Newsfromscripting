# An EFF to watch the EFF?
The EFF started, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">30 years ago today</a>, with the right idea, defending speech on the then-nascent net. I gave them $5000 at startup, but ultimately they sold us out to the big tech companies. Now we need a new EFF to reign in the original EFF.

I blogged about my first <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff">break with the EFF</a> in 2005. Subsequently I <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366">objected</a> to how they defended podcasting from a patent troll, and ultimately the effort to give <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">control of the web to Google</a>, that was the absolute last straw. 

They are no longer defending electronic freedom, they are protecting the rich monopolists. Ugh.
