# An EFF to watch the EFF?
<a href="https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1281312334284312576">Helping encrypt the web</a> == destroying the <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">webâ€™s history</a> and giving full control to Google. The EFF started with the right idea, I gave them $5000 at startup, 30 years ago, but ultimately they sold us out to the big tech companies. Now we need a new EFF to reign in the original EFF.

I blogged about my first <a href="http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff">break with the EFF</a> in 2005. Subsequently I <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366">objected</a> to how they defended podcasting from a patent troll, and ultimately the effort to give control of the web to Google, that was the absolute last straw. They are no longer defending electronic freedom, they are protecting the rich monopolists. Ugh.
