There's a new trend in programming that we must change our software so as not to, internally, invisibly to users, use terms like black or white, master or slave, etc. I'm editing some code now that has the concept of enabled and disabled. Can you imagine if we have to purge this from our tech vocabulary? The economics of such changes are mind-boggling. And the breakage. What if we used such a term in one of our standards? A frozen one? An ancient one? What then?
