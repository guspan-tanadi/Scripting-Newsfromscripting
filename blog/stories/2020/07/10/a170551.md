I'm trying to understand why Dr Fauci doesn't have a daily briefing carried by all the networks. Okay we know Trump wouldn't let him, and as long as he's employed by the US govt, Trump can probably stop him. But what if Fauci decided he would be more effective outside of government? Who would bankroll such a venture, as a public service? I'd be willing to contribute myself.  #savemylife
