# Hamilton and Brockmire
I subscribed to Disney-Plus so I could watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)">Hamilton</a>. 

Parts of it I liked, but for the most, it was very Disney. I wasn't expecting that for some reason. I was prepared to be inspired but it never happened. 

I then subscribed to Hulu so I could watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockmire">Brockmire</a>. 

It is very good and very not-Disney. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Azaria">Hank Azaria</a>, the voice for so many great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_cast_members">Simpsons characters</a>, plays a washed up baseball play-by-play announcer who ends up in a washed up Pennsylvania town, announcing for a team called The Frackers. 

It's LOL funny. Really good. And Azaria, as you might imagine, can play any character that requires character.
