I was talking with a friend yesterday about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen">Woody Allen</a>. We both felt that he had been unfairly <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woody+allen+condemned&t=hk&ia=web">canceled</a>. And yes the word <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/woody-allen-memoir-canceled-hachette-outrage-1202216039/#!">applies</a> to his experience. He's one of the great film makers of our time. The movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(1979_film)">Manhattan</a> came up, and I saw it was playing on Amazon, so I watched it. What an incredible movie. I think people forget that Allen wrote the movie, so any flaws you see in the main character, and they sure are there, were put there by him. In the end you feel his heartbreak at having been so dismissive of Mariel Hemmingway's character, she was so much more wise than him, even though she was so much younger. I had forgotten that Diane Keaton was in the movie. It's a masterpiece.
