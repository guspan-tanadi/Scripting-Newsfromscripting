# Simple is not stupid
A lot of people seem to think I'm realllly stupid. 

I think it's because I strive for simplicity in my work.

It happened right from the start, with <a href="http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html">ThinkTank</a>. I factored it for years, until it was super easy. 

The others said they could do it in a weekend.

Heh. They couldn't

In the next version, we added a blindingly complex feature, cloning. It was actually also pretty simple, but when you demo'd it, you could see their minds exploding. 

Hooo, what was that? 

Technology. Ohhhh. 

You have to impress them if you want them to believe you.
