I prefer <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire">Metacritic</a>  to <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-wire">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/">IMDB</a>. I like it because it's clean and simple. They gather reviews of lots of pubs, rate them on a scale of 1-100, and they give the movie or show a rating based on the average. A show with an 80 or higher is must-watch.
