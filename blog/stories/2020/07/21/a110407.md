<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/21/mask.png" border="0" align="right">Portland could send a handful of plain clothes cops to DC to arrest the temporary acting secretary of Homeland Security. Grab <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Wolf">him</a> off the street, into an unmarked car with DC plates, fly him back to Portland, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-justice-department/index.html">lock him up</a>, and put him on trial for kidnapping. He's a nice looking guy, he'd probably look great in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Penitentiary">orange</a>. :boom:
