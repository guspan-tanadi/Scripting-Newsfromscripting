Why doesn't Portland send a handful of plain clothes cops to DC to arrest the temporary acting secretary of Homeland Security. They could grab <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Wolf">him</a> off the street, fly him back to Portland, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-justice-department/index.html">lock him up</a>, and put him on trial for kidnapping. He's a nice looking guy, bet he'd look great in orange.
