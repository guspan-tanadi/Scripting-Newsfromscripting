# Object initializers in ES6
The new <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">version</a> of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+javascript&t=hk&ia=web">JavaScript</a> has simplified object initializers. It's one of the new features I use, and like. A brief summary of how it works. 

Here's a situation that comes up a lot:
* var tvShow = {

As you type it you think geez there's got to be a better way, and now there is:
* var tvShow = {

Since usually the only thing you're going to do with this is pass it off to a subroutine to save it in a file or database, you could do it this way:
* saveShow ({id, name, class, network});

In the old more cumbersome notation you probably wouldn't want to do it, but now I find I do, esp if there is only one property to initialize. 

I guess the bottom line is I don't mind two ways to do something if the new way is a simplified version of the old way.
