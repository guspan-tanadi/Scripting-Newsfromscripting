# Object initializers in ES6
A situation that comes up a lot in my <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+javascript&t=hk&ia=web">JavaScript</a> code:
* var tvShow = {

As you type it you think geez there's got to be a better way, and in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp">new version</a> of JavaScript, there is.
* var tvShow = {

Since usually the only thing you're going to do is pass it off to a subroutine to save it in a file or database, you could do it this way:
* saveShow ({id, name, class, network});

In the old more cumbersome notation you probably wouldn't do this, but now I find I do, esp if there is only one property to initialize. 

I guess the bottom line is I don't mind two ways to do something if the new way is a simplified version of the old way.
