Last night on MSNBC they just now started talking about how Puerto Rico was the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine">canary in the coalmine</a>. That should have been topic #1 as it was happening. Moderator, ask your pundit, geez if he'll leave Puerto Rico to die, why would he care about whether we live or die? Why do they leave the tough questions on the table until it's too late. The point of the canary is to pay attention when the canary dies, when you're about to die, it's too late.
