This is why you take pictures of your food. A picture of a <a href="http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/odessadinner">dinner at Odessa</a>. I don't know what all of it is. The sausage is probably a kielbasa. And the dumplings are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi">pierogi</a>, and come with fillings like sauerkraut, mushrooms, potatos and various meats. The pancake on top doesn't look familiar. I think that might be stuffed cabbage on the right at 2 o'clock. There's some kind of soup at the upper right.
