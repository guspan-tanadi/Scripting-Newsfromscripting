# A language worth learning
JavaScript is a lovely language once you’ve spent a few years getting comfortable with its quirks. Not what I’d recommend as a starter language.

Here are some of the qualities of the ideal starter language.  
1. One way to do things not 20.  
2. Boring, so the newbie can focus on their own app, not the language weirdnesses.  
3. Frozen. They should be able to run their student projects 40 years from now.  
4. No callbacks, synchronization handled in runtime.
5. Algol-like, so you can get support form millions of experienced developers.  May think of more qualifications later...
