# A language worth learning
JavaScript is a lovely language once you’ve spent a few years getting comfortable with its quirks. Not what I’d recommend as a starter language. Yet it is the language most people choose to learn as their first language. 

Here are the qualities I look for in the ideal starter language.  
1. One way to do things not 20.  
2. Boring, so the newbie can focus on their own app, not the language weirdnesses.  
3. Frozen. They should be able to run their student projects 40 years from now. Not a place where language designers try out new ideas.
4. No callbacks, synchronization handled in runtime.
5. Algol-like, so you can get support form millions of experienced developers.  

May think of more qualifications later...
