Om says to write as you speak. I totally agree, but I'd add this: Then edit. When I speak I use extra words as I plot my way through the idea, uncertain of which way I'll go at any step. After writing a first version from the speech in my head, I can go back and tighten it up, take out unnecessary detours, and flourish, the equivalent of spoken umms. As I write this paragraph, I wonder which parts I'll take out. :boom:
