<a href="https://om.co/2020/07/30/write-like-a-human/">Om says</a> to write as you think. I totally agree, but I'd add this: Then edit. When I speak I use extra words as I plot my way through the idea, uncertain of which way I'll go at any step. After writing a first version from the speech in my head, I tighten it up, take out unnecessary detours, and flourish, the equivalent of spoken umms.
