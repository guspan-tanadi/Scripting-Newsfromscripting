<a href="https://www.axios.com/herman-dies-coronavirus-5af21554-24dc-48a9-ab21-b750465aff4e.html">Herman Cain died</a> of Covid. There was a report a few days ago, via a family member, saying he was okay, just staying in the hospital for a few days to get more oxygen. I thought that was probably not true. A man that age, hospitalized that long, a good outcome was not likely. He was a CEO, not the brightest, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxxjd76hLi8">a salesman</a>. It seems he must have gotten the virus at Trump's Tulsa rally. He's the first political personality to die, of his stature, that I know of, Republican or Democrat. We probably still are waiting for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hudson#Illness_and_death">Rock Hudson</a> of Covid. The one that wakes most people up to realize holy shit this can come for me too.
