<a href="https://www.axios.com/herman-dies-coronavirus-5af21554-24dc-48a9-ab21-b750465aff4e.html">Herman Cain died</a> of Covid. There was a <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/national/coronavirus/herman-cain-receiving-oxygen-recovering-from-covid-19-in-hospital">report</a> just yesterday, via a staffer, saying he was okay, just staying in the hospital for a few days to strengthen his lungs. I thought it was probably not true. A man that age, hospitalized that long, a good outcome was not likely. He was a CEO, not the brightest, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxxjd76hLi8">a salesman</a>. It seems he must have gotten the virus at <a href="https://time.com/5865890/oklahoma-covid-19-trump-tulsa-rally/">Trump's Tulsa rally</a>. He's the first political personality to die, of his stature, that I know of, Republican or Democrat. We're probably still waiting for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hudson#Illness_and_death">Rock Hudson</a> of Covid. The one that wakes most people up to realize holy shit this can come for me too.
