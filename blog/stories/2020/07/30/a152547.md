Herman Cain died of Covid. There was a report a few days ago, via a family member, saying he was okay, just staying in the hospital for a few days to get more oxygen. I thought that was probably not the truth. I expected he would die. A man that age, hospitalized for that long, a good outcome was not likely. He was a CEO, not the brightest, but a salesman. It seems he must have gotten the virus at Trump's Tulsa rally. He's the first political personality to die, of his stature, that I know of, Republican or Democrat. We probably still are waiting for the Rock Hudson of Covid. The one that wakes most people up to realize holy shit this can come for me too.
