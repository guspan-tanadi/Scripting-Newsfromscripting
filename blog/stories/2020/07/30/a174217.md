<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/30/popeye.png" border="0" align="right">I usually give products in-development codenames of cities or states. Like Iowa, Fargo, Concord. Sometimes it ends up being the product name. But recently I've been choosing weirder names. For example, one version of an app was Frankenstein. Why? Because that's how it felt. Next one was called Turd Villa. I have no idea how that came into my head, but it makes me laugh, so I keep it. I love <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/30/turdVillaInTitleBar.png">seeing</a> the name in the title bar of my browser. Turd Villa. I'm sure there is no place with that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22turd+villa%22">name</a>, anywhere in the <a href="https://www.hover.com/domains/results?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=turdvilla">universe</a>.
