The tech industry is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_selling_pharmaceutical_products">pharma</a>, they only make products that have huge financial upside. That means there are lots of drugs for cancer, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic diseases, ones that might not kill you right off, but require lifetime use. This is like virality and lock-in in tech. Tools that don't bring in other users, or get you addicted can't make a ton of money. They might be worthwhile though, they might help someone figure something out that saves humanity, for example.
