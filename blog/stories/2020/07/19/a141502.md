If you read this blog you should also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">me</a> on Twitter. People say Twitter is bad, and of course they're right, but it's also very good. It's a very integral part of how I write this blog. Of course the really important stuff shows up here too, eventually. And I would like a Twitter that was just for my friends. And I think that'll happen eventually. :boom:
