I went back to UW-Madison for a visit a few years ago and got a tour of a new building that was built from money from a patent. It didn't appear the building was used for very much, but it was extravagant and luxurious. Very unlike a typical utilitarian building at a large state school. I learned they built it to recruit a professor who generated billions from patents, and I guess they felt was likely to continue to do so. The money apparently flows to the university, but the professor gets to work in a the Taj Mahal of campus buildings. Not sure. But it was very impressive.
