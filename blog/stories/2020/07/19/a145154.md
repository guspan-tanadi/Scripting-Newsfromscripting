I went back to <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">UW-Madison</a> for a visit a few years ago and got a tour of a new building that was built from money from <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/tag/patents/">patents</a>. It didn't appear the building was used for much, but it was extravagant and luxurious. Very unlike a typical utilitarian campus building at a large state school. I learned they built it to recruit a professor who generated billions from patents, and I guess they felt was likely to continue to do so. The money apparently flows to the university, but the professor gets to work in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> of campus buildings. Not sure. But it was <i>very</i> impressive, and surprising.
