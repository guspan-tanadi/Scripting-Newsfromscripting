# A new coding construct?
This bit of code comes up all the time.
* if (callback !== undefined) {

It would be interesting to try to come up with a clean way to say that so it would still be obvious what's happening, but would save you from having to check it so often.

Basically I want to call the callback if the caller specified one, otherwise, do nothing. 

Just putting that out there, not offering a solution to the puzzle.
