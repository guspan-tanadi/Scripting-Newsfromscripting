Do you wear a mask with a slogan or image?   If so, what do you wear? Include a picture if you can. ;-)  What's the best mask you've seen? Maybe the national mask should have an American flag on one side and #BLM on the other. Redefine unity as including all Americans. And let's win this together. Love America. All of America.
