I spent the day so far combining the "Radio3" docs into <a href="http://this.how/radio3/">one Howto page</a>. Consider this a draft, I still have to do a couple more read-throughs. If you have any questions or comments, please post them <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/180">here</a>.
