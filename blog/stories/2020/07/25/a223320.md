# Green screen baseball?
Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/25/alonsoAtBat.png">picture</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso">Pete Alonso</a> in the bottom of the 8th in today's Mets game. Note the <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/25/fakeFans.png">fake fans</a> behind the backstop. Cute, but why not make it a <a href="https://infocusfilmschool.com/filming-green-screen-guide/">green screen</a> so they can play with video effects. 

Unless the "fans" are there to help the pitcher feel comfortable?
