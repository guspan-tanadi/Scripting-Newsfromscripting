# Friend monitor
I have an app called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/serverMonitor">Server Monitor</a> that does something simple but important. It pings each of the apps I have running once a minute to see if it's still alive. If not, it sends me an email. I bet everyone who writes server apps has this kind of utility. 

I'd like something like this for my friends. A ping goes out to each, if someone doesn't respond, I get an email. 

In the age of The Trump Plague, I worry about my friends. I figure it's just a matter of time...
