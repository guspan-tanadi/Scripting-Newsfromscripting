Anyway, this is like one of those classic fables or myths about the people who were so divided, so hated each other, that they couldn't get together to fight a disease that they can't overcome until they can work together with respect, even love. It's like that famous <a href="https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf">O Henry story</a>, which I won't spoil in case you haven't read it.
