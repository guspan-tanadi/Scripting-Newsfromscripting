<a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1283153317095505920">Mike Pence</a>: "We don't want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don't reopen their schools." Pause for a moment. This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity">crime against humanity</a>. Not a trivial one. If we were doing this to another country's children and teachers, we'd be out in the streets protesting, screaming at the top of our lungs. But we seem to have forgotten that <i>we</i> are a cause worth fighting for too.
