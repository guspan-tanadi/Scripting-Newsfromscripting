DuckDuckGo is getting more <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/schlocky">schlocky</a> all the time. When I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649">started using it</a> as the default linking service for this blog, it was as plain as could be. A logo and a text box. Maybe a link at the bottom or off on the side, I have no recollection. But over time they've been adding junk to the page, so much so that this morning, doing a search there, I ended up at a page where you install a Chrome plug-in. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I paused, tried to imagine how the fuck I got there, hit the back button and square in the middle of the DuckDuckGo home page is a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/15/duckduckgoButton.png">big button</a>, the <i>only button on the page,</i> and it doesn't submit your search, it takes you to this crazy-ass page to install a plug-in. Fuck you. I chose DuckDuckGo precisely because I thought they would never do bullshit like this. Seriously rethinking my <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649">decision</a>. Are there any nice search engines that do a decent job that don't have dreams of world domination?
