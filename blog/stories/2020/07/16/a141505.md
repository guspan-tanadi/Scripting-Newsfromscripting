# Stop giving Trump the benefit of the doubt
Okay stupid question -- who does?

You do. You evaluate his actions against what a president would do, and you know he's not a president.

He's <i>trying</i> to kill huge numbers of American citizens. Teachers and children. And make even more live with disabilities, in great pain, for who knows how long. 

Look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity">crimes against humanity</a> -- that's what it is.
* <i>Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are purposely committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population.</i>

There isn't a more heinous crime.
