I like to ask questions like this:  "In a sane world, X would be Y."  I'm not saying I have a plan to turn X into Y, just that it would be ideal if X were Y.  It pays to know what success looks like, that way if it ever shows up by chance, you know immediately to say yes. (Example, in a sane world Fauci would be president.)
