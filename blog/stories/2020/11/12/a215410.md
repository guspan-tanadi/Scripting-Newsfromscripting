<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/22/santa.png" border="0" align="right">The difference in quality between the two groups of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/">Georgia senate candidates</a>, Dem and Repub are like night and day. The Dems will use the power of the US government to be sure the Georgians get through the winter of the pandemic in as good shape as possible. The Repubs will not. It's really simple. And when they save the lives of thousands of Georgians, they will also be saving the lives of many thousands of people in every other state of the union. That's power! And thanks in advance to Georgia for helping us out. We won't forget.
