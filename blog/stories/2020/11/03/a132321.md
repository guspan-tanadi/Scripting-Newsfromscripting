I'm loving <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/better-things">Better Things</a>. It's smart, funny, classy, nutty, loving and lovable, and sexy. The characters are great because they all remind me of someone dear to me. It's not Le Grand Binge, it's more like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuse-bouche">amuse-bouche</a>, something to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser">cleanse the palate</a>, before going onto more serious fare. Right up there with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock">30 Rock</a>, another of <a href="http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/">my favorite</a> shows. I'm still in Season 1 on Better Things. Savoring each episode because it makes me feel good, in times when feeling good isn't the norm.
