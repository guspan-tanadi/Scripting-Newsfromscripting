# Fargo digging
For a project I'm doing, I wanted to see how Fargo did calendar structures. This is what I found out. It's here primarily so I can find it again later through search engines. 
* First, here's an <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/myPublicProfile.opml">OPML file</a> from Fargo, that I used briefly in the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014 to edit my blog. 
* I was interested in the attributes that Fargo used. I wanted to see what type attributes it used for calendars. I was surprised to see that it didn't use any. It did use a <i>name</i> attribute. And now I can see what it used that for, it was for the name of the file. It allowed you to change the text of the headline without affecting the name of the file the HTML rendering was saved in. This had come up as a question in some of the work we're doing with Old School. 
* For clues about Fargo, I found the <a href="http://fargo.io/blog/">Fargo blog</a> indispensible. Here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/fargoBlog.opml">OPML source</a> for the Fargo blog.
