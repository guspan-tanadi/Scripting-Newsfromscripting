If you're an NBA fan as I am, you know all about Inside the NBA on TNT. Charles, Kenny, Shaq and Ernie. They're funny, smart, irreverant, and when they get serious, have a pretty good understanding of basketball. I like the Trippi podcast for that reason. I've tried the James Carville one, it doesn't have the same appeal, I guess. I think it may be a generational thing. Anyway, I don't think politics has to be so cutthroat as it is in the Republican world. I've tried listening to Limbaugh et al, it just doesn't work for me.
