If you're an NBA fan as I am, you know all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA">Inside the NBA</a> on TNT. Charles, Kenny, Shaq and Ernie. They're funny, smart, irreverant, and when they get serious, have a deep understanding of basketball. I want something like that for politics. The cable shows are dull and repetitive. If you're not going to say much at least tell some good stories.
