If you're an NBA fan as I am, you know all about Inside the NBA on TNT. Charles, Kenny, Shaq and Ernie. They're funny, smart, irreverant, and when they get serious, have a pretty good understanding of basketball. I like the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/that-trippi-show/id1523896927">Trippi podcast</a> for that reason. I've tried the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/politics-war-room-with-james-carville-al-hunt/id1484862164">James Carville</a> one, it doesn't have the same appeal, I guess. I think it may be a generational thing. Anyway, I don't think politics has to be so cutthroat as it is in the Republican world. I've tried listening to Limbaugh et al, it just doesn't work for me.
