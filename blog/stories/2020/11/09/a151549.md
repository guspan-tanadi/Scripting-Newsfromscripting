One of the reasons my blog doesn't work as <a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">an RSS feed</a> is that I'm always adding links and editing text through the day. I am done by midnight before the <a href="http://scripting.com/email">nightly email</a> goes out. But people who read via RSS only see the first version of a post. I think I've said it before, RSS as a format is fine, but the installed base of readers hasn't evolved at all since the beginning.
