Based on what I'm reading about the polls, they have a crude and often incorrect view of what they think and what influences them, what they look for in a candidate. Just read about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/how-democrats-missed-trumps-appeal-to-latino-voters.html">Hispanic voters</a> in south Florida and Texas voting for Trump, when the Dems thought they had their support. <i>Membership in the Democratic party should mean something. </i>Or maybe we need to start another party, not to run candidates necessarily, but to organize voters. Maybe the Dems would get the idea that they should "acquire" this party. That's how change often happens in tech, btw. Key point I've raised over and over -- political parties and social networks belong together. The current crop of social nets are optimized for advertisers.
