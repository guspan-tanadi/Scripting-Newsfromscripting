This <a href="https://twitter.com/dtone612/status/1322899801743261696">tweet</a> really grabbed me. "I intubated a relatively healthy 86 year old man with covid in the ER at 4:30 this morning. He was alone, I was the last person he spoke with and he was confused. He’ll likely die in the ICU, alone. I don’t make any extra money for that."
