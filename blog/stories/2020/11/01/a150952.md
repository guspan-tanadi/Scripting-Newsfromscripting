One of the threads was a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/01/clintonOdds2016.png">screen shot</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/FiveThirtyEight">538</a> graph showing the probability of a Clinton win over Trump over time. It took a real dive when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html">Comey</a> announced he was <a href="https://www.insider.com/lone-fbi-agent-reopened-hillary-clinton-investigation-2019-10">investigating</a> emails found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner">Anthony Weiner's</a> laptop. Nate Silver said, in the aftermath of the election, when people complained about the polls, that Trump had a greater than 30% chance of winning. A baseball player who hits .300 is a pretty good hitter. 30% ain't zero. That said Comey <i>made</i> it 30%. The odds were a lot lower before his announcement.
