One of the threads was a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/01/clintonOdds2016.png">screen shot</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/FiveThirtyEight">538</a> graph showing the probability of a Clinton win over Trump over time. It took a real dive when Comey announced he was <a href="https://www.insider.com/lone-fbi-agent-reopened-hillary-clinton-investigation-2019-10">investigating</a> emails found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner">Anthony Weiner's</a> laptop. He couldn't look first and then announce it if they found anything, which of course they didn't. Nate Silver said, in the aftermath of the election, when people complained about the polls, that Trump had a greater than 30% chance of winning. A baseball player who hits .300 is a pretty good hitter. 30% ain't zero. That said Comey <i>made</i> it 30%. The odds were a lot lower before his announcement.
