More exploration into the world of Fargo blogging. Here's the <a href="http://this.how/kimParkerBlog/fargo.opml?format=opml">OPML source</a> for <a href="http://bloatware.org/users/kim/">Kim Parker's blog</a>. Kim Parker is a fictitious person, a support person at a tech company called <a href="http://bloatware.org/">Bloatware</a>. Her blog was the example I used in the docs for Fargo's CMS. Not sure why I used #attributes instead of using outline attributes, which are hidden and out of the way. But there you have it. A 2013 blogging system, does it differently than Old School. It's more like Frontier's CMS.
