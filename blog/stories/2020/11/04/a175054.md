# People like you
A new "BingeWorthy" feature. 

<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/04/similarUsersCommandBingeworthy.png">Pull down the menu</a> and choose <i>Similar users. </i>A window opens with a list of users who have tastes similar to yours, ranked by how close they are. From there, you can click on the names to see their ratings.

You may get ideas for new binges from this, or may find people you know who have similar tastes. At least you'll have something to talk about next time you get together. :-)

If you have questions or comments, please <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/193">post them here</a>. The number crunching code was written by my very generous friend Andrew Shell.
