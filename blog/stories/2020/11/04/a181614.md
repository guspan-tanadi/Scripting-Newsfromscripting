Trump probably impressed the rest of the Republican Party by turning out so many voters, and keeping Congress competitive, even if he did have to spread a lot of virus to do it (please don't forget that, these votes cost a lot of human lives and health). They probably won't run away him so fast even if he doesn't win.
