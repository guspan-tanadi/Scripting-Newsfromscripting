I have to admit to having new respect for <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/decision-2020/joe-biden-wins-pennsylvania-clinching-presidency-in-historic-comeback/2581293/">Philadelphia</a>. I could never think of a reason for it existing, I tried, I really did. Next time we get a fascist asshole in the White House, weâ€™ll call Philadelphia.
