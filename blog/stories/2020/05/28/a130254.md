<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/28/dave.png" border="0" align="right">I got lots of good suggestions for my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/173">prior art search</a>, but no one had advice on getting my <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/27.html#a183347">iPhone to update</a>. And then the problem got even worse. As I was about to go out for my afternoon ride, my iPhone informed me that it had disabled Bluetooth for everything but my AppleWatch. No explanation of why it decided to do this. On my way out, with no music or podcasts to fill my mind, I thought how ridiculous it was that I had spent over $1000 on this device and I still don't own it. Apple says "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." They should change the name of the company to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE">Hal</a>.
