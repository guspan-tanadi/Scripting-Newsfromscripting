<a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1590698591000">Bug fix release of LO2</a>. For a new user, one who has never logged onto LO2 before, there was a problem with the initialization code that creates your first outline. It's possible that you would get a blank screen instead of a new outline. Not a very good user experience. It should be fixed now. If you had previously tried to create an account and failed, it might be a good time to try again. If it works. please <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1266109713667821588">let me know</a>.
