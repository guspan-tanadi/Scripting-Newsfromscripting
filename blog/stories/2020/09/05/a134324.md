I applied for an <a href="https://absenteeballot.elections.ny.gov/">absentee ballot</a> in New York State. It occurred to me they could cut out half the time, by allowing me to download and print a PDF of the ballot, instead of sending it by USPS. I could even fill it out in a browser before printing it. I imagine not everyone has a printer, but you did have to have a computer and a net connection to request the ballot. At least they didn't require you to send them a printed request to send you a ballot. Also note they didn't ask for an email address. That's a shame, because that could be used to debug problems with the system, or provide confirmation when they receive the ballot. (I know you can probably check online, but at this time I have no idea how to do that. Redundant systems seem good esp when security has been made such an issue by the Repubs.) Also note they don't ask for your mailing address. This is good. However, they display the person's physical address in the form, once you provide information that isn't that secure. <i>Not</i> a good idea.
