I applied for an <a href="https://absenteeballot.elections.ny.gov/">absentee ballot</a> in New York State. It seems to me they could allow me to download and print a PDF of the ballot, instead of mailing it to me via USPS. The first half of the process could be electronic. At least they didn't require you to send them a printed request to send you a ballot. They didn't ask for an email address. That's a shame, because that could be used to debug problems with the system, or provide confirmation when they receive the ballot. Also note they don't ask for your mailing address. This is good. However, they display the person's physical address in the form, once you provide information that isn't that secure. <i>Not</i> a good idea.
