I applied for an <a href="https://absenteeballot.elections.ny.gov/">absentee ballot</a> in New York State. It occurred to me they could cut half the time and half the risk, by allowing me to download and print a PDF of the ballot, print it out and mail it in. The first half of the process could be electronic. At least they didn't require you to send them a printed request to send you a ballot. Also note they didn't ask for an email address. That's a shame, because that could be used to debug problems with the system, or provide confirmation when they receive the ballot. (I know you can probably check online, but at this time I have no idea how to do that. Redundant systems seem good esp when security has been made such an issue by the Repubs.) Also note they don't ask for your mailing address. This is good. However, they display the person's physical address in the form, once you provide information that isn't that secure. <i>Not</i> a good idea.
