I'm working my way slowly through <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/08.html#a133321">Borgen</a> season 1. It's very good, and immersive. The format is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">The West Wing</a> in Denmark. The prime minister is a woman with a family. Every episode, as in TWW, they tackle a big issue. It's in Europe, and it's a small country, not the mighty USA. It's very well done. It's slow going because they wrote it so that you need to read things in the show and read the sub-titles (the characters get information from reading headlines in newspapers that go by too quickly to read them).  Sometimes they drop into English because the characters would speak English then. It's on Netflix now. There are already three seasons and a <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-04-29/borgen-season-4-netflix/">fourth</a> is on the way. A side-note, the chief of staff of the PM is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilou_Asb%C3%A6k">Pilou Asb√¶k</a>, who played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters#Euron_Greyjoy">Euron Greyjoy</a> in Game of Thrones.
