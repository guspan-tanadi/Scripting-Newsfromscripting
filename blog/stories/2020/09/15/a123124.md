I'm working my way slowly through <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/08.html#a133321">Borgen</a> season 1. It's very good, and immersive. The format is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">The West Wing</a> in Denmark. The prime minister is a woman with a family. Every episode, as in TWW, they tackle a big issue. It's in Europe, and it's a small country, not the mighty USA. It's very well done. It's slow going because they wrote it so that you need to read things in the show and read the sub-titles (the characters get information from reading headlines in newspapers that go by too quickly to read them). It's on Netflix now. There are already three seasons and a <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-04-29/borgen-season-4-netflix/">fourth</a> is on the way.
