Trump always talks about how other countries don't pay us for the things we do for them, but they do, they really do. Hugely. The US has the world's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency">reserve currency</a>. We're the only country that can print money that can be spent anywhere. People all around the world use our currency to store value. Even with all the lunacy, our dollar is still the safest place to store value. It means we can always have more money. We don't even have to actually print it, they're just numbers in a spreadsheet somewhere. Trump, of course is doing everything he can to make everyone else <i>not</i> trust us.  So if the trance breaks of the US being the most trustworthy country, we could end up being one of the "other" countries, and we'll have to pay <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#Chinese_yuan">China</a> to store our money. And they'll have the power we still have. It's one of those things that if you don't know about it, and most people don't, you can't understand how global economics works.
