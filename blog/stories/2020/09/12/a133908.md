I went out to lunch yesterday. First restaurant meal since March. Lovely <a href="https://thegardencafewoodstock.com/">outdoor restaurant</a> in Woodstock. I gather lots of other people were out for the first time too. But, maskless people were hugging all over the place. Hard to fathom. People my age, high risk people.
