# Self-executing functions
I believe <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE">self-executing functions</a> in JavaScript are obsolete with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp">ES6</a>. I never liked and rarely used them. I prefer to use features put there by the designers, rather than use a clever hack that makes you wonder why the feature wasn't put there. 

Now in ., you can create a simple block and declare your variables with <i>let. </i>No clever hacks needed. 

Some real-world example code.
* { //insert headline for 1st level subs

The block, like a bundle in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/manual/userTalk">Frontier</a>, allows you to collapse some code, hide its variables from the containing code, without declaring a new routine. It's essential that you put a comment at the opening left curly brace to say what the block does. If that's not easy to do that indicates a refactor is needed, imho.
