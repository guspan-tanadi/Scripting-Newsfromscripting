<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/01/orangeBlob.png" border="0" align="right">I'm on a <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/17/appleTvShouldBeATvDammit.m4a">podcast</a> roll these days. 17-minutes worth of rambling about how Apple should fix the TV problem, which btw is all those freaking wires. The tech has advanced so much, you could blow people away with elegance, ease of use, and power, and so what if it costs three times as much as the competition. We're accustomed to paying for the best. I should note that I have some $AAPL stock, purchased in 1997 and held since then so when Apple screws me in software at least I make up for it in my brokerage account. I'm so puzzled why I'm not using Clubhouse these days. And I'm totally maxed out on new services. OMG no more please. Also a story about hanging out with <a href="https://www.mixonline.com/recording/don-pearson-1942-2006-377439">Don Pearson</a> who did the sound for the Dead.
