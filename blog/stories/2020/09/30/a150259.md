I usually don't write about work as I'm doing it, but wtf, let's give it a try. Today I'm going to pick up the thread I last worked on <a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1594307363000">July 9</a>. LO2 becomes its own reader app. It was always weird that you had to go outside LO2 to read a published outline. It make the connection uneasy. Not obvious how you'd create an outline of your own. By having the published outline (aka <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/06/170728.html">instant outline</a>) be viewed read-only in "LO2", you're right there, in a tab, in the tool that creates these outlines. At least that's the theory.
