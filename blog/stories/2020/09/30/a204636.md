<img src="http://scripting.com/2016/11/12/trump.png" border="0" align="right">I did not watch the debate. I was watching the previews on CNN and MSNBC, and I could see where it was going. I went to sleep instead, as I did on <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html">Election Night in 2016</a>. I didn't really understand what happened until I listened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/podcasts/the-daily/presidential-debate-election-trump-biden.html">today's Daily podcast</a>, just now, which included excerpts. Trump is dominant. He really practiced dominance. He's got a knack for it. About halfway through the show I realized this is what happens when you debate a troll. You never get to finish a thought, he always has another nit to pick, an annoying way to say something. He disrespects your dead son. He makes it about him, 100 percent. There's no room for anyone else. He was awful on his town hall a couple of weeks ago. A bluff? Anyway, I never thought Biden should debate him, or it should have been with rules that made it impossible for Trump to talk over him. Trump owned the stage last night. Glad I didn't watch, from what I can tell it was a total nightmare.
