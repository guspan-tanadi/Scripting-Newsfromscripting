Biden's campaign had a slogan, <a href="https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/">Build Back Better</a>, but it didn't stick. Campaigns need slogans. For example, with ThinkTank we had See What You Think. Of course Trump has many. MAGA. Mexico will pay for it. Fine people, on both sides. We'll have to see. Just a few. It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete campaign promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY">Yes We Can</a>. That's pretty good, and hard to argue with.
