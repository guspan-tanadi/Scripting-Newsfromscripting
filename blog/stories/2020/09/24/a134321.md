<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/23/blackLab.png" border="0" align="right">Biden's campaign had a slogan, <a href="https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/">Build Back Better</a>, but it didn't stick. Campaigns need slogans. For example, with [%search: ThinkTank%] we had See What You Think. Of course Trump has many. MAGA. Mexico will pay for it. Fine people, on both sides. We'll have to see. Just a few. It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY">Yes We Can</a>. That's pretty good, hard to refute and doesn't really commit to anything in particular. I liked <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1840981_1840998_1840901,00.html">FDR's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvk_uLnv4uo">Happy Days Are Here Again</a>. That campaign happened long before I was born, but in a sense, I remember it. The same way I guess today's kids remember the Beatles.
