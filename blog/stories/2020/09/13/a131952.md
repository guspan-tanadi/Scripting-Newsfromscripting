I had a heated discussion yesterday with a dear friend who I greatly respect, about the Woodward thesis. Here's the question I asked, at the core of my case, and I'd ask it to Jay Rosen too, and to you dear reader, if you think what Woodward did was understandable and/or excusable. Why do you care about winning the election? What are you trying to prevent? Think about it. If you're listening and not arguing, you'll get it.
