# Firmware file not compatible
When I update my iPhone using iTunes I get this error message.  
* The iPhone could not be updated because the firmware file is not compatible. 

No one seems to know what that means when you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22firmware+file+is+not+compatible%22">search</a> for it on Google, and none of the advice works and it's happened a number of times, and every time I have to re-discover the workaround. This time I'm writing a blog post so when I search for it, I'll have the answer.
1. Don't update the phone with iTunes. 
2. You can update it over wifi, it doesn't need iTunes to do the update.
3. Open the Settings app, scroll down to General, open it. 
4. Click on Software Update. Follow the instructions.
5. Works every damn time!

It's basically the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs">Indiana Jones</a> method of updating.
