# Macros in Old School
I have a new <i>macros</i> feature in Old School, the Node app I use to build the pages out of the outline I use to edit this blog. Every blogging system needs macros. We had them in Manila and Radio UserLand. I probably had them in AutoWeb and Clay Basket too. I haven't put them in Old School, wanting to wait to see how the software evolved without them

Old School already has a glossary. You give it a string and a value that is substituted when the string occurs in the text. Today's machines are infinitely fast at that kind of thing, so it's not a burden to make the list of substitutions longer. It makes linking easier, and more consistent. Here's the <a href="http://electricserver.scripting.com/users/davewiner/electric/glossary.opml">OPML source</a> for the glossary I maintain. 

But what happens when you want to link to a search for a term on this blog. Like here are all the references on scripting.com for [%search: Dr Nick%]. Not something I'd likely put in the glossary because it's not a term I'd use a lot in my writing. But product names like Old School are a good candidate for glossarification.

This is the syntax: &#91;%search: Dr Nick%]. 

I'm writing this up so I can find it. Right now I'm the only one who can use it. ;-)
