Reporters forget past atrocities, so they can re-discover them, so it's (as far as they're concerned) news -- again. This makes their job approachable. Anything beyond this would require them to adapt, risk, improvise, grow. In software, ideas from users can be confusing, but also incredibly valuable. Users have nothing invested in the way you do things. They just know what they want. Knowing what users want is valuable, but news doesn't incorporate that, because they never listen to users, they only listen to each other, and often not even that.
