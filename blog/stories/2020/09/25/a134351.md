# BingeWorthy profile pages
Here's the deal with profile pages. 
* You have one. I have one. 
* Anyone who has signed on to BingeWorthy has one. 
* They list all the shows you've rated in-order, from best to worst. 
* They exist primarily to provide Twitter and Facebook metadata for your ratings. 
* Profile pages are designed to share. When someone asks for a list of good things to binge, instead of thinking of a few off the top of the head, share a link to your profile page. 
* If your screenname is bullmancuso, <a href="http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/">this</a> is your profile page. 
* You can edit your name, the image URL, description so if you're not happy with the initial versions (which we got from your Twitter profile), you can change it. All this is echoed in your Facebook and Twitter metadata, so it'll show up when you paste a link into those services (and many others that read this form of metadata).

If you have questions or comments, please post them here.
