Last time I listened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> was a great time of my life. I can tell because the way it makes me feel today. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bonfire_of_the_Vanities">Master of the Universe</a> type feeling. This is mine. I made it, I own it, I can make it do what I want. It's the feeling in a young man's heart.
