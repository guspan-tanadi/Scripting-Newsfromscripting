If you like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)">Succession</a>, here's a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/31/907923589/actor-cherry-jones">great interview</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Jones">Cherry Jones</a>. She played the <a href="https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Nan_Pierce">Nan Pierce</a>, owner of PGM (which is really the NYT), who Logan Roy (in real life, Rupert Murdoch) wanted to buy. It's a really good interview and of course it's about Succession so it's even better.
