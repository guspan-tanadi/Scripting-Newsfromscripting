In the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tabs+vs+spaces&t=hk&ia=web">tabs vs spaces</a> debate, I am firmly in the "neither" camp. Too low level a question. My editor <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/01/indentation.png">understands code structure</a>. I don't indent with tabs or spaces, I indent with structure.
