<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/01/bidenHarris.png" border="0" align="right">Had to do a lot of driving today, so I listened to a bunch of podcasts including two from political consultants. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gov-jerry-brown-on-how-to-save-our-democracy-and-planet/id1523896927?i=1000489608055">Joe Trippi</a> interviewed former California governor Jerry Brown and the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/land-of-unrest/id1514968525?i=1000489728138">Lincoln Project</a> podcast talked about polling and how evenly divided the bases of the policital parties are. Brown also talked about how hard it was going to be for Biden to govern. They would need to be creative to find a way around the deadlock. Then I wondered why? Aren't they missing something? Isn't Covid-19 offering the chance to bring us together? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> once asked his Soviet counterpart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> if aliens attacked, would he <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/reagan-and-gorbachev-agreed-pause-cold-war-case-alien-invasion-180957402/">pause the Cold War</a> and work with Reagan to fight them? Gorbachev said hell yeah he would. Isn't Covid exactly that kind of opportunity? Why isn't the Lincoln Project running ads that informs voters that if we had a merely competent president, one who got out of the way of the government, we would be doing a lot better. Not only would far fewer people get sick and die, but we could go out to dinner and a movie. We could take a vacation. We could have a party. We could have Thanksgiving dinner with our family and celebrate Christmas together this year. We could hug our family and friends. All that's standing in the way is our working together. I've felt all along that the virus is making us smarter, and part of that is getting us to work together because that's smart. Would one of the PACs be willing to try that message? Show pictures of people all over the world, everywhere but the US, enjoying their lives, and ask would you like this for America? All you have to do is work with each other. That's really all it would take. There's only one candidate offering that.
