Stop and watch this <a href="https://twitter.com/joshscampbell/status/1301324061373538304">CNN story</a> about evictions in Houston. They call it the "downward spiral of the COVID economy." We are going to pay for this. The sooner we start the easier it's going to be on everyone, esp the poor families, but really everyone. We're on a downward spiral. The stories are going to get worse.
