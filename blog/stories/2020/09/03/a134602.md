I've been saying this a lot the last few days: This election should be a blowout. Never mind how divided we are etc blah blah. The self-perpetuating bullshit. Take a step back and look at the circumstances. Americans are dying, the economy is a wreck, the country is careening and this time the casualties are at home. In a sane society, Trump would be in jail, Pence would be president and Biden would be preparing to take office in January. These are imho facts.
