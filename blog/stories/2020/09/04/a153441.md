* I'm sure almost everything I do would make Trump think I'm a sucker. To his question, I like to help others. That's what's in it for me.
* When Trump shuts down something from this point on, think (or say) --We'll Build It Back BetterStarting in January 2021.
* Listening to BBC on WNYC to the new White House pandemic advisor. What an idiot political asshole. This guy is a doctor??
* 1/3 This election should be a blowout. Americans are dying, the economy is a wreck, the country is careening and this time the casualties are at home. In a sane society, Trump would be in jail, Pence would be president and Biden would be preparing to take office in January.
* Oy the White House thinks they're running a campaign. They're supposed to be running a country.

* BTW, wouldn't it be interesting if Biden ran a series of ads:"On January 2021, we'll turn XXX service back on. Trump shut it down in 20xx."#builditbackbetterHe can make really specific promises. cc @SteveHanselman @carlick
* @jeffjarvis we'll build it back better starting in january.
* This is what the Asshole Atlas looks like. https://t.co/4IFzLrTgDq
* He's told the interviewer he's an idiot three times so far.
* He talks about priorities, nothing about mitigation.
* I don't know his name. But he's just like Bill Barr, only more combative. I see why Trump likes him.
* 3/3 Politics has moved online. So far it's been chaotic. But we could envision something that's orderly and productive and still preserve the energy. The idealistic vision of the early web wasn't entirely wrong, imho. :-)
* 2/3 There should be a permanent people's campaign, all day every day, every year, whether or not there's an election. Clearly waiting for the politicians and journalists to do this isn't working. And the current tech networks are mired, trying to serve everyone.
* @mayahovey True! ðŸ˜³
* @berzerkeley Depends on the insult I guess.
* @davidjoachim Where do they live? And thanks a lot.
