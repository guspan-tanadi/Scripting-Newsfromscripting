<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/04/mailChimp.png" border="0" align="right">A longtime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki">friend</a> uses Mailchimp to send a periodic newsletter. They have a feature that allows the author to re-send the mail to people who haven't opened it. Here's the <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/resend-an-unopened-campaign/">writeup</a>. They don't say how they know it wasn't opened. I was under the impression that mail apps prevent this kind of invasive behavior. People used to use one-pixel images with search params, but I think the email apps now copy the image and replace it in the HTML, to prevent the sender from knowing. So I told my friend I don't think it's possible. Pretty sure that's right, but I guess it depends on the app you use for email. I use GMail. I think these days enough people use GMail to make the Mailchimp feature useless. BTW, I did open the first email, and it treated me as if I hadn't. More evidence that the feature doesn't really work. If you have insight, please <a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1301930952151764992">comment</a>.
