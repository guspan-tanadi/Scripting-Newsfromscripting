<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1308794854332403713">I asked on Twitter</a>: If you decide to leave <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> can you take your subscriber list with you, or do they own that? And the answer is <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465992-How-do-I-export-my-email-or-subscriber-list-">yes</a>, you can export your subscriber list as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> file. So I wonder why people would stay with Substack after they get a certain amount of income. They get 10% for doing something that doesn't cost very much. If they're making say $1000 a year off your mail list, why not take distribution in-house? That's a straight question. I want to understand how the business works. Thanks.
