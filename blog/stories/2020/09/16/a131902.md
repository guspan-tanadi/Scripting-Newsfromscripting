Yesterday I was out and about doing errands, and instead of wearing my usual blue Mets cap, I was wearing my <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/16/daveWithWisconsinHat.png">red Wisconsin hat</a>. It has a big W on the front, and on the back it says Badgers. I was getting some dirty looks, and at one place a woman commented that I shouldn't wear that hat because people might not understand.
