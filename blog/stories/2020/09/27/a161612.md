Most viruses in that family do, because the strain that kills fewer victims comes to dominate the more deadly strain, and that process repeats. So over time it weakens. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">1918 pandemic</a> ended after two years, with no vaccine, that couldn't happen until after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin#Discovery">penicillin</a> was discovered in 1928. The 1918 virus mutated and then became seasonal. It still pops up, to this day, but it's not the problem it was in 1918. That will probably happen with Covid-19 too.
