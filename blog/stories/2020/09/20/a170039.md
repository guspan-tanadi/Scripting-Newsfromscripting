People who think they can predict the near-future, look at <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1307722350775930888">this video</a>, and imagine it was a year ago, looking a year into the future. Explain why the Hudson Yards Mall in NYC is a ghost town. You'd never in a million years guess the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">true reason</a>. It's so frustrating when smart people quote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablum">pablum</a> they hear on the cable news shows. Those are bedtime stories. The world is far more dangerous and far less predictable. Go back and watch the shows from a year ago to see how well they did.
