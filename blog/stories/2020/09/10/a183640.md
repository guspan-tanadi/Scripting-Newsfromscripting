In medicine, if they're testing a drug and they discover for sure it saves lives without harmful side-effects, they're obligated to stop the test and give everyone the drug. No more control group. No more placebos. It's ethical. Sometimes the information you uncover makes a difference, and holding onto it has an unacceptable cost. Same in journalism. Same in everything.
