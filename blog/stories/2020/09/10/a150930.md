On June 4, I did an interview with Walter Isaacson for his August 26 <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pacific-content/trailblazers-with-walter-isaacson">podcast</a> about podcasting. They only used a few bits from the recording to tell their story. Here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/04/isaacsonAudio.m4a">full recording</a> of my side of the interview. You can't hear the interviewer's questions, but it's not too difficult to figure out what they asked based on what I said. As always I'm very long-winded. :boom:
