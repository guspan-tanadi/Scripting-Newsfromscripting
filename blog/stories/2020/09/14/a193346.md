# Chrome playing video halts screen saver
A few weeks ago Mac stopped going to sleep when I left. Not only will this burn out the monitor, it's a security problem. 

I tried rebooting. No help. 

Tried quitting all my apps. Then the screen saver would start. 

Now to figure out which app was the culprit. I figured it was Dropbox, my first guess for anything going wrong. Sorry. But it wasn't Dropbox. 

Turns out it was Chrome. If it thinks you're watching a video, it will keep the Mac from going to sleep. I had a window from <a href="https://www.agora.io/en/">Agora</a> open, because I was interested in it and planned to go back to learn more. Well it has a video on the home page. It didn't even register with me. 

So I closed that window, waited a minute, with Chrome running, and the screen saver kicked in. 

A reminder if you have this problem in the future.
