If you have information that can save lives, err on the side of disclosure. I was hoping that Ben Smith would do it in his weekly column, instead he went after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/business/media/the-intercept-source-reality-winner.html">The Intercept</a>. Reporters do that, go after safe journalism targets, believing perhaps they'll never work with someone from The Intercept, or need a quote from the owner. As far as I know not one op-ed writer has said what Woodward did was bad.
