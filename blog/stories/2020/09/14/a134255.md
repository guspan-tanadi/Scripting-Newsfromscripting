He's been working on a new version of rssCloud for Node to go with the XML-RPC for JavaScript package I wrote. We talked about lots of stuff, philosophy of maintaining networks of software. We both agree deprecation is a bad idea. I didnâ€™t know that there have been riots in Madison, WI. We talked about Kenosha in that context. We need better news folks, too much repetition and they're leaving out important information. Riots in Madison? That is for sure news for this lifetime Badger.
