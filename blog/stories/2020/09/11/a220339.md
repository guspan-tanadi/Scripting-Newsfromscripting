People matter. That's it. The patron saint of National Everyone Love Each Other Day would be <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rodney_King">Rodney King</a>. He was the man who, after being beaten by the police in LA in 1992, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKj4L6GwL5Y">said this</a>. "Can we all just get along? Can we get along? Can we stop making it, making it horrible for the older people and the kids?" It's a good question and for one day each year we could all ask it, of ourselves and each other.
