About mail-in ballots. 1. Why not count them as they come in? 2. When people say they take longer because they have to verify your signature, that's exactly what they do when you vote in person, at least everywhere I've lived (lots of places). By definition that process takes 24 hours. I'm guessing it takes longer to count mail-ins because they have fewer people doing the work?
