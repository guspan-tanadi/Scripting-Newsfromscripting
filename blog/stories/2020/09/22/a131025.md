<a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a> has a new service called <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/">Blacklight</a> which rates websites based on how much spying they do on their readers. <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=scripting.com">Scripting News</a> does well, but they complain about one thing: the site interacts with "an ad-tech company" -- AWS. They've discovered that I load content from Amazon S3, which is true. That's where I store the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images that make up the site. I'm a paying customer and if they do any spying with the log info, that would be imho unethical. This is a problem with services like Blacklight. They make assumptions that things are nefarious when they're innocent, and if they become popular they constrain the web. This goes against the most powerful thing about the web, it's the platform with no [%search: platform vendor%].
