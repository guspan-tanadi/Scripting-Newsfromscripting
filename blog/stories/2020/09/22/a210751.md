<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/23/mrNatural.png" border="0" align="right">My internet was down today. Oy! I was just warming up, had written a piece about <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/22/123759.html?title=weNeedOccamsNews">Occam's News</a> and a <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/09/22.html#a125519">bit</a> about the wonderful word naïveté, when boom -- I'm offline. I made two trips into town to try to connect, but eventually gave up,went for an excellent bike ride on the <a href="https://ashokanrailtrail.com/">Ashokan Rail Trail</a>, a local wonder. I learned that I should have a few printed books around, or at least one downloaded to my Kindle, and some videos that are downloaded on my iPad. Luckily I had a few episodes of Brockmire and they were lovely. The whole thing is so LOL good. Really you do LOL. Rare thing. I tried watching a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve">Killing Eve</a> season 3, but it's garbage. Bad writing. The first season was so great because it was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Waller-Bridge">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>. The acting and the sets, they carry through all the seasons, but sheez, no one tells stories like PWB. So instead I planned out my next few projects, something totally worth doing, instead of wrapping up an abbreviated version of the big one I had been attempting. Tomorrow is another day, knock wood, praise Muphy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL#:~:text=IANAL%20is%20a%20Usenet%20and,particular%20addressee%20of%20their%20remarks.">IANAL</a>, my mother loves me, and all other disclaimers.
