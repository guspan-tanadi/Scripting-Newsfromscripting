# Our moment of power
You know how when the Repubs pass a disgusting Supreme Court nominee we feel so powerless. 

Well this time, they'll be doing it <i>just before America votes. </i>

At our moment of maximum power. 

They didn't choose the moment RBG left us. But they obviously don't mind losing.

Future Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh.
