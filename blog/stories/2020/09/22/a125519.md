I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">punch cards</a>, then graduated to all upper case terminals with 40 character displays and thought they were incredible, until I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazeltine_1500">Hazeltine terminal</a> that had upper <i>and lower</i> case and 80 columns. I was in heaven. But now you can include words with all that fancy punctuation, and wow isn't that amazing. And naïveté is such a great word, you actually get two of them in one freaking word. It's only been 80 years but look at all the progress.
