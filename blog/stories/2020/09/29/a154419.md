# The ideal blogging tool
The ideal blogging tool design would come from merging the publishing of WordPress with the interactivity of Facebook.

I don't mean the culture of either product. WordPress imho is too exclusive in its deployment. It should be easier. And without any FB-like algorithms.

You should be able to deploy it on your own. It should install as easily as an app on your iPhone. And you should have full control of hosting. Move whenever you want with no breakage. It should be as easy to port as it was to install.
