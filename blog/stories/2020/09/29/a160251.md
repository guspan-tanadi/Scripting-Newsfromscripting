<img src="http://scripting.com/images/2019/10/19/mrWhite.png" border="0" align="right">Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld">Hello World web app</a> for ES6 modules. It uses a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/module.js">module</a> that defines one function, secsSince. It then calls that from <a href="https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/code.js">another module</a>, and displays the result on the page. It's as simple as I could make it and it works. Not sure I want to use ES6 modules, but at least now I know how to do it, and you do too. All the other tutorials were missing some information you need to understand how modules work. The most confusing thing about modules is that you can only invoke modules from other modules. That means basically that all the JavaScript code in your web app has to be in a module. Not sensible imho, but also not much of a burden. BTW you can <a href="http://scripting.com/code/moduleshello/">run the code</a> without downloading.
