* The bad thing about all the open corruption in the Trump admin, is they aren't as old and crazy and Trump, and know if they leave office, without Trump or someone worse in office, they will go to jail. So they're going to fight like hell to keep him in office.

* He can target death by cutting off funding strategically, and forcing people to do things that will expose them to the virus. They're already doing it, for example forcing schools to open. That translates into death and disease, as you know.
* Also if you accept the premise that they're hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and i do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.
* @calliekimball I know people like him who have aged as he has. They harden inside, become very fragile. They have to control their environment or they break. He's lost in there. Way too old and in a rut to find his way out.
