The day after Election Day in 2016, I went for a walk around midtown Manhattan. It looked just like it did the day before. But I felt like people looked at each other differently. Did this person vote for Trump? Do they think I voted for Trump? I wanted to wear a button that said "I voted for HRC." Or better, I'm on the other side. I came up with the MLK button. I wore it then and some days when I'm out in public I wear it these days too. It was a more general Black Lives Matter. It said people are sacred and differences should be celebrated.
