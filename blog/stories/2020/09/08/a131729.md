I would have defended <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/08/julian-assange-rapped-by-judge-after-outburst-during-extradition-trial">Julian Assange</a> if he hadn't helped Russia and Trump hijack the 2016 election. After that, he can rot in jail for the rest of his life as far as I'm concerned.
