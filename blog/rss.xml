			<description>Good morning! We're getting close to the darkest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. So the light has to come from inside of us this time of year, to make up for the outside light that isn't here. Spread the love. Give someone a hug. Especially yourself.</description>

			<title>Really Simple Investing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 90s, I was doing pretty well in business and life. My company merged with another, and we went public. I left shortly after the merger. I was writing software and riding my bike around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/933+Hermosa+Way,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4423546,-122.1904147,3a,75y,225.13h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWpxKaYp2CLoVfYdOzKC9og!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa4b8c4919d37:0x737bbc1511131c2c!8m2!3d37.4422438!4d-122.190613&quot;&gt;Menlo Park, CA&lt;/a&gt;. I had a pool. Things were clicking. Life was good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried a lot of things with the proceeds from the company I sold. Most of them lost all the money I put into them, highly speculative stuff -- learning experiences for sure. One investment stood out among all others, it went up, consistently -- the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to know why this one fund is so good at returning value.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out the answer is really simple. Presidents are evaluated on the performance of the economy, and that means the stock market, and that means one of two indexes, the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500. Presidents have a lot of power to move the value of stocks relative to other ways of looking at the economy (there are lots of them, all valid). Because they are evaluated on the value of these two virtual stocks, they try to move them up. And you can go along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you hitch your wagon to the S&amp;P train, and basically do nothing else, you'll do the same as &quot;the market&quot; or &quot;the economy.&quot; If it's good times, you'll do well, and not good times you'll probably still do well. It's really weird that wealth is such a simple game, but it appears that it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things they don't tell you on TV because the really rich people worry that if everyone knows it, the value of the indices might no longer go up all the time. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/15/myOrangeJelloBox.png&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;, the fool, is really open about it. When he points out that the &quot;stock market&quot; is doing great even though thousands of Americans are dying every day he's talking to his constituents, not you. He's saying the silent part out loud. But there's nothing stopping you from listening. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is all completely arbitrary. Just in case you're wondering. It's why &quot;the market&quot; can be booming in a depression. It's arbitrary and an illusion. But it does for now at least translate into living comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>YouTube TV does something smart that all TV services should do. They have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt;. So you can go there and edit your preferences, menus, program your DVR, whatever. Roku should do that too, as should &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/02/211604.html?title=hboMaxIsAHistoricMess&quot;&gt;HBO Mess&lt;/a&gt;, or the arcane UI of LG-land. Set up your watch list. Integrate with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;! (i.e. have an API). Connect your world to mine. It's amazing how much of the design of the LG television assumes their TV is the center of our world. It's for watching. Not controlling. Relaxing, meditating, self-medicating with boredom. Not a place where you get big ideas, and if you do it's a lost cause because the UI tools are limited to what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1475971-REG/lg_an_mr19ba_magic_remote_control_with.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6zq6C-7XppTkISht-dKLTIKU4-C25MtD4GvWbqQurqJkDVJ8RRRUOhoCRH4QAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/a&gt; can do.</description>

I really should write a book with some of these projects and the philosophy behind them.</description>

			<description>Trump wants to be &quot;president&quot; not president. This came out during the 2016 campaign when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/magazine/how-donald-trump-picked-his-running-mate.html&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; the job of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/17/excerpt.png&quot;&gt;real president&lt;/a&gt; to Kasich. So he'll go to Mar a Lago, take the &quot;presidential&quot; oath while Biden takes the actual oath, everyone's happy.</description>

We should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=teaching+journalism+in+school+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;teaching journalism in school&lt;/a&gt;. Not just for journalism majors. Everyone should have a semester of training. If we had started doing that ten years ago, we'd be in a much better place now.</description>

			<description>The key point that the Democrats keep missing is that we want to do more. We will give you money and we will vote, but that's not all we can do. Each of has special talents, abilities. Some of us have more time to give than others. But almost to a person, we want to be part of this, not spectators. Trump kind of got that, with his rallies. He didn't condescend. He included them in his speeches. Talked to them like humans. This stuff isn't hard, you have have to try to see things differently. We're not just dollars and votes.</description>

The nice thing is how the mom and her three daughters have open affection for each other, it's their baseline. They get pissed off, mostly the kids with the mom, but they quickly get back to hugging and being motherly to each other, across generations. It's sweet. Nothing at all even remotely like the environment I grew up in btw, just sayin. Anyway, I'd kind of like to see Donald Trump as a guest on the show. They would listen to his sad stories, and try to help him. I think there could be some good jokes in there.</description>

			<description>I used to put Donald Trump's image in the right margin of this blog quite frequently, but I've stopped. He's a vampire we've managed to lock in a crypt, and I worry that just showing his image here might wake him up. He's now got the smell of loser on him, like an old version of Sarah Palin. She was pretty charismatic too, in her day. And about as talented as the lame duck. Better to let him fade away. Think of him as a dead relative. Maybe he was an asshole, it's hard to remember, it's been so long.</description>

			<description>One of the nice things about using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22outliner%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; to edit my blog is that I can move things around quickly, but sometimes things get moved to the wrong place. That happened yesterday. I was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;my new TV&lt;/a&gt; and all of a sudden there's a paragraph about how screwed up journalism is. And then there was a post that I thought I had deleted and didn't. Oy! That was pretty disturbing. I left it there, but edited it a bit so it made more sense. Yesterday was a good day in general, but a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; day on the blog. Anyway, I've corrected it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html&quot;&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html&quot;&gt;Ben Smith explains&lt;/a&gt; why it's bad that Apple is now a media company. He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop.

We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us.

We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory&quot;&gt;triangulation&lt;/a&gt; here. A source of news that is &lt;i&gt;totally disconnected&lt;/i&gt; from the media industry.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html&quot;&gt;Ben Smith explains&lt;/a&gt; why it's bad that Apple is now a media company. He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html&quot;&gt;biggest media buyouts&lt;/a&gt; in history (at the time).

			<description>BTW, a disclaimer. Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt;, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story. And Apple, btw is the perfect example of a tech company that should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; have a say in what stories get told.</description>

			<description>Now that I understand what agile development means, I realize that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/13/163911.html?title=howPodcastingCameIntoBeing&quot;&gt;story of how podcasting came into being&lt;/a&gt; is beyond agile.

It sounded to me like there was something there, so I started prototyping ideas I thought might be what he was saying until it clicked.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1338029694952869893&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; for podcasting was everyone who wanted to do a radio show could, without having to submit to corporate judgement. Almost 20 years later, it has, and still does. The web has none of the limits of broadcast. Simple idea. That it worked, that’s kind of a miracle. If you’re doing a podcast now, just know someone believed in you a long time ago.</description>

			<title>My new TV</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new TV made by LG.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their user interface is a classic corporate historic disaster mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a piece of shit. In every way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The picture is very nice though. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The software does all kinds of stuff I don't want it to do, automatically, like starting selecting programs for me to watch when I'm trying desperately to figure out how to tell it to show me the programs I'm trying to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing about it is there aren't many things a person watching a TV wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to choose between: Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube TV and YouTube. Inside each site I already know their UIs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I need to go to settings, to change options for video, sound, captioning, turn off annoyances I don't want. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't want to turn my life over to you by accepting legal agreements for the ability to do that, btw.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This TV has Alexa built in, I thought maybe I could use that to control the TV, but no, it's used to control everything but the TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Shovelware. That's what this thing is filled with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paid $2000 plus tax for this, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the TCL/Roku combo is very good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a Roku stick which I have hooked into the TV and I can get there, but I'm not convinced that the apps in there have full access to the high resolution display.

			<title>The NYT and Hillary's Emails</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The further we slide down the slope remember that it required some grease and a push from the great NYT which still has not accepted their responsibility for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/14/butheremails.png&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails story&lt;/a&gt; that was so pivotal in 2016. I mistakenly thought we were witnessing journalism's self-awareness and shame when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/14/nytheadline.png&quot;&gt;this headline&lt;/a&gt;. But no, they weren't accepting blame, they were blaming you and me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend writes: &quot;Why does the blame lie with NYT?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Good question.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They were fed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillary's Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; story by a conservative dirty trickster, and they went with it, made it a campaign, based on either cynicism or ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It hinges on whether the people at the NYT understood what email servers are, and have some basic idea of how they work and what they do. If they didn't know then it was ignorance. If they did know, then it was cynicism that basically their readers would have no idea and would trust them when they said &lt;i&gt;this is a big story&lt;/i&gt; by repeatedly putting it on page one.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yet the things they said amounted to WTF -- how is this relevant. They never explained. And of course we now understand that there was nothing there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't doubt that HRC would have been president for the last four years if they had done their job honestly and competently. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The NYT's impact was at least that of Facebook. So when they blame Facebook they should have just as many column-inches about how the NYT screwed us in 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, don't forget, just because Trump lost the election doesn't mean he isn't still playing his game. Control the story to draw our attention from where the real action is. This time it's pretty obvious that his Russian owners are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/201213/p71#a201213p71&quot;&gt;hacking the shit&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html&quot;&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;. That's going to have some serious consequences. You know what Trump says. &quot;They just let you do it.&quot; That's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFF6eKrH4s&quot;&gt;us&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Why didn't the Supreme Court do more? As keepers of the Constitution do they have to wait until they're asked a question. Couldn't they ask us a question -- The Constitution provides for a criminal president like Trump. Why isn't the country using it?</description>

			<description>When will journalism stop covering the disappointment of Trump supporters. They lost. They're having a hard time dealing with it. Meantime we're in the middle of a pandemic. Let them get over it on their own. My mother understood this. When my little brother was complaining about something, very unfairly, and loudly, my mother would say if you just ignore him he'll stop. She was right.</description>

			<title>The moment CNN was not prepared for</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Porter_Anderson/status/1338173209389240322&quot;&gt;CNN accuses Fox&lt;/a&gt; of lack of proportionality. I've been watching CNN the last few weeks. I find it mind-numbing. (A good thing, for now, I play video games and watch Twitter while CNN is on.) They repeat the same two stories over and over since Election Day. Literally the same words, over and over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's really going on imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both Fox and CNN are paralyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are prepared for hurricanes, earthquakes, even another 9/11. But they have no idea what to do with a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly the Trump rebellion is on a scale they have no concept of how to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are people &lt;i&gt;who do not improvise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As Chris Hayes said, they all did very well in school. Rose through the ranks. Lots of book learning and discipline. They can make looking like a maverick as tame as a lamb, which is good for the cash flow of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they can't improvise. They can only do what they were taught to do. They weren't taught how to do this job. So they are stuck. Paralyzed. Going round and round trying to catch a familiar beat, but they can't because it doesn't have one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The moment podcasting came into being</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It happened in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10.html&quot;&gt;October 2000&lt;/a&gt; in NYC. I met with Adam Curry over a couple of days at a hotel in midtown on the west side. I mention the meeting in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/12.html#myUserlandOnTheDesktop&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on December 28, 2000. Here's an excerpt. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It helps to have a user in mind when you're developing. In NY, when I met with Adam for two days he kept trying to explain what he wanted, but he's not a software developer, so to my ears it came across like hodgepodge. But I listened anyway, I kept trying to feed back what I heard, but we weren't connecting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I got back home I did what programmers do, I iterated, and kept showing it to him. Is this what you wanted? Eventually we got there, this software hits his button. It's also a framework for his vision for last yard connectivity. You can move huge pieces of content without any waiting and using the bandwidth that you don't use. When you're home sleeping in your bed your desktop system can get the big stuff, you won't even know it's there until it's fully downloaded on your hard disk.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is how video and music are going to move over the net in 2001. Who would have thought RSS would play a role in this? Adam did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the key idea on podcasting. How to distribute large bits of audio and video without having to wait for them to download. At the time, it was the slowness of the net that stood in the way of what we now call podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The significance of this is that it was 20 years ago. It led to a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; which supported enclosures for the first time. I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/12/27.html&quot;&gt;wrote this up&lt;/a&gt; on the blog that month. And the software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MUOTD%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;MUOTD&lt;/a&gt; became Radio UserLand, which was a two-way blogging and reading app for RSS. It's something the software industry hasn't replicated, not because it's so hard technically, it isn't. Not sure why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two-day meetup was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/26.html&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;. It still took a couple of months from then before we had any real demos. It was competing with other projects we had at UserLand at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was also a Scripting News dinner at Katz's Deli on Houston St during the same visit on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/12/lifeIsCrazy.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Spoilers, so beware. Two of my favorite movies: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)&quot;&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets&quot;&gt;As Good As It Gets&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because I identify with almost all the characters in some way. Such incredible story-telling. So much truth about our failure to understand our own struggles and beauty, try as hard as we can, and to accept the beauty in others. Also a short interruption as I got a spam call that I answered. I leave this kind of stuff in my podcasts. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/12/lifeIsCrazy.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Spoilers, so beware. Two of my favorite movies: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)&quot;&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets&quot;&gt;As Good As It Gets&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because I identify with almost all the characters in some way. Such incredible story-telling. So much truth about our failure to understand our own struggles and beauty, try as hard as we can, and to accept the beauty in others. Also a short interruption as I got a spam call that I answered. I leave this kind of stuff in my podcasts. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 12 Dec 2020 18:37:49 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2020/12/12/lifeIsCrazy.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="6605161" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/12/asGoodAsItGets.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/12.html#a183749"/>
