They're having a grand time, and while I (the listener) am deciding whether or not to cut them off, based on the probability that they'll ever say anything interesting before the end. Yesterday I cut them off and listened to music for the second half of my ride. It's the same reason I can't watch any MSNBC show for more than 3 minutes. They're filling the air, meantime I know there are things going on they should be informing me of, and add to things my mind can think about. Okay so N&amp;T had a bad episode, not the end of the world, the other most recent episodes are totally worth listening to, I highly recommend them, and I will keep listening in the hope that the NYC episode was just a bad idea they followed through on instead of canning.</description>

			<description>We are now all complete newbies when it comes to understanding how networks can be used to spread misinformation. We might look back in a few years and realize that our first line of defense was Facebook, Inc. Maybe tearing them down is like the press tearing down HRC in 2016. I don't trust their judgement on this stuff, do you?</description>

			<title>A thread from my tweet stream, as captured by Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If only we had journalism covering itself we'd probably learn they've been doing the exact same thing since the dawn of journalism.  This is a big defect in our system, no one is watching journalism.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/w8nGgjZTfb&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, what do you think the Pulitzer Prize is, other than a bunch of ads they do about journalism every year. No doubt the awards are highly politicized, and stories looking too deeply into corrupt journalism probably don't stand much chance of getting an award.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until there's some way for journalism's corruption to be exposed, why would any intelligent person think there's anything but corruption in journalism? In an Occam's Razor sort of way.  I'm watching The Wire, about to start Season 5, btw, if you know what that's about. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's this great scene at the end of Season 4, with Bodie and McNulty on a park bench. Bodie is talking about how fucked up the bosses are in the drug mob in Baltimore. It sounds just like what McNulty would say about the police department. That's the point.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the scene with Bodie and McNulty.    (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EtwlxhFKEz&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The next round of changes in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; will be about organizing tweets, using Twitter as a source for your writing work. Here's the use-case. You're out and about, and get an idea that belongs on the to-do list for your latest project. Open up Twitter, and post a note about it. When you get back to your desktop the note will already be in a Drummer outline, ready for you to act on it. It doesn't matter what kind of writer you are, whether you write for yourself, as a note-taker, if you write docs, research, news reporting, a blog, or a great novel. If you're a writer and and a steady user of Twitter, and interested in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; and outliners, I'd like to add you to the Drummer test group in a few days because I want to groom the product to your use of it. Send me an email, let me know if this interests you and we'll get you on board soon.</description>

It doesn't matter what kind of writer you are, whether you write for yourself, as a note-taker, if you write docs, research, news reporting, a blog, or a great novel. If you're a writer and and a steady user of Twitter, and interested in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; and outliners, I'd like to add you to the Drummer test group in a few days because I want to groom the product to your use of it. Send me an email, let me know if this interests you and we'll get you on board soon." created="Mon, 20 Sep 2021 22:20:56 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/20.html#a222056"/>

			<description>All kinds of &quot;twitterpro&quot; names are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=twitterpro&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;, somewhat amazingly. I've learned to control my domain name buying fetish, somewhat. I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;drummer.land&lt;/a&gt; recently. I found myself using that term when writing docs. I had to have it. Anyway. My name is Dave and I'm a domain name buying addict.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Little&quot;&gt;Omar Little&lt;/a&gt; is the most likeable character on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlo_Stanfield&quot;&gt;Marlo Stanfield&lt;/a&gt; is the coldest. For some reason I think of Marlo as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;. I know that's weird. Matt is a very nice fellow. But I guess the parallel is that I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_Barksdale&quot;&gt;Avon Barksdale&lt;/a&gt; to his Marlo Stanfield? The Wire is good, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(season_1)&quot;&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt; that's great. The remaining four seasons kind of coast a little after the spectacular creative success of the first.</description>

			<description>As summer winds down (tomorrow is the last day), I chose to listen to music instead of a podcasts on today's bike ride. I am loaded up with new ways of thinking from having gone through the archive of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then&quot;&gt;Now &amp; Then podcast&lt;/a&gt;. If you find your podcast fare is repetitive or shallow, dive into that podcast. It's a great college course in the history behind current affairs. Anyway, I've loaded up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)&quot;&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;, a very middle-class iPhone thank you, with lots of music history, and set it to shuffle the songs. The songs of my childhood. As this summer winds down, it feels like a metaphor for the summer of my own life winding down. The feelings from childhood that I re-experience with the music were the &quot;other side&quot; of the experiences  of adulthood which is now passing just like summer. The dreams of a child were of the future, full of possibilities, are now balanced by the regrets of an old man. I'm doing my best to stay fit, but it gets harder every year. This fall, esp because the pandemic is now going into its &lt;i&gt;third&lt;/i&gt; winter, has a grim feel to it. I know winter can be beautiful in the Hudson Valley. But this winter, unlike recent past winters, there's a sense of dread that hasn't been there before.</description>

To this day, their marketing campaign continues to be highly effective in getting the public to take on the weighty responsibility of halting climate change. We’ve cut back on meat, upped our recycling game and made the creative campaign’s key phrase – 'carbon footprint' – part of our vernacular. All in an attempt to make a positive difference – and yes, to clear our consciences.</description>

			<description>Everything we think is a new low in American governance is far from it. We were taught a lot of crap in school. The people whose egos were being protected are all long-dead.

			<title>What I'm learning from The Wire</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how many times I've watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; from beginning to end, but it's probably more than five. The last time I remember watching it was in 2010 when I just moved to NYC. I was living in the West Village, and had an active social life, and The Wire was something nice to do calmly, alone, just to get absorbed by a fictitious yet very familiar culture, again. Like coming home in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the thing about all good series that achieve suspension of disbelief, you feel like you're in the story, you're part of the family. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; with five seasons of 13 shows each, each show an hour, with all the characters and their stories, and relationships, makes for very absorbing reality-shifting and an emotionally satisfying experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I know what's coming, and amazingly, sometimes I've forgotten. But some big events, you remember, and experience them in full fidelity now, as you did the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also if I recall correctly the first seasons were only available in low-rez, they came out before 4K, but somehow they've upgraded the source material and it's all up state of the art, at least to my eyes, which aren't the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm toward the end of season 2. Not even close to half way through. Looking forward to the end of the day when I might watch a couple of epsiodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And get this, while I'm working through The Wire, I can't watch cable news. It's just too sad, slow, repetitive and just wrong. On one hand you see how great we can be as story-tellers, and the stories told on MSNBC and CNN aren't stories at all. The characters say nothing. Even the ones with reputations for saying a lot. There's absolutely no human connection. And you can see that the things they're saying are repeats, just like watching The Wire for the 5th or 10th time, but there's never a question about what the characters might say or do, it's always exactly the same. Yet it's supposed to be The News which would lead you to believe their intention is to say new things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep asking the question -- does news have to be as bad as it is? Could imagination bet part of it, curiosity, intellect, depth of knowledge about something other than politics or law? Maybe this is just what happens when you become older and more experienced than everyone on the news. They all seem flat and boring, and just plain stupid, bored with their jobs, but keeping the seat warm. But does it have to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I turned off Maddow last night</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I turned off Maddow  last night as she was reporting a leak of software for elections. She left out the vital part of the story, was this the first time the software had leaked? If not, all it tells you is the people who are doing the &quot;recount&quot; in Arizona are bad people. This is not news. If they were new leaks, I doubt I'd be hearing about it first on Maddow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it for all their breathess breaking stories, I can't remember Maddow ever cited by another news org as the source of a major story. Yet they often present their work as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the dishonesty when it comes to tech reporting, gives me an idea of how dishonest their other reporting must be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>CNN could use a constant critic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Saw a report on the news that Facebook is evil because they enhance pictures on Instagram. A really thin story because so many things other than Facebook damage people's self-perception based on ridiculous standards of appearance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;CNN does it, for sure in huge ways. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=brianna+keilar&quot;&gt;anchor&lt;/a&gt; reporting the story is a beautful woman, but probably not quite as beautiful has her makeup, hair and lighting people make her seem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish they were required to have a constant critic in a window in the upper right corner of the screen, pointing out these hypocrisies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Brianna Keilar&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I will always admire Keilar for how she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Kb7IDmFF4&quot;&gt;interviewed Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, before he was famous. If you haven't seen it, you might love it. It's very different from the usual TV news fare. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Thinking about the extent that Boomers are held responsible for where we're at, I still think that's nuts, the more I learn about slavery and how the Civil War is still going on, that's what we are fighting about in the US, that's why we can't get our shit together. We haven't accepted a very large part of our population, people who are fully entitled American citizens. Then I wondered about all the post-boomer generations that blame us. I wonder if they voted in every election they were entitled to vote in. What are the percentages of participation in democracy among the generations. I don't know if the idea of the vote as a sacred right is a Boomer thing, or what.  I know my parents had the participation bug. I got it from them, I'm sure. But if you didn't vote, I think it's hard to blame others. My friend NakedJen has a wonderful slogan for this. You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up. ❤️</description>

			<description>One reason I want Twitter to get rid of the character limit is so I no longer have to say &quot;I wrote a tweet.&quot; I have never liked the idea of writing tweets. Tweeting is weird and joke-like, self-deprecating, which I don't mind, but please not about writing. Writing is a religion, not something I joke about. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>More web breakage from Google</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Chrome has done something insidious to break the web a little more. They do this so often, breaking the web seems to be Google's business model. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what they changed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you type a domain name into the address bar of the browser, the protocol is hidden. This isn't new, or particularly bad, until they made the next change.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now instead of automatically generating http as the protocol in the URL, they generate https. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So sites that are running fine appear to be broken. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptscript.com/&quot;&gt;placeholder site&lt;/a&gt; to me just now. I was fooled, I immediately thought a server had gone down, and started looking for the outage. Then I was reminded of this trickery Google is doing. I was reminded of how much I hate what Google is doing to the web. They're fighting with me, and weakening the web in a way they have no right to. My site is a perfectly functional web site. It's just a placeholder. No one needs to worry about a &quot;man in the middle&quot; interference. There are no ads on this site. I don't know how else to say it. My choice of protocols is none of Google's business. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's basically a protection racket. If mobsters were doing it. &quot;Nice little website you have there, be a shame if people couldn't reach it because Google broke the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The other night I was bored and noticed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; was on HBO, so I watched one episode. Then another. And another. Later I started at Episode 1. I don't know how many times I've watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;. I'm almost at a point where I can recite the lines along with the actors. I've yet to see a flaw in this show, there's nothing I don't follow with rapt attention. I can't believe there are people who haven't seen it. It's as I imagine Shakespeare was in his day.</description>

			<description>Drummer has a feature called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+glossary&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt;, it's been part of every outliner I have done since the mid-90s. It's a very simple idea. A table that associates terms with text. If I use one of the terms in my writing, when it's published, the term is replaced with the text. We use &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; to represent the glossaries. Here's my &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;personal glossary&lt;/a&gt;. I wish every place I type text could be configured to use my glossary, so where ever I go I can use my terms. It would also be great to configure my searches to use these terms too, so Google for example would know what I am referring to when I type the name of one of my own products.</description>
