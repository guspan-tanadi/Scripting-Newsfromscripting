			<description>I spent much of the day at the eye doctor, and left with my eyes dilated, still feeling weird. So you are forewarned this is not the usual &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; fare. No doubt many typos.</description>

			<description>Scoble is trying to convince me to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. Confession: I'm starting to lust after one. But I'm also lusting after a Ford 150. Oy such problems. This is what I meant about feeling reborn after being double-vaccinated. I'm wearing a mask, frankly I think we should all wear masks from now on, for the foreseeable future. The way they did in Asia. People just wore them. I always thought it was weird. Then Covid happened, and they did a lot better than we did in mask-averse America. I think part of the return to &quot;normal&quot; is to understand that normal means something else now.</description>

			<description>About normalcy. I was telling a friend how there was a party atmosphere at the place we all got our vaccines. She pointed out that it might have been that we had been so deprived of social contact, and I slapped my hand on my forehead. Of course. I am not usually as gregarious as I've been in the last year, when I have had a chance to be with other people. I thrive on it.So we were all high at the vaccination site not just with relief at gaining some immunity, but also because here were some real live humans to talk with! It's why I think, no matter how dire the reality is, when we achieve new kinds of social interaction we will be a happy place, probably for quite a while or hopefully. I remember how it felt after 9-11, but the togetherness was short-lived. Maybe we should think about what kind of normal we want?</description>

			<description>One more thing. I had to spend a few hours at an eye doctor today for a checkup. I wanted to be chatting with people, but they weren't interested. Then I realized they work in a busy office, to them there's nothing unusual about having someone to chat with. As I waited for my eyes to dilate, I heard lots of random conversations, and didn't realize then how unusual that was, a fairly normal thing in the past, but foreign to me now.</description>

			<description>Okay yet another thing. Apparently after the 1918 pandemic no one wrote about it, no songs were written, no great movies or novels about life in the pandemic. I wonder if it'll be like that this time.</description>

			<description>I keep sharing this idea with my friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't think they get it. It's the same advice I'd give to any professional news org. Build more community around your podcast. If you do a weekly show, say on a Thursday, compile a set of emails from listeners and publish it on Tuesday, via email, as a newsletter. That way you get to know who's listening, and we get to know each other. Chris's podcast no doubt has some very interesting listeners, who are they and what do they think, what do they know? They've set up, imho, a too-narrow pipe, necessitated by the technology &lt;i&gt;we used to use&lt;/i&gt; for radio. Today's tech makes so much more possible. You just have to want to do it. I don't doubt they could find volunteers to read and curate the emails, so only the really interesting stuff goes out. What made me think of this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/write-like-the-russians/&quot;&gt;last week's show&lt;/a&gt;, with a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Saunders&quot;&gt;English prof&lt;/a&gt;, going through how short stories work. It was just a tiny sliver of a scratch of the surface. I want to know much more about this. Also glad to get away at least for a moment of end-of-the-world stories, which tend to dominate the podcast-o-sphere these days. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Vann&quot;&gt;Lizzie Vann&lt;/a&gt;, a famous entrepreneur, did something bold, she bought and renovated &lt;a href=&quot;https://bearsvillecenter.com/&quot;&gt;Bearsville Center&lt;/a&gt;, a theater, studio and restaurants and other buildings in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearsville,_New_York&quot;&gt;Bearsville NY&lt;/a&gt; that were built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Grossman&quot;&gt;Albert Grossman&lt;/a&gt; in the 60s and 70s as a place for the musicians he worked with to gather. He died in 1986, eventually Bearsville was abandoned. But now, it's beautiful again, an up to date and very attractive venue, what a great gathering place, as it once was, esp for people who produce audio (eg podcasters). Watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FEpT8INVn8&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea. A beautiful place. Lovely in summer.

			<description>There should be a way to opt out of Fox on cable. I realized recently that I've been paying them as much as the most MAGA person in the world, &lt;i&gt;for decades. &lt;/i&gt;I want to stop paying them. I want my money back too. Let's organize this. Fox is something that truly needs to be cancelled.</description>

			<description>A platform like Facebook is very hard to build. Serving billions of users, hundreds of millions at the same time, is a mostly unheralded accomplishment, probably like putting a man on the moon. Yet this never comes up in the public analysis.</description>

			<description>I don't watch a lot of movies these days thanks to the pandemic I guess. But in the last two days I watched two, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadland_(film)&quot;&gt;NomadLand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Care_a_Lot&quot;&gt;I Care a Lot&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to imagine two more different movies. NomadLand is a character study, played by a 63-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_McDormand&quot;&gt;Frances McDormand&lt;/a&gt;. Her age is important. I understand this somewhat because I'm 65, and it's like that great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_7eu64y6c&quot;&gt;Al Pacino speech&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, as you get older &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_Z_7eu64y6c?t=102&quot;&gt;things are taken&lt;/a&gt; from you. Parents, friends, lovers, and then pieces of yourself start going, and you're left wondering what the fuck. That's NomadLand in a nutshell. The acting is beautiful, the scenery, the characters, the feelings (somewhat) -- but the story? It's like viewing a work of art in a museum. It's just there. It's for you to decide what it means and a lot of that will depend on how old you are, I imagine. I Care a Lot is very much the opposite, but interestingly it's also about things being taken away from an old person, in this case played by 72-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Wiest&quot;&gt;Dianne Wieste&lt;/a&gt;. So much happens in the first few minutes of the movie, and it's so anger-making, I turned it off at least three times to regain my composure to continue watching. But then it becomes a rollicking ultra-violent comedy, kind of like a Quentin Taratino movie, but funnier. If you want entertainment, I Care a Lot is for you. I will watch NomadLand again. Sometimes movies like this don't grab me on the first viewing, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/a&gt;, which i panned after a first viewing, then &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; after a second. I'll let you know.</description>

I understand this somewhat because I'm 65, and it's like that great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_7eu64y6c&quot;&gt;Al Pacino speech&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, as you get older &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_Z_7eu64y6c?t=102&quot;&gt;things are taken&lt;/a&gt; from you. Parents, friends, lovers, and then pieces of yourself start going, and you're left wondering what the fuck. That's NomadLand in a nutshell. The acting is beautiful, the scenery, the characters, the feelings (somewhat) -- but the story? It's like viewing a work of art in a museum. It's just there. It's for you to decide what it means and a lot of that will depend on how old you are, I imagine. I Care a Lot is very much the opposite, but interestingly it's also about things being taken away from an old person, in this case played by 72-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Wiest&quot;&gt;Dianne Wieste&lt;/a&gt;. So much happens in the first few minutes of the movie, and it's so anger-making, I turned it off at least three times to regain my composure to continue watching. But then it becomes a rollicking ultra-violent comedy, kind of like a Quentin Taratino movie, but funnier. If you want entertainment, I Care a Lot is for you. I will watch NomadLand again. Sometimes movies like this don't grab me on the first viewing, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/a&gt;, which i panned after a first viewing, then &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; after a second. I'll let you know." created="Sun, 21 Feb 2021 15:18:20 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/21/nomadland.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/02/21.html#a151820"/>

			<title>Blogging is still with us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; is going on CNN shortly to talk about Google, Facebook, Australia and Murdoch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Had a thought. Simple arithmetic. There was a fantastic boom, blogging made a lot of stuff happen. Where did it all go? The thesis from journalism seems to be all that is over, ancient history. I think the evidence is to the contrary. Blogging reshaped the world. Not only for good, of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism plays a magic trick, ignoring the changes, and the good, and only focusing on how the new tech (yes it still is new) can be used for evil. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps possibly because of their conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jarvis is going on with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianstelter&quot;&gt;Brian Stelter&lt;/a&gt; who I understand got his start in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/how-a-cable-news-blog-turned-into-a-top-source-for-the-highs-and-lows-of-broadcast-media/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt;. So it would be interesting if Jeff asked him a question. Do you think the flow is just one way, from journalism to Facebook, or perhaps something more is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My thesis is that blogging may be somewhat vestigial, may be a virtual dinosaur, but its genes are still in ciculation, the equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-dinosaurs-shrank-and-became-birds/&quot;&gt;online birds&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-care-a-lot&quot;&gt;I Care a Lot&lt;/a&gt; is a fine movie, in a way, the best movie I've seen in a long time. The beginning is hard to watch, but if you're getting on in years, you should know that what they depict actually happens, out of the blue people are committed, by strangers, and their assets stolen, legally. Anyway, once you get over that hump, almost every time you turn a corner, there's something new and wonderful. I haven't had my attention held by a movie like this in a long time.</description>

			<title>Trump supporters after the insurrection</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A recital of some facts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The US is great at elections. We have been running them &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1788%E2%80%9389_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;since inception&lt;/a&gt;, longer than any other country in the world. We are the gold standard in elections. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Our elections are not perfect, but their imperfections heavily favor Republicans. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The 2020 election was a standard US presidential election. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was secure, fair and not in any way rigged. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Joe Biden won the election, in terms of votes, and in the Electoral College.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On January 6, Trump supporters attacked the US Congress, and came close to overthrowing the elected government of the United States. This was and still is shocking. We have not fully processed yet what happened on January 6. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Whether you think Trump caused it or not doesn't matter for this question. Trump supporters did it, in his name. It seems impossible for one to support Trump at this point, and not also support and accept the insurrection. If you self-proclaim as a Trump supporter, you also support the overthrow of the elected government of the United States by force. Sorry if this is news to you but you are not a patriot, you are a traitor. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Before the insurrection you could possibly shrug off our &quot;differences&quot; but now your friends who are Trump supporters are no longer willing to accept the result of a fair election, and their response to the fair election is to try to overthrow the government. You can't accept this. Even if they are family members. You have to turn your back on them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I thought Julian Castro said it brilliantly at the impeachment trial. Asked if he was concerned about Trump winning in 2024, he said no --  he was afraid of Trump losing. He's afraid of a repeat of what happened on January 6. He's right to be afraid. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump supporters live in an incompatible alternate country. The two cannot co-exist. We have to defeat them. It's not just about the people who crashed the Capitol, it's about the people who accept that. No excuses, not interested in discussing. We do not co-exist. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just cancelled Fubo and YouTube TV. I was able to replace both for &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; less money by re-hooking up with Spectrum, my cable provider. So &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/16.html#a174955&quot;&gt;cutting the wire&lt;/a&gt; is not economic. That word should get around. When you look at the set top box and think &quot;I can save money by getting rid of that,&quot; that's probably wrong. This is an ever more divided space, where big media companies use their content to keep you in their networks. And since many of them also own movie companies, and the pandemic has destroyed their distribution system, they;'re all trying, cautiously,  to use their streaming services to unclog their new movie pipelines. I guess because of history, the cable providers can offer the best deals? Not sure why it is that way but it is. YouTube TV still has the most comfortable UI in this category, btw. Spectrum's is awkward, but I'm guessing I'll get used to it.</description>

I guess because of history, the cable providers can offer the best deals? Not sure why it is that way but it is. YouTube TV still has the most comfortable UI in this category, btw. Spectrum's is awkward, but I'm guessing I'll get used to it." created="Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:57:39 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/19/blueJello.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/02/19.html#a165739"/>

			<title>Why I sympathize with McNeil</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I'm so sympathetic with &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Donald McNeil%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; is that I have a friend whose career was ruined by something not all that different from what happened to McNeil. And unlike McNeil, he's still got a number of productive years before retirement, has three children to provide for, and more important deserve to look up to their father.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are some people whose loyalty is so valued that no matter what happens I'll stand by them. There aren't many in my life. There was a time in 2002 when I was really sick, and had a long recovery in front of me. I made it is because of the help of three friends. And one of them is this person, who I'm not going to name, because I think there's a chance doing so would make it worse for him, and that's the last thing I want. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something &quot;the left&quot; does, and it's real. They're pretending they don't do it. But they do. It's just as awful imho as the people who attacked the Capitol, at least they had the guts to try to ruin things out in the open. The people who attacked my friend had nothing against him. It was all laid out in a Medium post, crafted to make no specific charges, just to phrase things that made him seem like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein&quot;&gt;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt; type, when he is nothing of the sort. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway another friend who reads my blog pointed this out. You are taking a lot of notice of McNeil, she said in a phone conversation. It's true. I love what McNeil did during the early days of the pandemic. I will miss his commentary as we go forward, but hopefully he can find another path to the podcast universe. I also like the rapport he had with Michael Barbaro, and I guess that's gone. I think the NYT is a lost cause. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But friendship, that's still the whole thing. The personal connection. The knowing your friend is deeply flawed but still he's your friend. I can openly advocate for McNeil without much risk, but the issue is much bigger than McNeil and the NY Times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, everything is in bloom in California this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I use a Mac. I keep the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/macbook-air/the-dock-apd4b7fb731f/mac&quot;&gt;desktop Dock&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the main screen. I want to be sure the dock doesn't magically get moved to the second screen. It happens every few days, if I click in the dock in a certain way. Is there some way to lock the dock in place, at the bottom of the main screen? It doesn't seem there should be any mouse click that gets the dock to move such a great physical and conceptual distance.</description>

I've had this problem where it complains about disks being ejected that I never ejected. I deal with it, but today there seems to be an infinite number of these dialogs. I've been clicking on the Close button in these dialogs for ten minutes, and it's impossible to know how many there are. It feels like thousands. I've tried pressing modifier keys while clicking, to no avail.</description>

			<description>I thought &quot;cutting the wire&quot; would save me money, but it actually costs a lot more for the same programming. I am currently spending $65 for both YouTube TV and Fubo, and $12 for Hulu, and no HBO, though I really want it. If you add it up, it's about $150 a month. So I called Spectrum to see if I could get that without the set top box, and if so, how much would it cost. Turns out it's about $40 on top of my internet service, with all the local sports, weather, news, CNN, MSNBC and HBO. I'm going to cancel the others, I'm sure I'll miss something, but one thing I won't miss is having to remember where to go for each of the shows I'm interested in. And of course I still have Netflix and Amazon. So I'm back to where I was before I naively threw all my cards in the air. Back to Roku and Spectrum. I guess I learned a lot. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It's ridiculous at this time to say that Clubhouse will be a raging success. But people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/&quot;&gt;verdicts&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>BTW, I forgive Wired for doing that. That was the culture at the time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Web Energy%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Web Energy&lt;/a&gt; -- I called it. I drank the Kool Aid &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/97/review/push.html&quot;&gt;myself&lt;/a&gt;. But it's especially important to keep your own scorecard, so next time you temper your enthusiasm and negativity with a proper amount of self-doubt.</description>

			<title>Facebook and journalism, yet again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the disconnect with journalism and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not journalism. And that's not an insult to Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not journalism the way the telephone is not journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook says you can publish on our site. Go right ahead. That's the opposite of journalism which says, you want to publish on our site, get in line, and conform to our values, look like us, and then 1 out 10000 will get in. It's even tougher than Harvard or Princeton. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So journalism keeps trying to fit Facebook into their model. Facebook says this can't work. Journalism calls them names. That's where we are right now in this great fight between the people and journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The real force here is not Facebook the company or their servers, which are impressive and very valuable -- it's the people who use Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back in the late 80s I started a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://userland.com/&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt;. My second company. I knew that was going to be the name when I was running my first, Living Videotext. It was named after the tech. By the time I was ready for the second, I came to believe that every company is about the users, not the tech, hence UserLand. 33 years later, I feel the same way, only more so.</description>

			<title>McNeil, the Jeremy Lin of the NYT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hoped that when Ben Smith &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/business/media/new-york-times-donald-mcneil.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/210214/p5#a210214p5&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the Donald McNeil firing at the NYT, he'd look at the media angle, not the internal chaos at the NYT. I guess maybe in a sense that is media? It's an old story, honestly I think only journalism insiders care. I don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;McNeil was like &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Jeremy Lin%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 and the NYT was the Knicks. Right person at the right place at the right time. And (oddly) the NYT did the same thing with McNeil that the Knicks did with Lin. Weird how that works. Someone should write a book. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What mattered with Lin and what matters with McNeil is that the users love them. You should check that out. I could go into great detail, but honestly that's not my job. I'm a user and actually a longtime fan of both the Knicks and the NYT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ask the NYT reporter who covers the Knicks now. They're doing great. They have a bunch of Jeremy Lins now. Somehow they figured out their business. The NYT imho is drifting further and further away from it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The combo of McNeil and the Daily podcast was gold. Why did they break up the team? Ben, that would be a story worthy of you. Again imho. A fan. Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/14/theTrumpWeKnewIsGone.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: It's the day after the death of the thing we called Donald Trump. In this podcast I explain how magical things happen in the days after someone you're close to dies. It feels that way with Trump. We got one last look at him, not in person, because the person is gone, the Trump who watched TV and tweeted all day from the White House. Gone, not forgotten, becoming a distant memory. What little is left is finishing up old business, and then will depart for good. It's a 20 minute series of stories. Hope you enjoy!</description>
