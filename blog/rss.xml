			<description>Five &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_neighborhoods&quot;&gt;neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; in Queens have more people than Wyoming. Here's the math. The five largest neighborhoods in &lt;a href=&quot;https://statisticalatlas.com/county-subdivision/New-York/Queens-County/Queens/Population#figure/neighborhood&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, by population, are: Astoria, Jamaica. Corona, Elmhurst and Flushing -- for a total of 581K. Wyoming's population is 578K. The point being this is just part of one county in New York State. It gets zero senators, probably a total of one member of the House (hard to figure). This came up as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KMCRadio/status/1340816003203252224&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on how the counties, if votes were allocated to them, one per county, would have given Trump a landslide win over Biden. Yes, and if every one of my toes were worth $1 billion, I would be a billionaire. I'm sure you can tell a story that makes you sleep easier at night. But that's not how elections are won and lost. And of course everyone knows that. Oh can we stop being idiots some day, perhaps? That would be nice. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/20.html#a155757&quot;&gt;ranted about journalism&lt;/a&gt; and the way they report on Facebook, from their own conflicted point of view. Toxic stuff, completely unrestrained by any effort at balance. I just came across a thread in a private FB group where a parent, considering buying a house in a small nearby town, asks what people think of local schooling. What came back is an incredible thread with real-life experiences. So far 70 comments. Not the kind of stuff you can get from journalism or books. Since it's private, I can't quote it, sorry.</description>

I like that, even though it is very much women’s POV, and they can be pretty harsh on men, the men sometimes have depth that women miss. I stuck with it through four seasons.</description>

			<description>Listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-facebook-owns-future&quot;&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt; about Google and Facebook. Such hype and propaganda. When you hear &quot;news&quot; talk about something you understand better than they do, you can hear how evil they are. And they are very evil at NPR. For example, they talk about how Facebook is used by white supremacists to organize so they can kill protestors. They interview the girlfriend of one of the dead protestors. What they leave out is that it's also used to plan charity events in my hometown, and every hometown in the world. It's like saying the telephone is used to plan terrorism. Yes, it is, but most people would know that's bullshit. Unfortunately they are so good at sliming Facebook in journalism, and it is still relatively new, that they mislead a lot of people who could benefit from using it. I know because I hear the bullshit coming back through them. They're scared of it, that's for sure. They should let some people use their air to explain how NPR exploits &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; users. Yeah I don't see that happening anytime soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW this is why blogging and podcasting are so important. They represent checks on the power of journalism. I was naive in the beginning to think this would negate the power of journalism to mislead, it hasn't had that effect. They are as oblivious to criticism as the Republicans in Congress are. But there's still hope.</description>

			<description>Meanwhile &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/01/05/141003.html&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; screwing us. If the people at NPR understand how, why aren't they reporting that. Both are choking the open protocols of the web, and keep competition from rising up to exploit their weakness. This is something that probably sounds &quot;technical&quot; to them. Most journalists are intimidated, for now at least, by the technology of the internet. To our detriment. Maybe over the years that will ease as the old folk move on and young people who grew up with the tech replace them. But I'm not really that hopeful about that. The young folk seem to have inherited the blindness and hypocrisy of previous generations of journalism.</description>

			<description>There's another reason to be in a hurry to get everyone vaccinated. As time goes by, the virus is mutating. Maybe a strain will come along that's resistent or immune to the vaccine. It makes sense that will happen faster as people are vaccinated. To work best it should happen fast. There's a lot of subtlety that is being missed in the press coverage. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-20/uk-new-strain-covid-19-more-infectious-spreads-faster-urgent/13001198&quot;&gt;new strain&lt;/a&gt; apparently in the UK now that is more communicative. Also, if history is a guide, the new strains will be less lethal. That's good news of course.</description>

We can send that money overseas and get back cars, food, drugs, hospitals, airports, roads, ski vacations, whatever we want that money can buy. 3. America is the only country that gets to do this.</description>

			<title>Really Simple Investing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 90s, I was doing pretty well in business and life. My company merged with another, and we went public. I left shortly after the merger. I was writing software and riding my bike around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/933+Hermosa+Way,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4423546,-122.1904147,3a,75y,225.13h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWpxKaYp2CLoVfYdOzKC9og!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa4b8c4919d37:0x737bbc1511131c2c!8m2!3d37.4422438!4d-122.190613&quot;&gt;Menlo Park, CA&lt;/a&gt;. I had a pool. Things were clicking. Life was good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried a lot of things with the proceeds from the company I sold. Most of them lost all the money I put into them, highly speculative stuff -- learning experiences for sure. One investment stood out among all others, it went up, consistently -- the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to know why this one fund is so good at returning value.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out the answer is really simple. Presidents are evaluated on the performance of the economy, and that means the stock market, and that means one of two indexes, the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500. Presidents have a lot of power to move the value of stocks relative to other ways of looking at the economy (there are lots of them, all valid). Because they are evaluated on the value of these two virtual stocks, they try to move them up. And you can go along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you hitch your wagon to the S&amp;P train, and basically do nothing else, you'll do the same as &quot;the market&quot; or &quot;the economy.&quot; If it's good times, you'll do well, and not good times you'll probably still do well. It's really weird that wealth is such a simple game, but it appears that it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things they don't tell you on TV because the really rich people worry that if everyone knows it, the value of the indices might no longer go up all the time. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/15/myOrangeJelloBox.png&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;, the fool, is really open about it. When he points out that the &quot;stock market&quot; is doing great even though thousands of Americans are dying every day he's talking to his constituents, not you. He's saying the silent part out loud. But there's nothing stopping you from listening. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is all completely arbitrary. Just in case you're wondering. It's why &quot;the market&quot; can be booming in a depression. It's arbitrary and an illusion. But it does for now at least translate into living comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>YouTube TV does something smart that all TV services should do. They have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt;. So you can go there and edit your preferences, menus, program your DVR, whatever. Roku should do that too, as should &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/02/211604.html?title=hboMaxIsAHistoricMess&quot;&gt;HBO Mess&lt;/a&gt;, or the arcane UI of LG-land. Set up your watch list. Integrate with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;! (i.e. have an API). Connect your world to mine. It's amazing how much of the design of the LG television assumes their TV is the center of our world. It's for watching. Not controlling. Relaxing, meditating, self-medicating with boredom. Not a place where you get big ideas, and if you do it's a lost cause because the UI tools are limited to what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1475971-REG/lg_an_mr19ba_magic_remote_control_with.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6zq6C-7XppTkISht-dKLTIKU4-C25MtD4GvWbqQurqJkDVJ8RRRUOhoCRH4QAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/a&gt; can do.</description>

I really should write a book with some of these projects and the philosophy behind them.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/#a201216p17&quot;&gt;Substack unveils&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href=&quot;http://reader.substack.com/&quot;&gt;RSS reader&lt;/a&gt;. A few comments, off the top of my head. 1. They had to do something like this to compete with Medium who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/13-ways-of-looking-at-medium-the-new-bloggingsharingdiscovery-platform-from-ev-and-obvious/&quot;&gt;sells discovery&lt;/a&gt; as their big thing. 2. It's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; that they built on a standard, RSS, instead of creating a closed system. 3. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/16/subscribeScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rssNightly.xml&quot;&gt;nightly email feed&lt;/a&gt; in Substack's reader. I checked, it works. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

They had to do something like this to compete with Medium who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2012/08/13-ways-of-looking-at-medium-the-new-bloggingsharingdiscovery-platform-from-ev-and-obvious/&quot;&gt;sells discovery&lt;/a&gt; as their big thing. 2. It's &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; that they built on a standard, RSS, instead of creating a closed system. 3. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/16/subscribeScreenshot.png&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rssNightly.xml&quot;&gt;nightly email feed&lt;/a&gt; in Substack's reader.

			<description>The key point that the Democrats keep missing is that we want to do more. We will give you money and we will vote, but that's not all we can do. Each of has special talents, abilities. Some of us have more time to give than others. But almost to a person, we want to be part of this, not spectators. Trump kind of got that, with his rallies. He didn't condescend. He included them in his speeches. Talked to them like humans. This stuff isn't hard, you have have to try to see things differently. We're not just dollars and votes.</description>

			<description>I'd like to hear Biden say, when asked if the US can get rid of the virus, hell yeah we can. This is what we're &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; at.

The nice thing is how the mom and her three daughters have open affection for each other, it's their baseline. They get pissed off, mostly the kids with the mom, but they quickly get back to hugging and being motherly to each other, across generations. It's sweet. Nothing at all even remotely like the environment I grew up in btw, just sayin. Anyway, I'd kind of like to see Donald Trump as a guest on the show. They would listen to his sad stories, and try to help him. I think there could be some good jokes in there.</description>

			<description>I used to put Donald Trump's image in the right margin of this blog quite frequently, but I've stopped. He's a vampire we've managed to lock in a crypt, and I worry that just showing his image here might wake him up. He's now got the smell of loser on him, like an old version of Sarah Palin. She was pretty charismatic too, in her day. And about as talented as the lame duck. Better to let him fade away. Think of him as a dead relative. Maybe he was an asshole, it's hard to remember, it's been so long.</description>

That happened yesterday. I was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;my new TV&lt;/a&gt; and all of a sudden there's a paragraph about how screwed up journalism is. And then there was a post that I thought I had deleted and didn't. Oy! That was pretty disturbing. I left it there, but edited it a bit so it made more sense. Yesterday was a good day in general, but a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; day on the blog. Anyway, I've corrected it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html&quot;&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html&quot;&gt;Ben Smith explains&lt;/a&gt; why it's bad that Apple is now a media company. He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html&quot;&gt;biggest media buyouts&lt;/a&gt; in history (at the time). I wanted to know when he/she was going to write about it. Never. That opened my eyes to something I should have been able to see much earlier. We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us. Yet they feel transparent to us, the mere conveyors of information, or so they would have you believe. We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory&quot;&gt;triangulation&lt;/a&gt; here. A source of news that is &lt;i&gt;totally disconnected&lt;/i&gt; from the media industry.</description>

			<description>BTW, a disclaimer. Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt;, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story.

			<source:outline text="BTW, a disclaimer. Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt;, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story. And Apple, btw is the perfect example of a tech company that should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; have a say in what stories get told." created="Mon, 14 Dec 2020 15:05:09 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html#a150509"/>

The user had a vision, but didn't know how to explain it. It sounded to me like there was something there, so I started prototyping ideas I thought might be what he was saying until it clicked.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1338029694952869893&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; for podcasting was everyone who wanted to do a radio show could, without having to submit to corporate judgement. Almost 20 years later, it has, and still does. The web has none of the limits of broadcast. Simple idea. That it worked, that’s kind of a miracle. If you’re doing a podcast now, just know someone believed in you a long time ago.</description>

			<title>My new TV</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new TV made by LG.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their user interface is a classic corporate historic disaster mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a piece of shit. In every way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The picture is very nice though. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The software does all kinds of stuff I don't want it to do, automatically, like starting selecting programs for me to watch when I'm trying desperately to figure out how to tell it to show me the programs I'm trying to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing about it is there aren't many things a person watching a TV wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to choose between: Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube TV and YouTube. Inside each site I already know their UIs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I need to go to settings, to change options for video, sound, captioning, turn off annoyances I don't want. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't want to turn my life over to you by accepting legal agreements for the ability to do that, btw.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This TV has Alexa built in, I thought maybe I could use that to control the TV, but no, it's used to control everything but the TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Shovelware. That's what this thing is filled with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paid $2000 plus tax for this, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the TCL/Roku combo is very good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a Roku stick which I have hooked into the TV and I can get there, but I'm not convinced that the apps in there have full access to the high resolution display. Who knows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT and Hillary's Emails</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The further we slide down the slope remember that it required some grease and a push from the great NYT which still has not accepted their responsibility for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/14/butheremails.png&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails story&lt;/a&gt; that was so pivotal in 2016. I mistakenly thought we were witnessing journalism's self-awareness and shame when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/14/nytheadline.png&quot;&gt;this headline&lt;/a&gt;. But no, they weren't accepting blame, they were blaming you and me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend writes: &quot;Why does the blame lie with NYT?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Good question.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They were fed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillary's Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; story by a conservative dirty trickster, and they went with it, made it a campaign, based on either cynicism or ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It hinges on whether the people at the NYT understood what email servers are, and have some basic idea of how they work and what they do. If they didn't know then it was ignorance. If they did know, then it was cynicism that basically their readers would have no idea and would trust them when they said &lt;i&gt;this is a big story&lt;/i&gt; by repeatedly putting it on page one.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yet the things they said amounted to WTF -- how is this relevant. They never explained. And of course we now understand that there was nothing there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't doubt that HRC would have been president for the last four years if they had done their job honestly and competently. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The NYT's impact was at least that of Facebook. So when they blame Facebook they should have just as many column-inches about how the NYT screwed us in 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
