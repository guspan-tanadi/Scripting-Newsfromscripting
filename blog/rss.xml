			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/frontier/nodeEditorExample.opml&quot;&gt;A new doc&lt;/a&gt; explains, through an example, how my Frontier-based code-writing system for JavaScript works. I started this suite about seven years ago, and have been using it ever since. It allows me to edit my code in an outliner, and use Frontier's scripting ability to distribute the results to S3, GitHub, NPM and pretty much anywhere else I want.</description>

			<description>The news business model is the worst. Every day I see articles I'd pay to read from publications I would not subscribe to. They're leaving so much money on the table, and at the same time want us to know how much money it costs to make news. We need to blow this whole sad system up. It somehow has retained all its stupidity through Trump's first term, and most voters still don't know this election is about autocracy. How can we depend on this idiotic elitist superior ridiculous industry to save our asses. Yet they totally control discourse in our political system. End of op-ed.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I put out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/29.html#a210605&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; for programs to binge. I got an overwhelming response. But nothing obvious emerged. Some were programs I had already tried, but didn't get far enough into to rate in my BingeWorthy &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;. Others were comedies, and I'm just not into them now. Examples of shows I didn't have the energy to watch recently: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fschitts-creek&quot;&gt;Schitt's Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-good-place&quot;&gt;The Good Place&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are very good for what they are, but I'm just not in the mood now. I'm thinking I may just re-watch something from the past that I liked and think might be worth a second look. In the meantime, the lists, one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1321921170938204167&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/192&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; are there for everyone to reference. I also want to add a recommendation algorithm to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet.</description>

			<title>News business models, again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Another thought re news business models.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know I can still buy a single issue of say The New Yorker at an airport newsstand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why not offer the same product on the web. Pure profit. No manufacturing or distribution cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Important: I can buy w/o credit card, no commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: On the web, not a Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I don't mind paying &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; a credit card, but I don't want to give the card to the news org.  Use Venmo or Paypal, for example. Or Apple or Google's wallet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Help -- I need something to bingewatch. I want something interesting, that will occupy my mind, and help me escape from reality for a bit. Dark is okay, but not too dark. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;list of stuff&lt;/a&gt; I've already watched.

			<title>Art tells a story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Art from Burning Man.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Anderson Morris &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharon.a.morris.5/posts/10158709734784696&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;A sculpture of two adults after a disagreement, sitting with their backs to each other. Yet, the inner child in both of them simply wants to connect. Age has many beautiful gifts but one we could live without is the pride and resentment we hold onto when we have conflicts with others. The forgiving, free spirit of children is our true nature. Remember this when you feel stubborn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't agree. Sometimes the right thing to do is to set pride to the side and renew the friendship. The child always wants to, but the adult also has a valid and important, not foolish, contribution to make -- safety. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The child can have the impulse to connect unconditionally, because there is an adult to put the brakes on if there is real danger. The child can't exist without the adult. When we are children, the adult must be external. Later in life we will be both the child and the adult.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The child, as the sculpture illustrates, wants to connect, but the adult isn't ready. It's possible that they've reconciled many times, and every time the same thing happens. That's also a pattern of humanity. So the adult is constrained by memory. The adult might narrate: &quot;I remember this person hurt me the last time I trusted them. Every time I trusted them. So as much as the child wants to reconcile, I can't. At some point it's wrong to trust.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's even more to the story. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are billions of people on the planet, we can't be friends with everyone, although, again, the child would like to -- the adult knows there isn't enough time. So you have to choose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also it could be that there are reasons you can't be close to this person. There's always disappointment and regret in life, and it's not wrong, it just is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally one more &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/29/charleyBrownFootball.png&quot;&gt;work of art&lt;/a&gt; on this topic. Charlie's inner child wants to believe this time Lucy will let him kick the ball. We hope by now he's figured out it's never going to happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I love that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen’s&lt;/a&gt; VC firm is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mondaynote.com/inside-a16zs-media-operations-1f5235881f6d&quot;&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; so much on &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/podcasts/&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;. We all benefited from his work in booting the open web. Happy to have been able to reciprocate. That’s the ethos of open networks.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/27.html#a200053&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the vote for the new library building in Woodstock. I voted yes. Michael Hunt, who also reads this blog, and emailed me about the vote a couple of days ago, posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/iwrDgwUSCco&quot;&gt;video summary&lt;/a&gt; of the case for voting yes. It's a much better argument than I could make, so I thought it belonged here.</description>

			<description>If Trump voters were getting real news, they'd know that Trump leaving his rally-goers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/hundreds-trump-supporters-stuck-freezing-cold-omaha-airfield-after-rally-n1245065&quot;&gt;stranded&lt;/a&gt; in the cold is par for the course for Trump. Ask the people of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/elections/2020/10/02/they-fled-hurricane-maria-now-theyre-fighting-to-defeat-trump/&quot;&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. Ask the governor of any state that was experiencing a surge of Covid cases in the spring. Trump isn't actually a business person or a president. He loves to give rallies, he's a comedian, a performer, but you don't matter to him. You aren't even a thing. If you want a real government, you have to vote for Biden.</description>

			<title>&quot;Getting it&quot; vs respect</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thejeffreymarsh/status/1321175950483169284&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; I saw on Twitter this morning really grabbed me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thejeffreymarsh&quot;&gt;They&lt;/a&gt; are right, first comes respect, then comes getting it. Now I'm going to add my two cents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Respect isn't something you earn, respect is the default. Respect is listening to who the person really is, versus the story you've projected on them. Listen to the words they say. And accept that it is their point of view. It isn't right or wrong, it isn't something that can be argued over. This is what the person you're listening to wants to say. That's all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I understand this idea really well myself because I've always been projected on. I was raised by parents who judged me by their impression of who I was. So I was always all twisted up thinking about how they would interpret something I did, and how I would avoid being punished. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world does it too, sometimes very openly. I spoke at a conference in 2019 where I was heckled as being a person of privilege. The people probably had never even read anything I'd written, even that doesn't tell you enough to judge me. Why was it so hard for them to listen? I don't know. But they were very insistent that I was not to be listened to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So Jeffrey Marsh, in the video, speaks for me. amd very likely you. It isn't worse or better for anyone. Either people try to change who you are or they don't. The best friends are the ones who give you a chance to be different from their expectations of you. Jeffrey says something we all probably would like to say, and expresses it in a way that some people can actually hear. And that's a service to everyone who just wants to be heard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There was one question on the local Woodstock town ballot, whether to fund a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.woodstock.org/planning/&quot;&gt;new library building&lt;/a&gt;. I voted &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/10/23/letter-vote-yes-on-woodstock-library-bond-issue/&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very hot local issue. I see signs all over town on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudsonvalleyone.com/2020/10/23/letter-vote-no-on-woodstock-library-bond-issue/&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;. I read the posts in the local Facebook groups. And while I'm new here, I am a taxpayer, and I will have to pay more property taxes to support the new library.  Here's why I voted yes. If the librarians want a new library, give it to them. They know what the town needs. They are the most selfless, idealistic people, by profession. Librarians &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/07/23/125635.html#a125814&quot;&gt;helped me&lt;/a&gt; a lot when I was a kid. I think this is what taxes are for. Funding libraries is directly related to the quality of life in a town.</description>

			<title>We must be worse than the Repubs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First a story... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I once lived on a narrow road, so narrow there was barely room for two cars. When approaching an oncoming car on this narrow lane, at first, when I was a newbie to the neighborhood, I’d do the neighborly thing and move to the right to make room. Always, the other car wouldn’t budge, so I’d have to pull off the road and slow to a stop. I found this frustrating of course, an example of selfish, Republican-like behavior.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I altered my procedure. When I saw a car approaching, I would still move off the to right, but if they didn't mirror my move, I'd veer directly into their path. This makes my car look bigger, and more of a threat to them. No need to honk my horn. The action is enough. Immediately, the other car &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; moves to the side, and I then move to my side, and we pass each other, both fully on the road, and going at normal speed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I assume these are otherwise good people who are selfish, like most people are, and will see your offer to get out of their way as weakness, and they'll just plow through you. Like Republicans. If you show you are selfish too, they'll negotiate for a win-win. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Soooo, this is where we are. The Repubs walk all over the Dems. But if you love America, you have to vote Democratic, because the Repubs are crazy fascists. We have to teach the Dems how to be hardass motherfuckers, and insist that they have a head-on collision with the Repubs so they respect them, and in doing so, respect us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are right now poised to lose our system of government. Okay, we accept that. Let's go all the way. The Supreme Court is already tainted. Let's just go ahead and call them illegitimate. The line was crossed not with the new justice but with Kavanaugh. The moment he &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2018/10/02/kavanaughExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;spouted&lt;/a&gt; Clinton conspiracy theories in his confirmation hearing was the moment I realized the enemy isn't just in the Oval Office, but in the Supreme Court too. We need to either get Kavanaugh and his ilk off the Court, to re-establish its legitimacy, or so dilute their vote as to make them irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say oh if you pack the court, the Repubs will do the same when they take power again. Fine. So we'll stack the court for them too. Instead of just adding four or six new justices, let's add &lt;i&gt;1000&lt;/i&gt;. All of them card-carrying members of the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party. The Repubs will ignore their decisions when they're in power, and the Dems will ignore the current 6-3 court which, I would like to add, in no way represents the people of the United States. We don't like Citizens United, we want the Voting Rights Act back in force (obviously) and we want the three justices appointed by the criminal traitor Trump removed immediately, or else we'll add &lt;i&gt;100000&lt;/i&gt; new justices, starting right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you don't like crazy, dear Republicans, then stop being crazy. And fuck off, we don't give a shit what you think. We love your tears. When you cry we are happy. Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="I once lived on a narrow road, so narrow there was barely room for two cars. When approaching an oncoming car on this narrow lane, at first, when I was a newbie to the neighborhood, I’d do the neighborly thing and move to the right to make room. Always, the other car wouldn’t budge, so I’d have to pull off the road and slow to a stop. I found this frustrating of course, an example of selfish, Republican-like behavior." created="Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:02:09 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160209"/>
					<source:outline text="Then I altered my procedure. When I saw a car approaching, I would still move off the to right, but if they didn't mirror my move, I'd veer directly into their path. This makes my car look bigger, and more of a threat to them. No need to honk my horn. The action is enough. Immediately, the other car &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; moves to the side, and I then move to my side, and we pass each other, both fully on the road, and going at normal speed." created="Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:03:27 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs#a160327"/>

Now the &lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt; part has coincided with it being a lot harder to use, virtually impossible if you use the popular Roku platform. At least for me. Looks like an epic mistake. At a time when the market is overloaded with lots of big brands (Disney, Apple etc) trying to diversity into a market already dominated by HBO, it's a really curious time for them to knock out their own legs.</description>

			<title>Using structure in outlines</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A friend is starting to use the outliner to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html&quot;&gt;narrate his work&lt;/a&gt;. He writes about an &quot;impenetrable wall of text.&quot; I wrote up some tips, and of course felt they should be public. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the impenetrable wall of text -- try collapsing things, where the detail isn't of immediate concern, so you can see the structure. It would help me too as a reader, to see the old stuff collapsed, and be able to expand it as I need to. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also hoist and dehoist are there to help manage complexity. You can hoist a section, by placing the cursor on a head with subs, and click on the pushpin icon in the left margin. It'll be the one that's enabled. Then when you want to return, click the other one. It's like a stack (it actually is a stack, of course).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a bookshelf of notebooks. You don't have every notebook open to all pages at the same time. It doesn't even make sense. You'd go crazy trying to find something. Same idea here. You've got tools to manage clutter, they take time to learn to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what my blog outline looks like as I'm writing today's notes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I posted a very short question on Facebook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1361834694023932&quot;&gt;Do you know anyone like Trump? &lt;/a&gt;I asked because I do. I grew up in Queens, a couple of miles from where Trump grew up, only ten years after. So there were lots of Trump-like people in my area. I'm constantly reminded, by something Trump does, of someone I knew in childhood. Anyway, after a dozen or so predictable responses, a former Apple exec, one who did a very good thing for my troubled company back in 1986, said yes he's had golfed with Trump, voted for him in 2016, and was going to vote for him in 2020. He lives in California, so his vote is symbolic, as is mine (I live in NY). It was jarring. No debate has followed, thankfully, and I hope it doesn't. I'm just going to leave it there.</description>

			<description>A couple of hours later, the thread is still peaceful. Thankfully. My friend from the past refers to Trump as a businessman, which causes me to write this screed, which I did not add to the thread. I was curious to know, how does this businessman see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1320026106494332928&quot;&gt;retired people packed&lt;/a&gt; into his audience, no distancing, no masks. Are they his customers? His team? His employees? Competitors? Serfs? Prisoners? Slaves? What kind of animal do you treat the way Trump is treating these people? To Trump are they even people?</description>

			<title>Will we undo Trump?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't want to jinx things, but when Biden takes office I assume the FBI will fully investigate what really happened in the 2016 election, without any interference from political appointees. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new Attorney General will release the reports Barr wouldn't let us see. I assume that's going to happen too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What if we determine that the election was a crime. That the Trump campaign didn't just collude with Russia, it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Russia. Recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbur.org/npr/903512647/senate-report-former-trump-aide-paul-manafort-shared-campaign-info-with-russia&quot;&gt;revelations&lt;/a&gt; about Manafort say that pretty clearly. Everyone was looking for collusion, but it was actually much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were an occupied country for four years. Should we allow everything Trump did in those four years to stand? Or do we remove the three Supreme Court justices he nominated, tear up all his executive orders, remove all the regulations passed by his agencies. Undo anything that can be reasonably undone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maybe there should be real debates on TV every week between leaders on issues that Congress is going to vote on. And a way of measuring public opinion. No personal attacks allowed. Strict control via Mute button. This week the debate would be about the merits of approving a new radical Supreme Court justice in the middle of an election when everyone's attention is focused elsewhere. Some actions are so important they deserve everyone's focus.</description>

			<description>I am so exhausted from US politics, this state going back to the summer of 2016. I made it through about 15 minutes of last night's debate before I couldn't stand it. All it took was one gaffe from Biden to shred all hope of a reprieve from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22shitshow%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;shitshow&lt;/a&gt;. Then I had a thought, what if Amazon released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-delivery-of-prodigious-bribe-to-american-regime-for-make-benefit-once-glo&quot;&gt;new Borat movie&lt;/a&gt; a few hours early? Wouldn't that be great. So I looked. And they had! So I watched the first half, returned to the debate, which still was not over, and went back and watched a bit more, and returned to the debate just in time to hear the wrapup. Then I listened to Maddow's review of Trump's lies about Covid (the part  I had heard) and I felt better so I went to bed. Only to wake up this morning and find that the feeling if utter misery was even worse. The election is 11 days from now.</description>
