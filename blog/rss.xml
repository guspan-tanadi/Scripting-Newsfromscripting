			<description>Trump is leading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Cops&quot;&gt;Keystone Cops&lt;/a&gt; version of a military coup. Yesterday's speech was clearly a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwUUUqgfu-E&quot;&gt;KK&lt;/a&gt; version of a coverup. All the tracks lead back to him, as usual he didn't even try to hide them. God help us if he were even slightly more competent and slightly less narcissistic.</description>

			<description>My big objection with the way journalists talk about Facebook is that it's so naive. The questions are much much much more complicated. Shutting off Facebook, which seems to be what journalism wants, would be as stupidly disruptive as turning off Wikipedia, or even the phone network -- or for that matter, all the daily newspapers. Facebook is &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; important for information flow in our society. It's not a joke. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/thursday-7-january-2021/32578/&quot;&gt;excellent rant&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/08/naughton.png&quot;&gt;reporters had no idea&lt;/a&gt; how to cover something like the riot in DC on Wednesday. Well they don't know how to cover Facebook either. Yes it is used for some awful purposes, so is everything. We have a much bigger job to do today. One thing journalists could do to help is being more outgoing, inquisitive, and respond to direct statements like this one. We need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Sidebars to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;JN&lt;/a&gt;: 1. I wish your blog had permalinks so I could point to individual items. 2. I like strong language. The people who run these platforms are not elected, it's true. Neither are the other gatekeepers, and it would suck, imho, if they were. When someone screams fire in a crowded movie theater, as Trump is doing, it's up to the management to do something about it. Nothing wrong with that. I like the title &quot;creeps&quot; -- it fits, because like the management of Exxon, the people who run Facebook spoil the resource they monetize, in this case the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/16/inDefenseOfTheOpenWeb.html&quot;&gt;open web&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lasorda&quot;&gt;Tommy Lasorda&lt;/a&gt; is gone. 93 years old. A good run. He was manager of the Dodgers back before I hated them. But I can't say I ever loved them. I had an experience at the World Series vs the Oakland A's where we scalped tickets that turned out to be in the Dodger's wives section. They tried to have us removed, because we were very vocally advocating for the A's. Of course, this was at the Oakland Coliseum. They argued with the cops that we would have been ejected at Dodgers Stadium. You see that's the problem with baseball these days. Decorum. It was never meant to be a respectful sport, imho. Anyway, I digress. Lasorda was a famous manager of a winning team &quot;back in the day.&quot; Sigh. We're all getting old and soon we'll be dead. That's what it all means. Oh la.</description>

			<description>Another problem I have with the Dodgers is that my parents were Dodgers fans, back when they were in Brooklyn, and known as Da Bums. The name turns out to have fit, because one day they up and left Brooklyn. I understand the problem wasn't of their making, they were targeted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-robert-moses-is-to-blame-for-losing-the-brooklyn-dodgers-to-la&quot;&gt;Robert Moses&lt;/a&gt; to be the team for his new stadium which turned out to be the stadium the Mets played in. And our family, before I was really aware of these things, switched allegiance to the Mets, who were called The Amazins, which was of course sarcastic. Which is fine, because as I said -- baseball is not a respectful sport. Even when it comes to your home team. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Twitter should also disconnect Trump. This is hard for me to advocate, as one of the first bloggers and podcasters, I believe, at my core, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;direct communication&lt;/a&gt;. But this has gone far enough. Someone said the Constitution is not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact&quot;&gt;suicide pact&lt;/a&gt;. Neither is blogging.</description>

			<description>Don't be a useful idiot. Don't RT the fascists. That's why they stay on Twitter, to outrage you and your followers. If you weren't helping them, they'd stay on their own private social net. What's ironic is that some of the worst offenders are reporters whose pubs blame Facebook for the garbage news. Their own reporters are distributing the same stuff on Twitter.</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few ideas early in the day...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We really need to get Trump out of the White House. Yesterday, as the riot was developing, I posted on Twitter that this coup could be successful. They will try again. And remember there are 50 state capitals in the US. Any of them could be next. I hope they're preparing for it. Esp the swing states. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment? How fast could it happen? The Dems certainly have enough votes to impeach. Could they must 51 votes in the Senate to have a real trial? Could they somehow get 66 votes to convict? It may end up being symbolic, but censorship is not enough. Trump being the first president to be removed from office through impeachment would be the warning we needed at the beginning of 2020. It could give the Republican senators another chance to do the right thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Communication. We need much better communication among all the American people. It's no longer acceptable that there be several versions of the truth. Radio Free America. It has to be less wish-washy and repetitive than Wolf Blitzer or as one-sided as Maddow. The NYT isn't it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Law enforcement. We have a big problem with the police, a lot of them are fascists, and support Trump. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Could they somehow get 66 votes to convict? It may end up being symbolic, but censorship is not enough. Trump being the first president to be removed from office through impeachment would be the warning we needed at the beginning of 2020.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/29/humansAreCrazy.html&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;An amazing scene in a Frontline episode in the Iraqi parliament while Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq. It was time for a purge. Saddam had decided to execute the whole legislature. The doors were locked and they started taking out people one by one and shooting them. Saddam, sadist that he was, videotaped it. So you could see what these guys were doing as they figured out, one by one, what was happening. So what did the condemned legislators do while waiting to be shot? They gave speeches, denouncing each other as the real enemy of the state, and proclaiming their love for Saddam, the best friend he ever had. Didn't work, they were all killed.&quot; They used to have video on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/&quot;&gt;PBS site&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a victim of the deprecation of Flash.

Amazing how quickly the political action moved from Georgia to DC. But all this Trump michegas is masking the big story -- the pandemic is digging in with increased virality all over the world, but especially in the US. With power as it's currently configured, we finally have a chance to help ourselves. But only barely.</description>

			<description>I had a conversation with a friend yesterday about why I go for connecting big things to other big things. It's not for money or fame, it's about power -- for the users of the open web. Which is what got me back into software development with a passion in the early 90s. I had already lived through a couple of generations of wide open &quot;blue sky&quot; that was later foreclosed on by the bankers. I felt that the technology of the web, as with the personal computer before it, could be used to enhance communication, and that could be used to solve problems, the ones we're still grappling with today. That's why it's not enough to make cool software, though I admit I love doing that -- it's for the power it gives to people to solve our problems. I still believe in that, as I did when I first got into software development in the 1970s.</description>

Never mind fancy tech, support the features the web has had since inception. Linking, first and foremost, then simple styling, titles for posts and podcasting. Then take a vacation and kick back.

			<title>What Frontier is about</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Brichter&quot;&gt;Loren Brichter&lt;/a&gt;, an accomplished developer, wrote to me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorenb/status/1345899361700630529&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I was a generation late to the party, is there and good reading/watching on what Frontier was all about?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first thought was -- he's not too late. Frontier is still in use, I'm guessing mostly on the Mac, but there is also a Windows version. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use it myself to write my JavaScript code. And I use all the ideas in Frontier, and hope one day to have many of the core ideas available in JavaScript-land. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so now here's a list of things you can look at and listen to, to get an idea of what makes Frontier good, different, and the ideas in Frontier relevant for future development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'd start with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/01.html#a204659&quot;&gt;45-minute podcast in 2020&lt;/a&gt; -- an oral history of how Frontier came to be. I know a few people for whom that story made the lights go on. I apologize for the shitty production -- I'm famous for not editing my podcasts. I think of it as voicemail. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the Frontier environment are online. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the verb set are also online. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tedchoward/Frontier/releases&quot;&gt;codebase&lt;/a&gt; is being maintained by Ted Howard. It's licensed under the GPL. (It's called the OPML Editor, but it really is just a distribution of Frontier. The result of some early disharmony when Frontier was initially released as open source in 2004.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are several levels to think about Frontier. At the base level, it's an outliner, object database, Algol-like language and its interpreter and verb set all &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; integrated. The language for example is designed to be edited in an outliner. The outliner is scriptable by the language. The database is the memory space for the language, so you don't have to get data and save data, your code runs in the context of the data. You can write scripts to write scripts and they're stored in the database. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At the next level up, it's applications, that again -- since they live in the same data space can share data, easily. We were able to build the first web CMS, blogging system, develop syndication for the web, podcasting, etc because Frontier is such a high level system, something that has become much more apparent to me now that I develop in Node and in the browser where you have to do all that yourself for every application. We could build much higher in Frontier, more quickly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's also a system scripting language. That was the original idea. The Mac is great because of the graphic user interface, but I was originally a Unix programmer, and missed the ability to script things in the OS. I knew the Mac OS was very capable, even if it was mostly hidden. We went further than that, since I came from app development on the Mac, I could see that with not very much new tech, we could wire up the apps so they could be combined by scripts, just like the OS. This all worked beautifully, we got support from lots of apps, including page layout, databases, web browsers. And later we added TCP verbs to Frontier, so it becamse in addition to all the other things it was, a hub for web development.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My dream is to have a Linux port of Frontier. It's the only thing that keeps me on the Mac these days. All my servers run Ubuntu. Plainly put, products like Frontier that give users so much power are not really consistent with Apple's view of the world, but are very much consistent with Linux's. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But just as important, I want to bring the ideas of Frontier to the Node/browser world. And we're getting there. Slowly. We have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt;, and are working on an easy scripting language based entirely on JavaScript, for one-off things that are imho too much work in asynchronous JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Plainly put, products like Frontier that give users so much power are not really consistent with Apple's view of the world, but are very much consistent with Linux's." created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:11:01 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/04/140651.html?title=whatFrontierIsAbout#a141101"/>

			<description>I'm glad we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3hrN0cP58Y&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; of Trump trying to bully the Georgia secretary of state. As this is going on the country is botching the administration of the vaccine. And the states and cities are running out of money. And his &quot;supporters&quot; think this situation is fine. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ”¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I wish the Washington Post would open source the audio. Upload it somewhere. The full conversation, not excerpts. This should be on the record, for all to hear, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html?fbclid=IwAR35bsuw5uv5HvLF7QFG7-1UF6UA2TPj3f5uV9yNuQyNwkbh67dy0RnInGs&quot;&gt;behind a paywall&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not saying they should or have to, but this is history. We should get it all, right now. Everyone should hear it.</description>

			<description>I said something in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/02/143005.html?title=podcastsPleaseGetToThePoint&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; about podcasting that caused some understandable confusion. Here's what I said. &quot;There are rules about this medium.&quot; I think that's true, not one rule for everyone at all times, but genres and practices, conventions. Any art has them, and then every artist breaks them. That's part of the art. Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3753122&quot;&gt;only steal from the best&lt;/a&gt; -- another &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt;. Every artist steals. If there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; for standards-makers, there must also be rules for podcasters, no? I don't claim that what I say are the rules. But there is one rule imho that art must follow, it must respect the observer, as a participant. If your art doesn't do that, I'm probably not going to like it. Doesn't mean I won't come back. Art is weird. If it isn't, it isn't art, imho.</description>

			<description>The Repubs backing Trump should be careful not to break the law. Trump wonâ€™t care, and wonâ€™t have the power to pardon, anyway. I bet heâ€™d enjoy seeing Ted Cruz go to jail. I bet a lot of people would. Seriously, they would be easy scapegoats, everyone could agree they deserve to be punished.</description>
