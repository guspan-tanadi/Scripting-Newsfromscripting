			<description>It's been a while since I looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?everything=true&quot;&gt;everything timeline&lt;/a&gt; in FeedLand. In the interim, a bunch of people have subscribed to Bluesky feeds, and they are the most active, and also support rssCloud (!) so the list is skewed toward Bluesky posts from people who are on now.</description>

As president he ruled like an autocrat, with contempt for the most American idea, that we pick our own leaders. So the jury will be asked to decide if he should go to jail for being an autocratic president. In other words, will the system validate itself. It's like asking a program to decide if it's functioning correctly. If the validator works, it should reject any argument that Trump makes. Sorry, you're going to jail because you tried to rob us of our right as citizens to replace you with Joe Biden. It's pure, brilliant, gets right to the heart of the matter. Is our system of voting real, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; we choose the president, or does our system crumble when it's violated by its top official. Finally we're asking the right question, making the correct accusation. And if it's decided the way it should obviously be decided our country says no to this bullshit, no matter what a bunch of our fellow citizens want. We had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution&quot;&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of the king.</description>

			<description>What made the news worth watching tonight was that finally the most important question was asked -- will our system defend itself? Finally, we've gotten around to insisting that this question be answered. And a jury of Americans will make the decision. How perfectly American.</description>

Maybe the Mets will once again be the Mets, in the spirit of Casey Stengel, Cleon Jones, Tom Seaver, Tug McGraw, Mookie Wilson and Ed Kranepool and far too many soulful players to mention in this small space.</description>

Well the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/how-jason-aldeans-small-town-became-a-rightwing-anthem/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; I tried was exactly as depraved, incompetent and disgusting as the NYT podcast. Do we disapprove of Jason Aldean's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; because we want to deprive him of his right to free speech as the podcast says over and over. Please. We object to it because it's an expression by white people of their desire to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching&quot;&gt;lynch&lt;/a&gt; black people, like they used to do when America was Great, as the slogan goes. They want to make it Great Again. Specifically, so you could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/26/lynchings-memorial-us-south-montgomery-alabama&quot;&gt;lynch&lt;/a&gt; blacks, again, when you don't like the way they look at you or your sister or when they have land you want to buy and don't want to pay a fair price for, or when a rich white guy made you feel like shit and you wanted to prove there were people &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/26/lynchings-memorial-us-south-montgomery-alabama&quot;&gt;terrorize&lt;/a&gt;. When a black life was worth nothing. And btw, they're not just coming for people of color and gays and trans people, or to turn women into slaves, they also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution&quot;&gt;Hitler's final solution&lt;/a&gt; for Jews. It's time for one of these pubs to have the guts to say out loud what the actual problem is with the Trumpsters like Aldean. They want to go back to when they could kill anyone with impunity. And btw, it doesn't matter if he &quot;really&quot; believes it or if it's a business model. It makes absolutely no difference. Someone should teach these pitiful spineless so-called reporters how and why to be angry. BTW, I live in a small town so fuck you Jason Aldean.</description>

			<title>I subscribe to the NYT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to the NYT, probably the only newspaper in the US that tries to get away with charging you more for sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read less and less of their stuff, the only reason I keep it is that in some things they are authoritative for me at least, like TV and movie reviews. They'll probably start charging extra for that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I am nauseated by the Daily podcast, used to be a big fan. I don't know what changed, me or them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
