An urban version of Friday Night Lights, which I had been working my way through, loving the first two seasons but the show got pretty bad by the third imho. Season 1 of Swagger is very good. I'm on episode 7. Season 2 starts tomorrow.</description>

			<title>Baseball reality</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Baseball fields looked more intensely green in the 60s in contrast to the black and white TV screens we watched most games on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember how amazing it all looked in full color when I got out of the tunnel at Shea into the full magnificence of the field. I suppose that was a virtual reality experience then, and to this day our computer screens are no competition for the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/22/koosman.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Jerry Koosman at Shea Stadium, in the 60s, in full color.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Having a settled spec is something RSS has needed for a long time. The purpose of this work is to help it become a unchanging thing, to foster growth in the market that is developing around it, and to clear the path for innovation in new syndication formats. Therefore, the RSS spec is, for all practical purposes, frozen at version 2.0.1. We anticipate possible 2.0.2 or 2.0.3 versions, etc. only for the purpose of clarifying the specification, not for adding new features to the format. Subsequent work should happen in modules, using namespaces, and in completely new syndication formats, with new names.&quot;</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;It worked.&lt;/i&gt; RSS 2.0 has stood the test of time. Lots of innovation has taken place in the namespaces, and the core has stayed intact. There were a lot of people who wanted to control and own RSS when I wrote that. If it hadn't been frozen they'd still be fighting over the basics. We've made a lot with RSS and we're going to make a lot more. It'll be important in the evolution of social media, podcasting, blogging and more. This is what the roadmap says. It worked and continues to work.</description>

			<title>Write specs for humans</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I like to write specs for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho too many specs are organized the way a computer would want them, the way software is organized. Establish basic vocabulary in layers then and assume the human reader will know how to put the pieces together to do things.

			<title>God is an ice cream truck</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a baby in a carriage, my mother would get an ice cream treat and share it with me. I thought ice cream was pure god food. I know this because when I see a picture of an old time Good Humor ice cream truck, my most primitive consciousness experiences it as a miracle that's about to happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My inner-infant delights, pure ecstasy, immortality! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;100 percent unadulterated love. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/20/goodHumorIceCreamTruck.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;How I felt pure love as an infant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>But here's some good news. There's no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it's probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is &quot;really simple&quot; and the benefit of federation is well known &lt;i&gt;to users.&lt;/i&gt; That's been what's kept it from being pwned by bigco's all these years.</description>

			<description>Also it'll be interesting to see how much of ActivityPub Facebook supports in their product. When Google Reader came out for RSS their trick was to break RSS by not supporting a key feature. This did huge damage that we're still dealing with long after Google is gone.</description>

			<title>The old weblogs.com feeling</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is we can all look at each other's feed lists to get ideas about what to subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was playing with ideas, looking at a bunch of different people's collections, and I saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1&quot;&gt;John Naughton's feed list&lt;/a&gt; a reminder of a centerpiece of the early blogging world, weblogs.com. You could quickly see which blogs had updated recently so you knew there was a reason to go there. It was the beginning of what eventually became Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over time as more blogs came online, it got diluted, we had to come up with something better and luckily &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; came along, and without much thought we switched over to that and weblogs.com fell into disuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20021123211136/http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;archive.org snapshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/18/weblogsComScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of weblogs.com from November 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1&quot;&gt;Naughton's list&lt;/a&gt; I had the old weblogs.com feeling! These are all people I'm interested in, but I don't have them in their own category anywhere, so I never see it like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With a bit of coordination it would be pretty cool to have a FeedLand page that tracked a bunch more Old School bloggers who are still blogging, or give ones who aren't a reason to restart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/18/feedlistscreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Partial screen shot of Naughton's list shortly after this item was posted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm doing more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caving#:~:text=This%20group%20referred%20to%20themselves,exploring%20caves%20in%20US%20English.&quot;&gt;spelunking&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt;-land. Found a goldmine of past history in a site that I had decommissioned for some reason, &lt;a href=&quot;http://listings.opml.org/&quot;&gt;listings.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;. So now it's back on the web and hopefully Google et al will index it soon. It'd be great to get this kind of stuff into an AI database. I hope products are coming soon to help us do this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Sell Reddit to its users?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reddit as a business is going down a user-hostile path. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I had this idea, I wonder if a compromise is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They want to do an IPO. Why not sell it to the users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A tech company run for the benefit of its users. What an idea! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a site that the users should own it's Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reddit could reboot as a non-profit or public benefit corp. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run intelligently to keep costs to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get help from a foundation perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the things I did this morning was carefully read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API docs&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in 2002. This became a widely supported standard almost instantly on publication. There was a demand for it. At that time, being compatible at an API level was a competitive issue for blogging software. A must-have feature.</description>

			<description>Did you wonder why there were no Jan 6 crowds at either of Trump’s arraignments? Isn’t it obvious? Any would-be insurrectionists saw the Jan 6 folks get tried, convicted and put in jail. That makes the whole thing real. Americans of 2023 are soft. We’re the ones who got tax cuts from Bush while we were at war. We had no draft, no price controls. War was okay as long as we could ignore it. We’d rather have others make the sacrifices for us. We like to own guns to support our fantasy that we’re badasses, but truthfully we’d rather watch the revolution on TV than go to jail, esp for a crybaby snob like Trump.</description>

When you achieve a certain amount of wealth, you are declared a winner. A champion. There's a ceremony where you get a medal and a special kind of credit card that allows you entry to the VIP room wherever you go. In that room you have free drinks, the most comfortable chairs, fantastic snacks, for you and a guest. Everywhere you go people are required to salute you. All the benefits. You eat the best food, sit in first class, and you live in a very nice house or apartment where all your neighbors are also champs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that, sounds great right, but what do you give up? You can't make any more money. That's it. Your earning days are over. You won. Now find something else to do. You can't have more than one house, one car -- no private jets, you can't own sports teams or CNN. You have to live like a human being, not consume more than double what a non-champ consumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like socialism or communism, deal with it. Because when you own 12 homes and fly around in your private jet, and consume hundreds of times more than you can possibly use, you're putting the continued existence, of all of us, in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: You get free guitar lessons too, and a nice guitar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🎸&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My advice on quitting smoking -- get someone to lock you in a room where you can't get a cigarette for a solid week. That's the hardest part of quitting, getting over the physical addiction.</description>

I was stuck trying to figure out how to encode some text in a sticky corner. I had tried the first two methods I usually use, and neither worked. I was about to give up and back out of the feature when I thought to explain the problem to ChatGPT and ask for a suggestion, and it included pragmatic issues like it really mattered to me that I not have to bring another toolkit into the mix. It suggested something I hadn't considered, a third way, and it worked, and I can move on. How do you put a value on that kind of contribution? It's like a programming partner that knows everything basically and is always there to help out and doesn't charge for their time. Pretty amazing.</description>

			<title>For now, small is beautiful</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People are concerned that Bluesky is so small. I'm not, I like that it's small, and I also like that there are no peers yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some part of me thinks the future of social networks is small, that we've seen how unwieldy they can be when they grow too huge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think we have to work on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;cross-platform API&lt;/a&gt; like the one we had with blogging. It didn't take long to create, and it was supported everywhere. WordPress still supports the API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of every social network having their own API is workable if and only if we can put a layer on top of them that makes it possible to communicate with all. It'd be analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite&quot;&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt; and the start of the internet. Peering is everything and then data formats. We have good &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; for that too.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All we're waiting for is people to work together. It doesn't have to be everyone, just people who want to build something bigger than one particular brand of social network.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm doing a Bluesky thread writer and publisher. Here's an example of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bingeworthy.bsky.social/post/3jxy72dbzxy2r&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; it published just now. I had ChatGPT write a story about the many kinds of bread in the world and pushed that out as a thread of nine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/12/threadCenterScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; at the end of business today. This was the first Node.js app I wrote for Twitter back in 2014, it was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/06/twitterLovesLittlePorkChop.html&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you remember. Now it's the first app I wrote for Bluesky. Should have it usable in a day or two, knock wood. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
