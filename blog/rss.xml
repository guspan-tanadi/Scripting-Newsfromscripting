			<description>In 2012, Obama liked to say the Repubs drove our economy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKv-dXHhtMs&quot;&gt;into a ditch&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dems would have to pull it out and dust everything off. This time, if Biden were to tell the honest total truth, the Repubs drove us off the cliff and not just the economy.</description>

			<description>Now is the moment when no incumbent Republican can fool themselves into believing that Trump isn't doing massive harm to America. They can lie, but every one of them without exception understands.</description>

			<title>Miracles happen</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Look at this, the virus gets Israel to cooperate with Arabs, and vice versa. And it gets Texas to stop being crazy like Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hitting this wall can wake people up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a miracle to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I haven’t had any interaction on my Facebook posts in the last week. No comments, no likes, nada. It’s like it just ended. The people are gone, or Facebook algorithm isn’t showing anyone my posts. Meanwhile it’s rock and roll on twitter and on my blog. Later: Well it turns out, I have been posting mostly-private messages on Facebook since May 23. Not sure how it happened but only a few people were seeing them. I just posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1263656047175131&quot;&gt;something public&lt;/a&gt; and it's as if the lights turned back on. Now I'm going back through the last months' posts and changing the privacy setting on them. Whew.</description>

			<description>Driving on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike&quot;&gt;Masspike&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, going west, listening to the audiobook of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;People's History&lt;/a&gt;, when a phone call comes in. Looks like spam so I don't answer. Then the car's audio, coming from my fully updated  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FT5A2LL/A/refurbished-iphone-xs-max-64gb-silver-unlocked&quot;&gt;iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/&quot;&gt;CarPlay&lt;/a&gt; switches over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt; app, and plays an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/podcasts/the-daily/facebook-twitter-black-lives-matter-trump.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;The Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, an episode I didn't want listen to, and there's nothing I can do until I can stop the car and reactivate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/ep/apple&quot;&gt;Audible app&lt;/a&gt;, about 15 miles of driving. To be very clear, it should have resumed the book, which was interrupted, not start a podcast. This is the kind of software lunacy that never gets fixed. Next year they'll revamp the OS of the car, or the phone, or switch the processor, or get rid of iTunes or Cookie Dough or whatever, and more stuff will break, and the process will continue next year and the year after, and it will not have been worth it. At some point some adult will run Apple, someone who can't be bluffed on software, will tell the engineers to shut up and eat your vegetables, you can watch TV when you finish your homework. It's an analogy. You can figure it out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>JavaScript and who made it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glitch/status/1275809005093429249&quot;&gt;Glitch asks&lt;/a&gt; a very interesting question.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you could rename JavaScript what would you name it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk this through.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First what is JavaScript. Let's make a list of things it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a single syntax that works in the browser and on the server. A lot of the built-in routines work in both place.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a vastly too-hard-to-learn language, but it's what we got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you were going to design one language that everything should be translated to, it would never be JavaScript, but once again, it's what we got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every toolkit shows up as a package in the server runtime for JavaScript. It's the default platform. If you want to write software that integrates lots of back end services, JS is your best choice. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was created by the immediate competitive need of Netscape's visionary, and a future venture capitalist, combined with the longevity of a standard syntax that has grown a lot especially in the last couple of years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In most of the answers to &lt;i&gt;What Is It? &lt;/i&gt;you could summarize it by saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;. In every category, given a choice between elegance and simplicity, performance and ease of use, JavaScript picks the worst of the options. And since worse is better, that's good! That's why it wins. It doesn't worry about being better, does it work, if so, let's use it and go forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to the beginning when Marc Andreessen didn't (presumably) want Java to run away with the web. That's the position Java had, and they were pressuring Netscape to bundle it with the browser, and he didn't want to do it, but he had to have something to put in his place. Pretty sure that's why he asked Brendan Eich to write it,  the legendary &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/&quot;&gt;10-day project&lt;/a&gt;. So what was &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; product? Maybe that should be the name? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though they weren't thinking of server-side language that JS would become, really JS is &lt;i&gt;the language of the web.&lt;/i&gt; That idea fits both the original vision and the current use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But that's not really a product name: Language Of The Web. LOTW. Nah doesn't really live well in the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would have just called it Netscape. It's so central to everything the company was doing, you could have said -- this is the reason we created the company. The web is the UI, and that's important, but the real power is the network behind it, and that network is defined by the language, and this here is the language. It would have given Java a run for the money, probably would have pushed it closer to Microsoft (that's a whole other story) but long term, it would have worked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW all that's left of Netscape today is -- JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They didn't do it then, but you could do it now and it would be cool and fun, historic, respectful and something people would talk about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to drive today on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;New York State Thruway&lt;/a&gt;, south of Albany. It was a long enough drive that I had to stop to use the facilities. I dreaded going into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waze.com/livemap/directions/united-states/new-york/new-baltimore/rest-area-i-87-mile-127-new-baltimore-service-area?place=w.187564456.1875579027.457925&amp;utm_expid=.K6QI8s_pTz6FfRdYRPpI3A.0&quot;&gt;rest stop&lt;/a&gt;. Happy to report that everyone, without exception, was wearing a mask. I had another thought, watching a woman walk her dog in the special area set aside for that. I thought geez if the dog can pee outside.</description>

After this, I want to read the equivalent book about the Jews in Europe. I have very little idea what that was about other than it was rough and didn't end well. ;-)</description>

			<description>Trillions will be spent by the US government in coming months to keep the country from crumbling. Do we use the money for big change, or do we settle for symbolic victories with most of the money going to the 1%. PS: IMHO the protests are a good sign.</description>

If I do, it's seamless.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose one month I spend $84 to read stories on The Atlantic. They can make me an offer to subscribe. Look dude, you're wasting money. Let us help you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's a lot nicer than -- hey asshole you can't read this article unless you subscribe. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is called marketing.

			<description>I asked a friend who’s Jewish, as am I, how he’d feel if a statue of Hitler was in the middle of his town. He said it’s different. It’s not. Imagine, after surviving the war, getting your freedom, the people you lived with, who controlled the town you live in, celebrated your enslavers.</description>

My longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheScottLove/status/1274898149161578504&quot;&gt;Scott Love&lt;/a&gt; says Apple should focus on the user experience. I say it's even more basic. What matters to me is how broken everything is. Every day it seems my flow is stopped because I have to find a way around something someone broke that broke something else. Stop deprecating, stop changing, let’s spend a decade fixing breakage.</description>

			<title>The N-word</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a Dave Chappelle concert last night on Netflix. Great stuff. But. He says the N-word over and over. Even to talk about white people. It gets imprinted in your mind, that's just a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example, after watching The Wire, my brain starts using the N-word all the time as my mind drifts. God forbid the word should ever come out of my actual mouth. Someday it will and I will get excoriated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So maybe our black bros (another word DC uses a lot) could take this into account and maybe not use it so much, at least when the audience has a lot of white people in it. Just sayin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The weight of the world</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is how a president should look. With the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Finally, perhaps, it has dawned on him that he can't bluff his way out of this one.

			<description>BTW, I never made software for iOS. I remember clearly when I decided not to. The day they announced the iPhone. I was expecting it to run Mac software. I had a great scripting environment for the Mac. I thought this is it, the perfect platform for me. Then I heard it was going to be nothing like the perfect platform for me. Now, 14 years later, give or take, the big story in tech is that it's an awful platform for developers. Y'all should just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Save a lot of time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A bug in journalism is that it tries to put people in boxes. Your ideas only have value if you have credentials to back them up. This method makes reporters easily replaced by algorithms, and keeps us from hearing the most interesting  even eclectic idea stimulating ideas. Of course no one in journalism will hear this because heh I lack the proper credentials.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/20/the-pandemic-is-accelerating-who-warns-of-dangerous-coronavirus-phase-video&quot;&gt;something to say&lt;/a&gt; that we all must hear, but they didn't get much coverage. We were all too busy focusing on Trump's shenanigans, as always. There should be a daily briefing with Dr Fauci, broadcast on all channels, treated as news, I don't care if he has to quit the government to do it. The WHO message is this -- the virus is spinning up to a new level, and it's going to cost us hugely to get it to quiet back down. This has to be said clearly and repeatedly with authority. In America the only one who can do that is Fauci. Without Trump, obviously. Maybe Wolf Blitzer, who clearly has a rapport with Fauci should take a leave from CNN to be his partner in this.</description>

			<description>The episode on &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/reviving-reconstruction/&quot;&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; of Radio Open Source is a must-listen, esp the interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw&quot;&gt;Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;. I got goosebumps listening to her, and at the end I was fistbumping &lt;i&gt;YES&lt;/i&gt; out loud on my bike ride. We are close to breaking through. The pandemic presents a huge opportunity for change that must not be wasted. Working together is required. I say something she didn't, white people will never know what it's like to be black, but we can work together, we must, we will.</description>

			<description>Today was the last Cuomo briefing, and the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrianbluestein/&quot;&gt;Richard Bluestein&lt;/a&gt; for doing the audio. Learned a lot from it, and also got to listen to some good leadership. I wonder who's going to fill the void. I hope the Democrats see there's a vacuum, maybe they could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci&quot;&gt;Dr Fauci&lt;/a&gt; to do something like what the Governor was doing. Or a former head of the CDC? We need a trusted source of advice and scientific info to keep going. Not just in New York, but around the country, and elsewhere.</description>

			<title>The revolution will not be televised</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was very much active in politics when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Scott-Heron&quot;&gt;Gil Scott-Heron's&lt;/a&gt; 1971 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJFhuOWgXg&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The revolution will not be televised,&lt;/i&gt; was a hit. I just saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ToriNicksWho/status/1271581194602180608&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; where he explains the idea behind it.  Back then I liked the song, but it was scary. Maybe that's why I liked it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of blacks leading a revolution, when the images on TV were of violence and looting, was fear-inspiring. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party&quot;&gt;Black Panthers&lt;/a&gt; were fear-inspiring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=black+panthers&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03mZAaIwlnwjCIpODhnxfEyskr7aQ:1592572085234&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwihjK2r-Y3qAhUkSN8KHem2DGUQ_AUoAnoECBwQBA&amp;cshid=1592572121919779&amp;biw=1489&amp;bih=1165#imgrc=oT8EPDvkkW4OiM&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; that went with the song, for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look, there's no absolute truth to any of this, only points of view. It was much later in life that I came to see that blacks can be hippies. When I was young as far as I knew only white people smoked pot. Did I ever see a black person smile? Not that I recall. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember in 1980 on a beach in Jamaica, the only white person, and feeling really scared. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've come quite a ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ToriNicksWho/status/1271581194602180608&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago. Gil Scott-Heron is a friendly artistic dude. I didn't get that way back when. Listening to it many years later, I realize now the song probably wasn't intended for me, a 16-year-old white kid. But it reached people like me, and influenced our thinking, the way we felt about blacks and revolution. But it's not 1971, and it seems we've learned how to listen to each other better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Simpler server-side JavaScript</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted here and on Twitter this idea:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’d like to do a new server-side JavaScript environment that’s compatible with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;, ie runs Node apps, no breakage, but it also eliminates the need for &lt;a href=&quot;http://callbackhell.com/&quot;&gt;callbacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/14/144017.html?title=javascriptPromisesVsCallbacks&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt; or async/await. I believe it’s technically possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend suggested using &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; to prototype this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I could imagine a modifier keyword on a function that means this function is internally going to do async things and calls to it should block until until it completes. That could be translated by a Babel plugin into somewhat that internally uses promises queuing to make callers wait for completion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the way to start. I wonder if anyone reading this has the expertise in Babel to make this work. I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/178&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; over in the repo to discuss.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will write up some code to demonstrate what the Babel plug-in will do, hopefully later today. Stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why try to simplify?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was asked on Twitter why I want this. There are all kinds of overhead, time, space, and intellectual. I program in a high level language instead of machine language because there's less intellectual overhead. It would save both time and space to use machine language. But I'm saving complexity by programming in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language&quot;&gt;HLL&lt;/a&gt;, and that means I can build more complex and useful software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why not just use promises, they're easy my correspondent asks. I say it's easier to not have to program something than use something that makes it easier to program. That's the philosophy of factoring. However the JavaScript I envision would be backward compatible with EC6. It would run any code that runs in Node. But it would also be able to process asynchronous functions with syntax that's as simple for a programmer as calling a synchronous function. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's any question that callbacks are something we'd like to simplify. &lt;i&gt;I'm saying it's possible to simplify callbacks by removing the need to use them for simple asynchronous I/O operations, yet give up none of the efficiency. &lt;/i&gt;Most other languages do it, so can JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's another reasons, transparency in APIs. For example, I might want to prototype a function by storing its data in memory, but at a later time may decide to store it on disk or on the net. I want to keep the interface unchanged, but with today's JavaScript you can't, you have to go to callbacks/promises/etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In general, the philosophy of factoring says you take a problem that you're solving over and over, and create a library of functions that do it, and call them instead of replicating the code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That could be translated by a Babel plugin into somewhat that internally uses promises queuing to make callers wait for completion.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:24:22 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142422"/>

				<source:outline text="This is the way to start. I wonder if anyone reading this has the expertise in Babel to make this work.

				<source:outline text="I was asked on Twitter why I want this. There are all kinds of overhead, time, space, and intellectual. I program in a high level language instead of machine language because there's less intellectual overhead. It would save both time and space to use machine language. But I'm saving complexity by programming in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language&quot;&gt;HLL&lt;/a&gt;, and that means I can build more complex and useful software." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:26:12 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142612"/>
				<source:outline text="Why not just use promises, they're easy my correspondent asks. I say it's easier to not have to program something than use something that makes it easier to program. That's the philosophy of factoring. However the JavaScript I envision would be backward compatible with EC6. It would run any code that runs in Node. But it would also be able to process asynchronous functions with syntax that's as simple for a programmer as calling a synchronous function." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:28:28 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142828"/>
				<source:outline text="I don't think there's any question that callbacks are something we'd like to simplify. &lt;i&gt;I'm saying it's possible to simplify callbacks by removing the need to use them for simple asynchronous I/O operations, yet give up none of the efficiency. &lt;/i&gt;Most other languages do it, so can JavaScript." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:58:27 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a145827"/>
				<source:outline text="There's another reasons, transparency in APIs. For example, I might want to prototype a function by storing its data in memory, but at a later time may decide to store it on disk or on the net. I want to keep the interface unchanged, but with today's JavaScript you can't, you have to go to callbacks/promises/etc." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:19:09 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a141909"/>
				<source:outline text="In general, the philosophy of factoring says you take a problem that you're solving over and over, and create a library of functions that do it, and call them instead of replicating the code." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:20:15 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142015"/>
