			<title>What is Electric Drummer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As we're starting to test the Linux and Windows versions of Electric Drummer there have been some basic questions. I thought I should respond publicly so people understand what we're doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; or E/D for short, is an app that runs on the desktop, hosted by its operating system.  Like a word processor or a graphics program. It's most like &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/building-hybrid-applications-with-electron/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; editor, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=drummer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-tab outliner for note-taking, organizing and publishing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It runs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful environment that makes cross-platform apps easier to create and manage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D saves files on your local file system as any desktop app does. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It can also hook up to your web Drummer account for outlines that you want to make public. It's how I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. The outline that I edit is on my local system,. It's also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/blog.opml&quot;&gt;public file&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be accessed by the CMS when I ask it to render my blog from the outline. The public file is stored in my web Drummer account. It's a nice combination.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D is a scripting system, like web Drummer is. It will be able to access the local file system, and also will be able to run a server, none of which are possible from the web app. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is already a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of E/D that has been available since October 10, when Drummer shipped. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same as web Drummer, a few commands work differently because it runs in a different place, but it's the same code, same outliner, same UI, same bugs (!), etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

As you may know, I've written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that flows LogSeq journal writing to a Drummer blog. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KLTransit/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. It does the whole thing, except it should be baked into LogSeq. Setting up a Node app and running it externally is both too difficult for an average user and too many steps. We already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog/issues/1#issuecomment-1013997158&quot;&gt;great techie user&lt;/a&gt; who I worked with me to get the Node app working, who is up to speed on using the software. He can guide the process, we just need a dev to work with him. I'm available to help too, to the extent that I can. If you are a LogSeq plugin dev, please post a note in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog/issues/1&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, and we can hopefully get started right away. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

I've decided to make the Mac work like Windows and Ubuntu, swapping the Ctrl and Cmd keys, but for some reason my Bluetooth keyboard is not showing up in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/17/modifierKeyboardDialog.png&quot;&gt;list of keyboards&lt;/a&gt; whose modifier keys you can change. The list is empty. I tried disconnecting the keyboard and reconnecting, no luck. I guess I should try rebooting the machine. If you have an idea, reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1483084855818784771&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>I can tell today is going to be &lt;i&gt;one of those&lt;/i&gt; days. My power went out overnight, but luckily I have a generator this winter (newly installed in the summer) and it automatically kicked in. But there are no outages listed on the Central Hudson outage map. Oy. I'll make the best of it.</description>

			<title>Political marketing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do I have anyone following me who is a political marketer? Is there such a thing. We need them now.  The way you fight this, and it's getting late, is by demonstrating the opposite.   Famous people of different races visibly doing things to help each other. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MU4F79oyfT&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to do.  We should be wearing buttons, small ones, with MLK's image on it. People of all colors. Americans. Showing support for all of us, esp people whose ancestors were slaves.   We have to urgently heal this huge wound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to do, we need to show each other that we are here, in great numbers.   I don't like huge national marches, what I'd love more than anything is people showing their passion for voting. Not just in November, but every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's meet up at our polling places for coffee and a sandwich and good old political talk. Talk about what we want. Yes there will be trolls there. But let's hope we outnumber them. I think we will always outnumber them, but can we get out there and show it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we need to use online advertising.   Campaigns should NEVER GO OFF THE AIR.

They start out easy at the beginning of each week, and get harder progressively until the Sunday puzzle which only great crossword solvers can do, like my mom. It was one of the things we could do together. I'd fill in a few of the answers and come back later to find the whole puzzle solved. She said she didn't mind that I did the easy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post recently started publishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/crossword-puzzles/daily/&quot;&gt;free crosswords&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I'm a paying NYT subscriber, their crosswords cost more, even for me. I find the Post crosswords are just as satisfying and clever as the NYT ones, and the price is great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know I have never been the answer to a clue in a NYT puzzle, or for that matter on Jeopardy. And I've never written a NYT guest column. I will be able to die a happy man when I've checked all these boxes. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we turn to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;. At first I looked at it and thought it was too much trouble, but then I read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/01/13/164646.html?title=solvingWordleWithLetterFrequency&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by my friend Ken Smith, the English professor from Indiana, who explained how to approach it mathematically. The idea is that your first word should have as many of the most likely characters as possible, which are the vowels and N, R, S, T etc. Then I don't know the best approach for the second word or third. What I've been doing is taking the matches from the first word, and there are bound to be one or two, and use them in the second word. If the position is correct, use that letter in that position, to make it a bit like a crossword, except there is no clue. Repeat in the third, fourth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've played Wordle twice and both times got extremely lucky and solved the puzzle in the third word. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; Scrabble. No patience for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted.

People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans.

Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I finally am able to use Linux as a GUI machine, not just a command line thing. But it's burning my brain cells that the Cmd and Ctrl keys are in the opposite places as on my Mac (and in my brain). It's easy to change key mapping on the Mac, but on Ubuntu, you have to do some pretty horrible stuff.</description>

I'm not sure if I were president I would obey this edict. This is a crisis. Maybe not treated as such by journalism, but what else can we expect from this court.</description>

			<title>Sinema for president?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr -- it might work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1481836126495256576&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; asking people to identify Sinema as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;bribed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blackmailed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;held hostage&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;insane&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had not considered another possibility -- she wants to be president! This came up in a tweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1481997298078990336&quot;&gt;forwarded&lt;/a&gt; by  the innovative Democratic campaigner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first thought: no way, maybe option #4 is correct after all, but then on reflection, it would increase interest in the primary and that's a good thing. Nothing is worse than a primary with candidates who all appear to be losers or bore you to death in their speeches, or worse make you feel uncomfortable (Biden, Hillary Clinton). And I don't want another Obama, I feel wounded by his presidency. Left us in a bad place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then I realize, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI5Z7Zg64YM&quot;&gt;Sinema&lt;/a&gt; is a good speaker, based on video of her back when she gave speeches. This crazy personal insurrection of hers has done one thing, it has made her much more famous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People vote for candidates who are confident and make them feel good about themselves, like they matter. That's pretty much it. I wish it were otherwise, but there's a lot to be said requiring a leader to be able to lead. Yes it matters where they lead us, but to a lot of voters, their thoughts don't go that far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've beem thinking about who I want to run in 2024. My two main interests are Jay Inslee and Gavin Newsom. Both are confident, good speakers, and their politics are  straight Democrat. I think they are our best shot at winning, and yes that's the primary concern. We simply can't have another Republican president and not go completely to hell. Please don't ever overlook that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's also a note there on how this will evolve. Right now all the loose-ends are showing, that's because I know almost nothing about LogSeq. As the people from LogSeq-land get familiar with this, they will no doubt have ideas about how to better integrate this software so it's super easy. This is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=bootstrap&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;bootstraps&lt;/a&gt; start.</description>

I always loved the imagery of this event. A cooperative venture, one team building from east to the west, and the other from west to east, meeting at a middle point, and thereby creating one great thing. Working together. Built during the Civil War.</description>

I was able to get by because I can now edit LogSeq documents in Drummer (!) -- it took me about 1/2 hour to realize I could do this. Oh the wonders of interop. I'm on Day 2 of my quest to hook up LogSeq to Drummer blogging. The first product of this work will be a JavaScript app that converts a LogSeq journal folder into a calendar-structured outline in OPML. We're creating a new idea universe here, and it's coming together quickly. I love being in the middle of these projects.</description>

			<description>Another thing I have to figure out is -- having indented, how do I outdent so the next line I type is at the parent's level. When I outdent the list I indented moves out. Not the intended effect.</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-queens-gambit&quot;&gt;Queen's Gambit&lt;/a&gt; again. It's so refreshing. The lead character, Beth Harmon, is so attractive, appealing, I want to see everything she says and does. She totally commands attention. And admiration. I once had a girlfriend who was as beautiful and brilliant like the character, smart and clever and ambitious. The show is such a fantasy, and very motivating. It makes me want to do brilliant work just to get her approval. I know it's just a story but it's also real in a sense, as my inner life. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. And it's good as a re-binge as well.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In a screen shot because I was writing in LogSeq. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have code that reads my Journals folder and turns it into an outline ready to be pushed at Old School and published as a blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It feels like building the transcontinental railroad.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Manchin is a tool. Obviously he's being paid off. We even know how. That said, perhaps we can put together a GoFundMe to get him even more money than his backers are giving him, to do the right thing. If he can be bought, in other words, why don't we just buy him??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be something for Wolf Blitzer to talk about. They could even have a box on CNN saying how much money had been raised so far. Reporters could ask Manchin all the time if $5 million isn't enough, what is your actual price?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He would say &quot;I don't have a price&quot; and we'd just..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't say!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/09/185121.html?title=noCellCoverage&quot;&gt;No Cell Coverage&lt;/a&gt; issue. I got a note that said to: 1. Turn on Airplane Mode. 2. Turn on Wifi. The thought is that should be enough to get the iPhone to stop trying to find a cell connection and thus stop draining my battery. If this works, all I'll have to do is remember to turn off Airplane Mode when I return to civilization.</description>

			<description>It would be interesting if one of the paywall'd pubs also offered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=ez-pass&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;tollbooth&lt;/a&gt; or pay-as-you-go option. It's possible I could end up paying more per month that way, but as a reader I'd feel better about it. I have too many subscriptions for things I never use. That really tarnishes the brand in my mind, esp after I unsub, which I inevitably do.</description>

			<title>Why LogSeq?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure some &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users are puzzled that the change notes outline all of a sudden has a bunch of stuff about LogSeq in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To a web outliner user who might not have heard of the product, or of the nascent &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; category, it could seem odd. My interest comes from the growth of the TFT category, and its close proximity to my products, and the potential for interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have put out a format for interop -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, but I've decided I don't want to wait for its broad adoption in the category to get interop. It's similar to  when RSS 0.90 came out when I already had &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scriptingnews%20format&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;scriptingNews format&lt;/a&gt;. You have a choice at that point, you can have interop right now, or you can wait for a consensus that may never come. In the first case you have the chance to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; the consensus, in the latter, you have to wait for others to agree. It's why I've noted in the past that the person who goes second has all the power. So I chose in this case to go second.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if I want to interop with TFT products, why LogSeq?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, when I approached them, they responded, and listened, and followed up. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Second, they have an open product, you can interop with it without getting in a locked trunk. What you look for in interop is a level playing field, that it be a peering arrangement, and that your interop partner can't shut off the connection without losing their users. LogSeq meets all those requirements. They are committed to being open. It's not just a thing they say, it's how they've built their product.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Third, the format is simple. I am familiar with it, having created a similar format for my outliners in the 80s called .HEAD. I know what it can and can't do. There's enough that we can do with the LogSeq format that makes for interesting projects built on the interop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fourth, I like the team! They have a fresh can-do go-get-em attitude that is very refreshing. You don't see this very often in the US (they are in China). One thing that makes interop work better is if there's compatibility between the people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I have to make a disclosure that I wish I had been able to make in November. I have made a small investment in the company. They have not announced this yet, and they asked me to wait until they do, but I feel I've already waited too long. I need people to know that I have a financial interest in the success of the company. But I also wanted to send a signal to them, to the users of our products, to the Tools For Thought category, to developers and others -- that we can compete and still see our success as beneficial to each other. This space is so large and under-developed that we can work for many years building on each others' strengths. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think what we're doing is substantially different. The focus of my projects tends to be in publishing and tools for development. I see their product as being useful in that context, but I don't think there's a big conflict. If we are able to co-exist with products that support OPML, surely we can do the same with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/4#issuecomment-1008016791&quot;&gt;progress report&lt;/a&gt; on the interop work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I'm sure some &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users are puzzled that the change notes outline all of a sudden has a bunch of stuff about LogSeq in it." created="Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:54:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/01/08/153904.html?title=whyLogseq#a145410"/>
				<source:outline text="To a web outliner user who might not have heard of the product, or of the nascent &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; category, it could seem odd. My interest comes from the growth of the TFT category, and its close proximity to my products, and the potential for interop." created="Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:54:50 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/01/08/153904.html?title=whyLogseq#a145450"/>
				<source:outline text="I have put out a format for interop -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, but I've decided I don't want to wait for its broad adoption in the category to get interop. It's similar to  when RSS 0.90 came out when I already had &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scriptingnews%20format&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;scriptingNews format&lt;/a&gt;. You have a choice at that point, you can have interop right now, or you can wait for a consensus that may never come. In the first case you have the chance to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; the consensus, in the latter, you have to wait for others to agree. It's why I've noted in the past that the person who goes second has all the power. So I chose in this case to go second." created="Fri, 07 Jan 2022 14:56:32 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/01/08/153904.html?title=whyLogseq#a145632"/>

			<description>I'm having a lot of trouble getting into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_6_(2021%E2%80%9322)&quot;&gt;final season&lt;/a&gt; of The Expanse. It seems really dry compared to what I've been tuning into lately. I will of course watch the whole thing, probably when it's done. Next Friday is the last episode.</description>

			<description>If I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0vJNp5asqc&quot;&gt;You're No Good&lt;/a&gt; the song of the day, about &lt;s&gt;100&lt;/s&gt; 250 people would think it was about them. It's not about you. You're great. I just like the song.</description>
