			<description>I've been playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;, a geography game somewhat inspired by Wordle. Here's the (spoiler!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/23/wordleSoution.png&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; to today's puzzle. I got close on the first guess then putzed around but did finally get the answer. I loved maps as a kid, so I have the shape of countries pretty well memorized.</description>

			<description>I was just looking over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040102121830/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;home blog&lt;/a&gt; at Harvard in 2003, a blog which I had the privilege of editing. I was looking for a snapshot of the &quot;What is a weblog&quot; page. A lot of work went into defining what it meant, because there was some confusion about this in the 2003 blogosphere. And then it turns out the page in question is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;still there&lt;/a&gt; on the Harvard site. Good thing it was preserved. And in case that page ever disappears, it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160729162359/http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;also on archive.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

It doesn't sound derogatory, but if a white person said it about anyone, any race, in any &lt;a href=&quot;https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/nytimes-peru-n-word-part-one-introduction-57eb6a3e0d95&quot;&gt;context&lt;/a&gt;, it could get them fired. It's also weird that watching shows where people use the word casually and often, your mind starts saying the word in your head, and it's not impossible that it could make it out of your mouth. In that case it doesn't mean you're a bad person, just that you watch HBO or Netflix. I think there's a good chance that's what happened when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/03/531365550/bill-maher-apologizes-after-using-n-word-on-his-show&quot;&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; said the word.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Raised%20By%20Wolves&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt; has bits of Westworld, Game of Thrones, Lost, Alien, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica and I'm sure a few other classics. My favorite character by far -- Mother as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Sg1Qzvpng&quot;&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Heckuva job Putin?</title>

			<title>Public editors, again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT should have public editors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They should only be copy edited. What they write is up to them.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Their work appears alongside the op-ed columnists, same prominence.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They must not be journalists, but must be good/great writers, and news users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why this has a chance of working?   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The journalists will be more likely to read it, because it gets the same distribution they do, it's harder to ignore.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The writers have no reason to tiptoe around journalists because they don't care about access, and aren't trying to protect a career in journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They come into the job with no fixed ideas on how journalism works. They view things only from the readers' perspective.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so they are vastly outnumbered by the people writing for the NYT who are trying to keep careers going and do care about access.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/21/224554.html?title=twitterArticles&quot;&gt;Twitter Articles&lt;/a&gt; is what it appears to be, Twitter is about to become a much more important part of the open web, assuming it's all accessible through the API in both directions (apps can post articles, as well as read them) and if it supports linking. It's very late, but better late than never, and in the future it'll mean that blogging tools such as the one I offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, will be able to peer with Twitter without hacks. Yes, we'll probably have to give up some features, and if the API isn't there then that would kind of render the whole thing null and void, but all &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;we've been asking for&lt;/a&gt; from Twitter et al is there in the screen shot.

The author says it's about Russia and the US and that the US doesn't want the new pipeline to be used to pump natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. The one weird thing about this is why would Putin pick this time to invade Ukraine when it gives the US pretext to shut down the new pipeline before it could get started? Seems like he has a lot to lose right now. Why not cement the bond with Germany before having an adventure in Ukraine. In any case, he says the US public is being conned, much as our journalism says the Russian people are being conned by their media. I don't doubt for a moment that the news we're getting is at least misleading if not total fiction.</description>

			<description>I've started bingeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/raised-by-wolves/season-1&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I like it so far into 3 episodes, and I hear it gets better. I have no idea why it's called Raised By Wolves, there are no wolves in the show (so far). The human kids are raised by androids. Here's something good/.interesting. It was liked by one person on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fraised-by-wolves&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;, Jake Savin, who is also considered the best match with me on BW. Jake said it was the Best. Aha I know I'm in the right place. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It could be that Putin gets to pick the day WW III starts. If so why wouldn't he wait till Tuesday so it can be a famous day -- 2/22/22. Just wondering about that while working on some tricky code. Yes, this is the kind of thing programmers think about.</description>

			<title>The Twitter-to-RSS project</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The project is coming along. Implemented so far... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tweets can have titles. Make the first character in a tweet a #. The rest of the first line is the title. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Full Markdown support. Anything you can type in a tweet can be Markdown and will be rendered as it's converted to an RSS item. Markdown is ideal for where Twitter is at now. It a plain text environment, and that's what MD is designed for. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads are rolled up into the first message, forming one RSS item. In RSS there is no character limit. And Twitter has a good thread composition tool built in. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160316075154/http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&quot;&gt;Emoji short codes&lt;/a&gt;. This was an easy one so I thought why not. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure how I'll package it for release. I want to wait until the major coding is done before deciding that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This post as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1495442593630638086&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, and then as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/20/thePostInMyReader.png&quot;&gt;RSS feed item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't watch All-Star games ever since I realized that players never play defense, esp in the NBA. I also understand that sports are pretty meaningless even for &quot;real&quot; games. All-Star games are two levels of meaningless. That's as they say a bridge too far for me.</description>

			<title>Why didn't Zuck fight back?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a comment that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/19/facebookstockoversixmonths.png&quot;&gt;Facebook lost&lt;/a&gt; half its market cap because they changed the company's name to Meta. It rings true. It was a really stupid move. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They changed their name because journalism has the power to shape public opinion and markets and they've been trashing the company name, confusing the company with the platform and the user community. It's amazing to me how much power they still have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago they decided as if by osmosis to conflate the company with the things users do with their service. When the users do something evil, they say Facebook did it. It's beyone inaccurate. Underneath the error it seems to me there must be malice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say it often enough and it sticks in the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook == evil. Over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So rather than try to clean up Facebook as a brand name, they just changed the name of the company and tried to disown the biggest cash cow ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is that Facebook the company has the best propaganda machine ever invented, but they don't use it for that purpose. If Zuck et al had chosen to usurp journalism's name shaping ability he could probably have destroyed them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't have made a difference to me or other people who don't have the power, but you wonder why they didn't use it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sure journalism would have screamed bloody murder. So what. Let them scream. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Recall that the word &quot;Facebook&quot; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;at least 8 meanings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Everett Dirksen could tell a story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I thought of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen&quot;&gt;Everett Dirksen&lt;/a&gt;, former Republican senator from Illinois. Probably hadn't thought of him in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I found him endlessly entertaining. He was a funny looking guy and had a froggy kind of voice, but he told great stories, the kind of stories a pre-teen kid could get into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Au2-J-3on0&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Dirksen telling a story about lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I wondered what happened to the American politicians who could tell a story? There aren't many. Certainly not in Congress or the executive branch, or even the court. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a bigger problem than it first appears. Because to be good at telling a story is being good at relating to other humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Trump is a good storyteller. People think that Trump resonated with his supporters because they're racists and narcissists, like Trump, but it could just be that he can tell a story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His stories always have him as the hero, and tend to blame immigrants, people of color for all the problems, but a Woodie Guthrie or Will Rogers for example might get the same people to vote Democratic. That is if you still believe in the basic goodness of most people, which I desperately try to cling to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>First major difference between the new iPhone and the old one -- the new one has 512GB of memory, the previous one had 64GB. That means that I can have all my apps loaded at the same time, where the system would always be swapping them out. That makes a big difference around where I live where cell coverage is very spotty.</description>

			<description>I was having breakfast with a local friend the other day and we were talking about the Beatles. He is not a fan. He cited as an example that Hey Jude is too long, at over 7 minutes. I had never thought about that. I expected that it was meant to crowd out other music on FM radio, where the standard song length was more like 3 minutes. He said he didn't know about that. I said if it were tech instead of music that would definitely have been the motivation. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+hey+jude+so+long&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; it up.</description>

			<title>The iPhone 13 epilog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/gaslight.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As I reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/15.html#a193031&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; Pro arrived yesterday. So the embarrassing saga is over. Now I want to clean up, by finishing the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Apple sent a total of three iPhones to me. After the first one was lost, the second one got jammed up in the system too, when Apple charged the wrong credit card $1 for an unspecified reason and they had changed my credit card number, so the charge was rejected. The email I got saying this happened had none of this information so I waited, hoping the problem would clear without me having to call them, but no such luck. Turns out that delay doomed the second iPhone because while it was in transit we had a huge ice storm that knocked out power in Ulster County for two days. The iPhone was left in the UPS warehouse, probably in Kingston, and probably was stolen while it was waiting for everything to come back online.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After trying to get help from Apple Support on Twitter, I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/142419.html?title=myEmailToTimCook&quot;&gt;email to Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of Apple. Within an hour of sending the email, I got a phone call from someone in &quot;Apple Retail Executive Relations&quot; who was empowered to blow through the problem. A third iPhone was sent, this time via Fedex, which is, in my experience, much more reliable in this area than UPS. But something funny happened before the third phone was delivered at 2PM Eastern yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 12:45PM or so, I heard a UPS truck park outside my house. It stayed there for about ten minutes. I went out to see what was going on, and could hear the driver in the back sorting through packages. It usually doesn't take that long. I shouted out to him through the open door, but he didn't answer. So I went back in the house to take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; with my Pixel 4a, in time to see him drive off without making a delivery. My guess is that the UPS computer had told him to come here to make a delivery, and when he got here, the package wasn't on the truck? I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; to prove this actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;UPS truck before it left without making a delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's not much more to say that isn't spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/142419.html?title=myEmailToTimCook&quot;&gt;email to Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll just leave it there, except to say at all levels Apple people knew what the right thing to do was, but their system wouldn't let them do it. That is, until we got to someone who was at most a couple of hops from the CEO, who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; empowered to solve the problem. As a long time Apple user, I got my first Apple II in 1979, I'd hate to see Apple be in the toilet bowl of uncaring bigco American rust belt e-commerce, where people are peripheral devices to poorly designed computer systems created by lawyers and accountants and in some cases psychopaths. For evidence of that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/dmExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;see the DMs&lt;/a&gt; that the Apple Support people sent.

				<source:outline text="As I reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/15.html#a193031&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; Pro arrived yesterday.

				<source:outline text="Apple sent a total of three iPhones to me. After the first one was lost, the second one got jammed up in the system too, when Apple charged the wrong credit card $1 for an unspecified reason and they had changed my credit card number, so the charge was rejected. The email I got saying this happened had none of this information so I waited, hoping the problem would clear without me having to call them, but no such luck. Turns out that delay doomed the second iPhone because while it was in transit we had a huge ice storm that knocked out power in Ulster County for two days. The iPhone was left in the UPS warehouse, probably in Kingston, and probably was stolen while it was waiting for everything to come back online." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:53:03 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog#a135303"/>
