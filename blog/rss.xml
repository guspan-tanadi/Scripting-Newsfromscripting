They're all expecting that if Biden takes office, they will be soon be implicated openly with something horrible, likely treasonous. And what that is is not really a mystery. They were all working for Russia. Either for money or because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat&quot;&gt;kompromat&lt;/a&gt;. There's an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_for_a_penny,_in_for_a_pound&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound&quot; that applies here. And who is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; implicated? The governor and secretary of state of Georgia and a few other Republican state officials who stood behind the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan. And very oddly -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;US AG Bill Barr&lt;/a&gt;. Amazingly, he didn't go along with the coverup. He appeared to be the most corrupt of them all, except for the Trump family. Go figure!</description>

			<title>How to ask for help with software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Three things your report must include: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What you did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What you expected to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What actually happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It may help to include a screen shot if it reveals something that is hard to communicate in words.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you can access the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/&quot;&gt;JavaScript console&lt;/a&gt;, take pictures of any messages in red, or anothing else that sounds like an error message.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're using free software rememeber that any person who helps you is doing the work for free. Make it easy for them and they're more likely to help. And when it works, say thank you. For good karma. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why I need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptscript.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript-like scripting language&lt;/a&gt;. I had a bug in a script I use to backup various files from my blog in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. It was simple enough to fix, but the script stopped working 27 days ago, so now I have a hole in my repo with all the missing days. This is the kind of problem you solve with a scripting language. Doing this in standard JS is going to be a pain in the ass. But I'll do it because I care. But things could be so much better.</description>

			<description>Sooo, the Dems are horrible at communicating with the people. You'd think that would be something a political party would be &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; at. But most Dems suck, even Obama, and definitely Clinton, going all the way back to Dukakis, which was the first presidential campaign I tried to give a free idea to (and a good one it was, in hindsight). Al Sharpton is great, as is Mayor Pete, and of course they're shipping him off to China. See how &lt;i&gt;ridiculous&lt;/i&gt; they are. Oy!</description>

As I said then, it's a big chicken and egg thing. Once the pubs sign on, they will be gold, we need Scroll to succeed. Well they scored with a big publisher. Good for them, and maybe good for us (people who want to be able to read everything on the web, without subscribing to every publication with a paywall, which is obviously not possible).</description>

			<description>Google changed the icon for Chrome? It's as stupid a thing to do as a cigarette maker changing the taste or packaging of their product. It's an addiction you don't even know you have until they &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; you conscious of it. Going to the web is programmed so deep into my neurons, it's at the base of my spine, a total reflexive thing, addict behavior. Now I think about it every damn time. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/09/iconbar.png&quot;&gt;Safari icon is next to it&lt;/a&gt;, and btw it &lt;i&gt;hasn't&lt;/i&gt; changed. Which browser you use is something they want you not to think about, as long as it's their browser. Maybe it's a bug, in which case never mind. But if it was deliberate, it's a stupid move. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Positioning%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Positioning&lt;/a&gt; for the importance of what's in peoples' minds.</description>

			<title>Apple zealots suck</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a very pragmatic problem with the religious zeal people have for Apple products. I can't tell when I should take their advice if they always gush about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two recent examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A friend, a VC, told me that the XS Max was totally worth the $1500. So I got one. No way it was worth that. I replaced it this year with a new SE for $350, and I love it, actually more than the XS Max because it's only $350. I'm cheap that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another friend told me last month I had to get the new earpods. $250. A little steep, but the way he was talking, it sounded like Moses had come down from the mountain with the secret to human happiness, and I could get it for only $250. So I did it, on an impulse. Well, they're nice enough, but there's absolutely nothing special about them. I like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=WH-1000XM4+Wireless+Noise-Canceling+Headphones&amp;qid=1607538440&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVEtROTdWUkwwVVExJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDEwMDc3MjJONDJPRklMN0dBMSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODA4MjY1MjVEWVdBQ1VSVDBXNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=&quot;&gt;Sony overear headphones&lt;/a&gt; better (almost exactly the same price, btw). I buy headphones on a whim, so I know what's good. These are ok, but didn't not deserve the review they got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So all this ends up backfiring for people who want to help Apple sell product, which btw, I'm happy about since I bought Apple shares in 1997, and have watched them make me rich,. But as a user, I am offended by the way people go on and on about such bullshit. Headphones and iPhones aren't sex toys or drugs. They're products. They're good products, but they also suck like all products do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back in the day there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage&quot;&gt;million pixel web page&lt;/a&gt;, they sold individual pixels, $1 a pixel. The guy made the money, got paid for all the pixels. Anyway what made me think of this was President-elect Biden could sell seats at the virtual inauguration and use the money for a good cause. I'd like to be part of a million people participating in the inaugural, without endangering people's lives (including my own).</description>

			<description>Highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gov-cuomos-briefing-for-december-7/id1506413883?i=1000501621982&quot;&gt;yesterday's Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt;, esp the conversation between Cuomo and Fauci. Important: we need 80 percent to be vaccinated to eliminate the virus. Everyone, legal or illegal, no matter where they live. Of course, not likely, given that more than half of NYC firefighters say they will &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7ny.com/fdny-vaccine-covid-pfizer/8560168/&quot;&gt;refuse the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. These are people who run into burning buildings, but think the vaccine is too dangerous?</description>

			<description>Journalism should use some of their space to debate how they should conduct journalism going forward, the discussion not overseen by journalists, btw. Assuming Trump doesn't manage to overturn the election before January 20, the first chance they're going to get to change things radically over in journalism-land is if Trump has a rally to counter-program the inauguration, in what will probably unprecedented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/06/birx-winter-covid-surge-the-worst-event-that-this-country-will-face.html&quot;&gt;moment of misery&lt;/a&gt; for the country re Covid. Journalism no longer has to cover Trump because he's no longer POTUS. They could choose to focus totally on the inauguration and the virus. It's so perverse now that they could go the other way, they could have Chris Cilizza and Gloria Borger discuss whether infecting millions of people and destroying the health care system was a brilliant political move, horse-race-wise, for Trump to set up on his way out, moderated by Wolf Blitzer (who btw, sometimes seems to think he's Speaker of the House).</description>

			<description>Until very recently my Twitter feed didn't have ads. They really suck. Itâ€™s all stupid tabloid celebrity paparazzi bullshit.

			<title>My plan for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today Om Malik posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2020/12/07/what-twitter-can-learn-from-spotify/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; outlining the future of Twitter as very different from where Twitter is today. As I read it I thought, yes that is the future, and about a dozen other things. We should do them all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note I said &lt;i&gt;we,&lt;/i&gt; not they.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my plan for Twitter. Become an investment banker and distributor. It's the same advice I have for every tech company that achieves the size and seniority that Twitter has achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their strength is operating servers and raising money. They have access to an infinite supply of both. They also have a unique platform, with virtually universal adoption. Their service is so many places, that's where the distribution comes into it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Commit to the API as a developer ecosystem, and invest in developers with promising apps. Buy them when that would be in the interest of both. That's how you grow from where Twitter was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also for crying out loud, broaden the pipe to allow text objects greater than 280 chars. &lt;i&gt;Please.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the advice I came up with for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Microsoft%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; when we were studying them in the 90s and they were helbent on taking over the nascent web. With hindsight it was good advice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was also my advice for pre-1997 Apple. I even wrote a piece where I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;dreamed I was CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and outlined how I would reorganize Apple's relationship with devs. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; would be perfect for Twitter in 2021. Imagine Jack Dorsey as CEO of a new Twitter that does deals with devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is too big a boat to turn. But it can be a safe harbor for thousands of startups with ideas for what to do with the basic ingredients of Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We. Have. To. Work. Together.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When we were first rolling out podcasting in the winter of 2004, we had a hard time getting anyone in established media to listen. I think people could have understood, but they didn't make the effort to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It does take effort to listen, I've seen it in myself. We just have our heads down and are focused on what we do. It's even worse today, sixteen years later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump stumbled across the idea we were selling, me, @ev, the other blogging and RSS folk. Trump understood it intuitively, we understood it technologically (and some of us as writers and designers).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So now this method of communication is owned by the tabloids, only worse. Real journalism is reduced to writing about the hoaxes spread in the more powerful media channel. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To win, we have to work together. The people with a vision for how the tech could help, and the people who are able to actually run the complex machinery of government.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We. Have. To. Work. Together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past when that happened, when there was real collaboration, the result was explosive, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My house makes this sound..</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When it's windy, as it was last night, my house makes a really jarring loud sound, and I haven't been able to figure out what it is. So I took out my iPhone, and opened the Voice Memo app and recorded the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/windSlammingSound.m4a&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/windSlammingSound.m4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can hear it clearly at 2 seconds, then 8 seconds and then at 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In real life it's a lot louder than it sounds in the recording. Sounds like a metal door slamming. You can't sleep through it, and it sounds like it might be doing damage to the house. Last night was particularly bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The sounds always come in pairs. As if something is slamming open and then slamming closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been going on since I moved in, in March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The wind has to be going about 35 mph or so. It only does this when it's gusting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had a couple of contractors look into it, but of course never when the it's making the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Any theories welcome. If you know what it is, even better! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

What if he's firing people in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense&quot;&gt;DoD&lt;/a&gt; who would get in the way of a military takeover of the government.</description>

			<description>Studying the Unix source code when I was a CS grad student was a revelation. Here's how I summarize the gestalt. &lt;i&gt;This code looks like what it does.&lt;/i&gt; It takes a lot of time, care and craft to do. Up till that point, my code tended to quickly get out of control, but somehow the Unix developers kept it clean. From that point on I knew it was possible, and it's what I always strive for. Some languages make it easier than others, but even if you're writing in assembly language, if it's a well crafted language, you can make the code look like what it does. JavaScript is notorious for making it very difficult. As a language designer I keep wanting to fix it. Someday I will. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>In programming there's a moment when the code you're working on first does what you're trying to make it do. It's only barely doing it. But it just went from doing nothing to doing The Thing. I call this the moment when &lt;i&gt;the first blade of grass pops through the surface of the earth. &lt;/i&gt;Later there will be a nice lawn here. You hope it'll be thick and green. But for now it's just the one blade of grass. It's nice moment. The code is no longer just an idea, it's now a thing.</description>

			<description>Gotta say it's not news when a Republican &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2020/12/04/kellyanne-conway-acknowledges-bidens-win/&quot;&gt;acknowledges&lt;/a&gt; that Biden won. Unless you report it as how pathetic the Repubs are. Even that's not news, but at least it's another way they are pathetic. For the time-being. They'll think of something else.</description>
