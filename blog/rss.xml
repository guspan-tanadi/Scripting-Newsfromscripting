			<description>I like promoting other people's products when they're good. I am unhappy when I see bad products promoted by people I respect. If I think a product is not good, unless I think people will be hurt by it, or if the badness can be fixed and the product would then be useful, I'll generally say nothing.</description>

			<description>Maybe there should be real debates on TV every week between leaders on issues that Congress is going to vote on. And a way of measuring public opinion. No personal attacks allowed. Strict control via Mute button. This week the debate would be about the merits of approving a new radical Supreme Court justice in the middle of an election when everyone's attention is focused elsewhere. Some actions are so important they deserve everyone's focus.</description>

			<description>I am so exhausted from US politics, this state going back to the summer of 2016. I made it through about 15 minutes of last night's debate before I couldn't stand it. All it took was one gaffe from Biden to shred all hope of a reprieve from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22shitshow%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;shitshow&lt;/a&gt;. Then I had a thought, what if Amazon released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-delivery-of-prodigious-bribe-to-american-regime-for-make-benefit-once-glo&quot;&gt;new Borat movie&lt;/a&gt; a few hours early? Wouldn't that be great. So I looked. And they had! So I watched the first half, returned to the debate, which still was not over, and went back and watched a bit more, and returned to the debate just in time to hear the wrapup. Then I listened to Maddow's review of Trump's lies about Covid (the part  I had heard) and I felt better so I went to bed. Only to wake up this morning and find that the feeling if utter misery was even worse. The election is 11 days from now.</description>

			<title>Re 2-factor-authentication</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever thought what happens when you lose control of the phone that is your second factor? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, how hard is it to hijack a phone?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years back I had a phone hijacked via AT&amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I never got it back. But I was able to terminate the account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tying_(commerce)&quot;&gt;Tying&lt;/a&gt;. A big company uses a monopoly in one area to create a monopoly in another. It was the basis for the anti-trust case against Microsoft in the 90s. They were forcing PC manufacturers to bundle their web browser, which was not a monopoly with their operating system, which was, thus forcing the leading browser, Netscape, out of the market. This happens over and over in tech. Google does it by using their monopoly in search to crush competitors in other categories. It can't be allowed. Products must compete on merit, not because we are forced to use them.</description>

			<description>I think I will at least try to watch the debate tonight. Too much at stake, and too much &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes&quot;&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/a&gt; from El Orange the would-be dictator of the United States of America.</description>

			<description>I had way too much to eat and drink at dinner yesterday, but it was great. A local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cucinawoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; has a great patio, set up comfortably, and they serve excellent food. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York&quot;&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; is a small town, but it has the amenties of a town in the Bay Area (e.g. Berkeley, Palo Alto). But I did eat too much and I'm paying the price for it today. Oy!</description>

			<description>Glad that Andrew is reviewing &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; now. There are all kinds of loose-ends. That's what happens when you're developing only for yourself. Looking forward to going back over it and cleaning things up a bit. It's a very fine piece of software imho. In many ways the web server I've always wanted.</description>

			<description>Since Andrew is working on a new version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; server now, he asked if it would make sense to support &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; in rssCloud. That would mean adding a &amp;lt;head&gt; element that had all the info that's in the rssCloud element in an RSS feed. It's a good idea, but.. (sorry) -- OPML already has a realtime notification service, it came after rssCloud and is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;web sockects&lt;/a&gt;. It's the core tech behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Instant Outliner%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Instant Outliner&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; implements.</description>

			<description>Anyone who votes for Trump is suicidal and I can prove it. 1. The virus is real, doesn't matter what you believe, it is in fact killing people and destroying other people's lives. 2. We aren't doing anything to stop it, because the president doesn't want us to. He has that power. 3. If you re-elect him, you'll get more of the same; if you don't we'll start fighting it asap. If for no other reason than you want to live, you should vote for Biden/Harris.</description>

			<description>I'm doing a phone interview/podcast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis&quot;&gt;Jason Calacanis&lt;/a&gt; later today. I often blog about these things before doing them, so I fill my head with ideas that might be worth discussing. He and I have some interests in common, notably how to include universities in the tech development process. I think there's more to it than what Y-combinator does. Anyway, I just spewed (not kidding) a bunch of ideas into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1318919848240570368&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. Wanted to be sure it was linked into the blog.</description>

			<description>Started a web and voice conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/rethinking-blogs/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; about ideas for rethinking blogs and feeds. I found, as others have, that I need another kind of document to include in my personal CMS other than a story that's part of the blog. Everything about blogs are set up to be written, then lightly edited, and never touched again. Like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco&quot;&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt; painting. It's &lt;i&gt;temporal&lt;/i&gt; writing. But there are other things that I want to develop over time, keep coming back to, revising. A few years back I started this.how to hold those docs. It's worked out really well. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; faq as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/&quot;&gt;this.how&lt;/a&gt; doc. We also had this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, right from the start. We wrote, published and maintained the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier using the same CMS we used for blogging. In the end the data structures are the same, what was confusing is how we think about them. But once you make a decision to put non-temporal docs &quot;over there&quot; then things start working.</description>

			<description>BTW, about 20 years ago I was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22timeless weblogs%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;timeless weblogs&lt;/a&gt;. I vaguely remember it. Some of the stuff I wrote is offline, but possibly in archive.org. But I'm pretty sure I have the right solution now. How can I tell? I use it. Why? Because I know &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; to use it. That's the trick to iterating this stuff. The tech is easy compared to the workflow.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hover%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; is a great domain company, highly recommend them. I've even given them an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; for a very clever no-brainer DNS feature that no one else does, as far as I know. On Sunday I registered a new domain and wasn't able to access it. So I contacted their support, they said they needed permission to go into my account to see how I had it configured. By then the problem had cleared on its own, but it was puzzling why they would need permission. The DNS setup is, by design, totally public info. Anyone could look to see how my domain is set up.  I assumed they were doing that when there have been support issues in the past.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmzEIJBGQfg&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that demos how I edit my blog. I created it last October, and thought it might be worth another look. The big deal is fluidity. The user interface hangs on a framework that's designed for writers. Most of what goes into a blog is writing, so it's worth setting it up this way.</description>

			<description>As a Roku user, HBO clearly doesn't want my money. I tried getting HBO as part of Hulu and it's awful. There was a program I wanted to watch, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/16/opinions/the-west-wing-reunion-we-didnt-need-yang/index.html&quot;&gt;West Wing reunion&lt;/a&gt;, but their search only showed the original series. I found it on my iPad, which HBO still has its own app for, so that worked. Later, I cancelled my HBO subscription. Subscriptions are madness. Every service has its own user interface. Three services are locked in for me. 1. Netflix, because it's Netflix. 2. Amazon, because I pay nothing extra for it, so why not. 3. YouTube TV so I can watch cable news and have learned its UI. There are plenty of other brands that have shows that I want to watch and would be willing to pay for, but there's a limit to how many packages I'm going to buy and how many UIs I can learn. Can the people who run these businesses not understand this? There's going to be a huge culling and one or two will remain. Probably Netflix and Amazon. If you don't think so, look around. How many product categories have more than one or two products with any market share?</description>

			<title>Correcting media errors</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Mistakes heard recently (and repeatedly) on cable news.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wearing a mask protects other people more than it protects the wearer. So if one person in a crowd of thousands wears a mask, unless it's certain that person has the virus, it's not doing much to protect anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It has been said that if the Dems win the Senate and hold the House, it doesn't matter if Trump is re-elected, Congress will remove him. Not possible. It takes a 2/3 majority in the Senate, or 67 votes, to remove the president, and there aren't enough Republican seats at stake in the election to give the Dems that big a majority, even if they swept the Repubs. However there would be enough Democrats in the Senate to require a full trial, including testimony. Recall that the Senate not only didn't convict, they didn't allow an actual trial with witnesses and compelled testimony.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Repeating Russian misinfo, even to question it, is journalistic malpractice. It's the biggest mistake journalism keeps repeating. Journalism wields a lot of power, and that power is accountable to no one. It may be a bigger problem than Citizens United or court packing by either party.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

Iâ€™ve seen it before and read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, but itâ€™s good to get a refresher. Everything, not just baseball, needs a fresh look, because weâ€™ve been doing so much the same way we always have, without thought, not questioning out-of-date assumptions.</description>

			<description>I am usually interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball&quot;&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association&quot;&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; playoffs, but this year I practically ignored them. The reason, in retrospect, is that sports is all about the ritual, the continutity, the historic connection. Novelty feels wrong. For example, I still haven't gotten over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter&quot;&gt;Designated Hitter Rule&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal&quot;&gt;three-point shot&lt;/a&gt; in basketball still seems like an innovation. I like sports because they connect to the past. I went to games as a kid with ancestors who are now gone. &quot;What did the Mets do?&quot; was the beginning of every kitchen table conversation in the house I grew up in. It was the default. To this day my brain says those words when it's idle. This season was a heroic effort for both sports, esp the NBA with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble&quot;&gt;bubble&lt;/a&gt;, but the only heroism that gets me to pay attention to sport is what happens on the court and on the field.</description>

			<description>The primary rule of trolls is the rage has to build. Immunity to outrage builds up over time. What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today. That's the problem with Trump as a troll. He got stuck. He's trying to entertain with the same schtick he used four years ago. Yawn. Been there done that.</description>

			<description>I wonder if The Lincoln Project should do an ad just for Georgia that tells voters that the state has become famous for suppressing African-American votes. People overlook just where we're at on racism in this country, even a state like Georgia where a fair number of Repubs must've voted for a black man, who was elected president, and did a decent job, esp compared to the shitshow of a Republican who's president now. Remind them that there is no honor in preventing an equal citizen of your state from voting.</description>

			<title>Trump's magnificent shitshow</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/15.html#a130631&quot;&gt;told you&lt;/a&gt; that Trump would suck at the town hall yesterday, whether or not Biden was there. NBC did us all a favor by putting it on. People, you have to think. This is not 2016, when Trump was a juggernaut. Like it or not, Trump is president now, and reality has caught up with him, and with us, his subjects. The economy is wrecked, huge numbers of Americans are dead, many more seriously sick, and there's no end in sight. We're all either huddled in our houses in isolation, or out getting infected, and there isn't much of an inbetween. If there's a car accident in Wisconsin they won't be able to help the victims because there's no room in the hospitals. Trump is much more familiar with the conspiracy theories than he is with what's actually happening in the country he's supposed to govern.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So how did a meetup with actual American voters go? It was a shitshow. A glorious, Trump-humiliating shitshow. It was obvious that was how it was going to go. There's an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-by-generals-always-fight-the-last-war&quot;&gt;adage&lt;/a&gt; about people always fighting the last war. 2020 is not 2016. Trump isn't the same candidate he was then. In 2016 you would be right to be pissed at NBC. But in 2020, we should be thanking them for giving full exposure to the fake president we sadly have, and happily have a chance to remove. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Maddow I didn't even have to watch the Trump town hall. She did an incredible post-town-hall review of all the ridiculousness of Trump trying to talk to normal voters about his role as their commander in chief. Hers was the inverse of a shitshow. She was cleaning up the shit after the show. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-by-generals-always-fight-the-last-war&quot;&gt;adage&lt;/a&gt; about people always fighting the last war. 2020 is not 2016. Trump isn't the same candidate he was then. In 2016 you would be right to be pissed at NBC. But in 2020, we should be thanking them for giving full exposure to the fake president we sadly have, and happily have a chance to remove." created="Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:30:20 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/10/16/142934.html?title=trumpsMagnificentShitshow#a143020"/>
				<source:outline text="Thanks to Maddow I didn't even have to watch the Trump town hall. She did an incredible post-town-hall review of all the ridiculousness of Trump trying to talk to normal voters about his role as their commander in chief. Hers was the inverse of a shitshow. She was cleaning up the shit after the show." created="Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:28:11 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/10/16/142934.html?title=trumpsMagnificentShitshow#a142811"/>

			<description>If you saw the last Trump town hall, a few weeks ago, you wouldn't be so mad at NBC. He doesn't like questions from voters. He can't call them fake news. I don't think it'll help him.</description>

			<title>My Borgen review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fborgen&quot;&gt;Borgen&lt;/a&gt; last night. Three &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70302482&quot;&gt;seasons&lt;/a&gt;, and I would love to watch the fourth season right now. As I do my work this morning, my mind keeps drifting back to how the last season ends. How the conflicts get resolved, and the questions that are left unanswered. Every character is about to embark on something new. But they got there by stretching themselves, taking a risk, and coming out okay. Not perfectly, they pretty much all got hurt, but in the end they more or less have a clean slate, lots of possibilities, and I wonder what's next.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You end up loving them. They bare their souls to you. You see them weak, and dealing with it. To pull that off, in TV, is pretty amazing. And that all that comes through from reading titles in a Danish-language show. The characters at times switch into perfect British-accented English, mainly because they're doing something international. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No spoilers, so I can't tell you the roles the various characters play, but I will say that this is sort of like the Danish equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt;, only more adult, and less &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=schmaltzy&quot;&gt;schmaltzy&lt;/a&gt;. The writing is very good, but it's not Aaron Sorkin, and that's neither a plus or minus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also have an English-dubbed version. I tried that at first, but the subtitles were for the Danish version, and there are differences. I prefer shows, even in English, that have subtitles. I think dubbing is generally cheesy, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After finishing it, I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my BingeWorthy page&lt;/a&gt; and changed the rating from Loved to Best, the top rating. If you have the time, and can read titles, I would put this on my watchlist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
