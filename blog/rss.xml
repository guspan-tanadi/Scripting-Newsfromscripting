			<description>An immediate improvement AI could make for developers are making the error messages from language interpreters and runtimes better at pointing to the actual source of the problem, not just where it shows up. That would require some guesswork, but it's better to have the computer do some of that before turning it over to the human. The same way it can make medical doctors work easier.</description>

			<title>Bootstrapping an app ecosystem</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A week ago I wrote a piece about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html&quot;&gt;identity as a product&lt;/a&gt;, summarizing stuff I've written on this topic for the whole life of my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been on an exploration of what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; is, and how developers and users figure in it. In the intervening almost 30 years (!) we started out with a fresh slate, the open web, but it never turned into the developer platform I hoped it would. Quite the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today it's virtually impossible for an independent developer, without millions in venture capital, to launch a new product or service. Far too many barriers exist. And the money comes at a cost, meaning that many products that are truly useful to users never get out there. Mostly the products turn users into the product as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/willUsersAlwaysBeUsers.html&quot;&gt;cliche&lt;/a&gt; goes, products for marketers, wanting to sell products to largely passive users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I still believe! There are a lot more young people today who are fluent in computer programming, who have been using computers their whole lives, than there were the 80s, the last time there were intentional developer communities where an individual could launch a product and still retain their freedom to serve users, not marketers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now some story-telling to go with this idea...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first deliberate new platform I experienced was the Macintosh in 1984. Before that, there were the Apple II and CP/M platforms which had accidental developer communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Apple II's app ecosystem was bootstrapped by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc&quot;&gt;Visicalc&lt;/a&gt; but at first Apple, did almost nothing to help. There was no idea that the Apple II would be used in business, or that there even &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a business market for personal computers. The Apple II was thought of as a &quot;home computer.&quot; Used for shopping lists, calendars, recipes, and kids doing homework. Ads showed the computer on a kitchen counter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Visicalc, an Apple II spreadsheet with an innovative UI, &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; the business market and a huge wave of apps following it, once they showed it could be done. That wave continued on the IBM PC with another developer product, Lotus 1-2-3, a precursor to Excel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;CP/M had a spreadsheet, Supercalc, and a lot of word processors, databases, programming languages, communication software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first deliberate app ecosystem was the Mac in 1984.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When it first shipped, the Mac didn't run Apple II software, so they had to solve the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; problem. They did it by developing two products in-house that were bundled with the machine -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint&quot;&gt;MacPaint&lt;/a&gt;. So people who bought the machine would have something to use it for before they noticed that there was no developer software for the platform at launch. Only promises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was lucky, our product, ThinkTank, for the Apple II, had just launched in 1983, struggled to find distribution at first, got a rave review from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/personal-computers-software-first-idea-processor.html&quot;&gt;NY TImes&lt;/a&gt;, which had just started reviewing software, and then the authoritative tech pub &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/12/infoworldThinktank1.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/12/infoworldThinktank2.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; it the highest score possible. All of a sudden we had sales, and could grow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our early success caught the eye of Guy Kawasaki who was newly hired as Apple's chief evangelist. We were a tiny startup but they seeded us with an early Macintosh along with the big software companies, and while we ported to the Mac platform it wasn't uncommon for Mike Boich, who was in charge of developer relations at Apple and himself a programmer, to be at our office helping us debug. They got involved with developers. There was no idea that success meant developers succeeding on their own. This very wrong idea would be the fatal flaw of a few otherwise excellent startup platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We raised angel money and by early summer 1984 we had ThinkTank/Mac shipping. Apple bought full page ads for our product in Fortune, Business Week, Time, etc, out-spending us by a lot. Targeted at education and business, the Mac also caught on in government, and esp the military. To be clear, they invested in quite a few other products, not just ours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had a long way to go to catch up to the IBM PC, which had launched three years earlier and was booming, with magazines covering PC software and every major category deep with product, addons, utilities. But Apple's Mac strategy eventually worked. It took time for the developer community to grow, lots of other factors were at play, mostly that the PC had limited memory and the Mac could grow without practical limits. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to, in 2023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assuming one were going to approach the idea outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html&quot;&gt;Identity as a Product&lt;/a&gt;, on launch there should be at least two simple products that play the role of MacWrite and MacPaint, giving users a reason to try the platform, and give developers a user community to aim at. Early users would get a special price, but it would &lt;i&gt;never be free.&lt;/i&gt; This is a key part of the positioning of the service. Unlike social networks, users pay for this product, and are viewed in every way as the customer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The MacWrite/MacPaint startup apps would be released as open source so developers not only have the ideas in the product to help them get started, but also working source code. The bundled products would also define documented open file formats, that developer products could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; with, and thus would set the precedent that interop is a core value of this platform. More than any idea, it shows that we are investing in user's power and choice and will commit to getting them lots of software they can use without having to leave their favorite tools behind. There never has been a commercial platform with this ethos, as far as I know.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 when Apple was on the ropes, a fantasy about what I would do if I were Apple's new CEO (this was before Jobs came back in 1997). It more or less outlines a business plan for bootstrapping an app ecosystem. We help developers, as Apple did with my product in 1984, and they commit to deliver products in time to be part of the bootstrap of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There would also be a venture capital part of this platform, and it will mainly focus on product quality, not headcount, or even number of users. Value to the platform will be the major concern. Are they filling a need that's under-served? Will they draw more developers to the platform. Will it help build user confidence? Will it be fun? Do we believe in their vision? ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How revenue flows -- from users to the platform, where it's distributed to app devs, based on the utility of the product. They can if they want, in addition, charge users a license fee, offer a subscription, or whatever, for use of their product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if the users get value from the product, developers will receive dollars from the platform. That means this can work for individuals. Just make a product that people love, and this can be your fulltime job, or maybe even make you rich. No more turning excellent developers into managers and CEOs if that isn't their calling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not the iOS model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The prior art for this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Apple's iOS app ecosystem. The platform vendor here, sells core services to the users, mainly identity and storage, but does not provide any warranty for the developer apps. They can ship whatever they like, and if they want can form associations that might behave like the iOS ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for not wanting to emulate that model, but for me the most important is that it cripples developer creativity. None of my products would have been allowed under the iOS approach. It's as if all music would have to be pre-approved by Disney. Maybe that is how music works these days, but it's it's a very limited form of creativity, imho of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Future-safety&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another constant theme of this blog is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/10/futuresafeArchives.html&quot;&gt;creating persistence&lt;/a&gt; for the web. I have gigabytes worth of text and images on scripting.com, written over the last 29 years. I would like to be able to pay say $10K to have that writing persist at its current address, after I die. That would be something the platform vendor could offer -- safe storage, renewal of the domain name, whatever other services are needed to make the ideas persist in their current form.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have an extensive collection of Trump imagery from the years he was in office, but I haven't used any of them since he left office. I'd rather never write about Trump again, but he's back in the news so I guess it has become unavoidable. So I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/07/01/orangeBlob.png&quot;&gt;orange splat&lt;/a&gt; image in place of any likeness of Trump himself. I see him as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/medical-magazines/human-scourge&quot;&gt;human scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Punishment for us for lacking honor or integrity, humanity. There will of course be a final post about Trump, someday, but sadly we are not there yet.</description>

			<description>Sorry for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paucity&quot;&gt;paucity&lt;/a&gt; of posts in the last few days. I've been moving around NYC in the heat, riding Citibikes and enjoying the change of pace. I will be back home by the end of the week and the normal posting may resume then, Murphy-willing. Meanwhile everything is fine.</description>

I missed my mountain home. I took a nap and decided to make the best of it. I packed my biking helmet, put on biking shorts, went downstairs, got a Citibike, and rode it to Washington Square Park, where I took in the scene. I knew it would cheer me up. The people-watching there is fantastic. And now that weed is legal in NY, everyone was toking, not that this was vastly different from before, WSP has long been a hippie haven. I got another Citibike and rode uptown to one of my favorite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/village-pizza-new-york&quot;&gt;pizza places&lt;/a&gt;, on Eighth Ave between 13th and 14th. Put the two slices of cheese pizza in my backpack, got another Citibike and rode back to the hotel, where I sat down with my laptop and am now updating my blog. I feel like I'm back in the saddle. I have a laptop that works as my mobile desktop. I could cover a convention now. Or write about some new technology (see below) or just take in a vision of Jersey City across the Hudson. I could definitely see living here again. What a transition in a few hours. Bike riding in Manhattan is something I didn't realize how much I missed.</description>

			<title>Miriam is great at summarizing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm having a great time with my new librarian assistant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://miriam.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically she's an AI chatbot that has ingested a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;files&lt;/a&gt; from my archive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did the writing, the development was done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;. I get to be a user here. Very relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the other day I very casually asked Miriam how the weather was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/06/askingMiriamAboutTheWeather.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px dotted silver; padding: 3px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being software, she dutifully answered the question, by referring me to various times I had discussed the weather on Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We don't yet have a way to archive the results of queries, which will, when it's ready allow me to share the actual query with you, so you can take it off in different directions if you're so inclined. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A surprising take-away: I really like how she summarized my posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since Automattic also makes WordPress, which is used for blogging I thought this might be an interesting service they could offer. It could also be used to improve their feeds, esp if writers don't want to include full text. I know this is not a popular view, but I like sites that provide descriptions that are not full text, like the NYT. Much easier to skim. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Miriam's digest of my writing would make a good feed. Maybe this is something we should try. (BTW, I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; provide full text in the feed for all my sites.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to like about her summaries -- they are respectful of the reader. No click-bait anywhere in sight. She's a librarian after all. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Using DALL-E to visualize Miriam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E&quot;&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; to draw &lt;a href=&quot;https://miriam.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt; for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I have a vast library of information nice people are interested in reading. So I have hired a librarian named Miriam. She has a standing desk, in front of a vast library of books, spreading out all around her. She has glasses and a very friendly but wise look to her. She wants to help. She has gray hair and bright eyes and a very big smile.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the first images.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/06/miriamByDolly1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked Dolly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/08/06/miriamByDollyBig.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;elaborate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Identity as a product</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is about a service that is sold to end users and developers. The users pay for the service, and developers invest in it. Once it's up and running it will be the foundation for the web as an open platform for users and developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My personal timeline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until recently I was using Twitter as my identity service. I knew there was some risk, but as long as one of the original founders was still involved, I felt it was pretty safe. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then with new ownership, I had to quickly pivot to create my own identity system, based on email. It took four months from beginning to end to transition &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of my products that used Twitter identity were left to break. I wrote about this effort in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://roadmap.feedland.org/&quot;&gt;roadmap doc&lt;/a&gt; for FeedLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every developer needs the same service. And it's a mess for users that there's a new identity system for every app. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Users need storage. I have to provide them storage for their writing in Drummer, and in FeedLand for things like bookmarks, their personal feeds (ones they generate). Again, I have no interest in this. But I have to do it. And I am stuck paying for their files. &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; should be paying for them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And if my service should ever go off the air, they lose their data (I also provide ways for them to back up their data, but no surprise a lot of them don't do it). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No surprise there's almost no developer community for the web in 2023. The hurdles are pretty close to insurmountable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Describe the service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An identity service as a business. Operated by a strong company with longevity and a good track record for treating users and developers fairly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A standard OAuth interface for logging on. Can handle multiple identities per user, make it easy to switch from one to the other. Prior art, look at how Twitter or Bluesky do this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No per-app storage. Rather functional storage. A folder for PNG images, a folder for OPML outlines, or Markdown files, graphs, spreadsheets, or whatever. And make it easy to form projects with files of whatever type. So a user can have 15 programs that use OPML files and decide which get access to the OPML folder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a key point -- such a system enforces the need for interop. Teaches users they have a right to demand it. When users know this, good things happen in markets. (Example: Podcasting has not gotten siloized because users know they have a right to choice in listening apps.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dropbox got incredibly close to doing this, but punted.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Amazon should do this but for some reason hasn't. They have end-user identity working (their shopping system) and they lead everyone in storage as a service. Connecting the dots seems to be incredibly easy for them, but they haven't done it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dave Winer, Human</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I started at Harvard in 2003, one of the first things I did was get my official ID card. When I got it, there was my picture. Underneath that was my name, and underneath that my status: Officer. It was a bit breathtaking. A few minutes before I was a schmuck. Now I was an officer at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just had that kind of experience again. I went to my profile page on DALL-E, which I've been playing with lately, and there it said I was:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/05/daveWinerHuman.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid silver; margin-left: 35px; padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What an unusual perspective. Here's a place where saying someone is human is saying something. A familiar tweak I haven't felt in a while -- I am once again living in the future. 2023 has been like that for me, a lot of living in the past, and bringing it forward into the future, and then living in that future. I hope to do a lot more of that. Shoveling ideas from 20+ years ago that never got a chance into the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You know what we say about that..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I get this feeling sometimes when I start using a new keyboard, as I did this morning. It's a nice one, the same model as it replaces, which I just plain wore out. It will go to one of my other computers where it won't have so much work to do. Its profile would say: Dave's Keyboard, Keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tina Weymouth</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did some searches on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Weymouth&quot;&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/a&gt;, the bass player for the Talking Heads. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_BfWwbCrw&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with her husband, he said everyone's eyes were on her when they performed, I thought I was the only one. When I listen to a Talking Heads song with a strong beat (a lot of them) I think of her. That's what she represents, the driving power of the group is a woman. Try listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXdVgILd38U&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; and look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AB5stBgMSi6KCAVa4-pV7pTOKKxwIwrtQw:1691244562327&amp;q=tina+weymouth&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6mfb62MWAAxW2kIkEHQGiDhMQ0pQJegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1663&amp;bih=1151&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/05/tina.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Tina Weymouth, bass player for Talking Heads.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Try listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXdVgILd38U&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; and look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AB5stBgMSi6KCAVa4-pV7pTOKKxwIwrtQw:1691244562327&amp;q=tina+weymouth&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6mfb62MWAAxW2kIkEHQGiDhMQ0pQJegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1663&amp;bih=1151&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of her." created="Sat, 05 Aug 2023 14:06:16 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/08/05.html#a140616"/>

And whether most of American culture treats individuals like mindless blobs, the justice system is built on trust in the wisdom of the people, who once so challenged, don't let us down.</description>

I want to get more systematic in working on FeedLand. When you're reading a docs page, there's a command in the menu that opens the same page in GitHub. If you're a FeedLand user, you may want to read the new docs, it's always a good idea I find to review the docs of products I use. You often see things you didn't pick up on the first time around.</description>

As president he ruled like an autocrat, with contempt for the most American idea, that we pick our own leaders. So the jury will be asked to decide if he should go to jail for being an autocratic president. In other words, will the system validate itself. It's like asking a program to decide if it's functioning correctly. If the validator works, it should reject any argument that Trump makes. Sorry, you're going to jail because you tried to rob us of our right as citizens to replace you with Joe Biden. It's pure, brilliant, gets right to the heart of the matter. Is our system of voting real, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; we choose the president, or does our system crumble when it's violated by its top official. Finally we're asking the right question, making the correct accusation. And if it's decided the way it should obviously be decided our country says no to this bullshit, no matter what a bunch of our fellow citizens want.

They traded them for young prospects, players they can develop. Maybe the Mets realized that they can't buy a kickass team, and that real fans aren't inspired by money, we want love, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the Mets will once again be the Mets, in the spirit of Casey Stengel, Cleon Jones, Tom Seaver, Tug McGraw, Mookie Wilson and Ed Kranepool and far too many soulful players to mention in this small space.</description>

They traded them for young prospects, players they can develop. Maybe the Mets realized that they can't buy a kickass team, and that real fans aren't inspired by money, we want love, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the Mets will once again be the Mets, in the spirit of Casey Stengel, Cleon Jones, Tom Seaver, Tug McGraw, Mookie Wilson and Ed Kranepool and far too many soulful players to mention in this small space." created="Tue, 01 Aug 2023 21:05:55 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/01/mrmet.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/08/01.html#a210555"/>

Well the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/how-jason-aldeans-small-town-became-a-rightwing-anthem/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; I tried was exactly as depraved, incompetent and disgusting as the NYT podcast. Do we disapprove of Jason Aldean's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; because we want to deprive him of his right to free speech as the podcast says over and over. Please. We object to it because it's an expression by white people of their desire to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching&quot;&gt;lynch&lt;/a&gt; black people, like they used to do when America was Great, as the slogan goes. They want to make it Great Again. Specifically, so you could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/26/lynchings-memorial-us-south-montgomery-alabama&quot;&gt;lynch&lt;/a&gt; blacks, again, when you don't like the way they look at you or your sister or when they have land you want to buy and don't want to pay a fair price for, or when a rich white guy made you feel like shit and you wanted to prove there were people &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/26/lynchings-memorial-us-south-montgomery-alabama&quot;&gt;terrorize&lt;/a&gt;. When a black life was worth nothing. And btw, they're not just coming for people of color and gays and trans people, or to turn women into slaves, they also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution&quot;&gt;Hitler's final solution&lt;/a&gt; for Jews. It's time for one of these pubs to have the guts to say out loud what the actual problem is with the Trumpsters like Aldean. They want to go back to when they could kill anyone with impunity. And btw, it doesn't matter if he &quot;really&quot; believes it or if it's a business model. It makes absolutely no difference. Someone should teach these pitiful spineless so-called reporters how and why to be angry. BTW, I live in a small town so fuck you Jason Aldean.</description>

			<title>They write themselves</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid08DaZVAx1dsi3zaAckQBZYu9UF3CmypwFB9s7ntEQJzKG5f7bqTfPsn6x5QwCEpYgl&quot;&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My blog posts always &quot;just write themselves.&quot; If they don't I do something else. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For me, a blog post is just the culmination of something I've been thinking about or a story I've told in person a dozen times.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It has to pop to the top of my consciousness a dozen times or more before I'm ready to write about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I blog therefore because I: 1. Think. 2. Tell stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
