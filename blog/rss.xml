			<description>Experiment: call your bank. Tell them you have a security issue. See how long it takes to freeze the account.</description>

			<description>I've found that credit card companies are very tuned into security. If you call them up with a security issue, within a minute they have put a freeze on the account, and send you a new card. I generally get the new card the next day. And by &quot;a minute&quot; I mean a minute after the phone rings, not after navingating voicemail hell, getting upsold and hung up on, and being reminded your call is important to us, and did you know that you can get all the information you need on the web? Please hold and an operator will be with you soon. We apologize for the inconvenience.</description>

			<description>Programming note. I've decided that, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and other outliners, the special icon for tweets is annoying. Especially when it's just an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/10/tweetsWithIcons.png&quot;&gt;outline of tweets&lt;/a&gt;. They will still have the &quot;tweet&quot; type attribute, but they will display with the default wedge.</description>

			<description>Just did my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-hosting&quot;&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt; session. I have a suggestion. When you start a space, ask the user if they want to set a time limit. Then display the time limit for everyone to see. Maybe even have a clock counting down. And when it's over, just shut it off. I'd do more of them I think.</description>

			<title>GitHub notifications via WebSockets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new project I started. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An app that stores files on GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Other apps can be notified when any of these files changes, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is accomplished by a very thin publicly accessible server app that gets &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks&quot;&gt;WebHook&lt;/a&gt; calls from GitHub, accepts subscriptions from browser apps and mobile apps, really any kind of app, over WS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that it relies on GitHub. It performs well, and it'll probably be around for a while. And it's free to use, all you have to do is set up an account. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Other apps are using it as backend-storage for web apps. I am interested in trying that out too.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The files themselves contain the ws:// address of the server app as metadata, so all you need is the address of the data to hook up to the correct server that does notifications over WS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a schematic of the relationship between the apps. I apologize for my handwriting which used to be much better. I hardly write by hand anymore these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Schematic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This, btw is exactly the infrastructure neeed by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bhc3.com/2009/01/16/before-there-was-twitter-there-was-dave-winers-instant-outliner/&quot;&gt;Instant Outliner&lt;/a&gt; via OPML. The apps that generate the OPML could be outliners, or really any app that wants to deal in outline-structured data. But the protocol is general enough so it could be used for any data file type. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In a few days, once the app has been running for a while, and I have a good demo put together, I'll publish a pointer to a compatible OPML file, and provide example code running in a browser for requesting notification via Web Sockets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today's journalism is not a wartime journalism. Even though we've been at war in west Asia for 20 years, and in a civil war 30. Journalism has been living in the 80s, I guess. The assumption being that elections and laws have meaning. In war, elections don't matter. You can't win a war in court.</description>

			<description>I tried to listen to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/max-boot-on-future-democracy-joe-manchin-gops-threat/id1523896927?i=1000524616180&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; today, an interview with another political insider, Max Boot, member of a political thinktank and columnist for the Washington Post. It's the same discussion you can hear on every cable news show or political podcast. Basic question -- what can we do to stop the Repubs from taking over the government and destroying everything. They run through all the options and come to the conclusion that there actually is nothing to be done. I got through the first ten minutes, on a 1/2 hour drive to town, so I paused his show, got out my iPhone and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/08/dearJoe.m4a&quot;&gt;recorded my response&lt;/a&gt;. I don't like picking on Joe, he's a nice person. The thing that makes him different from say Chris Hayes is that he might listen. There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; something that can be done. But it means leaving business as usual behind. You can't win a war with an enemy that is 1/2 of your government. So listen to my 12-minute answer to Joe.</description>

			<description>When your “worth” rises, that’s not income. You don’t pay income tax until you sell the asset whose worth increased. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax&quot;&gt;Journalism&lt;/a&gt; almost never explains this. That’s why if your net worth rises by say $1 billion, you might not pay any income tax.</description>

			<description>An example. I inherited &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_retirement_account&quot;&gt;IRAs&lt;/a&gt; from my parents. You can put income into an IRA to defer taxes until you retire, when presumably you will have less income and therefore will pay less tax. My parents' IRAs outlived them, so I'm holding them, the taxes still deferred. They will be one of the last things I sell to pay the rent and buy groceries. It might be that their IRAs will outlive me too! I also am holding stock that has appreciated. Nothing like Bezos or Musk, but I don't want to sell the stock until I have to because I don't want to pay taxes on the appreciation, and I think/hope the stock will hold its value. In other words, everyone tries to keep taxes to a minimum, not just the super rich. The government knows this, and uses that desire to create incentives. In the case of IRAs, they want people to save for retirement.</description>

			<description>I bet our European allies say privately to Biden, we won't begin to trust the US again until you put Trump behind bars. I would if I were them. Hey I would if I were me! Trump's insurrection is ongoing. What would you expect, we're not putting up any resistance. And right now, theoretically at least, the resistance occupies the White House. I don't know if Biden understands why he was elected.</description>

			<description>Today's song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE&quot;&gt;The swimming song&lt;/a&gt;. This was the song of the summer of 1978 in Madison. I was in love with a beautiful young woman. I was a beautiful young man. I had so many friends. We all went swimming. I had a key to the computer lab at the university. I would go swimming every day. Sometimes in the lap pool out by the Ag School. Other times at a flooded rock quarry outside town. We went to the farmer's market on Sundays up by the Capitol. Fish fry on Friday night at Crandall's. This was life at its best. I had everything. I'm not doing too bad these days, and I have the memory of swimming in love, health and creativity when I was young. Nothing better than that.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm so tired of people trying to figure out if Trump is crazy or what. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what we know about him.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He's a bastard.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He would go out of his way to hurt anyone, no exceptions. Even his family.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does he know he lost? Sure, and   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He knows everyone knows, including his fans.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump likes that he can get all his fans to say what they know are lies, and force the people he hates to keep saying that Trump is lying and then revel that they're too chickenshit to do anything about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is the school yard bully from Queens, a person I've met many times growing up, who has no shame and his only love is causing deep pain for others.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing he didn't find a way to nuke the planet while he was president. I'm sure he would have loved it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Electric Drummer screen shot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A progress report on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Drummer is mainly a web app, but it is also a desktop app for the Mac known as Electric Drummer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is coming along nicely. I've been using ED for a couple of weeks now, and find it's way better than any other outliner I've used for web writing. It should be, it's the newest, and has lots of promising features. But it's really nice when the software you've been dreaming about, and working hard to create, is suddenly usable for what you designed it for. Electric Drummer is there now. Yippee!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/06/edScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my workspace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't hate the Nets for any reason other than they are (I hope) the last instance of a superteam, a concept pioneered by LeBron James, whose career as a superteam founder is now over, btw, as of this week. Basketball is a sport. I know it's also a business, but I don't give my heart to businesses. Sorry.</description>

			<title>[[Drummer]] docs tease</title>

Which means theoretically, anything you can do with a mouse and keyboard you could also do in a script. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first app I've created a scripting interface for is Twitter, because I use it so much, and so many other people do. I felt it could immediately benefit from being scriptable. I haven't covered anything like the whole functionality of Twitter, it wouldn't even be possible because their API doesn't cover it all, but -- a lot is possible with the verb set we have working right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot of Drummer's docs UI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Brooklyn Nets are not a real basketball team. They are just a shell that Kevin Durant pwned by signing with them. Kind of the way Apple didn't really buy NeXT, it was the other way around. Anyway, the Durant's &quot;Nets&quot; might win a title, or try a couple of times, but either way the train will move on and leave the Nets as wrecked as the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is a trend, it's no longer innovative, curious, fun or even good basketball. Durant was bored in Golden State. He'll get bored in Brooklyn too. Imho, they're boring right now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Anyway, the Durant's &quot;Nets&quot; might win a title, or try a couple of times, but either way the train will move on and leave the Nets as wrecked as the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is a trend, it's no longer innovative, curious, fun or even good basketball. Durant was bored in Golden State. He'll get bored in Brooklyn too. Imho, they're boring right now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 03 Jun 2021 02:41:35 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/02.html#a024135"/>
