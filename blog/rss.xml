			<description>Every time I read about how Biden's popularity is dropping, I wonder if there's any reality to this. If it were really a troubling sign that means in the next election, Americans will do what Germans did in 1932, we'll vote into power a fascist party, and open the US to concentration camps and mass exterminations of our own citizens. You may think this is wild, but before Covid the idea of 700K Americans dying of a disease that was largely preventable, because of disinformation from the government itself, that would have seemed like a paranoid delusion. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/&quot;&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to preserve that perspective. If the US actually does vote Repubs into power, we deserve what we get.</description>

My rating -- Good, after watching the first five episodes. I want to see how it turns out, it could become Loved, depending on what they do with the story, which so far is gripping.</description>

Best line so far: &quot;A sad white person is still a white person.&quot; Try changing that to black and see if it gets through the censors. Also a reporter that gives up his sources shouldn't be a reporter.</description>

			<description>Here's the big problem with Ted Lasso season 2. You have to like at least one character in a sitcom like Ted Lasso. That was the charm of season one, the star, the person the show is named after, was very likeable, and so were almost all of the others. Nice people, you cheer for them. This season you have to brace yourself because at any moment the formerly likeable Ted Lasso is going to do something supremely assholelike. I'm not joking. Come on. Anyway it's just like Apple to switch the user interface radically without any warning, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs&quot;&gt;ask Gruber&lt;/a&gt; about where they moved the freaking &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-tabs-for-webpages-sfri11576/mac&quot;&gt;tabs&lt;/a&gt; in the new version of Safari. It's conceivable that a character could reveal a very well hidden dark side and pull it off, but it's not very common and they totally don't pull it off.</description>

			<description>Welcome to October. The monthly ritual is done, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/09.opml&quot;&gt;OPML for September&lt;/a&gt; is uploaded to the GitHub repo, where interested &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; geeks can use it to experiment with interop. There's over &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;four years&lt;/a&gt; worth of archives there to play with. Also &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; testers can see techniques that work in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/span&gt; blogs that they may not have seen.</description>

			<description>Facebook tells me today is &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakesav.in/&quot;&gt;Jake Savin's&lt;/a&gt; birthday. He's a young man, I don't know exactly how young. Jake worked at &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/span&gt; on Manila. Oct 1 was also my dear departed &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;uncle's birthday&lt;/a&gt;, it would have been his 76th. I miss him every day. He would have loved the web, especially Wikipedia. Ken was always looking stuff up in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please&quot;&gt;Information Please Almanac&lt;/a&gt;. Ken's mind would no doubt be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outspanned/status/1437301987884871682&quot;&gt;blown&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis is legal in much of the US, at least the parts of the US you'd want to visit. He grew the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikileaf.com/thestash/what-is-sinsemilla/&quot;&gt;sinsimilla&lt;/a&gt; back in the 70s and 80s. I was trying to explain to a friend what that was, to no avail because all weed is seedless these days. Ken had an efficient way of killing off the male plants. He'd cover and uncover his seedlings with a blanket to simulate spring. The tiny baby plants would flower, and thus reveal their gender. Only the female plants produce the resin that humans like so much. 😀</description>
