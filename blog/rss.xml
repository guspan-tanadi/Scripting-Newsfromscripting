			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1422660407890747392&quot;&gt;In my humble opinion&lt;/a&gt;, the thing to do is insist on being able to buy cable service without paying for Fox. But none of the talking heads will call for this because they all depend on a good relationship with the cable system owners. A very deep conflict of interest, across the board. It's like software devs can't afford to piss off Google or Apple, or else they'll figure out a way to kick them out of their app stores. There was a famous slogan at Microsoft back in the day, &quot;No version of DOS will ship until Lotus doesn't run.&quot; I'm sure it was just a joke. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I went to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/migliorelli-farm-stand-phoenicia&quot;&gt;farm produce stand&lt;/a&gt; on 28 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Migliorelli+Farms/@42.0329671,-74.2749173,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xdd7ed88ac0c706ec!8m2!3d42.0329439!4d-74.2749978&quot;&gt;Mt Tremper&lt;/a&gt; yesterday to get fresh local peaches, just now coming into season, and everyone was masked up. I think we're doing the wise thing in NY state. It's easy to put a mask on, much easier than being intubated and dying. The peaches are the best part of the year except for the apple harvest. On the other hand at the hardware store, I was the only one wearing a mask. So maybe it's not &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; peaches yet.</description>

			<description>Should we be excited about big silos and podcasting? Apple, Spotify, etc. Well if you like the way news works now on the web, I'm sure you'll love what they do to podcasting. On the other hand, what we have now is what most sane users want. So I say resist them if you can.</description>

			<description>Watching the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Olympics&lt;/span&gt; is ridiculously hard given that it's 2021 and our entire entertainment system is computerized and networked. They've had plenty of time to adapt, but the entertainment industry is stuck in the 1980s cable model, where ever they can get away with it. Thankfully &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/span&gt; helped to budge them. There should be, if everything were sane, a network location I can go to where I see the schedule of the whole event, past, present and future. I can schedule reminders for upcoming events. And go back, like using YouTube to watch events I missed. Instead I have to hunt and peck, and depend on luck, and the programmer's sense of what'll be popular, and endure NBC's business model, like only making some events available on Peacock, a service I don't use and do not want to subscribe to. It's the same mess as with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews&quot;&gt;news on the web&lt;/a&gt;. I subscribe to services I never watch. There are a hundred thousand shows on and nothing I want to see, and the stuff I do want to see is inaccessible. Come on. Isn't there a person in power somewhere in TV-Land who is just as fed up as everyone else must be? Meanwhile we should give up the pretense that the athletes represent the USA, they rep NBC and should wear a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/02/nbcLogo.png&quot;&gt;peacock&lt;/a&gt; on their uniforms and salute the NBC flag and their anthem whatever that might be.</description>

I am too young to have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_DiMaggio&quot;&gt;Joe DiMaggio&lt;/a&gt; fan, and I never loved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees&quot;&gt;Yankees&lt;/a&gt; (ugh) but I know what it feels like to be missing a hero. Where is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/15/172451.html?title=mcneilTheJeremyLinOfTheNyt&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;?

At least this former Daily podcast listener turn our lonely eyes to him. Where is his Twitter account? How about a weekly podcast with him and someone to play the role of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barbaro&quot;&gt;Michael Barbaro&lt;/a&gt;, an interested neophyte to represent us, to quiz the hardened Old Man of Covid, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/span&gt;? A weekly commentary on what's going on with Covid. That's a &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/span&gt; I'd pay money for, if only for the peace of mind and the chance that his wisdom will save my life, and the lives of others.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; is coming along nicely. There's a small test group, that includes a couple of old friends who are experienced software developers. The focus in the first part of this process is &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; as a programming environment. I don't want distractions from that at first, because I remember how important it is to review and re-review everything about a platform like this before trying to make it work for users. Programmers at this stage will understand breakage  more than others. I'm doing what I've been doing for the last four--plus years, developing for myself, following my wants and intuition, not letting it be driven by others. Ouija boards yield a certain kind of software, the world is filled with it. You can only get so far if you have to reach consensus. I'm driving towards a place I've been before. And I know I'm doing it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Something about &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt; has been bugging me and I think I just figured it out. Suppose you have a topic that's starting to develop, and you want to hijack its links to redirect to a page that includes more information than just a scrolling list of references. Well I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/24/150234.html?title=theGlossaryInLittleOutliner&quot;&gt;the glossary&lt;/a&gt; for that, I just realized. I can override what double-square brackets means for a certain term, have it link to a page which also has a list of the references. Boom and bing. Do they have these overrides at &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; products?</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Color_Purple_(film)&quot;&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/a&gt; on HBO last night. I'm looking for ways to learn what black people say about the black experience in America through history. It was a weird choice, because, even though the actors are black, it was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg_filmography&quot;&gt;Steven Spielberg movie&lt;/a&gt;, like ET or Jaws. Always upbeat, even when a husband is raping his sister-in-law. The weirdest thing to have Indiana Jones type music playing while Oprah Winfrey is being beaten by a mob of white men. So bizarre. But I loved all the actors, esp of course Whoopi Goldberg, and there was at times a bit of suspension of disbelief, but the Spielbergishness of the movie was very awkard.</description>

But I loved all the actors, esp of course Whoopi Goldberg, and there was at times a bit of suspension of disbelief, but the Spielbergishness of the movie was very awkard." created="Sun, 01 Aug 2021 16:49:00 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/01/purpleFlowers.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/08/01.html#a164900"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1421859236842250241&quot;&gt;Someone&lt;/a&gt; should write a book about the lost software ideas of the 70s and 80s. There's a lot of reinventing going on. Layers of reinvention. It'd be great if there was one book earnest devs could read, ones who want to build on what was learned in the past.</description>

			<description>I usually do my bike rides in the afternoon, but today I knew the park would be really crowded, I live in a place where people go to get away in the summer, so I went first thing in the morning. What they say is true, the exercise powers you through the day. It's now mid-afternoon and I'm still feeling the strength in my body from the workout. I think I may reorient my day.</description>

			<description>A number of years ago I wrote about the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/03/27/submission.html&quot;&gt;submission&lt;/a&gt;. No point fighting some things. I also was learning at the time that there is nothing you think of, that has to do with values, that isn't projection. Science is different, using your senses and intellect to draw inferences. But opinions and values, is just you broadcasting everything you feel to everyone in the world. But really it's an audience of one, you. Combine the two, and years later I realize that submission to yourself must come before submission to another. Give up the struggles between who you feel you should be and who you actually are. If you submit to yourself, you can stop worrying about that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The monthly ritual is complete. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/07.opml&quot;&gt;OPML for July 2021&lt;/a&gt;. And just for fun, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/scriptingNewsArchiveInOpmlFromMay2017.zip&quot;&gt;zipped up&lt;/a&gt; an archive going back to May 2017, when I deployed my &quot;new&quot; content management system. It's all a matter of perspective I guess. 2017 seems to me like a short time ago, but then a lot has happened in the interim. Some of it is in the contents of the blog. I think some interesting apps could be built using this archive as a seed. So far there haven't been any takers that I know of, but I think we may be getting close with all the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; activity.</description>
