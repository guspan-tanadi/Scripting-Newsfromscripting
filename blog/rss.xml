			<title>Cuomo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone polled New York voters on whether they want Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign? I haven’t seen any results. The journalists and politicians pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; out just like they’re pushing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/13/politics/andrew-cuomo-chuck-schumer-kirsten-gillibrand/index.html&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; out now. Why not have a &lt;i&gt;somewhat&lt;/i&gt; democratic process? Wouldn’t the cause be better served?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why Cuomo matters. First, being fair to everyone matters. And when you see someone rushed off, as is happening with Cuomo, and what happened to Franken, and other people you probably never heard of, this has a nasty side-effect with people who identify with Cuomo and Franken and the others. They think you're going to do the same to them. Some would say if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about. Hah. You know where that comes from. That's the kind of shit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; used to say about people who worried about being purged in one of his un-American trials. It's a common thread, and totally anti-democratic. We believe in due process here, not in mob rule. And what's happening here is mob rule, even if you aren't willing to say so publicly, you know it is. Take a close look at why you're not willing to say it publicly. What does that say about where you live. And what does it say about you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The more they try to rush Cuomo's resignation, the more I want it to stop. I'm a NY voter, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Threadviewer update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Threadviewer is back up. I have to admit to having serious brainfog about this project, but I slowed down, and did some more verbs docs, and just got it working much better than it was previously. Here's the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370863807715762179&quot;&gt;test thread&lt;/a&gt; and here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://threadviewer.com/1370863807715762179&quot;&gt;threadviewer view&lt;/a&gt; of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That should continue to work, even as I post more tweets through the night and into tomorrow (knock wood). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should also reflect any additions and deletions to the thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However after 24 hours, it will disappear. Obviously that's not good! But one step at a time. I want to make sure this much works as I expect it would. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What we want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure we all want the same thing, what's fair, to be ourselves, for people to care about us. I don't think it matters what our identity is, at the core, we're pretty similar. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we have in common is that we believe and share lies about each other. That keeps us isolated and from working with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule I believe is our salvation. Respect the differences, and always when you can, give the benefit of the doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone says someone else is evil, focus on what you know not what they say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why I wanted the vaccine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who I have known for a long time, who I love very much, who is one of the smartest people I know, who I would trust with my life, who says she does not want the vaccine. I have told her I'm going to write about it, without naming her, because the goal isn't to shame her, not even slightly, but rather to explore why I was enthusiastic to receive the vaccination, and to be open about it, to share my thoughts and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, why I wanted the vaccine. The main reason: I was horrified to think of dying alone, suffocating, feeling awful, surrounded by people who were overworked and exhausted. Your body is theirs. Your life is in their hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are harsh places. It's never quiet, the lights are always on, people come and go at all times. You're in pain, weak, and groggy from the meds they give you, and you have to grapple with whatever the future holds for you. I've been there myself, with parents who were gravely ill, this is not a place you want to go in good times, and it most definitely is not a place to be during a pandemic, where the odds of survival, if you're sick enough to be in the hospital, are awful. 1 in 10, say. So you're lying there, feeling terrible, with no one to help your soul through the most difficult thing a person has to do, knowing you're almost certainly not getting out of there alive. The fear of dying that way overwhelms me. I'd do almost anything to avoid it. Take a vaccine, twice? Sure! No problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so what about the other side. Why would you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to take a vaccine. I listened, and skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandemic.solari.com/family-financial-disclosure-form-for-covid-19-injections/&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt; my friend sent. And I thought about it. Conceding that the vaccine makers are all big companies with problems in their history, I also know they went through a vetting process with the FDA, and other regulators elsewhere. Yes, it's possible that the government officials could be bribed, but I honestly don't believe they were. Had it only been the Trump government that was supervising it, I would have been more suspicious than I am now. I'd say I'm 95% confident that the FDA can be trusted, and they say the vaccines can be trusted so that's 95% good enough for me. Considering the risk of the awful death I outlined in the first part, this would be enough for me to risk it. But there's more. Suppose the government was in cahoots with the drug manufacturers, what is the probability that that fact would not leak? That's where my real trust lies. I think most professionals in every profession want to do it well. But in this case, &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; doctor and researcher would have to be in on it. And that's just not possible, imho. The world doesn't work that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As much as I love and trust this friend, I also have a friend who is a biomedical researcher who I've known since he was a little person, five or six years old. A real brat who grew up to be a wonderful friend, who I have been talking with since the beginning of the pandemic. He's now in his mid-30s, and because of his field, had early access to the vaccine. He took it. The question of me not taking it never came up in our talks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I follow lots of doctors' advice. Some of it has been awful and left me with disabilities. Ones that I can live with and are not painful, and ones which are actually hard to live with. So I am very skeptical of the competence of individual doctors. But I also understand that their prescriptions are the result of a huge amount of testing, statistics, cost and risk analysis. With vaccines, they aren't just prescribing a treatment for individuals, I also got the vaccine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is true of all medicine. The drugs we take to control our diseases aren't designed for each of us individually, they are designed for all humans, we are all assumed to be the same, because there's no other sane way to do it. That's why they print the side-effects warnings on the labels, so we know that while this treatment works for most people, for some it will hurt them, and for some it &lt;i&gt;will kill&lt;/i&gt; them. I don't want to die that way either, but I understand statistics and probability and I also understand that I am part of a community, and my health affects yours in a pandemic, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to the story, but this is enough for now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Slow down to hurry up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm juggling too many balls in my development work. I just lost about 24 hours tracking down a problem. I had some code outside of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitter&quot;&gt;davetwitter&lt;/a&gt; module that really belonged in there, so after a half-day of working on something else, I decided to quickly move the code from where it was to where I wanted it. However since I was actively developing the davetwitter module, I included it using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; call to include a copy of the file, without going through NPM; and here's the key thing, in one place, and in another I used NPM. I couldn't understand why a properly initialized config object at startup would all of a sudden be completely uninitialized when I used it later. The answer was there were two davetwitters, one initialized the other not. A sloppy mistake I would never have made in a bootstrap. This kind of thing only happens when factoring. I guess the moral of the story is I should only attempt these integrations at the beginning of the day, when no other project is loaded into my brain, and I'd be more likely to spot these kinds of mismatches. In the end it cost me a lot of time to try to do it quickly. That's a lesson I've had to learn many times, and still am learning. I even have a slogan for it -- &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Someone said tweets are like potato chips and therefore should be limited to 280 chars. I took a few screen shots of tweets that lead to long reads or watches. These are not potato chips. People think of twitter as a home for baby squirrels, this was clever marketing in the beginning, but now it's where the political and cultural world is centered. The former president of the United States was banned from twitter. The potato chip people need to let that sink in. It's a place where real communication happens. The better the tools, imho, the better it works.</description>

			<description>They like to say the apps are better than the web, but I find the opposite is true. When I click a link in the twitter app it doesn’t take me to the web. I don’t have all my tools where ever it is they take me. and When I click a link to a tweet I’m taken to a dead end. Ughh.</description>

			<title>Threadviewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new app is coming soon called Threadviewer, not quite ready yet, hopefully tomorrow. Here's how it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You give it the ID of a tweet that's at the top of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. The app loads all the tweets it can find that are replies to the tweet with that ID, written by the author of the original tweet and shows them inside a box, in chronologic order, as a nice sequence of easy to read paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It does what I need it to do. Now twitter can be a writing space for me that flows into my blog. I also have thread.center if I need it, that goes the other way. BTW, you can use this with WordPress, Medium, Substack, email, whatever you like. It's just copy/paste from the threadviewer rendering. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's an here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/11/aThreadviewerUrl.png&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a Threadviewer URL. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Twitter Thread</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote to be sucked into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Medium was founded in 2012, I was afraid they were going to do to writing what YouTube did to video, what Twitter did to short outbursts. Medium is a nice product, but it was too strong, and too much of a silo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Medium didn't exist I'd have the same fear about Substack, but they are there to keep each other from dominating. And I still hope a more distributed approach appears, esp since running a server these days is getting much easier and cheaper and is only going to get more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder why Medium hasn't directly competed with Substack. It isn't that hard to ad email subscriptions to a product like Medium. Have they done it and I missed it? I would have thought it would be automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with Clubhouse. A bit of a juggernaut. I tried it, was briefly addicted, and then for some reason I lost interest. It was a time-filler, like Twitter is, for example. When I reach a milestone in other work, I take a break by checking out Twitter. You can't do that with Clubhouse. There is no 15 minute Clubhouse break. It's either a few seconds, or an hour. I don't usually have an hour in the middle of the day to goof off, and at night I'm not at the computer and in need of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Twitter is going where Clubhouse is. I'll try it. I think it has a chance because Twitter and Clubhouse really should be more integrated. And Twitter itself doesn't live with the limits outside devs have. They can create connections we can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world somehow has missed that Twitter has a great API, and it runs fast, and they are expanding it, not contracting it. Briefly, when Dick Costolo was CEO, they made a mistake that they quickly corrected, by cutting off certain (but not all) external devs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then they've been very liberal and reliable. I love using the Twitter API. Of course I would love it even more if they got rid of the 280 char limit. I'm usually good at figuring out angles on things in tech, but I have never seen the logic behind this limit, when they allow so many other much more complex data types to be attached to tweets. I would have thought given all their other payload types that by now they would have a 64K or greater limit to the amount of text attached to a tweet&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Playing with a thread viewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been accumulating tools to use Twitter as a blog-writing tool, for times when I'm not near my desktop the main place I write.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one was a tool that, using the Twitter API, gathered all my tweets in the last 24 hours and categorized them as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Original tweets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Replies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RTs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to get the original stuff first, to give me a way to jot down an idea in Twitter, so I could recall it later when I'm officially writing my blog for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It worked okay, it was great at first actually, but it required too much work to reassemble a twitter thread for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted was a tool that could gather a whole thread, like the one you're reading now, into a series of paragraphs, that could then be edited into a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there was a missing feature in the Twitter API. No way to ask for all the replies to a given tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then a few days ago while my mind was wandering, I figured it out.

			<description>If Osterholm's analysis is right, and it seems likely, the virus is going to explode again soon. What a difference it would make if we had a leader who could do fireside chats and keep us all directed in the most positive way,  as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Cuomo%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; did last year. Biden is doing the right things, but he doesn't have a good fireside manner. Cuomo was one-in-a-generation. I think that is now impossible. I think ultimately this was a product of very bad judgment on his part and journalism without perspective.</description>

			<title>My kitchen is mine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing happens when woman friends visit. They take over my kitchen. Move things around. Hide them. Put things in places they don't belong. Sometimes I find them years later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got so used to it, and btw angered about it, that I tried to make a deal with my aunt when she and my uncle came to visit when I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California&quot;&gt;Calif&lt;/a&gt;. I said if you tell me why you want to do it, I'll let you. (At least they asked, I think that was probably my uncle's influence, I should have asked him why they asked, usually they don't, they just start doing). Anyway, when I made the offer Aunt Marsha said nothing and went ahead and started cleaning and reorganizing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It. Happens. All. The. Time. And I hate it. I fucking hate it. I tell them this before they do it. I tell them while they're doing it. I warn them, don't mess with the kitchen, after they've done it, and they do it again. Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's what it says to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We like our men incapable of taking care of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You are a man, therefore you cannot take care of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I will do it for you. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now on their side -- I don't think there's much thought to it. I think I am invisible to them. Not a factor. Subconsciously somehow they got the idea that there is no woman who owns this kitchen therefore I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked many times if they would do this to a woman friend, come for a visit and start rearranging and cleaning their kitchen. No one has said yes, but I think some of them actually do it. But most won't because it's such a sign of disrespect. I guess maybe they can see other women. Or they can relate to it, they can imagine how they would feel if their friend tried to take over &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for all men (and neither can you btw) but some of us want powerful and capable women friends. People who have big positive ideas and try to do their part to help. More than anything what we want from women is to be seen as real people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's help each other, and start by giving us all the benefit of the doubt, and assume we mean well and can and want to take care of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token&quot;&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are easy to understand. It's like buying a work of art to hang in your house. Everyone else can have a print. The print is just as beautiful, but the original can possibly appreciate in value. It's controversial because it uses the blockchain (probably the first time I've used that word on this blog) which uses a lot of energy. Isn't there a way to achieve the same without that cost?</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token&quot;&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are easy to understand. It's like buying a work of art to hang in your house. Everyone else can have a print. The print is just as beautiful, but the original can possibly appreciate in value. It's controversial because it uses the blockchain (probably the first time I've used that word on this blog) which uses a lot of energy. Isn't there a way to achieve the same without that cost?" created="Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:28:29 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/05/norm.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/08.html#a132829"/>

			<description>I'm thinking about selling one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/fridayDave.mp3&quot;&gt;my first podcast&lt;/a&gt;s, the one that got the ball rolling, that started my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt; podcasts, and then inspired a community to develop, which caused more podcasts and on and on. People are dismissive of NFTs, and critical, but there's been no other way for a maker of new media types such as myself to get credit for our creations. Looking back, I certainly would have led the bootstrap of podcasting, even if I didn't get credit for it, someone had to do it, we needed to use the internet for audible expression and no one else seemed able to do it. But I'd like young people to know how these things work, they don't have to start companies to make a significant contribution. They can stay in their art.</description>

			<description>It took a while for me to get how common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; is. If someone says, in a discussion, that you're upset, they're gaslighting. It's wrong because: 1. They have no insight into how you feel. 2. They're changing the subject. Gaslighting is insidious.</description>

			<description>A bit of advice to people who want a vaccine but aren't yet eligable. It pays to hang around places that do vaccinations near closing time, because they're required to get extra vaccines into people's arms, if they don't they're wasted. There are, apparently, lots of cancellations and no-shows in some places, so your chances are  getting better all the time. Just want to be sure everyone knows.</description>

			<title>Virus, Democracy, Climate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our focus should be sharply on these three things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Virus &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Democracy&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Climate&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every other issue is a distant non-priority. Yet of course the news keeps gravitating around things other than the mutating virus and people's refusal to mitigate, how we're going to get our republic back on solid ground, and what are we doing to radically change how we live so we can survive the climate catastrophes that are already here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can find a solution for the problem with Governor Cuomo. Have him wear a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uedata.amazon.com/Smartphone-Powerful-Action-Sports-Camera/dp/B016M99GAW&quot;&gt;head camera&lt;/a&gt; 7 by 24. Every word is recorded, every image, from his point of view. It should be designed like one of those lights coal miners wear, and be streamed live to Facebook and YouTube. Everyone will see and hear everything Cuomo does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we don't need to discuss this any further. Problem solved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Virus, Democracy, Climate. If it doesn't have anything to do with these, it's a distraction. Distractions are necessary so we don't go insane. But understand that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the reasons I love writing for the blog is that I've made the best software for me for editing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't make it for anyone else. I know of one person who has adapted it for his own use, that's it. The software still is far from as good as it could be. It needs the one feature my old outliner in Frontier had, scriptability. I need to get outside the limits of the JavaScript environment in the browser and on the server, while relying on the software I've built so far, to define a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/19/suspensionOfDisbeliefAppli.html&quot;&gt;virtuality&lt;/a&gt; that is perfectly scriptable. To exist at a higher level, both as a writer and a developer. I've been to the top of this mountain before, but this time I'm taking a different path to the top. And maybe it isn't even the same mountain. That's what makes these writing/software explorations so interesing, and risky. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I like Chris Lydon who does the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; podcast. In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/plague-year-two/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing an expert on pandemics, he exclaimed &quot;Oy oy oy,&quot; almost wearily. Now Chris is nice, as I said, but he’s a total &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy&quot;&gt;goy&lt;/a&gt;, so it was LOL funny to hear him say that phrase. Oy!</description>

			<description>I want to know more about who the listeners are for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I bet they're amazing. I'd start by asking listeners to send in a photo of where they listen to the podcast. We'd publish them (after reviewing to be sure they're safe for work). It'd be quite a conversation starter. They have a Disqus comment section on the blog, and they get some comments.</description>

			<description>Key fact: Every time someone gets infected, the virus has another chance to mutate and thereby get around our vaccines. So it's in all our interests to reduce the number of infections, to slow mutations. Does this make sense? Somewhere in my education, I don't remember where, they taught me to think like this. Two or more processes that interact happening at the same time. It's reality. We're in a contest with the virus. It won for many months, and it's still winning, but now we have a strategy for slowing its growth. We will not eliminate it. These are basic facts most people haven't begun to absorb.</description>

			<description>I don't like the Holier Than Thou BS of the Democratic Party. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-never-trumpers-are-becoming-pro-democracy-republicans.html&quot;&gt;Never Trumpers&lt;/a&gt; form a new party, I might join up. I'd like a party that endorses only two things, 1. the Constitution and 2. a return to majority rule. All other issues, up to the individual to decide.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/05/whatIveLearnedAboutWhereWereAtWithTheVirus.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: What I've learned about where we're at with the virus. When will it be over? Depends on a lot of things, including many that are completely out of anyone's control, and unknowable. All we're doing basically is going with hunches, and trying to see what works. The virus our vaccines were tested against is not the same virus that's out there today. Variants and mutations make the virus a moving target. We need better monitoring, hopefully the Biden Administration is working on that. 15 minutes.</description>

			<description>All of a sudden the opportunities to get vaccinated are exploding here in upstate New York. We are over-supplied, it seems. It's always been true, the United States is the country you want to come help when you have a disaster. We were not prepared for this pandemic, but we could invent, test and manufacture a vaccine, and we are able to distribute it. We're good at this stuff. And we're big and rich enough to do it right. If the pandemic had happened with Biden as president, we'd have cleaned up the virus by now, and also gotten started of ridding ourselves of the insurance industry, which does nothing for us, and takes so much.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html&quot;&gt;One year ago today&lt;/a&gt; I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how the world was about to change and how Americans weren't ready for it. And for a few hours I replaced the contents of the home page of my blog with a simple statement in very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/urgent/2020/03/05.html&quot;&gt;big letters&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;A deadly virus is taking over the world and the United States doesn't have a government.&quot; A year later, and the virus did take over the world, and thankfully the US now has a government, yet it is very damaged by the traitorous behavior of the ousted president. But we're doing better now.</description>

			<description>In the podcast I said the virus was going to hit us hardest, because we feel invulnerable. Lots of other things, it's worth a listen. I'm glad I did this podcast. It was a transition point, the world changed around March 5, 2020. On the other hand as it turns out I overestimated how bad it was going to be.</description>
