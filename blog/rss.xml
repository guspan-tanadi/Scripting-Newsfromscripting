			<description>I once designed a JSONified version of RSS. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/03/17/jsonifiedRss.html&quot;&gt;Wrote about it&lt;/a&gt; and even put up a demo. I was surprised that somewhere in my sprawling ecosystem is a piece of code, still running, that maintains my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSONified RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. Geek pride.</description>

			<description>When someone says &quot;X is part of the problem&quot; that's wrong in so many ways. Useless. They're actually the problem, not part of it even. Working together is how we get ahead. Unite rather than divide. I don't care how you got to the party, I'm just glad you're here now.</description>

			<description>I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/05/snarkySlogan.png&quot;&gt;snarky thing&lt;/a&gt; in a friend's Facebook feed that said women don't need men telling them what to do with their bodies. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; shows that 43 percent of American women are pro-life and 45 percent of men are pro-choice. I thnk everyone should be pro-choice, but it's wrong to blame men for the current situation.</description>

			<description>Most people in America don’t get how slavery is what we’re still fighting over. Colin Kaepernick  is  black, in America that means he’s a slave. Our country has yet to settle that question. Most of us have decided to grow out of it, but for a sizeable minority, they’re going keep fighting it. What Kaepernick is to them, a slave who forgot his place.</description>

			<title>Getting caught up with Electron</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A query for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+electron&quot;&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; Electron apps for five years at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an Electron version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac (to start) almost ready to go, but there are problems with the File dialogs. It feels like a versioning thing? These routines worked fine in earlier software. So I figure what I need to do is get this app building using the latest versions of Electron and the latest build tools. If I recall correctly they change a lot. And it's been a while since I figured out how to do it. When I read their docs for building stuff I feel as lost as I felt when I was just starting out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here's how I build the app currently:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo electron-packager . &quot;Electric Drummer&quot; --platform=darwin --arch=all --overwrite --icon=drummer.icns --electron-version=7.1.10&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What should I change to get my build process up to date? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It works, it builds the app, and I've been using it, it's just not the current Electron release and their are quirks with the file dialogs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ideally I'd like to not have to learn too much about the Electron release process or versions -- just give me something that works and I can get back to my sprawling codebase. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/222&quot;&gt;thread for comments&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks in advance. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>JSON Feed after four years</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/04/164251.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about JSON Feed a few times. Summary: it was a bad idea. I don't know why devs want to come up with new names for well-established concepts. It makes all our lives more complicated if the format catches on, and if it doesn't, it just makes a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely had to have a JSON feed format, which no one does, it's easy to encapsulate anything you don't like about a format behind a simplifying API, and anything you can represent in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; can be represented in JSON and vice versa, the best thing to do was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSONified RSS&lt;/a&gt;. But they didn't do that either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so four years later &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manton/JSONFeed/issues/157&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; appears in the support repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I might have been vaguely aware that Apple has a new format, obviously its own reinvention of RSS, also a totally bad idea, and another developer thinks JSON Feed should adopt its features. He is correct. That is the right move. Or even better, just leave JSON Feed behind and support both Apple's new incompatible format and RSS 2.0. Given that they're rooted in the Apple world, probably both. But the sparsely supported format they put out there was a bad idea and today it's an even worse idea, and it's only going to get more so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People keep doing this, thinking that starting over is the thing to do. Apple will have trouble with their format because publishers will see it as the trap that it obviously is and probably will forever tell Apple it would be better if they didn't go off and blaze a new trail when there already is a well-worn path. No one wants to get locked in the trunk, they want to ride up front with you. And in publishing, thankfully, Apple still is not dominant. And hopefully it stays that way. And the rest of us have to circle the wagons and &lt;i&gt;reduce&lt;/i&gt; the number of formats we have to deal with, not add to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>If I were in health care</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I were in health care, working in a place where they have to care for Covid patients who are very sick, I'd feel very inclined to quit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Given that 99 percent of the people who are very sick with Covid chose not vaccinate. And the transmissibility of the virus unlike other illnesses, makes them responsible not only for their own illness but other people'.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd seriously consider quitting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Drummer user note: When you're creating something new in a chronologic structure, use the big + icon at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/03/plusIcon.png&quot;&gt;top of the icon bar&lt;/a&gt;. Don't do it by hand. The software that cares about chronologic notes ignores nodes that were created by hand. The + icon puts special attributes on the nodes that matter. You could if you wanted to do it yourself. But why would you? I'm saying this 20 different ways, here on Scripting News and everywhere else I can think to because I want &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; users to get this right. It's important. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'm doing user support for the first time since &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/span&gt; days and am reminded of what sucks about it. In the groups I am part of, as a user,when I ask for help I have reproduced the problem on my machine several times. I have tried workarounds. I've thought about it. I don't immediately ask for help, because I know the other people are like me, doing it for love, it's not their job, they're helping because they like to help. For whatever reason the groups I assemble often don't do this. At the first sign of trouble they post something that's impossible to understand, and it's really clear they didn't try it again, or they would have spotted their mistake. Support is a dear resource. Use it when you need it, but be sure first that you do need it.</description>

			<title>We have to fight, at some point</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I saw Amy Klobuchar interviewed on CNN and the reporter pressed her to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/jun/13/stephen-breyer-retire-supreme-court-alexandria-ocasio-cortez&quot;&gt;Breyer should resign&lt;/a&gt; while there's a Dem president, was wondering why no one wishes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; had resigned when Obama was president, but of course there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland#Supreme_Court_nomination&quot;&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in hindsight, we should have had the fight over the Supreme Court when Garland was nominated and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/03/16/470664561/mcconnell-blocking-supreme-court-nomination-about-a-principle-not-a-person&quot;&gt;McConnell refused to confirm&lt;/a&gt;. Obama could have taken that as an affirmation, and seated Garland. It would have been a better time to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said it at the time. If McConnell won't vote, then after a decent amount of time, Garland takes the seat. Set a new precedent, if the Senate abdicates its responsibility, we go forward without them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good guys have been scared of a fight, and the Repubs have been walking all over the Constitution. You can't be nice always, sometimes you have to hit back. We've been delaying and delaying. And btw, where are the indictments of Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland#Attorney_General_(2021%E2%80%93present)&quot;&gt;Mr Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On Facebook, when you reply to a post you disagree with, your followers will then see it in their timeline. This puts people who follow you in an awkward position. I want to unfollow you because I don't want my timeline polluted with nonsense about how great the former president is (for example), and the only way I can do that is by unfollowing you. So your momentary feeling of righteousness has a hidden potential cost you should be aware of. 1. You help a cause you disagree with and 2. You alienate your friends.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; runs on Linux, in case that wasn't clear. And Windows and Mac. I use a Mac mostly, but I'd love to convert to Linux. Only one app is keeping me on the Mac, the OPML Editor, and only for its ability to manage my development work. But Drummer is getting pretty close to being able to do that. When it's fully up to speed I will be able to run everything in Linux, and believe me -- I will relax. I'm skating on thin ice on the Mac and know it.</description>

I'm skating on thin ice on the Mac and know it." created="Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:26:46 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/01.html#a132646"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/31.html#a153800&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I put out a call for new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; testers, asking for people with blogging and/or scripting experience. I should have also asked for people who have used &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/span&gt;, such as LogSeq, Roam, Obsidian, Org-mode, my own MORE, ThinkTank and Ready, or others. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; is all about outlining, as I said yesterday -- unabashedly so. We used to be reserved about software centered on outlining, but no more. Send an email or Twitter DM if you're interested in being in the test group.</description>

			<description>The usual monthly ritual is complete. Archived the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/08.opml&quot;&gt;August posts&lt;/a&gt;, and started my outline with a fresh slate for September. Trying to imagine what wonders and atrocities await us! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Tagging in Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My use of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt; has been going for a while now, and i'm still doing it, which in my experience is a total success for a categorization system. Even better, some of the tags are getting enough references to be useful, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tag=drummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What seems to come next is to hook all of this up with a Wiki, so the landing page for a tag can have more than just links to articles. In other words all of this amounted to integrating an outliner with a Wiki, which was one of my goals after hanging out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ward+cunningham+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of days &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html&quot;&gt;a few years back&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Software development sometimes is like painting. You do something over and over iteratively, from a lot of angles, and arrive somewhere, but that itself is probably just on the road to what's next after that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
