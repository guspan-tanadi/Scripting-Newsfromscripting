			<description>Is there a nice open source JavaScript clone of Wordle? By nice I mean: 1. It covers all the functionality of the original. 2. The code is clearly written, not obfuscated, easy to build on. No amazing JS tricks, just straight boring code. I'd like to add a simple back-end, to automatically save your history, publish an RSS feed. Easily integratable into a community. Back-end is open source Node app. I'll just operate a server a few Wordler friends. A labor of love like the original app.</description>

			<title>Apple's boastful robot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you call 1-800-MYAPPLE, an intelligent robot answers the phone, introduces itself as as such and kept sending me to tech support when I had a customer service problem, and said so clearly in short phrases. I am trained at talking to Alexa, Siri and my Tesla, I know how to give them commands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then, on my way back to tech support, it asked me to identify myself, but didn't say what info it wanted. It paused and in a stern voice said I had not answered the question in enough time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then it connected me to customer service to talk to a human.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which btw was exactly what I was hoping for when I called the number in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For a super high tech company this was embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To their credit, the human I spoke with was apologetic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do they test their software at Apple? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also tried using their text chat service, it was worse. It repeatedly told me to use the self-help system. Why offer a chat service if you're just going to tell me to use the self-help system? (Interestingly the self-help system gave me information I did not have.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A $1300 purchase, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A perfect time to build a ring of interop now is around Wordle clones. The word of the day should be the same across all clones, and there should be a single place where users' history is stored. What an incredible demo this would be. Journalists are rarely around when the new technologies are formed. By the time they are in the loop there's the cynicism of VCs, and journalism brings its own cynicism. They listen to the money and dismiss the individual. They assume the individual never survives an onslaught from huge companies. But there are times when the money doesn't win.</description>

			<title>Wordle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry that the NYT bought Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Part of its appeal was that it was a nice web app that had no scaling issues, written by a person who was happy not to be a billionaire, and everyone was loving it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that it's attached to the NYT, there's an element of hate there too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe it would show the world that ordinary people who love their GF and want to make something nice for her and decides to share it with the world and retains his human-ness -- that software can be fun and doesn't have to be the usual hot mess of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW this is true, software &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; made by people, not icons, and I don't blame Mr Wordle for taking the money. I just hope he stays a nice person and doesn't get caught up in being more than a human being.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;Your human-size life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A tweet worth framing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle/status/1488576702817079297&quot;&gt;quite a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle&quot;&gt;Brewster Kahle&lt;/a&gt;, the archiver of the open web, about podcasting. He quotes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/30.html#a130520&quot;&gt;post of mine&lt;/a&gt; from April of last year. Basically when you sign an exclusive deal, good for you, but it's not a podcast anymore. To say it is is false advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't get tweets like this every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
