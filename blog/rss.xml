			<description>I wonder why the DNC didn't create an actual crowd for one or two speeches. It can be done safely. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4&quot;&gt;eulogy&lt;/a&gt; Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Maybe they'll create such an event tonight for the presidential nominee. I went to Obama's acceptance speech in Denver in 2008 in a football stadium. Quite an event.</description>

I'm sure they've thought it through, but next year we'll know a lot more about living with the virus than we do now. Look at how much we've learned in the last six months. Net-net, we'll do better in terms of human lives, if we give it more time. Work up to it slowly. Maybe have conferences on campus but do everything else online. Create projects for people to do collaboratively. I know the economics are dismal. But I think it's better if universities die to keep students alive rather than the other way.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I never do interviews on podcasts about podcasting, but I just did one, a few weeks ago, and they're getting ready to publish, and wanted a 75-word bio. So I wrote a new one.

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/podcasts/the-daily/dejoy-postal-service-trump.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about Trump and the USPS. They present something as theory that I'm pretty sure is fact, that Trump is trying to and quite possibly succeeding at making the postal service incapable of doing its part in the November 3 election. Also, they got an important fact wrong, if this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/trump-mailboxes-sorters-usps-2020-election-louis-dejoy-20200816.html&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The author of the NYT story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater&quot;&gt;Luke Broadwater&lt;/a&gt;, said that disabling by-mail voting would not hurt Democrats more than Republicans. On the other hand, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png&quot;&gt;Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt;, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. &lt;b&gt;Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. &lt;/b&gt;So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction.</description>

			<source:outline text="Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/podcasts/the-daily/dejoy-postal-service-trump.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about Trump and the USPS. They present something as theory that I'm pretty sure is fact, that Trump is trying to and quite possibly succeeding at making the postal service incapable of doing its part in the November 3 election. Also, they got an important fact wrong, if this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/trump-mailboxes-sorters-usps-2020-election-louis-dejoy-20200816.html&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The author of the NYT story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater&quot;&gt;Luke Broadwater&lt;/a&gt;, said that disabling by-mail voting would not hurt Democrats more than Republicans. On the other hand, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png&quot;&gt;Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt;, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. &lt;b&gt;Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. &lt;/b&gt;So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction." created="Wed, 19 Aug 2020 16:27:54 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a162754"/>

			<description>I finished John Barry's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. I would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend it, if your goal is to learn as much as you can about the pandemic itself. In the afterword, Barry explains why the book isn't really about the pandemic, it's about how scientists collaborate. He used the pandemic as an example. I had pretty much already figured that out. So much information about the lives of the individual scientists. It went on and on. I skipped whole chapters. Now, I like a good story as much as anyone, but nothing about his tale made me care about them as people. And that isn't why I picked up the book. I want to learn as much as I can about influenza pandemics, because I'm living in the middle of one. To his credit, the book was published 15 years ago, long before Covid-19. I'm going to keep looking for a book that focuses on the science.</description>

			<description>BTW, then as now the government lied about the disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has since had his reputation somewhat cleaned up, was apparently not a very great president. Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video&quot;&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu. He theorizes that the terrible deal that Germany got was due to Wilson's flu, and if he had not gotten ill, maybe Germany wouldn't have gone fascist? The same story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/woodrow-wilsons-case-of-the-flu-and-how-pandemics-change-history&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker earlier this year. He also says the flu resulted in Wilson's stroke and disability. Perhaps a cautionary fact for our current president. Also interesting that there is no mention of &quot;influenza&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for Wilson! Amazing. I wonder how Trump's epitaph will read? I expect Covid-19 will be prominent.</description>

			<title>Mouse invasion</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I've had two of mouse invasions in my car. One where a mouse chewed through a vent in my air conditioner, and the latest where a family of mice made a nest in the air conditioner and then proceeded to die! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ay ayay.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had the mouse family cleaned out by the local Subaru dealer, but the smell lingers, and now I have to figure out what to do. It's not a nice problem to have! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I know some are in dismay because the Democrats are appealing to Republicans, but they are doing the right thing. It's so much more important what we agree on than what we disagree about. We agree in the Constitution and government of laws. Right now, in 2020, that's what matters most. Later we can re-divide on issues, but right now, we have to organize for one thing: America.</description>

			<description>I was sure that last night's virtual DNC was going to suck, but quite the opposite, it was riveting, great political TV. I can't wait for tonight's episode. Michelle Obama, the closer, was masterful. I hadn't heard anything from her since her last DNC speech. Imagine what watching Trump has been like for her. She knows how demanding the job is. She was generous with Trump and said he wasn't up for the job. Such an understatement. And she threw his &lt;i&gt;It Is What It Is&lt;/i&gt; line back at him. Kind of what you might say giving Trump's eulogy (since that's what he had to say about 150K American deaths he's responsible for). Great speech. Now tonight we get Bill Clinton. He gives great DNC. I've heard him speak in person a few times. Get ready. It's going to be something. But. The most powerful speech of the night was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrDMEvvNzU&quot;&gt;Kristin Urquiza&lt;/a&gt;. In case you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it, because there's one line in it that will stay with you, but you should hear it from her, the way she says it. Her father, a Trump supporter, died of the virus. The speech isn't long. Be sure not to miss it.</description>

			<title>Adams Farms in Kingston</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two reasons to live in this area. Blueberries and Adams marinara.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My mother would have turned 88 on Thursday. She was always on my case to eat more blueberries. She would be happy to know that I am. Esp this time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I live in blueberry country. It's peak blueberry season. I bought these at &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/locations/kingston/&quot;&gt;Adams in Kingston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries in season.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every place has one of these groceries. In New Orleans it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.langensteins.com/&quot;&gt;Langenstein's&lt;/a&gt;. In Menlo Park, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.draegers.com/&quot;&gt;Draeger's&lt;/a&gt;. In Woodside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertsmarket.com/&quot;&gt;Roberts&lt;/a&gt;. In the Hudson Valley -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/&quot;&gt;Adams&lt;/a&gt;. They make a lot of their own stuff. They get the best products. They have a farm where they grow a lot of the produce they sell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now we have peaches and all kinds of berries, local grown, fresh and delicious. In September that's when the apples arrive. Huge boxes of them. It's something to behold. New we have blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I'm telling you, their marinara sauce is the best. I know Adams is not an Italian name. But somehow they figured it out. Very fresh and delicious in every way. Previously my favorite marinara was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/San-Marzano-Pomodoro-Marinara-Sauce/dp/B00CXA1J14/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw-O35BRDVARIsAJU5mQUhOqC-6Uu6FYC5Tmcpcida0mGpAZxQZKZrdG5feJIzaeQsshg62_0aAp9uEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=232499064174&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=7378444453978147064&amp;hvtargid=kwd-383386643679&amp;hydadcr=4846_9629179&amp;keywords=san+marzano+marinara&amp;qid=1597765390&amp;sr=8-3&amp;tag=googhydr-20&quot;&gt;San Marzano&lt;/a&gt;. Very good. But Adams is better imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Adams marinara.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm going to watch the DNC tonight, but there's great competition in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-playoffs-bracket-2020-standings-projections/15owf3ue8ug1g12k7jgud2b11w&quot;&gt;NBA playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, which starts today with games between the Nets and Raptors and then the Sixers and Celtics, two hot matchups. The basketball has been &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; this summer. I'm also super excited that &lt;a href=&quot;https://sportsnaut.com/2020/08/nba-world-reacts-to-carmelo-anthonys-dagger-to-send-blazers-to-playoffs/&quot;&gt;Melo made&lt;/a&gt; the playoffs, finally, with his new team the Portland Trailblazers. I knew all along that he wasn't a team leader, like LeBron or even Damian Lillard who leads the Blazers. He's a Hall of Fame supporting player. Too bad he was miscast all those years as an alpha. Imagine if Melo had been LeBron's sidekick. At least he's found a happy home now, and that's cool.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was first starting out as an entrepreneur in the early 80s, I had an Apple II product, and Apple was in serious trouble, judging by the stories in the press. I asked my lead investor what to make of it. Should we not ship our Apple product and port to the IBM PC? He asked what Apple's sales were. About a billion dollars. He said you can safely continue, companies with a billion dollars in sales don't disappear. He was right, of course. A year later they shipped the first Mac, and we were on board for the boom in 1986. Had we switched in 1983, we would have missed the boom, and been lost in the crowd of second-tier PC companies. On the Mac we had a chance to rise to the top, and we did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of this story is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt; has 8 million people. Most of them are staying. Many of the people with the means to leave are leaving. The business environment in NY will change. All that office space will be used for something. Nature abhors a vacuum. And NYC will have a lot of space, to be used creatively, we expect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, the virus will weaken, like a hurricane as it moves inland. It won't go away, but the major damage is done as it makes landfall. At least judging from the 1918 pandemic. It was two years of hell, but the worst of it were the first waves, as it circled the world. In all likelihood that will also be the pattern of Covid-19. And remember, they never got a vaccine for the 1918 virus. It seems like we will have one, or more, and they will blunt the damage the virus does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that NYC is dead -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/nyc-is-dead-forever-heres-why/&quot;&gt;that's&lt;/a&gt; just opportunistic linkbait. That's who the author is. Famous as a promoter of himself. There isn't a whole lot of thought or science behind his theory that NYC is over. As with billion dollar PC manufacturers in 1983, cities of 8 million don't just &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/16/132137.html?title=horrorFilmPlot&quot;&gt;disappear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like the world we left behind in March of this year, however, the old NY &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; gone. But there will be a new New York. There probably isn't another city on earth so capable of reinventing itself. In the two generations my family has been in NYC, the city has already reinvented itself a few times. My mother, herself an immigrant, lived to have her world disrupted by a new wave of immigration. It's a good thing, even a great thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And humans are a resilient species. We get accustomed to new realities very quickly. We'll do fine. And NYC will rise again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Can't wait for the election. Trump's plan to steal the election &lt;i&gt;will work.&lt;/i&gt; First, do not vote by mail. Do not vote by mail. Not sure what you should do if you live in a state like Utah, Washington or Oregon where vote-by-mail is all you can do. Second, Congress has to come back. We must protest in the streets. Esp in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KolbieReports/status/1294615470004469760&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;. They must feel our ire. Now, not in November. That will, for sure, be too late.</description>

			<description>A couple of things they changed in the iPhone UI, not sure how recently. To get the app switcher to come up, double-tap the home button. To take a screen shot, click the power button and the home button simultaneously. I will never remember these, but at least I will be able to find them on scripting.com. The problem with the way Apple changes this stuff, when you search for it, you find the old method. To get the new method you have to have as many followers as I do on Twitter. This is a bullshit way to run a platform, Apple.</description>

			<description>I had a little dinner party at my house in the country last night. People do this here. But not in the time of Covid. I haven't had a gathering at my house since last winter, but last night we chanced it. These are lovely people who I speak with them frequently online, but it was so much better to eat and imbibe in person, outside, under the stars. With the animals and bugs. Ideas flowed. We made new jokes, new memes. I promised to do things that I have since forgotten. What I will never forget is how much I enjoyed their company.</description>

			<description>One thing I think we agreed on last night is that people who support Trump do so because he tells them what they want to hear. The truth doesn't enter into it.</description>
