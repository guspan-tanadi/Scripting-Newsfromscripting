			<description>I have the Apple credit card. It's so incredibly easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209226&quot;&gt;pay the bill&lt;/a&gt;, because the UI is right there on your iPhone. I also now have an Amazon card, and two traditional bank cards. So I know from what I'm talking about.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbomax.com/&quot;&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; is like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke&quot;&gt;New Coke&lt;/a&gt;. HBO was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tjwaldorf.com/brand-positioning-the-ladders-in-our-head/&quot;&gt;#1&lt;/a&gt; brand. Needed to be a little more like Netflix, but really it was pretty good as it was. Now the &lt;i&gt;max&lt;/i&gt; part has coincided with it being a lot harder to use, virtually impossible if you use the popular Roku platform. At least for me. Looks like an epic mistake. At a time when the market is overloaded with lots of big brands (Disney, Apple etc) trying to diversity into a market already dominated by HBO, it's a really curious time for them to knock out their own legs.</description>

			<description>One thing that's so disappointing about the people I've met in tech is that they are mostly motivated by what they can take from others, rather than what they can build working with others. So often they could make so much more money by doing the latter. Stupid. (And of course money is far from the most motivating motive.)</description>

			<title>Using structure in outlines</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A friend is starting to use the outliner to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html&quot;&gt;narrate his work&lt;/a&gt;. He writes about an &quot;impenetrable wall of text.&quot; I wrote up some tips, and of course felt they should be public. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the impenetrable wall of text -- try collapsing things, where the detail isn't of immediate concern, so you can see the structure. It would help me too as a reader, to see the old stuff collapsed, and be able to expand it as I need to. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also hoist and dehoist are there to help manage complexity. You can hoist a section, by placing the cursor on a head with subs, and click on the pushpin icon in the left margin. It'll be the one that's enabled. Then when you want to return, click the other one. It's like a stack (it actually is a stack, of course).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a bookshelf of notebooks. You don't have every notebook open to all pages at the same time. It doesn't even make sense. You'd go crazy trying to find something. Same idea here. You've got tools to manage clutter, they take time to learn to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what my blog outline looks like as I'm writing today's notes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I posted a very short question on Facebook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1361834694023932&quot;&gt;Do you know anyone like Trump? &lt;/a&gt;I asked because I do. I grew up in Queens, a couple of miles from where Trump grew up, only ten years after. So there were lots of Trump-like people in my area. I'm constantly reminded, by something Trump does, of someone I knew in childhood. Anyway, after a dozen or so predictable responses, a former Apple exec, one who did a very good thing for my troubled company back in 1986, said yes he's had golfed with Trump, voted for him in 2016, and was going to vote for him in 2020. He lives in California, so his vote is symbolic, as is mine (I live in NY). It was jarring. No debate has followed, thankfully, and I hope it doesn't. I'm just going to leave it there.</description>

			<description>A couple of hours later, the thread is still peaceful. Thankfully. My friend from the past refers to Trump as a businessman, which causes me to write this screed, which I did not add to the thread. I was curious to know, how does this businessman see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1320026106494332928&quot;&gt;retired people packed&lt;/a&gt; into his audience, no distancing, no masks. Are they his customers? His team? His employees? Competitors? Serfs? Prisoners? Slaves? What kind of animal do you treat the way Trump is treating these people? To Trump are they even people?</description>

			<title>Will we undo Trump?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't want to jinx things, but when Biden takes office I assume the FBI will fully investigate what really happened in the 2016 election, without any interference from political appointees. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new Attorney General will release the reports Barr wouldn't let us see. I assume that's going to happen too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What if we determine that the election was a crime. That the Trump campaign didn't just collude with Russia, it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Russia. Recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbur.org/npr/903512647/senate-report-former-trump-aide-paul-manafort-shared-campaign-info-with-russia&quot;&gt;revelations&lt;/a&gt; about Manafort say that pretty clearly. Everyone was looking for collusion, but it was actually much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were an occupied country for four years. Should we allow everything Trump did in those four years to stand? Or do we remove the three Supreme Court justices he nominated, tear up all his executive orders, remove all the regulations passed by his agencies. Undo anything that can be reasonably undone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I like promoting other people's products when they're good. I am unhappy when I see bad products promoted by people I respect. If I think a product is not good, unless I think people will be hurt by it, or if the badness can be fixed and the product would then be useful, I'll generally say nothing.</description>

			<description>Maybe there should be real debates on TV every week between leaders on issues that Congress is going to vote on. And a way of measuring public opinion. No personal attacks allowed. Strict control via Mute button. This week the debate would be about the merits of approving a new radical Supreme Court justice in the middle of an election when everyone's attention is focused elsewhere. Some actions are so important they deserve everyone's focus.</description>

			<description>I am so exhausted from US politics, this state going back to the summer of 2016. I made it through about 15 minutes of last night's debate before I couldn't stand it. All it took was one gaffe from Biden to shred all hope of a reprieve from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22shitshow%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;shitshow&lt;/a&gt;. Then I had a thought, what if Amazon released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borat-subsequent-moviefilm-delivery-of-prodigious-bribe-to-american-regime-for-make-benefit-once-glo&quot;&gt;new Borat movie&lt;/a&gt; a few hours early? Wouldn't that be great. So I looked. And they had! So I watched the first half, returned to the debate, which still was not over, and went back and watched a bit more, and returned to the debate just in time to hear the wrapup. Then I listened to Maddow's review of Trump's lies about Covid (the part  I had heard) and I felt better so I went to bed. Only to wake up this morning and find that the feeling if utter misery was even worse. The election is 11 days from now.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tying_(commerce)&quot;&gt;Tying&lt;/a&gt;. A big company uses a monopoly in one area to create a monopoly in another. It was the basis for the anti-trust case against Microsoft in the 90s. They were forcing PC manufacturers to bundle their web browser, which was not a monopoly with their operating system, which was, thus forcing the leading browser, Netscape, out of the market. This happens over and over in tech. Google does it by using their monopoly in search to crush competitors in other categories. It can't be allowed. Products must compete on merit, not because we are forced to use them.</description>

			<description>I had way too much to eat and drink at dinner yesterday, but it was great. A local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cucinawoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; has a great patio, set up comfortably, and they serve excellent food. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York&quot;&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; is a small town, but it has the amenties of a town in the Bay Area (e.g. Berkeley, Palo Alto). But I did eat too much and I'm paying the price for it today. Oy!</description>

			<description>Glad that Andrew is reviewing &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; now. There are all kinds of loose-ends. That's what happens when you're developing only for yourself. Looking forward to going back over it and cleaning things up a bit. It's a very fine piece of software imho. In many ways the web server I've always wanted.</description>

			<description>Since Andrew is working on a new version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; server now, he asked if it would make sense to support &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; in rssCloud. That would mean adding a &amp;lt;head&gt; element that had all the info that's in the rssCloud element in an RSS feed. It's a good idea, but.. (sorry) -- OPML already has a realtime notification service, it came after rssCloud and is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;web sockects&lt;/a&gt;. It's the core tech behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Instant Outliner%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Instant Outliner&lt;/a&gt;, a protocol that &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; implements.</description>

			<description>Anyone who votes for Trump is suicidal and I can prove it. 1. The virus is real, doesn't matter what you believe, it is in fact killing people and destroying other people's lives. 2. We aren't doing anything to stop it, because the president doesn't want us to. He has that power. 3. If you re-elect him, you'll get more of the same; if you don't we'll start fighting it asap. If for no other reason than you want to live, you should vote for Biden/Harris.</description>

			<description>I'm doing a phone interview/podcast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Calacanis&quot;&gt;Jason Calacanis&lt;/a&gt; later today. I often blog about these things before doing them, so I fill my head with ideas that might be worth discussing. He and I have some interests in common, notably how to include universities in the tech development process. I think there's more to it than what Y-combinator does. Anyway, I just spewed (not kidding) a bunch of ideas into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1318919848240570368&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. Wanted to be sure it was linked into the blog.</description>

			<description>Started a web and voice conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/rethinking-blogs/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; about ideas for rethinking blogs and feeds. I found, as others have, that I need another kind of document to include in my personal CMS other than a story that's part of the blog. Everything about blogs are set up to be written, then lightly edited, and never touched again. Like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco&quot;&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt; painting. It's &lt;i&gt;temporal&lt;/i&gt; writing. But there are other things that I want to develop over time, keep coming back to, revising. A few years back I started this.how to hold those docs. It's worked out really well. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; faq as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/&quot;&gt;this.how&lt;/a&gt; doc. We also had this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, right from the start. We wrote, published and maintained the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier using the same CMS we used for blogging. In the end the data structures are the same, what was confusing is how we think about them. But once you make a decision to put non-temporal docs &quot;over there&quot; then things start working.</description>

I vaguely remember it. Some of the stuff I wrote is offline, but possibly in archive.org. But I'm pretty sure I have the right solution now. How can I tell? I use it. Why? Because I know &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; to use it. That's the trick to iterating this stuff. The tech is easy compared to the workflow.</description>

I've even given them an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; for a very clever no-brainer DNS feature that no one else does, as far as I know. On Sunday I registered a new domain and wasn't able to access it. So I contacted their support, they said they needed permission to go into my account to see how I had it configured. By then the problem had cleared on its own, but it was puzzling why they would need permission. The DNS setup is, by design, totally public info. Anyone could look to see how my domain is set up.  I assumed they were doing that when there have been support issues in the past.</description>

I created it last October, and thought it might be worth another look. The big deal is fluidity. The user interface hangs on a framework that's designed for writers.

Most of what goes into a blog is writing, so it's worth setting it up this way." created="Mon, 19 Oct 2020 16:23:49 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/10/19.html#a162349"/>

			<description>As a Roku user, HBO clearly doesn't want my money. I tried getting HBO as part of Hulu and it's awful. There was a program I wanted to watch, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/16/opinions/the-west-wing-reunion-we-didnt-need-yang/index.html&quot;&gt;West Wing reunion&lt;/a&gt;, but their search only showed the original series. I found it on my iPad, which HBO still has its own app for, so that worked. Later, I cancelled my HBO subscription. Subscriptions are madness. Every service has its own user interface. Three services are locked in for me. 1. Netflix, because it's Netflix. 2. Amazon, because I pay nothing extra for it, so why not. 3. YouTube TV so I can watch cable news and have learned its UI. There are plenty of other brands that have shows that I want to watch and would be willing to pay for, but there's a limit to how many packages I'm going to buy and how many UIs I can learn. Can the people who run these businesses not understand this? There's going to be a huge culling and one or two will remain. Probably Netflix and Amazon. If you don't think so, look around. How many product categories have more than one or two products with any market share?</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Atlas&quot;&gt;Dr Scott Atlas&lt;/a&gt; is even more scary than Attorney General &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general&quot;&gt;William Barr&lt;/a&gt;. Now imagine if they got together, and figured out how to kill all the of the president's political enemies with the virus. That's why the virus is such a strong ally of Trump. If we lose the election, they won't need to build death camps. There's never been a situation anything like this. Just a week ago it seemed the president was doomed, due for a long recovery perhaps, certainly no longer a threat. I wish &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Fauci%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Fauci&lt;/a&gt; had left the government and was independent now, and had a strong communication channel of his own.</description>
