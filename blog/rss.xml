			<description>I had broken the mailbox template for the feeder app. It's back. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadamsinger.substack.com%2Ffeed&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also making sure that we don't break urls as we go along and I change things. For example, this is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmailbox?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; that changed in two ways. It should still work, getting us a mailbox view of the feed for this blog. I'm probably the only person who cares about this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Mailbox-style readers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed how some feeds look great in a mailbox-style reader while others don't. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffallows.substack.com%2Ffeed&quot;&gt;feeds from Substack&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadamsinger.substack.com%2Ffeed&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; in mailbox readers because their items are full-text titled essays. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnytimes.com%2Ftimeswire%2Ffeeds%2F&quot;&gt;NYT feeds look terrible&lt;/a&gt; in mailbox readers, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;does Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The mailbox reader, which was popularized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/12/154157.html?title=googleReaderNineYearsLater&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, is designed for titled full-text feeds. The NYT has titles on its feed items, but not full text, just a synopsis. There's so much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/22/wastedSpace.png&quot;&gt;wasted space&lt;/a&gt; in the display. It feels unbalanced. I like whitespace, but that's not what this is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The incredibly useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https://news.ycombinator.com/rss&quot;&gt;Hacker News feed&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty weird in a mailbox-style reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt;, and feeds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;Drummer blogs&lt;/a&gt;, some posts have titles, but most don't. A mailbox reader can't deal with untitled posts, I've given up on trying to make it work, it just doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT and Scripting work much better in a river-style display, which is the pattern that Twitter and Facebook use, as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: We have to move away from mailbox-only feed readers. Mailboxes are great when the items are like email messages. But that's far from all there is. We have to try out new ideas, lots of them. And to do that I'm making it easier to try new ideas out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Echoes of 2002</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have the same attitude about &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 as I did in 2002. I wanted to move, to clean up the mess, start with a fresh new foundation. It worked then, and I believe now twenty years later it'll work again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much has changed. There was no Twitter or Facebook in 2002. None of the writing systems we use now existed. I think RSS 2.0 even predates Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have found a way to make it much simpler and easier to evolve feeds on the web, and I'm not waiting for permission I'm just going ahead. That's in fact what happened after RSS 2.0 with podcasting. We just did it, no one objected, and off we went. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The theme is totally opposite of the one in 2002, when I was basically finishing RSS, and giving it over to everyone to do with as they please. The roadmap said it clearly. This is it. No more new stuff in RSS itself. If you want to add to it, you can, but to get support for your ideas you're on your own. I wasn't signing up for another stint as notetaker for this particularly community. It was too thankless a job. But guess what, not much happened. The RSS people are using today is pretty much what they were using 20 years ago. There have been some new applications, and there are some respectful projects to add a new namespaces. That's more or less what the roadmap called for. So without any leadership, it kind of took care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, RSS as they say is what it is. There's also Atom and RDF, these exist and are in use. Very little if any innovation across the whole market, all of the new stuff has been in the individual products, but there are severe limits on what they can do because the format isn't moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My thought is that I can write some new software, as everyone else is, but with the thought that I want people to do the same as I am doing. At the same time, I don't care if you do it or not, if you pick up the ideas or don't. All I'm looking for is a critical mass of people who want to experiment with a new cleaned-up simplified feed system built on what was built before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A demo outline</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Note to outliner devs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=helloworld&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;Look at the outline elements&lt;/a&gt; in the RSS items. It's like podcasting, but instead of MP3s, it's outlines. Right there in the feed. So if you know how to render outlines, you can build more interesting kind of reader.

To write about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TommyBeer/status/1538889310224666624&quot;&gt;foibles&lt;/a&gt; of would-be kings of basketball, such as Kevin Durant. He did the NBA a favor by leaving Golden State. There was no room for both KD and Steph Curry on the same team. This is the year that the idea of the superteam was completely debunked. Perhaps KD should hook up with LeBron and hmm Russell Westbrook and Melo. James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker. If there were an NBA team in Pittsburgh I'd say that's where they all should play. Otherwise Sacramento or Orlando. However this is the time of year when my attention turns to the Mets. If all goes as planned you should get a few months of reprieve from basketball.</description>

			<description>My father was a real outliner user. You know them when you see them. They want to make lists and figure stuff out. Very much into concepts. My mother on the other hand was a NBB or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;Natural-Born-Blogger&lt;/a&gt;. She always had something on her mind and had to tell the world about it. So of course I, their first-born child, wrote outlining and blogging software, all together in one package. My mother once said that I was a good investment. She thought that way too. My father if you can believe it, said every day is Father's Day, thanks to my outliner.</description>

			<description>The people who say our democracy is teetering on the edge are a few seasons behind. It's time to design a political party that fits the political system we have.

			<description>BTW, I might be missing something about Julian Assange. Isn't he the asshole who &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=Hillary%20Clinton&quot;&gt;dumped&lt;/a&gt; all of HRC's emails and gave the NYT all the ammo they needed to tank her candidacy thus giving us Trump?

			<description>I take note when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1538135017079054337&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi forwards&lt;/a&gt; one of my posts. Yesterday it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/17.html#a132248&quot;&gt;my bit&lt;/a&gt; about Ron DeSantis. I think for sure he's running for president in 2024, and if the Repubs are smart, they'll nominate him instead of Trump. He gets a clean slate. He's just dog-whistle-level racist enough to get all the votes Trump got and enough of Biden's to win without having to resort to an insurrection. But he is a solid white supremacist, return-to-slavery type Republican. Won't make even the slightest attempt to win support from blue states or minority voters. All white all the way. At the same time, it's a good bet that by the election in 2024, Twitter will be run to please the MAGAs. Why do I think so? Well, everything Musk says about free speech is just another dog-whistle for the MagaVerse. Joe if you're listening, please tell your friends in the the political consultant sphere that we need to at least start a social network for electing Dems in 2024 and beyond. Don't depend on Twitter being useful in that election. We'll need new ways to organize that go beyond fund-raising and advertising. We need to have a 365-by-7-by-24 connection with voters. Organizing isn't just for elections anymore.</description>

			<description>I finished two series -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Ftehran&quot;&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fgentleman-jack&quot;&gt;Gentleman Jack&lt;/a&gt;. I would not recommend the first, it got really tedious and kind of bullshitty toward the end. And completely not believable. You'd have to believe that Iran, a country that has been at war continually since the 1979 revolution, wouldn't have the most basic security for its leaders. Gentleman Jack on the other hand is a sweet story, a bit melodramatic, the bad guys are just a little too bad, esp at the end of the second season. But instead of leaving us with a horrible cliffhanger, as most shows do, they have so far ended each of the two seasons with a kiss. If there's a third season I will watch it. I've been saving the new season of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fborgen&quot;&gt;Borgen&lt;/a&gt;, pretty sure that will be the next binge.</description>

			<title>What people want in a president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The perfect candidate for president from either party is a clever, confident, handsome, young, white man you'd like to watch on social media every day. He can lead a cheer, tell a joke, kiss a baby, knows how to eat pizza, and will get angry in a debate and then tell another joke. You would love to have a beer with him, or ride with him on a chair at Vail even if you're too poor or old to ski. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched Trump's rally last night for a refresher. Yup. He still looks and sounds good if you overlook the criminality and lies, narcissism and mediocrity which people are happy to do. He meets the important criteria. He's funny, looks okay and is white and a man. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Trump's term people were completely wiped out from the consequences of hiring such a loud-mouth punkass papa's boy loser, but memories are short, and Biden really is old, and he stumbles through his speeches. Biden will do, as long as he's running against Trump, but doesn't inspire. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look if you're willing to compromise, and I am, although I would love an America that would embrace a really black president (not Obama who is a black man designed to make white people feel comfortable) or a woman president like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Demings&quot;&gt;Val Demings&lt;/a&gt; who is smart, thinks on her feet and hasn't been battered by the press and Republicans for 30 years when she runs, but that is not this America. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the best compromise for Democrats is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom&quot;&gt;Gavin Newsom&lt;/a&gt;. He checks all the boxes and he would also be a good political leader and is not a fascist. Any Democrat would get my vote, but I'd be confident Newsom would win. Almost anyone else I'd hold my breath and hope for the best, and expect we'd lose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The US is openly white supremacist, but for sixty years has been trying to become less so. That peaked when we elected a black president in 2008. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Oprahs-Book-Club-Discontents/dp/B085VXLKRJ/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcSLpCIAggnuGi0Z8ZnGrwIc2tg4021vRgIxgUdxMA9dZMDLYLoUCr4aAvPrEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=552574215490&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=16381147703423192585&amp;hvtargid=kwd-938508291970&amp;hydadcr=7438_9611178&amp;keywords=caste+the+origin+of+our+discontent&amp;qid=1655516954&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;caste&lt;/a&gt; system here, and blacks were the bottom rung, and still are, largely, but there has been progress away from that, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society&quot;&gt;laws&lt;/a&gt; passed in the 60s, and supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; decisions. All that is turning around. DeSantis, a smoother Trump, will be more careful about arousing his opposition. He will seem to be a likeable Republican and many will overlook his racism, or worse, quietly support it. I have no idea what the answer is, the racism is deeply ingrained in America.</description>

			<description>Trump supporters like this about him: He tells them they are important, but if things continue as they have been going, with elites promoting black people, they will matter less and less. That's the connection.</description>

A friend who is visiting was staying in a house where someone got Covid the night before they came to my house. We both took Covid tests, and both were negative. So I feel pretty good about dodging this. It's the first time I took a test. I play it very safe re Covid. I have too many risk factors to want to take too many risks, and as far as I'm concerned the pandemic is still raging. In the meantime, if you get Covid, get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/13-things-to-know-paxlovid-covid-19&quot;&gt;latest treatment&lt;/a&gt;. I can't imagine why someone who gets infected doesn't, but it happens apparently.</description>

Not imho a great movie though it received universal acclaim from critics and friends. I will try again.</description>

			<description>More on EEAAO -- I think what we're seeing here is that commercial movies have changed, they have to be action superhero type movies because they have to sell all over the world, and that's basically what the world likes. So they snuck a little &quot;I'm ok you're ok&quot; psychology into it, so it would have appeal for adults, kind of like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY&quot;&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; movie, but like The Matrix or Kill Bill instead of Iron Man and the Marvel Universe. It's like we stumbled into an alternate metaverse that wasn't intended for us, the response of its people would be basically OK boomer, time to move on. And it's no accident that the dialog is half English, half Cantonese. Two big markets for blockbuster movies.</description>

			<description>I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lbbonline.com/news/yves-saint-laurent-beaute-makes-a-daring-step-into-web3&quot;&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Makes a Daring Step into web3.&quot; Oh really. So I went to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.web3.yslbeauty.com/&quot;&gt;glorious web3 adventure&lt;/a&gt; only to find -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/15/web3DaresYou.png&quot;&gt;ooops&lt;/a&gt;. If it had worked I am told that I might get a YSL Beauty NFT. &quot;Acting as a recognition token of the community engagement, those 10K YSL Beauty Golden Blocks (ERC721 minted on Polygon with the Arianee Protocol) will unlock utilities throughout the year including a premiere launch, whitelisting for NFT drops and much more.&quot; I'm making a note of this here on my decidedly old school tech blog. We have so much to learn from their brave and daring experiment.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06/14.html&quot;&gt;6/14/2002&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;It's going to be a light day here on Scripting News. Lots of non-Internet stuff going on.&quot; In other words, I was going for a doctor's appointment to check out the problems I knew I had with my heart. They put me on a treadmill, didn't like what they saw, walked me over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Hospital&quot;&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography&quot;&gt;angiogram&lt;/a&gt;. Didn't like that they saw. A few days later I had heart surgery, and a week later I was back home, weak as a kitten, with lots of new meds to take, and a non-smoker. I felt like I was in the house of a dead relative, that's how profound the change was. In accordance with Bruce Sterling's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that you can make big changes when something big happens, a few months later I was more or less recovered, strong as a bull, determined to make good use of the time I had been given. A few months after that I had moved to Boston, was starting up blogging at Harvard, then BloggerCon, podcasting, and a new life. Lesson learned, don't wait for the bottom to fall out before making the changes you long to make. Also it's a lot easier to quit smoking if you're in a hospital for the first week. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Ted Nelson was a mentor for all developers of my generation. We studied his book and were both thrilled to find other people thought the same way we were thinking, before we came along, and pissed (a little) that we weren't the great inventors we imagined ourselves to be. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/06/19/thehypertextman.html#1&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Nelson in 1995. &quot;He saw the complete picture when I was only getting a glimpse at the parts.&quot;</description>
