It's about reviving the blogger developer community, to give them the tools we didn't have in the 90s and 00s that are now very practical. And start to grow, slowly at first, the way blogging and podcasting grew, with a clear foundation of what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; is, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; is really simple and we're not so vulnerable to Silicon Valley adventures. To give programmers the means to easily deploy their apps with the minimum fuss, and for users to be able to take responsibility for keeping their own work safe. Then, having achieved this I will retire to Albania where I will throw pottery and sew afghans.</description>

			<description>I was looking for a simple list of ingredients for a nice pot roast and made the mistake of looking on Google first, and was bewildered by all the bullshit. Then I thought, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/16/potroast.png&quot;&gt;this is a job for ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. All the business model bullshit prevents the web from being able to answer a simple question. ChatGPT filters out the bullshit and gets right to the point. What is so complicated about that. I don't see any &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/16/misinformation.png&quot;&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, btw.</description>

			<description>I heard from a troll that ChatGPT couldn't come up with a recipe for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/16/latkes.png&quot;&gt;nice potato latkes&lt;/a&gt;. More bullshit. I would only add that you can use chicken fat in place of the vegetable oil if you want the full experience.</description>

			<description>There's this great scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt;. McCartney and Lennon are disagreeing, it's getting personal, or heavy in some way. Lennon looks at McCartney, big pause, and says &quot;It's just me.&quot; The founders of the Beatles. The biggest rock stars. The whole franchise. On the other hand, they were nobodies together. Now everyone thinks we're so important, but come on, it's just me. Funny thing is, when you're a nobody you're desperate to be somebody. And when you're the biggest somebody there is, you yearn to be a nobody again.  Nothing ironic about it, it's almost mathematical. BTW, if you find this clip on YouTube, I'd love to include it with this post.</description>

It's been down &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/04.html#a162658&quot;&gt;since Feb 4&lt;/a&gt;, while it was retooled for email-based identity and HTTPS. It all appears to work as well as it did when we previously did identity with Twitter. It has been a really &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/10/023900.html&quot;&gt;stressful&lt;/a&gt; couple of weeks, while working with developers on getting FeedLand open source release out, I had to also rip up Drummer and put in a new identity system. All the code was written but it still was an ugly transition, one you hope to never have to do. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/178&quot;&gt;Report problems here&lt;/a&gt;.

Legally we have the same rights and deserve the same respect. That’s why your behavior was both bewildering and unacceptable, and why you feel you were chased out of NYC, which is an especially tolerant part of he US because it is a cultural melting pot. We all have to get along, and accept and even celebrate our differences. Your view of the world just doesn’t fit in here.

			<description>Drummer users, we're almost ready to switch over to the new Drummer. If you want your files moved to the new server, you have to register your Twitter address and email address a new utility app. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/177&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; carefully. It takes less than a minute. All you need is access to the Twitter account you used for Drummer and to know what email address you want to use for your Drummer identity.</description>

			<description>What if friends treated their friends as nicely as they treat dogs. When you sensed they needed a little support, you'd look them in the eye and say &quot;Who's the good girl?&quot; Rub behind the ears and when they sit give them a treat. Inside of us, everyone, including you, is a little pup who just wants to know they're in the right place doing the right thing.</description>

The revulsion was gone. These were two New York teams, roughly comparable, and there weren't any carpetbaggers or Nazis on the floor, at least none that I knew of. The weird feeling was pride. This is NY basketball. I like it. Both teams have a good foundation to build on, and lots of first round draft picks in the bank, so there's hope for more talent. But don't import people who already have their championship rings who expect us to root for them. We want a unique experience, suitable for our great city. I'm still a Knicks fan, but I could see myself rooting for the Nets. BTW, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/heat/miami-news/nba-top-performers-of-the-day-feb-13-jalen-brunson-has-big-game-to-lead-knicks-past-nets&quot;&gt;Knicks won in a blowout&lt;/a&gt;, that also contributed to the good vibe. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If I were giving advice to NBA team owners, don't sign players who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving&quot;&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt;. No one wants to see a team win just because they bought famous players with no hunger, and no link to the hometown. I love where the Knicks and Nets are now. I think NY is the best basketball city in the NBA.</description>

			<title>It's Melotime!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It'd be cool if the Knicks or Nets bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; in for the rest of the season. For the fans!

			<title>ChatGPT clearly has a place</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/16/simcity.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1624392828154712064&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; is worth money. I've given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chatgpt&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; programming jobs like the ones the author descibes, and it's saved me huge amounts of time. Last one was asking how to do something with the Twitter API. I could have spent fifteen minutes trying to find it in the docs, or on Stack Exchange, but I got the answer instead in a few seconds, and there was no bullshit, no preambles, just the answer to the question I asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example. Last summer I had a medical problem, and the local clinic that I go to is having problems keeping people on staff. My normal primary care physician, who I loved, had just retired (in her 40s) so I had to see three different doctors, and they all guessed wrong about what was afflicting me. Finally I got a new doctor and after two visits and one visit to a specialist, we had it nailed down, I got treatment and it's getting better. That's a full year of dealing with a problem because no one doctor could focus on the problem long enough to see what the problem was. As an experiment I tried entering the symptoms  to  ChatGPT and it warned me I should see a doctor, but then proceeded to get the diagnosis correct. This is the kind of thing that will save lives, improve overall health, and help our awful health system in the US cope with the fact that doctors are retiring because they have burnout jobs. It might even help the doctors cope with that reality and maybe not burn out in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that most of medicine is doing what ChatGPT does so well. Getting some data and then applying best practices. We all get the same treatment for the ailments we have and most of them are ordinary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam's Razor&lt;/a&gt; maladies (ie it usually is what it looks like it is and it usually is what everyone else has). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalists, who do most of the writing about news, immediately focus on how it might affect their careers, and imho educators zoom past the purpose of education, to create more better-educated people. As a kid, I had a party the day my parents bought us an encyclopedia. That meant we could settle arguments by getting facts. We could've gotten them before but that would've meant a trip to the library. Better tools make for better information. ChatGPT is a revolutionary tool. Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista&quot;&gt;Alta Vista&lt;/a&gt; was when the web first came out. I'm sure people screamed that it would screw up something. People always say that about change, esp people who are invested in the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there will be negative consequences of ChatGPT, but I'm sure we're not in a position to see what they are now, based on experience with similar changes. And maybe we'll look back on this moment twenty years from now, and not be able to imagine what life was like before we had this fantastic tool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the funny things about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/10.html#a020506&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; is that they pitched developers saying &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; I'm sure they meant it, but once &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot; title=&quot;All about RSS.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was established, they tried to replace it with an incompatible format. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; wasn't as powerful as Apple or Google, and their format didn't replace &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot; title=&quot;All about RSS.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. But, imho, when you push an open tech and someone takes you up on it, you should help, not fight them, ie if you really meant it.</description>

			<title>A stressful week</title>

It was supposed to be the week we launched testing of feedlandInstall, enough of a stretch on its own, but it also simultaneously became the week that Drummer had to be converted to a new identity system and HTTPS, all happening at the same time, thanks to the implosion of the API at Twitter. It's okay, it is what it is. I went into it with my eyes open, I knew there could be a day when we had to quickly get out of TwitterVille. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This added some extra chaos to the feedlandInstall process because the products share a package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;, and I had to make changes to how it works to get Drummer working, and there was a risk of FeedLand breakage as a result, and some breakage has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will get there. A new Drummer without Twitter for identity and a new open source release of FeedLand's server so a thousand instances can bloom. Everyone will want to be part of a FeedLand workgroup the same way they are joining Mastodon instances. Communities of feed readers serving larger communities of news users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; responds to things you say when you didn't say &quot;Alexa,&quot; which contradicts everything Amazon says about privacy. If it doesn't listen, then how does it wake up exactly? BTW, Google does this too. Sometimes I'm recording a voicemail or a podcast using my iPhone and my Pixel 6 starts responding to what I am saying. It's funny, even cute, until you realize &lt;i&gt;it wasn't supposed to hear any of that. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Under development, not yet ready for users. But here's something cute. If FeedLand supports HTTPS in all its functionality, it will end up demanding that people with feeds support HTTPS too, and will fail for those who don't. If we continue down this path, I will be doing Google's work, helping them take ownership of the web. Here's the deal. Suppose you're displaying an item from a feed that includes an image. Suppose that image is served from an HTTP website, but your reader is running HTTPS. You won't see the image. The browser will refuse to load it. This came up when Scott Hanson tried to look at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/08/022722.html&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from Scripting News that contained a painting from René Magritte. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/09/magritteInFeedLand.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. I'm trying to think of a way I could &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; give aid and comfort to the enemy. There might be a way. I don't want to betray the open web. I might be willing to do a lot of work so I don't force the owner of that site to support HTTPS (which I know he won't do because he is me). The old moral of the story -- give an inch, they'll take a mile.</description>

Why build something huge if the idea is small. The cost of staying with Heroku would have been totally diseconomic when full servers could run all my apps for $10 a month. Why should I pay Heroku $500 for the same thing, even though I had to do a lot of work to dig out of the hole. Now with Twitter, I think I'll just bow out, and let other people find out if this is workable or not. I'll leave my servers running, and if they stop working, we'll figure out what if anything to do then. None of the apps I've made that depend on Twitter are worth $100 a month to keep running. That's another story, because the Twitter ecosystem for cool utilities was practically non-existent. All that energy from now on clearly is going to Mastodon where there is no vendor who can turn the cart over, at least not yet (don't rule it out, it could happen).</description>

Thanks in advance. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Wed, 08 Feb 2023 16:55:10 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/10/drummer.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/02/08.html#a165510"/>

			<description>One of my favorite things on Twitter are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/lists/1389951899424677888&quot;&gt;art channels&lt;/a&gt;. The curators post reproductions of famous works of art. And occasionally RT another art channel they feel is related to their artist, that their viewers would enjoy. It's a way to broaden the art you get to see. When they talk about how horrible Twitter is they leave out stuff like this. However, without use of the API these channels can't exist, and since each is a labor of love, it's unreasonable to expect them to pay for it.</description>

			<description>A question for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt;. If you are off Twitter, where are we supposed to meet? What's our common ground? Serious question. Maybe it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@brentsimmons@indieweb.social/109815316574037279&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109818552360089269&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;. Is that the best we can do, feature-wise and from a UI and open formats and protocols standpoint, in 2023? We've been at this for almost 30 years. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I'd rather take care of this now than put it off for much longer. I'm asking this question in a lot of places. Why have we let the web stagnate? Why be preoccupied with the machinations of Musk et al. Why don't we take advantage of the new freedom we have in light of their chaos to build new stuff! Taking features out of products seems like giving up to me, or perhaps it's lightening the load. We'll see I guess.</description>

			<description>I changed my Twitter bio, removing the phrase &quot;I'm not trying to get rich or famous.&quot; I felt that was a bit holier-than-thou. And at times I most definitely am thinking about that. So it's a matter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt;. My rule is when what you appear to be is different from what you are, you should change one or the other or both. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/06/partITookOut.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; that highlights the part I took out. I am still dedicated to fixing things that are broken, but there's no unawkward way to say that, so I removed it too for now.</description>

			<title>A quick story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A little story I probably have written before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I once made an exciting product called Frontier just for the Mac, and this turned out to be a mistake, because while I was making the product, Apple changed, and they eventually attacked and destroyed my investment, which was considerable, and also set us back a long way, all of us, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm typing this on a Mac because right now this is the best computer for me to use. But what Apple did to us was terrible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is life. You have to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I had all the pieces written, but I wasn't sure at first how they fit together. This morning I started down a path and everything clicked into place. Like a ski boot into a binding. When the pieces fit together like this I call it &quot;clean living&quot; -- we didn't cut any corners when doing this for FeedLand, and the two products share a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the bits were already there for Drummer. I hadn't worked on Drummer in almost a year. It took a while for the cobwebs to shake off. Nice to see you my old friend, who I've been using all this time. Anyway, I think we'll have a test version of this ready in a day or two. To deploy shortly after, with fingers crossed, praise &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;Murphy&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I had all the pieces written, but I wasn't sure at first how they fit together. This morning I started down a path and everything clicked into place. Like a ski boot into a binding. When the pieces fit together like this I call it &quot;clean living&quot; -- we didn't cut any corners when doing this for FeedLand, and the two products share a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the bits were already there for Drummer. I hadn't worked on Drummer in almost a year. It took a while for the cobwebs to shake off. Nice to see you my old friend, who I've been using all this time. Anyway, I think we'll have a test version of this ready in a day or two. To deploy shortly after, with fingers crossed, praise &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;Murphy&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sun, 05 Feb 2023 18:26:56 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/12/zen.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/02/05.html#a182656"/>

			<description>Update: I have been able to log on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, so I crossed out the first part of the next post.</description>

			<description>&lt;s style=&quot;opacity: 0.9&quot;&gt;Note to people who read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog tab&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News and in the nightly email. &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, the tool I use for linkblogging, relies on Twitter identity. Twitter is not allowing me to log in. I see that's happening for other users too, but I've also heard of users who are able to log on to Radio3 via Twitter. Obviously I'm going to have to fix that app too. Until that happens, the linkblog will not be updating. Can't be helped.&lt;/s&gt; I'm not against Twitter btw, I see it as something that stretches back in time, and likely has some kind of future. It's struggling now, that's for sure. Maybe it'll come back together. I am most definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; rooting against it, and it bothers me to see other people doing it. This isn't a sport, it's a world-level communication system that we use. While Mastodon has taken the Twitter idea for its own, it is not in any way a replacement for Twitter. In the past few days it's become painfully obvious how much we depend on it, and how it's negatively impacting my work when it's in trouble. I don't see any victory really for anyone in this other than people who get a charge from of other people's misery.</description>

It would take too much time to try to keep both versions running at the same time. So I have redirected it to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.lucky.wtf/&quot;&gt;temporary placeholder site&lt;/a&gt;, and when the new site is ready, it will redirect to that site. We will then have to figure out how to have your data meet you on the other side. So this will happen in several steps, of which this is the first. And in doing this I will learn how to do it for other sites such as Radio3, BingeWorthy, etc. If you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/174&quot;&gt;see this thread&lt;/a&gt;. Please don't ask when will it be ready. This is still seat-of-the-pants unfortunately due to the randomness of the changes at Twitter. Also, your data is safe.</description>

			<description>I was getting &quot;invalid token&quot; errors from &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, from Twitter. I tried logging off and logging back on and am not being allowed to. I see in the log that other users are getting that error as well. It could be Twitter's system has failed, or they turned us off.</description>
