Otherwise it was saying something pretty horrific. That the economy will just sail along with huge unemployment, hunger, disease and death.</description>

			<description>On Twitter, a question. Name something that your mother cooked that was your favorite. At first I was going to reply my mother wasn't a very great cook, but then I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1271192726671962112&quot;&gt;remembered&lt;/a&gt;. She sent us, my brother and I, cookies at summer camp. They were the best things ever.</description>

			<description>I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polywood.com/chaise-with-arms.html&quot;&gt;patio lounge chairs&lt;/a&gt; I want. Reasonably priced. Sturdy. Attractive. Only problem is they take a long time to get here. 8 weeks. By that time summer will almost be over. (Update: My friend Peter Politi found the chairs on the Lowe's website at a good price for delivery in 8 days. Problem solved.)</description>

			<title>Defensive driving in code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing the example from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/07/140541.html?title=aCaseStudyInReadableCode&quot;&gt;previous case study&lt;/a&gt;. The routine, pad, takes three parameters, a string or something that can be coerced to a string, a character to pad with, and the number of places to pad to. So &lt;i&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4)&lt;/i&gt; returns a string whose value is 0008. It's useful for neat tabular displays.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In an app I'm working on, I call pad a lot. Then, while testing it in a new environment, I got an error message from the JavaScript runtime:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the stack, the error was in the first line of pad.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I conclude that val is undefined in one of the many calls. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The question -- should I find the place I called it with undefined and add logic to not call pad in that case, or should I add the test in pad, and return something reasonable when val is undefined?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the point of this case study.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Changing a core routine like pad is tricky. If you change its functionality, you potentially break code that calls it. If it's been around a while, who knows all the places it has been called. However in this case, that's not an issue, because any call that has undefined as the value of the first parameter is going to fail. So it's already broken, therefore you can't break it and therefore it's okay to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the question is if it's &lt;i&gt;desirable&lt;/i&gt; to fix it in pad, or in the place that calls it that causes the app to fail. For me that's a no-brainer. It would clutter up every call if we don't put it in the function. The whole point of factoring like this is to trade off a tiny bit of time for space and reduced complexity. Factoring is a good thing, and you should do it whenever it's responsible. Remember what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; said. Basically factoring is good, but don't do too much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I call this coding technique &lt;i&gt;defensive driving. &lt;/i&gt;It's something you do in case the other driver (the caller) screws up. You want to prevent the accident. Most of the time it won't accomplish anything, but when it does, it saves you from a crash. One less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the new version of pad, with the defensive driving code added:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = (val === undefined) ? &quot;&quot; : val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while (s.length &lt; ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;s = withchar + s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (s);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes &lt;i&gt;pad&lt;/i&gt; a little more complicated -- a fact of life. Production code is rarely as simple as demo code because it has to deal with all the crap that gets thrown at it. Defensive driving is how you deal with that, the same as in driving a car or riding a bike in traffic. You never know what the other idiot is going to do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I still want an automatic blog indexer web app. I would pay you $50 a year to do this for my blog. Create a website that's organized like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/10/index.png&quot;&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; in the back of a book. It digests my new stuff every day (or hourly, even better), and adds each item under topics in the index.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I'd like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs. But not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend hours reading a book via its index. A bootstrap. I'd love to help drive such a project. We need this.</description>

			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a135424&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; something like this. Yesterday at the supermarket, I glanced behind in the checkout line, saw a woman who had pulled her mask down. She seemed very naked, as if she had pulled her pants down and you could see everything. Sexual. Very forbidden. A month ago, it wouldn't have been a thing at all.</description>

			<description>One thing that's needed is a canonical place to point about news that isn't behind a paywall. I want to point to something definitive from my blog for Defund The Police. All that Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=defund+the+police&quot;&gt;finds&lt;/a&gt; are news articles on paywalled sites, or ones infused with spyware, or ones whose archives won't last.</description>

			<description>The biggest problem in police in America are the unions. You want to reboot the police? Knock out the unions. Redefine them. Limit their power. Then the voters can pass new laws about police. Until then, anything Congress passes is powerless. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/reagan-fires-11359-air-traffic-controllers&quot;&gt;Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, when he took office, outlawed the Flight Controllers union. So you can do it. No more police unions. Police, you don't like it? You're fired.</description>

I heard it said if Joe Biden doesn't embrace it his election could be in doubt. That's fucked up.  It doesn't mean what it says.

			<description>Defund is not a good word. Whoever came up with the slogan, it may work in City Council meetings, but it isn't a slogan for the presidential election. This needs to be driven by the people, and that's what's happening. The Dems now have all the support needed to make change. Now let's see if they are independent enough to do it. Or are their strings to money too rigid?</description>

			<description>There was so much happening so quickly during the first days of the protests. I couldn't figure out what was going on in NYC. And that's just one city. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/podcasts/the-daily/police-brutality-protests.html&quot;&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; filled in some of the blanks, if you're confused I highly recommend it. It pays to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War&quot;&gt;The Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; every so often for a reminder of how confusing war is. In America, our military thought the Vietnam War was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory&quot;&gt;war against communism&lt;/a&gt;. On the other side it was a war for independence. We fought that war for years, at huge cost, and we didn't even agree on what the war was about. Think about that.</description>

On the other side it was a war for independence. We fought that war for years, at huge cost, and we didn't even agree on what the war was about. Think about that." created="Mon, 08 Jun 2020 20:10:07 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/08.html#a201007"/>

			<description>In a late night &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressthink.org/2020/06/battleship-newspaper/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Jay Rosen tells the story of the editor in chief of the LA Times in the heyday of print news. He likens his publication to a huge battleship steaming along, and describes critics as swimmers throwing dead fish at the ship. Of no consequence. The ship will go where it wants to go, as fast as it cares to. Fast forward to the NY Times in 2020, being forced to listen to their reporters, a new class of critic. They say we might personally be hurt by this thing you did. And no one stops to notice that there are millions of other people who would be hurt, and the Constitution (which makes the idea of a news org possible), and a way of life. Not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/200607/p6#a200607p6&quot;&gt;all the tweets&lt;/a&gt;, op-eds, blog posts, no one sees the problem. In the analog of the LA Times editor, what matters is the ocean. Not the captain, or the deck hands, not the swimmers or the dead fish, or even the battleship. It everything. And that's what's so incomprehensible to an industry that has struggled to be blind to the people it's supposed to serve. Always inventing new distractions. Never showing up for the only job that matters, serving the people.</description>

			<description>Have there been interviews with police, rank and file, saying why they support the officers caught on video torturing and killing American citizens? I'd like to hear, in clear language, the other side of this discussion. So far no one is speaking, as far as I know.</description>

			<description>At Living Videotext, my first company, I used to pore over the regcards when they came back. After they were entered in the database they were cycled back to me a few months later, I would call a few and find out how they were doing with the product, and if they were really using it (I could tell) I'd ask what they wanted to see fixed or added. After a while there was a consensus, and they were usually the things I also wanted added or fixed (and they already had been, I was CEO and lead developer). I saw my job as using the product myself, and also listening to the other people who used it. Actually it was my favorite part of the job. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A case study in readable code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just wrote a JavaScript function that pads a string with a character you supply, to a certain number of places. You call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would return:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;0008&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a useful thing to have around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now how would you write it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet you could do it in a single expression. It might be hard to understand, but in a way that's kind of cool. You have to be smart to understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, as a less spectacular coder, I would write it in eight lines of the most boring code possible. For example, &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while (s.length &lt; ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;s = withchar + s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (s);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can quickly read it and see what it does. I don't have to spend any time thinking about it, so I get on with my project that much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now this might strike you as inefficient. Look at all that code, and the looping. Oy. For fun, write a benchmark script. Call it a million times and see how long it takes. I'm pretty sure you'll see that it's fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It tooks 0.04 seconds to call &lt;i&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4) &lt;/i&gt;a million times on my iMac. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/07/oneMillionLoops.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Albert Einstein &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about unemployment?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough coverage is that the stock market is back to where it was before the pandemic.   How to interpret this? What message is it sending?  Get ready, because this is harsh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're unemployed, it says this. The stock market doesn't need you. Literally, that is its message customized for the unemployed. The market doesn't consider Depression-level unemployment to be a problem for the companies it values.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about bad apples?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We could probably get by with a lot fewer police, something the police might not want to ignore. When they beat up citizens they are not only hurting the citizens, they're burning our money. We are literally paying them to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we can't find the bad apples, we could just start firing  police randomly. Maybe at that point, they'll see the value in helping find, remove and prosecute the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Simplicity is a virtue</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_marcba/status/1268092311587651584&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The value of having a standard language is simplicity for newbies. But it takes discipline to remove barriers, instead developers add them. Eventually (maybe now) the weight of the totality will force the whole thing to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW there are many other virtues of simplicity, not just limiting barriers for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a familiar pattern. When I first got into software, I learned C on Unix. Simplicity. Heavily factored. Less is more. Then I looked at the jobs available in the real world, and they had a stack like the one in the cartoon. I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal&lt;/a&gt; on the Apple II instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because on the Apple II, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Woz&lt;/a&gt; machine, less is more. To display a character just write it to a location in the machine's memory. Again, a fresh slate.   How many fresh slates would it take to get to networked apps? Lots. How many were actually needed if we had discipline?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One. But you have to have a culture where we only add features if we're adding functionality. I have a motto for this.  &quot;Two ways of doing something is worse than one, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had to say this many times over the decades of my career, as other programmers added complexity to an already-too-complex system.  JavaScript *was* a good idea. Now it is a huge hairball because programmers keep wanting to solve the same problems over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maddow had a good point last night. If militia-like police are deployed by the government, without any identification, what's to stop civilians masquerading as police to start acting like government police? Maybe that's the point, if what you want is civil war.</description>

			<description>Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1268716877355810818&quot;&gt;Buffalo police shove&lt;/a&gt; the tall 75-year-old man to the ground yesterday I was struck by two things.  1. If you put people with all the flaws of normal people in uniforms like that they're going to act like pigs. 2. Seeing an old white dude be almost killed that way was jarring, as an old white dude myself.</description>
