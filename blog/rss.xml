But she misses an important point. Men saw what happened too. And while we were effectively silenced in the public debate, men do vote and that's a private thing. I don't doubt that #metoo contributed to more men voting for Trump. So there's another reason to regret forcing Franken to quit without any process, it was stupid politics. I think something similar contributed to Elizabeth Warren's failure as a presidential candidate in 2020. I enthusiastically supported her at first, but then I guess trying to get stronger women's support, she said some awful things about men. It didn't get any press, but I, as a man heard it, and as far as I was concerned it disqualified her. A president has to be for every American, regardless of gender. A woman president is also a president for men. And we can vote. We will I hope have a woman president someday, and when we do, she will appeal to all genders. Men can be feminists, but if you think that equates to attacking men for being men, you won't win. Men still have a lot of votes.</description>

			<title>Do you feel you're better than me?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1550156845976879104&quot;&gt;A poll on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason I ask is that I'm often surprised when people act as if they are better than me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like a person I knew before he was super rich, when I suggested we might work on something together, responds as if I was a lunatic to think he would bend that low. I'd love to ask why he responded so negatively, but I can't do that, because I don't want to go there, to really hear the nasty bits or intonations inside this person. But I wouldn't mind knowing if I didn't have to be present when he gave his answer. It's kind of like what Woody Allen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azquotes.com/author/291-Woody_Allen/tag/death&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; about death. &quot;I am not afraid of death. I just don't want to be there when it happens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have friends from another country, a country that in general feels superior to America. The friends have always acted as if they were better. It sometimes comes out as a joke, but the behavior is there too, indicating that like most jokes, they are also truths. Anyway I think &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; better because my country is a lot bigger and richer than theirs, we have more nukes, and we create more kickass tech and culture. But then I remember my own country is net-net such a jackass internationally, and I remember that we also had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; for 250 years, and we still haven't turned the corner on that. But you have a queen and I know you think that's a positive, but I think it's quaint and more than a bit sad. A family of fat boring people who supposedly have a special connection to god? Please spare me. We have people like that here too, and we're trying to put them in jail. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically the lesson is this -- we all suck. Judge us on what we've done, our actions. Inside we all have ugly thoughts, the question is how much do you act on them. If you think I've created something interesting, consider that perhaps I could do it again. If I've been generous maybe I am generous. Maybe you have prejudices. I can't tell you how many times I've been dismissed as too old to do what I actually did. Like the time, at a conference, a young person asked if I knew what a podcast was, with a doubtful look on her face as if oh god I can't believe I'm actually talking to someone this ignorant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find I do it too, and I've tried to consciously overrule my prejudices, and consider the possibility that someone who doesn't look like they could know anything actually does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Which Markdown?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/discussions/6#discussioncomment-3187614&quot;&gt;Joseph Zitt&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;It's very cool that you're supporting Markdown -- but which Markdown are you using?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This of course is a great question. I answered it, the way all Markdown questions are answered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course as you know there is no One True Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The approach we all take with Markdown text is to stay within a reasonable subset of the syntax, and hope for the best. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I go by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;, which I keep in an icon in the chrome of my browser, easy to reach for. And it seems to work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the Markdown processors I use --&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the client side -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/markdownConverter.js&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; called MarkdownCoverter, which I downloaded many years ago. I seem to recall it's the one that StackExchange uses, so I figured it's got to be pretty good. In all the years I've been using it there haven't been any complaints as far as I know.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the server side -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked&quot;&gt;markd&lt;/a&gt;. I don't recall how I decided to use this one, but it has also served me well.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As I understand it Gruber likes the way it has evolved. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The shit does kind of hit the fan when it comes to using Markdown in something like RSS where interop is the primary thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But this was one of the first enhancements I wanted to get out there in 2022, the 20th year of RSS 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: See the previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/18/163658.html?title=twitterRssMarkdown&quot;&gt;day's&lt;/a&gt; posts about Markdown in RSS feeds.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dev notes for Markdown in RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/18/163658.html?title=twitterRssMarkdown&quot;&gt;blasted&lt;/a&gt; out a lot of information about RSS feeds from Twitter accounts that support Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This note explains how developers can generate feeds with Markdown and handle them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generating feeds with Markdown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suppose you've written blogging software that allows users to enter Markdown text. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you render their posts to the web, you run the text through a Markdown processor which returns HTML which you then copy into the page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You also save the Markdown source text in case the user wants to edit it later. They don't want to edit the HTML you generated, they want to pick up with the Markdown version of the text. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You do something similar in the RSS feed, probably, putting the rendered text in the description element of the item. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now you can also include the Markdown text in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element. To get an idea how that works, have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://feedland.org/twitterfeeds/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for my Twitter account. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/19/swimmingScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the RSS item for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549420878764691458&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The existence of the source:markdown element tells the reader app that it can either use the text of the description as it normally would, or it can start with the Markdown text, render it and then display it. Or perhaps you're sending the text somewhere that understands Markdown -- then you'd just send the Markdown text without rendering. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reading feeds with Markdown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suppose you have a feed reader and want to do something nice for feeds that have source:markdown elements. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is what you do: If you can handle Markdown rendering in your reader app and you spot a source:markdown element, use that in place of the description element.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're passing the text on to an app that can deal with Markdown, for example a database, save the Markdown text in addition to the rendered text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I am developing both an editing tool that generates Markdown text and a feed reader that knows how to render Markdown text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, post a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/discussions/6&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter + RSS + Markdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://feedland.org/twitterfeeds/cluelessnewbie/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for the tweets on my cluelessnewbie test account. This is new. Look at the items in that feed, you'll see each has a  &lt;i&gt;source:markdown&lt;/i&gt; element. It's explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the Source namespace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I entered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549068783066791937&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter, using Markdown to style lists, text, links and code. Also note that the first item in the Twitter thread begins with a single #, which my processor interprets as it being the title for the RSS item. Believe it or not that fixes a pretty big mismatch in the connection between Twitter and RSS, titles. If you remember reading Twitter feeds in Google Reader you'll know what I mean. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The text starts in Twitter, goes out through RSS, is processed by Markdown, and rendered predictably in my reader app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549068783066791937&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/18/markdownInAFeedFromATweet.png&quot;&gt;as rendered&lt;/a&gt; in my RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Summary: We've added Markdown to RSS, and hooked Twitter up to RSS. And of course because it's all open, any RSS reader can support this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the old days on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; when something like this worked I'd end the post with..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Support for this feature is already in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md&quot;&gt;reallySimple package&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/discussions/6&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInFeeds&quot;&gt;devnotes&lt;/a&gt; for Markdown in RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I couldn't work without one. After almost 10 years of working in JavaScript I've got the debugger working almost as well as the one in Frontier. I use the debugger to write code -- if I want to see the data my code has to work with, I don't have to figure it out, I can see it. A debugger isn't just for fixing mistakes, it's for exploring the inner workings of code you might not be familiar with. The first really great debugger I used was THINK C. It made it possible for me to do much more complex projects, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Won't get fooled again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You can invent and evolve a new sport if you are all the elements, yourself. If you're can play all the roles, have a venue, journalists (cover it), and you have fans. If you want to change the rules, you don't need to get anyone's approval, you just need a vision. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how I got blogging going. I had tools for writing, and reading, and I generated feeds myself because I am a writer. I don't have to wait to find a writer who will try out my latest ideas. Or get a feed reader to support the feature, or have editing tools so that other people can do it. It happened even faster with evolving podcasting because it was the second time around, and people were paying attention to the blogs we created in Step 1. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With RSS 2.0, I was intimidated when big companies and VCs got in the way. In the future I'll keep cruising because I know I have a better sense of what's needed than they do because they just hire bored employees to work on my ideas. None of them had the guts, curiousity or frankly enough intelligence to work with the person who put it all together. Learned that lesson after twenty years of stagnation in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rss.land/&quot;&gt;RSS-Land&lt;/a&gt;. No more of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I turned this post into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549146834689556481&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: You can read the feed &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http://feedland.org/twitterfeeds/cluelessnewbie/rss.xml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

They got some things right. The protocol was designed in a couple of weeks by four people, two at Microsoft and two of us not. The Microsoft people were from their networking group. They wanted a cross-platform protocol to do what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model&quot;&gt;DCOM&lt;/a&gt; does. It was and is a brilliant idea. I wanted it as a way of designing APIs for scriptable blogging systems. We were in the process of shipping a new Windows version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we already had a Mac version, and I wanted the two Frontiers to work beautifully together on LANs and on the net. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it, when I figured out that it would be done with XML and HTTP. I then got an email from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft asking if I wanted to work with them on this. I always admired Bob and people like him at Microsoft, they had an excellent engineering culture imho, so of course I said yes. What followed was one of the most productive collaborations of my career. And as a result not only did Frontier get great cross-platform compatibility, all the early blogging systems has compatible APIs. To the Hacker News folks, that's what matters in a protocol, what kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; did it enable.

And as a result not only did Frontier get great cross-platform compatibility, all the early blogging systems has compatible APIs.

			<description>I want Biden to step back after the election and let the Democrats have a great primary campaign where we really discuss, as a country, what our options are going forward. Not limited to things considered too daring, like expanding the court. It's clear Biden will not do what we need. But that's okay, his greatest contribution would be to create a stage for the next generation of leaders to work things out, along with Bernie Sanders and others.</description>

			<title>The Dems are the problem now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who say we shouldn't criticize Dems are crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're losing on every front and all the Dems have to say is we need to vote so they can codify reproductive rights, which is, sad to say only a small part of the problem, a symptom of the disease, not the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic leadership has yet to commit to doing anything about all the other chaos that the Supreme Court has inflicted on us. It's not good enough to bring back reproductive rights, we have to neutralize all the other attacks as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a voter, citizen, taxpayer, human being -- this is unacceptable. If the current leadership of the Democratic party can't get this together, now, then we must act quickly to get new leadership. We don't have any time to waste. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Medium in the rear-view</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People are writing their summaries of Medium's accomplishments today, because yesterday Evan Williams announced he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/220712/p14#a220712p14&quot;&gt;stepping down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO to start an R&amp;D company. Here are the ones I've seen people mention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Clean look.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't have to start a blog to write a post.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Authors have a way to make money.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No argument with the first item. Design was always its big thing. It was designed by someone who understood writing and reading on the web. That's the thing that made it stand out in 2012 when it started, and now its ethos has been absorbed by designers everywhere and that was good positive contribution to web design. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not having to start a blog is mainly a matter of how they present it. You don't have to give your space a name. Maybe that is an impediment for writers. As a designer myself, I'm taking note. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;About making money, I think that was the fatal flaw of Medium. The thing that no one could relax about for a moment. It was always judged on those terms. I didn't think it was achievable ten years ago, and I don't think it's achievable today. Writing publicly on the net is about something other than being paid as a writer and funding a public writing space as Williams and Medium's outside investors did, shouldn't depend on whether Medium makes money. I just don't understand why someone who's worth as much money as Williams cares in the slightest whether his new (in 2012) blogging system made money. He didn't care if Blogger made money a few years earlier when he was broke! Now that he has an infinite amount of money all of a sudden he cares about making money? I don't know. Doesn't make any sense to me. It's okay to make software just because you love to make software, even if making money is not the motive.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now Substack has taken Medium's place as the default place of for-the-record-writing, and once again they've tied a business model to public writing, and that will make them do all kinds of contortions to restrict the movement of their writers and eventually readers, because at some point their investors will want to know how they're getting paid. And of course investors have every right to expect to make money, that's why they invested. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One time around this loop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At some point, I hope the default place of for-the-record-writing is an easily cloneable system that supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twowayRss&quot;&gt;Two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt; then we can all relax and wish them the best, and see it as a good thing for the flow of ideas on the net. But as long as these systems are tied to the expectations of VCs, we will never get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Maybe one of the foundations would support an open, cloneable and free place of for-the-record-writing to once and for all remove the business model from this important societal function?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium as the place-of-record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I talk about default place-of-record writing in this piece, something that everyone knows about but I haven't seen people write about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you want to get something on the record, people still use Medium, but it's not the only place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I knew something was out of whack when the President of the United States, Barack Obama, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ObamaWhiteHouse/president-obama-addresses-the-nation-on-keeping-the-american-people-safe-b4cfa8a0f143&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; it for that purpose. The taxpayers gave him a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; for that. He should have used it. Archives is something the US government knows a lot about, and the United States itself is a lot more long-lived that a struggling Silicon Valley startup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I knew something weird was happening when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Baquet&quot;&gt;Dean Baquet&lt;/a&gt;, the Executive Editor of the New York Times, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amedium.com+Dean+Bacquet%2C+the+Executive+Editor+of+the+New+York+Times%2C+wrote+a+Medium+post&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsbJrF7zqIeZsYzxJM16xR5mMiIXrA%3A1657739233902&amp;ei=4RfPYq3VNuaJptQP18mY8Ao&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtyarxx_b4AhXmhIkEHdckBq4Q4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=site%3Amedium.com+Dean+Bacquet%2C+the+Executive+Editor+of+the+New+York+Times%2C+wrote+a+Medium+post&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BAgAEEc6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEEcQsAMQyQM6CggAEOQCELADGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGAFQ_jtYkVxg9V1oAnACeACAAWuIAZ4JkgEEMTYuMZgBAKABAcgBDcABAdoBBggBEAEYCQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; about some newsroom controversy.

As far as I know Medium has never said anything about a commitment to maintaining the record, although being a for-profit business they wouldn't do anything to get people to stop thinking of it as the default place-of-record. We need and deserve better. It's time to stop thinking of technology as only a place to make money. It's clearly being used for other important things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Two-way RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a reader, I have no problem with a publishing site like &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; only doing outbound RSS. All my reading tools can hook into their authors' writing. It's good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as a writer, I can't use a system that doesn't do inbound RSS. It's the inverse of the silo problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Such a site insists that I do all my writing on there. That's a deal-stopper because I already have my best writing tool and I do all my serious writing in that tool.  It's as if a radio station insisted that I use their guitar to play music. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someday we'll look back on this practice and think how could we have missed something so obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked writers who use Substack how they feel about this, with mixed results. None of the writers are thinking about it very much, apparently. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Give us something to remember</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for something spectacular from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet&quot;&gt;first photo&lt;/a&gt; released from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope&quot;&gt;JWST&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at 5PM, but when I saw it I had no idea what I was looking at. The explanations were technical, and while I am technical in some areas, the cosmos is not one of them. Also as someone who was raised in NYC -- I didn't grow up with a view of the cosmos as people who live in more rural areas do. So none of what we saw in that photo means much to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were told by experts that this was really impressive, I'm sure they're right -- but I was hoping for something that would make me gasp, that would give us &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; something to remember. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am old enough to remember the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/07/20/#a1405894933&quot;&gt;moon landing&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. I suppose there were some who said they shouldn't bother with a TV camera for live broadcasts, but they had it, and we saw Neil Armstrong climb down the ladder and say his famous first words. This moment is probably just like that. The first time we're seeing the cosmos as a peer, not from the point of view of someone on or near a planet, but from the perspective of a solar system. Maybe at some point we'll have a telescope outside of our solar system, but I won't be around for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I tuned in at 5PM for the great unveiling, I was greeted with nothing. There was nothing on the TV channels I tuned into. Nothing on Twitter. A few hours later on Twitter I saw a picture a bunch of blurry lights. I was told this was it. Come on folks, point the camera at something we know. &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2490/saturns-rings-shine-in-hubble-portrait/?category=planets_saturn&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt; perhaps. Maybe Earth. It's not what the telescope is for, I get it, nor was the moon landing for sending a TV show back to Earth, but we're the audience for the moment. Give us something we can remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway there's another moment coming up this morning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webb.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/countdown.html&quot;&gt;the official unveiling&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to be emotionally overcome with pride and amazement and a bit more optimism for the future. Give us a show.
