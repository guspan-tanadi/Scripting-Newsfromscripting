			<description>I watched a lot of news this evening. I forget who said this -- women do not want Ted Cruz controlling their bodies. I think that's compelling. I, too, would not  want &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1521331931878731776/photo/1&quot;&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt; anywhere near my body.</description>

			<description>An idea for a movie. Get a writer to transcribe the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt; fiction, turn it into a screenplay. That's the story. I bet it would be a box office smash. I'm surprised Hollyood hasn't done this yet.</description>

			<description>People used to assume you have to make money from a blog, which is ridiculous. My blog did make me money but only incidentally, by making products of mine more famous, or helping establish standards that allowed me to build other products. But I never did this for the money, I pay money to do the blog. I do it because I have ideas that I want to get out there. It's worth it.</description>

			<description>Ukraine had to deal with what we're &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1521145126390796288&quot;&gt;going through&lt;/a&gt; now. Their political system was undermined by Putinites, proclaiming their right to speak, but they were undermining their democracy like the Putinites here are today. They solved the problem by being hardcore about it. Free speech is not more important than survival of democracy. We will have to make that choice too, until we do, we'll be stuck where we are.</description>

			<description>I don't know how McCartney came up with the idea for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;, but I imagine he goes into a junk store and takes a look around. Then he goes home and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulmccartney/junk.html&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; a song about what he saw. &quot;Candlesticks, building bricks, something old and new. Memories for you and me.&quot;</description>

			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1520786270728990721&quot;&gt;trying to figure out&lt;/a&gt; why Wordle's reports get mangled when they come through the Twitter API. I find when I paste them into a local text file they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/01/wordleMangle.png&quot;&gt;look pretty bad&lt;/a&gt; too. Update: It appears it has nothing to do with the Twitter API, rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1520791215414947847&quot;&gt;the fonts&lt;/a&gt; that are used to render the page.</description>

			<title>I want my karass</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem on Twitter is that no one will hear this tweet. Because trying to stay in touch with 1000 people is utterly impossible. Some people follow many more. And then there are the people you don't follow who have a good idea. How do you keep that channel open without also leaving it open for scammers. We haven't figured that out yet. As far as I know, no one is trying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What we are left with -- everyone's attention even for the things you follow relatively closely is infinitesimal, and it's constantly diminishing. So it gets even harder for ideas to circulate because nothing penetrates. How can I forward you something you need to know if I never see it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I yearn for is a &quot;karass&quot; system, for the 12 people who I want to communicate with who I know will pay attention, and will let me build up ideas over a period of weeks or months. And I do the same for them. Their projects connect with mine, we're constanty improving the system, creating new gateways, modifying others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had that work once in 2001, when I was working on Radio UserLand with a small team of people spread out over the world. Ever since I have been trying to recreate the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: According to the Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle#Bokononism&quot;&gt;Cat's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, a karass is &quot;a group of people linked in a cosmically significant manner, even when superficial linkages are not evident.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
