			<description>Debuggers aren't only for debugging, they're also programmer's way of looking inside the body of the software. We can stop the heart beat and look anywhere we want. We can put our attention in any organ we want. Or more than one at a time. It's how you can watch the organism doing its work, if you forget how it works because you wrote it a long time ago, or if someone else wrote it. If you aren't using a debugger in all aspects of your programming work you're limiting the amount of complexity you can deal with in your code.</description>

			<title>A place for urgent news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1431959907927040001&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that about collaboration in the news industry to help disseminate critical information. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;An idea for the news industry to collaborate on. Sometimes a news org takes down the paywall on a story because it's important that everyone see it. Make an RSS feed that combines all such stories across all pubs. Make spreading the news even more efficient.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A simple idea, really -- not much tech, and news orgs are already doing it. The post got a lot of traction on Twitter, and favorable notice from a fair number of people &lt;i&gt;inside news orgs, &lt;/i&gt;people who would be critical to making this idea a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what's needed, technically, beyond what's already there? Probably just this -- a way to tell, in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed, that an item is outside the paywall.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How to do that? Create a namespace, anyone can do that. Call it (say) the &lt;i&gt;urgentNews&lt;/i&gt; namespace. You could have its url point to this post if you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To begin with the namespace has one element, &lt;i&gt;isOutsidePaywall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what an item might look like for such a news item.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;item&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;title&gt;Sed do eiusmod tempor&amp;lt;/title&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;description&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

			<description>As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/28.html#a150550&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chair_(2021_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Chair&lt;/a&gt;, but there was something in the story I wish they had explored. Spoilers follow. One of the faculty, a young white male superstar, is accused of being a Nazi by students. They have demonstrations. Make demands. The faculty freezes. He tries to respond, his colleagues tell him this never works, when men try to defend themselves, it only makes it worse. He's seen as not contrite. We see the issue only from the faculty standpoint, all we hear from students are slogans and soundbites. We do hear from one student who will be hurt by the takedown. We understand from the start that the professor is not a Nazi. As I watched the confrontation, I wondered if the individual students knew they're wrong. Why was this not explored? Do any of the students argue that they should help the professor instead of attacking? (He's a sympathetic character, his wife died recently.) I know this is TV and they're subject to the same dishonesty they're portraying (Netflix defends Nazis). As I said yesterday, the acting is great, the characters are appealing, it's a page-turner of a binge-watch. But with one small exception, the students are portrayed as flat angry unreasonable monsters. They can't be that single-minded, unconflicted, thoughtless. It left me feeling dissatisfied. Now that I've written it up, I can move on. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Over the past couple of days I binged season 1 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chair_(2021_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Chair&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. I liked it. It's quick, only about three hours. It's a Sorkin-like show, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-west-wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-newsroom&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, fast dialog. Fun and really pulls on the heartstrings. There's cute smart little girl, and a timely plot of a second-tier Ivy League school that reminded me that campuses can be interesting places to hang out. I gave it a 4 of 5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-chair-2021&quot;&gt;on BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Fun and really pulls on the heartstrings. There's cute smart little girl, and a timely plot of a second-tier Ivy League school that reminded me that campuses can be interesting places to hang out. I gave it a 4 of 5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-chair-2021&quot;&gt;on BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sat, 28 Aug 2021 15:05:50 GMT" type="outline" urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOqtBtWGl1Q" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/08/28.html#a150550"/>

			<title>Twitter says no soup for you!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Still the most annoying thing is when you switch into Twitter you get about 1/2 second to scan what's there, enough time for pictures to register, and boom it refreshes with new content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This also has another painful side-effect, if you're watching a video, it'll just refresh in the middle of it. I was intently listening to the chairman of the Fed the other day, and then part of a Grateful Dead concert, when Twitter decided enough! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/28/weReserveTheRightToRefuseServiceToAnyone.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSTiKHOFEI&quot;&gt;No soup for you&lt;/a&gt;!  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a CNN commercial where a white guy in a suit, probably an actor, is talking to the camera. He says (paraphrasing): &quot;The NRA is not going away. Every American should have a gun.&quot; I wanted to ask if he felt that every Black man should have a gun, or just Whites. What about religion? Should Jews and Muslims have guns too? Should only rich people have guns, or should poor people have them too? If a Black man came to your all-White neighborhood would you like to see him with a gun? Would you call the cops if a Black man came into a convenience store with a gun? I suspect he was thinking, when he said every American should have a gun, of Americans like himself.</description>

			<title>API for newsletter publishing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I keep beating &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/24.html#a211637&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/02/153208.html?title=aProposalForNewsletterTools&quot;&gt;drum&lt;/a&gt;, because it's important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thej/status/1431230072103440389&quot;&gt;Thejesh posted&lt;/a&gt; a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.buttondown.email/v1/schema&quot;&gt;Buttondown's API&lt;/a&gt;. I like it -- it's really simple. But it could be even simpler! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First a summary of why this is important. I want to use my own editor to write a newsletter and publish it through a commercial newsletter service. I don't want to use their editor. Why? Because as a writer, I have the best editor for me. And I don't like being a copy-paste-bot. My writing has too many ways to get out to make it possible to do that for all of them. And I want someone to go first, to make it easy to publish without forcing me to be creative in their world, with their inadequate (for me) editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So to further the discussion -- here's how I would do the API .&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The user, through the app's user interface, enters the URL of an RSS feed. That interaction is of course authenticated.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When a new item appears in the feed, publish it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For extra credit, accept a simple unauthenticed ping message with the username, which tells your server to check the feed. That way your server doesn't have to check as often.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Voila, super simple API.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's the thing about the Taliban and ISIS -- they're competing for the same soldiers, and as long as ISIS is attacking and hurting the US, they're going to recruit more soldiers, primarily from the Taliban. So the Taliban &quot;controls&quot; Afghanistan in a temporary way. They're going to be fighting other radicals for a long time to come.</description>

			<description>I saw somewhere the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/bidens-approval-ratings-plummet-bad-news-for-democrats-in-congress.html&quot;&gt;Biden's approval numbers are down&lt;/a&gt; because the virus is booming. This is wrong. He's doing the job we hired him to do. Our mistake is we give up our power and responsibility and look to a parent figure to take care of us. But that's not how America works. The president isn't all-powerful, isn't a god, or even god-like. The president is a human being. We should judge the president on their honor and intelligence, and ability to listen, and we should take responsibility for &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; power.</description>

			<title>Autonomous cars everywhere?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember a couple of years ago people were confidently saying that by now the streets would be full of autonomous cars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They snickered when people like me who have spent a life programming thought that was a pretty shitty idea. Who would even want to go out for a walk with driverless cars all over the place, subject to programmers' mistakes, or the callous deprecations of platform vendors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagined a car plowing into a crowd and killing twenty innocent people because some idiot at Apple decided to change the order the params of an API because they felt like it, and the car software dev missed the notice and didn't update the car's OS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh sure I want software doing all the driving after less than two years of a burn in. Yeah that makes all the sense in the world. (Sorry for the sarcasm.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Graduation day, 1976</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here I am, in 1976, holding a college diploma. My parents, grandmother and brother came down to New Orleans for the occasion. They were happy because no one expected me to get a college degree. This came from my father's photo scrapbook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Unfortunately journalists don't stand for re-election. They are not term-limited. There is no journalism for journalism. Our opinions are not sought.

A couple of weeks ago I discovered, entirely on my own, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/a&gt;. I loved it from the first scene in the first epsiode. I started telling everyone I know how great it is, and with few exceptions they said &quot;old news Dave.&quot; They loved the show since it started in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_episodes#Season_1_(2013%E2%80%9314)&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;. Why did I struggle for years to find something great to watch when Rick and Morty was out there. I'm sure there are a dozen other delicious shows I don't know about, and it's only getting worse. What is the answer? It seems like a simple problem to solve, yet it evades an answer.</description>

			<description>They've had the same tired old guests on the cable news shows for years. They always say the same things. How is it that people don't just change channels and tune into 30-year-old Law &amp; Order reruns instead. I've been enjoying watching the reruns for the 15th time. Compared to the news they seem fresh and strangely relevant.</description>

			<description>The remains of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Henri&quot;&gt;Tropical Storm Henri&lt;/a&gt; has been parked overhead for about 24 hours. Pouring rain, hour after hour. Not much wind. I couldn't go riding yesterday, and probably won't be able to today either. Tomorrow should be hot and humid, good swimming weather. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

First few episodes were pretty awful, but I'm glad I stuck with it, the last two were gems.

			<description>You'd think that by now &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt; would have figured out how to make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/22/squintyText.png&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; read well on their website, by default, based on who's reading and what their vision is capable of.

			<description>A perhaps surprising truth. We aren't free to ignore other people. For example, you're not allowed to shit in a public swimming pool. Think about it and all the other things you aren't free to do. It's not something you can argue about and live with other people.</description>

			<title>Extreme silo-osity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I tried to post this reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/om/status/1429230610439041025&quot;&gt;Om on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; but it wouldn't let me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Om, the height of silo-osity was when &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/span&gt; came along, they insisted that in order to use their service you had to use their editor. I absolutely refused to do that, so I had to write my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email distributer app&lt;/a&gt;. What a waste of effort. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We have to get through to them and others. Componentize so some devs can specialize in editors and others can specialize in distribution. We can't all dominate the same world, being all things to all people. What a difference it would make if we worked together. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No more shitty editors, lots of different kinds of editors for all kinds of writers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They wouldn't listen to me, but maybe they'll listen to a successful tech VC. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/06/150554.html?title=copypastetopublish&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with Substack earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Journalism is oblivious</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalism says the pullout from Afghanistan was botched. Maybe so. Everything everyone does is botched, and that includes journalists, esp journalists, because no one is watching over them, reporting all their botchings. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism is oblivious to the past or future. Everything is in the moment. A lot like Trump in that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why aren't the people obsessed with Afghanistan like journalism is? Because it was always there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That Afghanistan is being botched isn't news, it's just that journalism has decided for now to pay attention to it. Next week it'll be something else. Always a horse race. Biden has to win or lose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Never mind the context, we're still one election away from complete disaster. At least 49% of the people aren't overlooking this important fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words journalism is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I totally despised &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus&quot;&gt;White Lotus&lt;/a&gt; through the first four episodes, but having so much invested in it, and the hook in the first episode, got me to watch the last two episodes, which were actually pretty good except for one bit that I saw coming and averted my eyes it was so disgusting. And you know the way they left it there's definitely going to be a season 2.</description>
