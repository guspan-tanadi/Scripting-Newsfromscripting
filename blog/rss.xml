			<description>I'm working my way through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Things_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt;, just got to the episode where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Rainbow&quot;&gt;Randy Rainbow&lt;/a&gt; guest stars. He plays a serious role, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbLIYEXqWeA&quot;&gt;sings a song&lt;/a&gt; that's so incredibly sweet. Viewing young love forty years later. I'm there right now. Remembering the women I've loved. And how ineptly I did that when I was young, but I really felt it and still do.</description>

			<description>BTW, don't forget, just because Trump lost the election doesn't mean he isn't still playing his game. Control the story to draw our attention from where the real action is. This time it's pretty obvious that his Russian owners are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/201213/p71#a201213p71&quot;&gt;hacking the shit&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html&quot;&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;. That's going to have some serious consequences. You know what Trump says. &quot;They just let you do it.&quot; That's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxFF6eKrH4s&quot;&gt;us&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Why didn't the Supreme Court do more? As keepers of the Constitution do they have to wait until they're asked a question. Couldn't they ask us a question -- The Constitution provides for a criminal president like Trump. Why isn't the country using it?</description>

			<description>When will journalism stop covering the disappointment of Trump supporters. They lost. They're having a hard time dealing with it. Meantime we're in the middle of a pandemic. Let them get over it on their own. My mother understood this. When my little brother was complaining about something, very unfairly, and loudly, my mother would say if you just ignore him he'll stop. She was right.</description>

			<title>The moment CNN was not prepared for</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Porter_Anderson/status/1338173209389240322&quot;&gt;CNN accuses Fox&lt;/a&gt; of lack of proportionality. I've been watching CNN the last few weeks. I find it mind-numbing. (A good thing, for now, I play video games and watch Twitter while CNN is on.) They repeat the same two stories over and over since Election Day. Literally the same words, over and over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's really going on imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both Fox and CNN are paralyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are prepared for hurricanes, earthquakes, even another 9/11. But they have no idea what to do with a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly the Trump rebellion is on a scale they have no concept of how to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are people &lt;i&gt;who do not improvise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As Chris Hayes said, they all did very well in school. Rose through the ranks. Lots of book learning and discipline. They can make looking like a maverick as tame as a lamb, which is good for the cash flow of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they can't improvise. They can only do what they were taught to do. They weren't taught how to do this job. So they are stuck. Paralyzed. Going round and round trying to catch a familiar beat, but they can't because it doesn't have one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The moment podcasting came into being</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It happened in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10.html&quot;&gt;October 2000&lt;/a&gt; in NYC. I met with Adam Curry over a couple of days at a hotel in midtown on the west side. I mention the meeting in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/12.html#myUserlandOnTheDesktop&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on December 28, 2000. Here's an excerpt. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It helps to have a user in mind when you're developing. In NY, when I met with Adam for two days he kept trying to explain what he wanted, but he's not a software developer, so to my ears it came across like hodgepodge. But I listened anyway, I kept trying to feed back what I heard, but we weren't connecting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I got back home I did what programmers do, I iterated, and kept showing it to him. Is this what you wanted? Eventually we got there, this software hits his button. It's also a framework for his vision for last yard connectivity. You can move huge pieces of content without any waiting and using the bandwidth that you don't use. When you're home sleeping in your bed your desktop system can get the big stuff, you won't even know it's there until it's fully downloaded on your hard disk.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is how video and music are going to move over the net in 2001. Who would have thought RSS would play a role in this? Adam did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the key idea on podcasting. How to distribute large bits of audio and video without having to wait for them to download. At the time, it was the slowness of the net that stood in the way of what we now call podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The significance of this is that it was 20 years ago. It led to a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; which supported enclosures for the first time. I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/12/27.html&quot;&gt;wrote this up&lt;/a&gt; on the blog that month. And the software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MUOTD%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;MUOTD&lt;/a&gt; became Radio UserLand, which was a two-way blogging and reading app for RSS. It's something the software industry hasn't replicated, not because it's so hard technically, it isn't. Not sure why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two-day meetup was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/26.html&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;. It still took a couple of months from then before we had any real demos. It was competing with other projects we had at UserLand at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was also a Scripting News dinner at Katz's Deli on Houston St during the same visit on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why I need a &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptscript.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript-like scripting language&lt;/a&gt;. I had a bug in a script I use to backup various files from my blog in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. It was simple enough to fix, but the script stopped working 27 days ago, so now I have a hole in my repo with all the missing days. This is the kind of problem you solve with a scripting language. Doing this in standard JS is going to be a pain in the ass. But I'll do it because I care. But things could be so much better.</description>

			<description>Sooo, the Dems are horrible at communicating with the people. You'd think that would be something a political party would be &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; at. But most Dems suck, even Obama, and definitely Clinton, going all the way back to Dukakis, which was the first presidential campaign I tried to give a free idea to (and a good one it was, in hindsight). Al Sharpton is great, as is Mayor Pete, and of course they're shipping him off to China. See how &lt;i&gt;ridiculous&lt;/i&gt; they are. Oy!</description>

			<description>Google changed the icon for Chrome? It's as stupid a thing to do as a cigarette maker changing the taste or packaging of their product. It's an addiction you don't even know you have until they &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; you conscious of it. Going to the web is programmed so deep into my neurons, it's at the base of my spine, a total reflexive thing, addict behavior. Now I think about it every damn time. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/09/iconbar.png&quot;&gt;Safari icon is next to it&lt;/a&gt;, and btw it &lt;i&gt;hasn't&lt;/i&gt; changed. Which browser you use is something they want you not to think about, as long as it's their browser. Maybe it's a bug, in which case never mind. But if it was deliberate, it's a stupid move. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Positioning%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Positioning&lt;/a&gt; for the importance of what's in peoples' minds.</description>

Esp for taking out the garbage at night. You can carry all the bags and still see where you're going. One special feature is that the spy cam can't see your face, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stQIznrn-1E&quot;&gt;illustrated in this video&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Apple zealots suck</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a very pragmatic problem with the religious zeal people have for Apple products. I can't tell when I should take their advice if they always gush about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two recent examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A friend, a VC, told me that the XS Max was totally worth the $1500. So I got one. No way it was worth that. I replaced it this year with a new SE for $350, and I love it, actually more than the XS Max because it's only $350. I'm cheap that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another friend told me last month I had to get the new earpods. $250. A little steep, but the way he was talking, it sounded like Moses had come down from the mountain with the secret to human happiness, and I could get it for only $250. So I did it, on an impulse. Well, they're nice enough, but there's absolutely nothing special about them. I like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=WH-1000XM4+Wireless+Noise-Canceling+Headphones&amp;qid=1607538440&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVEtROTdWUkwwVVExJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDEwMDc3MjJONDJPRklMN0dBMSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODA4MjY1MjVEWVdBQ1VSVDBXNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=&quot;&gt;Sony overear headphones&lt;/a&gt; better (almost exactly the same price, btw). I buy headphones on a whim, so I know what's good. These are ok, but didn't not deserve the review they got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So all this ends up backfiring for people who want to help Apple sell product, which btw, I'm happy about since I bought Apple shares in 1997, and have watched them make me rich,. But as a user, I am offended by the way people go on and on about such bullshit. Headphones and iPhones aren't sex toys or drugs. They're products. They're good products, but they also suck like all products do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back in the day there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage&quot;&gt;million pixel web page&lt;/a&gt;, they sold individual pixels, $1 a pixel. The guy made the money, got paid for all the pixels. Anyway what made me think of this was President-elect Biden could sell seats at the virtual inauguration and use the money for a good cause. I'd like to be part of a million people participating in the inaugural, without endangering people's lives (including my own).</description>

			<description>Highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gov-cuomos-briefing-for-december-7/id1506413883?i=1000501621982&quot;&gt;yesterday's Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt;, esp the conversation between Cuomo and Fauci. Important: we need 80 percent to be vaccinated to eliminate the virus. Everyone, legal or illegal, no matter where they live. Of course, not likely, given that more than half of NYC firefighters say they will &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7ny.com/fdny-vaccine-covid-pfizer/8560168/&quot;&gt;refuse the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. These are people who run into burning buildings, but think the vaccine is too dangerous?</description>
