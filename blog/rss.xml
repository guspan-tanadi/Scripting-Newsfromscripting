			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/for-all-mankind&quot;&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly lame. There is one moment where there's a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-expanse&quot;&gt;The Expanse&lt;/a&gt; feel to it, when the daughter is docking with the big ship. I thought &quot;yes that's what this could have been.&quot; It gets a turd rating on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy list&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>What's cool about watching the Speaker rollcall for the fourth time is that we get to review the sheer size of the House, hearing the name and voice of every member. It's real, a new kind of programming.</description>

			<description>I can't stop watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1609719192596381696&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. I want to know who each of the performers are. And the stories of each of the soldiers. I have a favorite, but they're all fascinating. I have a lot of Russian blood, my grandparents spoke Russian to each other. I could see a TV series like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/lost&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt; based on the characters in the video.</description>

			<description>I tuned into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham&quot;&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/a&gt; interview last night on Fox with one of the 20 reps who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/politics/20-republicans-voted-against-mccarthy/index.html&quot;&gt;voted against McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. His problem is that McCarthy works with Dems to do things that he ran against. What else could he do. Made sense, even though I don't support the things he stands for.</description>

			<description>It might be time for a new political party to form in the House. I'm pretty sure a majority of voters love watching the Repubs fight this way. I sure do. It's an actual bonafide horse race. They should keep doing this until the Republican Party explodes.</description>

			<description>I introduced a problem in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/changenotes/2022/12/28/162013.html&quot;&gt;keyboard navigation&lt;/a&gt; in the Feed List feature was added. Basically, if you had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;Feed List&lt;/a&gt; displayed, an &quot;ask dialog&quot; wouldn't receive your keystrokes, or it would appear to freeze. This dialog appears whenever FL asks for a string, for example to enter a string to search for, or to enter the URL of a feed to subscribe to. I believe I found the problem and fixed it. It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/163&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Now I'm a nobody compared to her, but she was so gracious -- it made we wonder if grace is part of what makes someone a great blogger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I think of great blogging I think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;Julia Child&lt;/a&gt;. She was on a mission to teach everyone who would listen about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-Vol/dp/0375413405/ref=asc_df_0375413405/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312061146391&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17119945012164616075&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-435445841003&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=60223809057&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=312061146391&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17119945012164616075&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-435445841003&quot;&gt;French cooking&lt;/a&gt;. She would never miss an opportunity to praise someone for giving it a try. In the same way &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;HCR&lt;/a&gt; believes in American democracy, and that appears to be the source of her grace. It certainly is a consistent theme through all her posts, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.megaphone.fm%2FVMP8436744812&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, and the one book of hers that I have read. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I used the word &quot;sass&quot; to describe some of her blogging. I was thinking about the way she talks about Thomas Jefferson. It's good. It says to me, a person who got a fairly standard education in American History from New York public schools, that these founders that we all iconify and think were so great, actually were people, and some of them were not beyond reproach, like Jefferson. That's the source of my use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+sassy&quot;&gt;term&lt;/a&gt; in yesterday's post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>TV relationships</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/02/thePetries.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been bingeing some highly rated but very mediocre TV series. What makes them so bad is how they present human relations. For example, it's very common for one character to approach another and ask &quot;Are you OK?&quot; with the clear implication that they are not. The person who is supposedly hurting, or sad, confused, troubled, about to die, grieving some horrific event (that we might know about) puts on a happy face and says &quot;No everything's fine, what makes you think I'm hurting, sad, confused etc?&quot; We know it's fake and so does the accuser. I imagine that a lot of people watching it think this kind of interaction is okay, but it's actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; which is a terrible thing to do to another person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is how they portray romantic relationships. A wife is dancing wildly at a party. The husband grabs her and takes her home, and on the way back explains how embarrassing her behavior was to him. I want to yell at him -- hey who cares if you're embarrased. It has nothing to do with you. And she was having fun. I can imagine being married to you is pretty stressful. Etc etc. Or a young dude once gets to have sex with an older woman and is therefore obsessed with her for his whole life, even after he's married to a very nice age-appropriate woman. The way he describes his feelings might be the way an infant would describe their relationship with a caregiver. &quot;Without you I can't live,&quot; he says. Sorry but that's bullshit. The baby is dependent. No matter how you feel, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; live without your age-inappropriate GF. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think about all the great shows I've binged many times and wish there were more out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my Bingeworthy ratings&lt;/a&gt; for shows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you see something that you think I would love, feel free to drop me an email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Every day she teaches us something about what's happening, in a historic context. This is blogging at its best. If she has a business model it isn't in your face. She has something to add and she does it generously and with great expertise and sass.

			<description>Mastodon has a cute way to validate sites as being yours. If you put your masto address in the text of the site that's good enough. But it has to be HTTPS. Oh well. I think they get most things right at Masto, but the trying to force people to adopt HTTPS is selling out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and their thirst to own the web, which is imho not theirs to own.</description>

			<description>A new application for AI. Rate the humor level of a tweeted &quot;joke&quot; response. If people knew how unfunny their supposed jokes were they might think again before inflicting them on others. Better yet, score people on the quality of the jokes they actually post. Publish that score next to their number of followers.</description>

			<description>Requiring people to use one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character in a password is bullshit. It doesn't make your password more secure. What it does is make it impossible to remember the password.</description>

			<description>I remember when I saw a product that expired after 2000 and thought that I had arrived in the future. Hah. It's 2023 now. That's just ridiculous. It's impossible that I actually have lived this long. It's all bonus from here-on-out.</description>

			<title>In the new year, I miss my mother</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reading back over the archives of my Facebook posts, the &lt;i&gt;On This Day In&lt;/i&gt; posts, it's the biggest gift when I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/01/iMakeMyselfLaughThanksToFacebook.png&quot;&gt;tell a joke&lt;/a&gt; to my future self and make that person who I would become happy all over again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I enjoy my own writing more than anyone else, anyone that is, except my mom. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure she thought I wouldn't miss her when she was gone, but she was wrong about me in so many ways, so why not one more? Every time I look back on some event I measure it by whether or not she was still alive when it happened. It permeates everything I do. I wish it were otherwise, I really do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All I can say is if there is anything left of her, almost five years after her passing, I hope she's reading my blog, and I hope she's proud of her son, after all is said and done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
