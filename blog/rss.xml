			<title>A stunning realization</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/15/kristaps.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Having done it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, I was starting to think about how to wean &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; off Twitter identity, and had a stunning realization -- it may not be necessary, since (I believe, haven't tested yet) it might be possible to host Drummer from a FeedLand instance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would actually have to do it to be sure there aren't any roadblocks I haven't foreseen. But they're both running the same server software, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;, and once you've established an identity in FeedLand I don't see why it can't be used with Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ken Smith was tripping out on the synergies between Drummer and FeedLand. This, if it works, would blow the doors off that. They would be storing their data in the same place. You would be able to open your FeedLand bookmarks menu in Drummer, to start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I figured something else out. I was wondering what would happen if Twitter broke their identity with developers like me as they did with the clients, how would we transition Drummer then? I don't want people to have to start over. I could ask them to do what I asked FeedLand users to do, is make a connection between their Twitter identity and an email address, as a backup. But this would have to be done before any outage. Something most people probably wouldn't do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I realized we would be able to do what we do now when we want to associate an email address with a domain, ask the user to post something to their Twitter account, some magic string. When we see it in their timeline, voila, we know they are who they say they are and we can move the files to the new server. So we can relax. Users shouldn't have to lose data if Twitter pulls the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing, when Twitter was blowing up, I was getting harassed by idiots (no other word for it sorry) who didn't understand that you can't unwind a connection just by snapping your fingers. Identity is baked into an app at a deep level. And, when it already has users, and has gone through a ship cycle, you can't just flip a switch or everything you worked so hard for would just fall apart. It would be like, for example, making the NYC subway system run on a different track gauge. Sure you could do it, but it might take a few weeks. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, all who think Musk/Twitter is the big problem, you're falling for a smokescreen. A much bigger problem is the brain of Google. It's the nightmare of science fiction. We have no clue what it wants. It has unfathomably immense and unchallenged power.</description>

Crosby and Stills were tripping out on their harmonies. Cass brought Graham Nash with her to meet them. After hearing the song twice, he joined the harmony.

			<title>I like Masto, but...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I like Mastodon, and like Twitter. I've been on Twitter since 2006, and on Masto since 2017, but didn't start using it until late last year. I think Mastodon is an improvement over Twitter, but the limits I list below matter more than all the improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Optional titles.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No linking.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No styles.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Posts are limited to 500 chars.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No enclosures.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes I know some instances don't have these limits, but what matters is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator&quot;&gt;LCD&lt;/a&gt;. What can be exchanged with all Masto systems, and the list above applies to the vast majority of instances. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way. This is a simple post, expressing a simple idea. Yet neither Mastodon or Twitter can transmit this message. When we really get out of this bottleneck we'll be able to send messages like this one, and we'll wonder why we put up these limits for so long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, I've heard all the arguments. At one point 140 chars was the limit that mattered, if we went over that then it wouldn't be any good. Then we went over it, and communication got better. I don't want to argue about this. Just want to point out that we're still waiting to be set free from the limits imposed by Twitter 17 years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Not going to spoil anything, but if you need a good love story, this is it.

At the end we'd say well it was a good effort, knowing that's bullshit, it's pathetic.

			<description>If you're going to tell the story of the growth of podcasting, you can't leave out &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Podcasting was a mission that two people were on, myself and Adam Curry, mostly working in harmony, to find ways to get people to adopt this idea. We kept throwing ideas out there, and it wasn't until MCN in the summer of 2004 that other people got the idea that &lt;i&gt;they could do it.&lt;/i&gt; That was the breakthrough. You didn't need a big studio and money to produce good audio programming. That's what MCN did. It was as crucial to the growth of podcasting as Serial or The Daily were many years later. You can't write a truthful history of this without including this series. Luckily the &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Why the US is so rich</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Judging from the news, no one has figured out how to explain what defaulting on our debt means in human terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To do it, you'd have to explain why the United States is richer than any other country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not because we're smarter, or make better products, or have more natural resources. It's because the dollar is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; of the world. It's the safest place to store value. That means when we create a new dollar someone accept it as repayment of a loan. That's how our wealth is created and sustained.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, people are happy to be paid in dollars. They want to be paid in dollars. They like dollars because they remain valuable, because they trust the United States to repay the loan because &lt;i&gt;the US never has and never will default.&lt;/i&gt; That's the assumption. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We got a good thing! We should want to keep it! (I don't often use exclams on this blog, btw.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we don't pay back our loans, the safety thing blows up. It'll be gone. Then when we print a dollar to pay back a loan, they'll say no thanks, give us Euros. It's actually pretty simple. If you understand the rules of football, driving or poker you can definitely understand this.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People ought to learn what it means to be a reserve currency. And how it makes the US much richer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It means we can piss away huge amounts of money on the military, and let the super-rich get off with paying no taxes. That's where the difference goes. It's why we can still live in a Western way, with big cars and mortgages, and have the hugest miltary and fuel the growth of the super-rich all around the world all at the same time. It's not because we're a great country, it's because everyone thinks the dollar is safe.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't the military is going to suffer much when our unfair economic advantage is blown up by a default, I think the poor will. I think health care and education will disappear. I think the rivers and air will be polluted. We'll be sicker and more ignorant. Everything will work much worse. More shortages so prices will go up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To understand this all you have to understand is what a reserve currency is. Please news people, explain that. Help the people understand how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Yet it in no way interferes with the readability of the code. I've been doing it this way for 20+ years, so it's a pretty smooth process.

			<description>I finished bingeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/his-dark-materials&quot;&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/a&gt;. Utterly tedious. 99 percent speeches by people saying nothing and the music rising and sounding ominious as if something very profound was happening. The last episode was good for about 15 minutes then it got tedious too. Somehow I was snookered into watching one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_superhero_television_series&quot;&gt;superhero shows&lt;/a&gt; that are so popular now. It's all special effects. I'm sure they're impressive, and they made a big deal about how important stories are, too bad the show didn't have much of a fecking story. I give it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fhis-dark-materials&quot;&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; of 💩&amp;nbsp;and I'm rating myself a fool for sitting through it all the way to the end. Oy boy what a mess.</description>

			<title>Why ChatGPT is a good thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should be pleased that CNET is &lt;a href=&quot;https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai&quot;&gt;putting themselves out of business&lt;/a&gt; of being an authority on commodity info. That business isn't viable today much as being a travel agent isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of what doctors do will be automated by ChatGPT too, and that's a good thing! They can give us more personal care. Their recommendations are also commodity, and rightly so. And I'm absolutely sure that the new way will save lives and make human bodies work better and live longer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fuckups of medicine pile up. By the time you're my age it's happened so many times it's a wonder I'm still alive. (That said medicine saved my life twice, so there's that too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Worrying about side-effects like CNETs demo, is like people worrying about typesetters losing their jobs when desktop publishing came around. This is evolution and imho it's a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Uncle Arno's zettelkasten</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's this idea called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; that's been going around in the outlining world. It's like a &quot;second brain&quot; another term they use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thought is that if you get all the info and ideas out of your brain and onto a computer something magical will happen, you will attain a sort of super-humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why but I hate the term zettelkasten, but I love to say it. It sounds like something goofy and idiotic at the same time. It's not an English word. I do not like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=arno+schmidt+zettelkasten&quot;&gt;look it up&lt;/a&gt;. I found that one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;early pioneers&lt;/a&gt; of zettelkasten was my ancestor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic but fringe German writer of the mid-20th century. He was my maternal grandmother's brother, my great-uncle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In his case zettelkasten made sense because:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He was German and zettelkasten is a German word so it isn't icky or pretentious.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He had a legitimate use for one, he was writing a complex novel with lots of characters and plots. And this was before personal computers, in the 1940s and 1950s, so he did it with index cards. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Around the time Uncle Arno died in 1979, I started working on my first outliner, which is the ideal tool for creating and managing a zettelkasten on a personal computer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've attached a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/24/arnoSchmidtWithZettlekasten.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of Arno with his zettelkasten.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The tech industry and Google</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/23/exxonLogo.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was chatting with a leader of tech, a person who has made huge money on the open web. I don't want to say this person's name because my goal isn't to shame them, rather to provide a rebuttal in public where it won't just go into the trash -- I hope -- where there might actually be some listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Google owned the web when my friend's company was starting up, it's likely Google wouldn't have permitted their product to launch because they were competing with a Google product. But the web was an open platform, no one controlled who could deploy a web app, so my friend had a chance. But Google is now taking that power for itself and there's very little resistance. Right now Google and a number of other organizations are taking ownership of the web, but it's mostly Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt;, Google's first change to the web, now that they apparently feel they own it, will mean losing a lot of the archive of the web because it won't be possible to update those sites to comply with Google's rules for what constitutes a legal website. But the web is a fantastic archive medium. And losing the archives, that's not something a big company should be allowed to decide. It would be like saying Exxon could decide if beaches should be protected from oil spills. We'd never let them take that power, they would be stopped, they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-oil-pollution-act&quot;&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt;. But there's Google, doing it in the Age of the Web, saying we own this and if you don't like we'll just shut you down. You know, like Apple and iPhone apps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to put up with this on corporate platforms, there's no choice -- but the web doesn't belong to them. And my friend, who really is someone I like on a personal level, is going along with it. We are opponents in this, and I hope he comes around and realizes that not only do we need the archives, we need the web to be an open playground for innovation. And having tasted this power once, you have to know Google isn't finished, it'll happen again, and again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course Google could just create something new and market it as being &quot;more secure&quot; and leave the open web alone. You gotta wonder why they didn't just do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked Chatgpt &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat/f1631d0c-cb60-400c-8194-59745ec05b6f&quot;&gt;who owns the web&lt;/a&gt;. It's not Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There’s no comparison between Twitter and Mastodon for idea distribution. I routinely get hundreds of RTs on Masto. The Twitter system thinks the same ideas are worthless. I’m guessing virtually no one sees my tweets. For an idea why that is, see the next item.</description>
