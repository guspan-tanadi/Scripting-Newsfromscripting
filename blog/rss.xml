			<description>Some Mastodon posts are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/27/mastopost.png&quot;&gt;gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;. And they're going to look even better when Masto has Markdown support. The version I'm testing has Markdown now (also a 10000 character limit btw). Think of how long it took for Twitter to not do Markdown in tweets. And we've got users to play with. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Users and developers party together.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Where we're headed is a world where it doesn't matter where you write, you can use the tools you love, and it doesn't matter where you read, again what you love, in the moment is what you will use. Computers used to be like this. In the 80s you could use any writing tool you wanted and any printer. There was no concept of a writing tool that was bound to a printer. We're very close to that now, closer than we've been in a decade. I am determined that we do not pass up this opportunity. Seize the moment.</description>

			<title>To MastoDevs re RSS + Markdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I posted this on one of the discussion boards for Mastodon devs, but it may not have been the right place. So I'll try here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm the author of the RSS 2.0 spec, and actively working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and hooking it up to Mastodon. Very excited about what we're building and how well it works with MD.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon's RSS feed is also great. Items that don't have titles don't have titles in the feed. Stick to your guns on that, we have to get the feed readers to stop calling title-less items errors. They are totally valid RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Love the Markdown support, I've been advocating for it. And it's fully supported in both directions in FeedLand. We do it the same way you do. Render the Markdown in the description element and in the HTML rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing I'd like to see you do here -- include the Markdown source in the item using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;&lt;source:markdown&gt;&lt;/a&gt; element. That's how we do it and others are as well. As far as I know we're the only ones doing this, so it's possible at this point to get everyone swinging the same way, for interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For a model see how I do it in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;FeedLand feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/27/screenRssFeedMarkdown.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a demo item with styled text, a link and a list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if there are any questions and congrats on a phenomenal product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can't tell you how convenient it is that Mastodon has the same name as my first real internet presence on CompuServe in the early 80s, also Mastodon. I have a whole language already designed to go with that name. Mastodoctor, for example. For a while we were all adding &quot;bunny&quot; to our names, so I became Mastobunny and then Mastobun for short. Most of these names are available, so I'm tempted, but so far I've resisted. I have bought a couple though. Like most domain names I buy, I'll probably never use them. But it's nice they're there. I keep hoping someday to come up with a service that deserves the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://ou.rs/&quot;&gt;ou.rs&lt;/a&gt; which I've been renewing for many years.</description>

We had fun at the expense of New Jersey, Kevin Durant, The Nets and of course the current mess at Twitter. I keep thinking we should do a podcast.

			<description>I have very vague but strong memories of the JFK assassination. I was 8, in second grade, my teacher, Miss Ruffino, rushed out of the classroom in tears, no idea why. My mom picked me up to walk me home, we lived a couple of blocks from the school, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7548979,-73.8742838,3a,75y,1.49h,103.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stH-FAYMIFIYDPVFnFvREhg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DtH-FAYMIFIYDPVFnFvREhg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D46.733856%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;PS 149 Queens&lt;/a&gt;. I understood Kennedy was President, but he was the only president I had known. The idea of someone other than Kennedy being president didn’t make any sense. I asked my mom, what now. Someone named Johnson would be president. It didn’t make any sense to me. Kennedy was president.</description>

			<description>To &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; users. If Twitter turned us off for some reason you’d still be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/11/17/122301.html&quot;&gt;read your news&lt;/a&gt; while we worked around the outage. But so far there have been no problems that I’m aware of, and rushing to change tested software is a sure way to break things. That said we're making good progress on hooking up to Mastodon. Planning to show off a new way to do news products with FeedLand, and I want to write Mastodon threads in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Trump is all wrung out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had to say this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1594372293723045888&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is making the same mistake that Kevin Durant did when he signed with the Nets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First thing he did after signing, he had a press conference where he dis'd the Knicks. I guess he was thinking there was some kind of rivalry. There wasn't. No one had any feelings at all for the Nets. A complete zero among NY basketball fans. And the Knicks, well we have a lot of heart there and for the most part it's an ache. The last thing we have any energy for is an idiot who has no idea of the place he's entered, and where we're at, basketball-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Musk has no idea where Twitter users are re Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what led him to believe anyone had any more juice for Trump. Even the people who liked him are tired. He had a good run, as far as &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; go, but we're just tired. Not even remotely excited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump is all wrung out. Even he knows it. But somehow that fact escaped Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One thing I love &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; about Mastodon is they are genuinely interested in my software. Unlike Twitter which could give a shit. Over there, wow, they think the idea of more toys from Dave with feeds and blogs, that's the best. I feel like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Richards&quot;&gt;Keith Richards&lt;/a&gt; singing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPvDUeaKwMc&quot;&gt;Happy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Jew Hate is all around us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, and still to this day, the word &quot;Jew&quot; was, to me, dirty. I didn't like to hear it. It smelled like rot and death and sadness. I had this idea before I was conscious, before I was in school. Yet I knew all along that I was a Jew. Where did I get it from? I guess I grew up in it. It must've come from my family and neighbors and schoolmates, even teachers, and on TV, in music and radio. Reading. Who knows. But it was there. It still is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that's why I don't use the word &quot;antisemitism&quot; any more. It sounds so technical, almost benign. Instead let's call it what it is -- Jew Hate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Jew Haters practice their hate, they're moving the needle towrd Holocaust, which even though it's a very strong word isn't strong enough. It's genocide. The killing of an entire ethnic group, systematically, with the goal of eliminating all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't think anything we do can eliminate or even reduce Jew Hate. But letting it out of its box and into the public conversation as it has been lately, amazingly coming from black men, that despite what Jon Stewart says, that is not okay. It's not liberal to allow Jew Hate to be laughed at on SNL. Or to allow an NBA star to shout it from his million-follower Twitter account, or for a pop singer to say he wants to kill Jews, again on a million-follower Twitter account. When you do that, you invite all the other Jew Hate to come out and play. And once it's out, that means Jews are going to die. Once out, it might not be possible to stop it. Something to think about Jon Stewart when they take you and your family away for your final solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm old and tired and fed up with accepting that it's too dangerous to speak up about this. If no one else will, I guess, I will. If no NBA star will reassure me that the NBA is not filled with Jew Haters, I'm going to assume it is. I will never watch an NBA game without thinking that every black man on the floor hates me because of my ancestry and blames me for their misery and would like to see me and my kin killed in a horrible way. I don't wish that for them. But I also can't enjoy a sport where the participants feel that way about me, and they don't even know me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think you're liberal and a fair-minded person and just another Good American, it 's time to say something. Otherwise you're going to have to explain to your grandchildren what you did as it was happening again, only this time in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Further Tesla users spend tens of thousands of dollars to become users, and Tesla could brick their cars any time they want, and we're not connected to each other. Same with SpaceX of course. And even worse than that, most of Twitter's users are either journalists, bloggers, or podcasters. So there's that too. And every one of them is sure Elon Musk is fucking it up. All of this foerseeable, btw.</description>

			<description>To all the old school bloggers, remember how you all used to hate me? This is how it works. It's very rare that in an online space people love the top person, if they are accessible. If they're aloof, hard to find, or speak in haiku, you love them. But if you can talk to them and they might respond, most of what you're going to say to and about them will be negative. I know -- I lived on the other side of that for a number of years. It was fucked up. Absolutely nothing I said would be interpreted as if it were said like a human, like themselves.</description>
