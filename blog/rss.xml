			<description>Now that I can see &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt; in action, I changed how tags are displayed. A tag appears as a single-square-bracketed term, in blue. When you hover over it, it's underlined. This is more consistent with the way links work. And single-square-brackets are less intrusive than double, but still convey the idea that where you're going is different from a normal link. Feedback is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/218&quot;&gt;welcome&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also finding bugs in the tag server. Of course, and that's good.</description>

			<description>Falling in love with &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/span&gt; and then giving up on open &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;-based news after it was cancelled is like falling in love with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXpKiY2MXE&quot;&gt;The Monkees&lt;/a&gt;, and giving up on music when their show was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-was-The-Monkees-show-cancelled&quot;&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. Long term the open wholesome tech ecosystem is where the breakthroughs come from. When the users learn to accept that tech companies just harvest these developments, don't manage them or develop them, or care about them, then progress will accelerate, but not until then. The power is strong, but you have to use it.</description>

			<description>Scott Love sent a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/21/22586870/google-reader-ode-end-of-the-good-internet&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that said Google Reader was beautiful, and something huge was lost when they shut it down. Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX_TFkut1PM&quot;&gt;American Pie&lt;/a&gt; about the death of music, and as wrong. As it turns out, since we now &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; how it turned out, having &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; adopt &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; was a pretty bad thing for everyone, except maybe Google. The tragedy isn't that Google fucked us over so hard, it's that even now, eight years later, people still haven't figured out that companies don't make wholesome tech, they consume it. Leave it like an Amazon rain forest after harvesting. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/span&gt; should have been called Exxon Valdez Reader. The author's attitude toward people who understand this tragedy is to dismiss us as naïve. Which is ridiculous given the premise. It's like saying that we liked the meal but we insisted on it being served it by &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Darth Vader&lt;/span&gt;. Oh boy he betrayed us! The users have the power, this has always been true, and until now, they have used the power to be idiots.</description>

			<title>Tagging in Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's something new on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; today -- tags. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you see a tag reference, click on it to see a list of refs to the same tag. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example of a tag reference. Click it, see what happens: &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you hover over a tag ref, it should turn blue.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on one you should see a dialog that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/22/taggingDialog.png&quot;&gt;looks like this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the text in the dialog has tags, you can click on them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The left and right arrows move back and forth through the tags you've clicked on like the arrows in a browser.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I'm writing, my CMS passes the OPML of today's writing to a new server app called a &lt;i&gt;tag server&lt;/i&gt; that scans for tags. A tag is simply text that's enclosed in &amp;lsqb;[double square brackets]].&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When it finds a tag, it adds it to a database, with the following info: the URL of the OPML file it came from, the path to the tag in the outline, the &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; attribute of the headline it came from in the outline, and the screenname of the author (for now, just me).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now we can do a query, such as: Find me all the items tagged by davewiner with the term RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And that query can be displayed in a dialog when you're reading the blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkNWAr6s5K8&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll have more to say about this, but first I wanted to introduce the feature so you can try it out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, you can post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/218&quot;&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In the end I was rooting for the Milwaukee &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bucks&lt;/span&gt;. I don't understand why, maybe it's because I had been following the east more than the west, largely due to the time difference. Or maybe it was my connection with Wisconsin? Whatever the reason I was happy last night because the Bucks won the series, 4-2, over the Phoenix Suns who are also an excellent team. I felt bad for &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/span&gt;, this was his first chance in the finals and at age 37 perhaps his last, after a long playoff career, marred by injuries, and he didn't win, not just because the Bucks wanted it more. The playoff process is a long grind. He was still standing, but the Bucks prevailed -- because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo&quot;&gt;Giannis  Antetokounmpo&lt;/a&gt;. He's a superstar in league with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AooUnpj5nzE&quot;&gt;best&lt;/a&gt;, plays through pain, and basically carried the team on his back. He is also famous as a terrible free throw shooter, but last night he made 15 of 16 free throws. Without that, the Bucks would've lost, and we'd be going to a game 7 showdown in Phoenix tomorrow night. The most important thing to me, and Giannis commented on it too, is that the Bucks are a team that was developed through the draft and trades, not as a superteam formed for the purpose of winning a championship, like the detestable &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Brooklyn Nets&lt;/span&gt;. The two stars of the Bucks, Giannis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khris_Middleton&quot;&gt;Khris Middleton&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the Bucks since 2013. I feel great that the NBA, despite the best efforts of the superteams, is still a game where talent and perseverance wins. The playoffs were good this year, it was the year the Knicks competed well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young&quot;&gt;young talent&lt;/a&gt; impressed and entertained. Now it's time to shift to the Olympics which start on Friday, and the Mets who are in first place!</description>

He is also famous as a terrible free throw shooter, but last night he made 15 of 16 free throws. Without that, the Bucks would've lost, and we'd be going to a game 7 showdown in Phoenix tomorrow night. The most important thing to me, and Giannis commented on it too, is that the Bucks are a team that was developed through the draft and trades, not as a superteam formed for the purpose of winning a championship, like the detestable &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Brooklyn Nets&lt;/span&gt;. The two stars of the Bucks, Giannis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khris_Middleton&quot;&gt;Khris Middleton&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the Bucks since 2013. I feel great that the NBA, despite the best efforts of the superteams, is still a game where talent and perseverance wins. The playoffs were good this year, it was the year the Knicks competed well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young&quot;&gt;young talent&lt;/a&gt; impressed and entertained. Now it's time to shift to the Olympics which start on Friday, and the Mets who are in first place!" created="Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:43:30 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/21/giannis.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/07/21.html#a124330"/>

The official story is we used the bomb as soon as it was ready, but that could just be a story. He asks a good question, and many others. I wish we had more people around today asking questions like that.</description>

			<description>&lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bezos&lt;/span&gt; wants to move manufacturing into space. I had never heard that idea before seeing a quick interview today with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/07/20/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-launch-cooper-intv-sot-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt; of CNN and the two Bezos brothers, who look very much alike. The rich one is the guy in the dorky cowboy hat. He says some industries that use up too much of the earth's resources would be better in space. I started to think about what he might have in mind. Server farms run on solar energy, and cooled by the vacuum of space. Perfect. On the other hand, who would regulate his businesses in space? No OSHA, no unions, no taxes or laws. I bet they're all thinking about this, and I kick myself for not having thought of it myself.</description>

			<description>In &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Denmark&lt;/span&gt; they have a children's show about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillermand&quot;&gt;man with a huge penis&lt;/a&gt; that he uses to help people. At first it's a little shocking to this American, but why shouldn't we think of a &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;penis&lt;/span&gt; as something friendly and useful. I was brought up to think of my penis as something shameful, dirty, to hide, to apologize for. I can't imagine how I got those ideas, but they were and are there in my infant brain. Eventually we learn to have fun with our penises. Hopefully. Why not start as a kid?

			<title>Reporters are pussycats</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;More confirmation that today's blockbuster news about Trump is about the crazy place we were in six months ago. I don't get reporters who think that's acceptable. Their job is to know (and tell us) what crazy place we're in &lt;i&gt;right now. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the military. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/14/donald-trump-reichstag-moment-general-mark-milley-book&quot;&gt;Joint Chiefs guy&lt;/a&gt; thought Trump might be doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire&quot;&gt;Reichstag fire&lt;/a&gt;. Great. So WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T HE PREPARE THE MILITARY TO KNOCK IT DOWN BEFORE IT STARTED AND SHIP THE INSURRECTIONISTS OFF TO GITMO. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO WITH TERRORISTS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When are some reporters going to get into the present and deal with today's truth. Stop praising the military for *saying* how fukced up everthing is. Praise them for keeping it from getting that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's hope Biden, first thing when he got on the job, sat down with the military and told them they fucked up big, and they better be prepared next time. I suspect he didn't because he hasn't fired any of these nincompoops. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to stop thinking like pussycats and start getting in front of this. We're getting our asses whipped every time, and we're the United States dammit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Coronavirus infections are surging in places with low vaccination rates. SARS-CoV-2 is continuing to mutate. Researchers have confirmed the delta variant is far more transmissible than earlier strains. Although the vaccines remain remarkably effective, the virus has bountiful opportunities to find new ways to evade immunity. Most of the world remains unvaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And so the end of the pandemic remains somewhere over the horizon.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>OPML's building block -- the include node type</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a developer yesterday and the question came up, what about huge outlines? How does &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; handle those? That gave me a chance to tell the story about how i'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archiving&lt;/a&gt; Scripting News, and how include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+include+nodes&quot;&gt;nodes&lt;/a&gt; work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All systems have to evolve as projects get bigger -- you break it up into components and link them together in a single document. That makes the code more manageable, and makes it possible to reuse the pieces. Every serious system has to provide for breaking big things up into smaller, reusable bits. For example... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Node.js has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt;. You can include a package in an app, or in another package, with a require call, like this: &lt;code&gt;const fs = require (&quot;fs&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; Then you can refer to exported bits from the &quot;fs&quot; package in your app as if they were part of it, because they are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;programming language C&lt;/a&gt; has the #include directive: &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;standard.h&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The C preprocessor reads the file, and replaces the #include directive with the contents of the file. Includes can contain includes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_directive&quot;&gt;survey page&lt;/a&gt; explaining how inclusion works in other languages, such as Fortran, Pascal, PHP. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;OPML has &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#inclusion&quot;&gt;include nodes&lt;/a&gt; which have a &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute whose value is include and a &lt;i&gt;url&lt;/i&gt; attribute which is the address of an OPML file. When the user expands an include node, the outliner reads the contents of the OPML file and inserts it as subs of the include node. To the user, if the net is sufficiently fast, and the file is a manageable size, they wouldn't need to know that it was an include node. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example. I archive my blog, which is written in an outliner, and saved as OPML, at the beginning of every month. I save the previous month in a repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and empty out the outline I edit. The CMS that builds the HTML rendering and the RSS version of my blog is able to jump month boundaries. So I have a convenient-size outline for editing, and everything else just hums along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what if I wanted an outline of all my blog posts going back to May 2017? I would do that with include nodes. And just for fun, I did exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/005d8b83ea76fbb25df8627096cb75f7&quot;&gt;an OPML file that contains includes&lt;/a&gt; for each of the months of 2018, 2019 and 2020. If you have an outliner that can expand includes, then you can view all the writing for those years in one outline&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trust me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&amp;t=4s&quot;&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; this 18 minute video. It's a real &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;mind bomb&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;racism&lt;/span&gt;. 18 minutes, for a brain explosion. That's a pretty good deal.</description>

			<description>I have not been able to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki's podcast&lt;/a&gt; feed. The usual tricks aren't working. Here's his Apple Podcasts &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827&quot;&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; page. Usually if you give that URL to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getrssfeed.com/&quot;&gt;GetRSSFeed&lt;/a&gt; app, it returns with the address of the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; podcast feed. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; it took me. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377&quot;&gt;viewed the XML&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows me an HTML page? If anyone can figure out the URL of his podcast feed, please let me know. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I get stressed, like everyone else. I have a technique for working my way through it. I ask myself this question: What would Dave do if he wasn't stressed out. Change the perspective. I'm now outside myself, am an observer of myself. Often I have no trouble writing down a few things. Then I do one of those things. If it works, I get into it, and an hour or two later I forgot why I was stressed.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1414945524101287938&quot;&gt;tweet about GitHub&lt;/a&gt; yesterday got a fair amount of attention. I'm glad, because the idea is powerful and works. Further if GitHub/Microsoft made this a business priority, it could be streamlined for end-users, and be a revenue source, and an incredible developer platform, beyond what it already does. I would love to begin a conversation with MS, privately if they want, to figure out what's possible here.</description>

			<description>I've been reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Malcolm-Told-Alex-Haley/dp/0345350685&quot;&gt;Autobiography of Malcolm X&lt;/a&gt;, and it's transformative for me. He's talking about whiteness from the point of view of a black man of my parents' generation. I can't agree with some of what he says, he's talking nasty shit about my people, and it's as oppressive as anything anyone says about blacks, even the stuff he quotes. Don't respond to oppression with more oppression. But overriding that is the bigger point, that the United States has been destroying the lives of black people since inception. I just spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&quot;&gt;18 minutes&lt;/a&gt; with the flipside of Malcolm X, a white academic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://documentarystudies.duke.edu/people/john-biewen&quot;&gt;John Biewen&lt;/a&gt;, explaining what it means to be white, in the same context as that which X describes, but from from the other side of the relationship. I think if you watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&amp;t=1095s&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, it'll be the most transformative 18 minute video experience you've had in a long time.</description>

			<description>Good morning sports fans! The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; finals resume tonight, I'm actually going to miss basketball when it's over. But then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics&quot;&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt; start, and after that my attention will finally turn to the Mets. I've got the rest of the year planned out. But the weather. Oy does it suck. I know there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/07/none-of-the-old-rules-still-apply-when-the-driest-city-in-the-us-faces-a-catastrophic-drought/&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1013446314/amid-a-mega-drought-a-water-shortage-will-be-declared-along-the-colorado-river&quot;&gt;droughts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html&quot;&gt;heat domes&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere, but here we're living in a constant state of deluge. I take my bike ride every day, rain or shine. I used to skip rainy days but this summer that's not an option because it rains every damned day, and not just drizzle, hours of downpour. And the thunder last night. Who could sleep through that. Not this sports fan. I just want some beautiful warm summer weather. On the other hand the new rose bush I planted really seems to like all the wetness.</description>

			<description>Toaster ovens are now called &quot;air fryers.&quot; That's weird, but I just bought one, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&quot;&gt;Cuisinart&lt;/a&gt;, as recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-fryer/&quot;&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Something very scary just happened. There's a bug in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; that it sometimes updates the wrong outline when an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;I/O&lt;/a&gt; update comes in. This can result in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=sarcasm&quot;&gt;hilarity&lt;/a&gt; when somehow the updates overwrite the file for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems there is no backup. It's a bug. And bugs hurt! I looked everywhere and kicked myself virtually for not maintaining a backup of this vital file. Every time I publish there should be a copy preserved. Well, it turns out that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; happening. I post the outline to the instantOutlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/outlines/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the power and elegance of GitHub, there's a snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main/outlines/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;every update&lt;/a&gt;, going back to when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main?after=8131158da2d286bb63af971a89c286e1e6f6c217+349&amp;branch=main&amp;path%5B%5D=outlines&amp;path%5B%5D=scripting.opml&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/845ff95bfb4be0f23decf8293c87bd1265f2e6a3#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/3786362d531109220bafe8f62b9689692f03f92b#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc&quot;&gt;June 17&lt;/a&gt;. Catastrophe averted. Whew. And wow GitHub is starting to turn into a very nice network file system.</description>
