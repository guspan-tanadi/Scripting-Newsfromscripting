			<description>The only time we have to listen to other Americans is when we vote. They can keep talking, that‚Äôs their right. But I can choose not to listen. There‚Äôs a limit to respect. I don‚Äôt listen to people when all they have to say is how they hate me.</description>

			<description>The news should reflect what the Trumps are really doing with the lawsuits. They're going to pitch state legislatures that the election was stolen and they should appoint different electors. The lawsuits just have to get press coverage and show up in opinion polls. They wouldn't have to flip too many states with Republican legislatures. For example: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan.</description>

			<description>Assuming Trump refuses to leave the White House, here‚Äôs the plan. Turn the White House into our equivalent of Lenin‚Äôs tomb. Seal it off but, everyone but Trump can leave, send him food and water and people can visit to see the imprisoned former president. When he dies embalm him.</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;While the campaign was still on, I didn't want to criticize the Dems for their rallies, which were basically impossible to watch. They must've been even worse to be a speaker at. You take a gifted campaigner like Obama, who could get into a lovefest with an audience, he had so many good lines like Don't Boo, Vote. The crowd would boo just to get him to say it! Or he'd say &lt;i&gt;Fired up! &lt;/i&gt;and everyone would scream &lt;i&gt;Ready to go! &lt;/i&gt;Even watching the rallies on TV would get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin&quot;&gt;love chemicals&lt;/a&gt; to flow through your blood. But the drive-in rallies, while the idea seemed cute and innovative, as an idea, were, in practice, embarrassing. I kept wondering if the Dems could have done something like what the NBA and MLB did, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportscasting.com/theres-a-surprising-amount-of-tech-behind-the-nbas-fake-crowd-noise/&quot;&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/09/05/baseball-fake-crowd-nosie&quot;&gt;crowd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/the-invisible-crowd-inside-the-nfls-fake-crowd-noise-system/2381799/&quot;&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone knew they were fake, but you didn't mind. Even though a basketball game with no crowd noise is actually kind of nice, as at a small college game, not having a crowd cheering and booing at the right times during the NBA Finals and the World Series would have been awful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the Repubs cut the corner, and went ahead and had viral-spreading events in the form of end-game political rallies. And they were wonderful. Trump, like Obama, really is in his element in those rallies. Once, because of a stubborn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaaltv.com/rochester-minnesota-news/president-trump-campaign-rally-rochester-october-30/5911428/&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_Minnesota&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, he had to give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/10/30/trump-rallies-in-rochester-with-spillover-from-250-capacity-showing-support-outside/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; to a socially distanced group of 250 people, and his heart wasn't in it, and he left early. So the Repubs cheated. I think that's where a lot of his votes came from. If the campaign had ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsGqrLkmFMU&quot;&gt;Trump on the balcony&lt;/a&gt;, febrile, gasping for air and weak, pulling of his mask, then we would have gotten the Biden/Harris landslide that the polls predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The really awful part is that the pundits, idiots, one and all, are ignoring the context of this election. As if it were a normal election where the candidates were playing on something of a level playing field. They weren't. The Repubs sacrificed hundreds of lives, and thousands of peoples' health and helped spread the virus that was already spreading uncontrollably. They weren't rallies for the presidency as much as they were rallies for the virus. Come get sick, and btw, also see the president dance. The people would have come out, just as much, for Obama and his mantras, or him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXcNgCr0nk&quot;&gt;brushing the dirt&lt;/a&gt; off his jacket, or just looking like the stud he is. Or Biden telling stories of his lost family, and how great America still is, and how it'll all come back as soon as he's in the Oval. But they didn't, and that was the right thing to do. And the pundits, who really do need to be fired, are ignoring the whole thing, and pretending the Dems are out of touch, when they were totally committed to the reality that there is a deadly pandemic that is happening at the same time as the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a replay of what happened in the final days of the primary, when people were mourning the loss of E Warren, and the impeachment was booting up. The virus was already the Big Story, but everyone was putting it off until they could get around to it. Same thing now. When we come back to the pandemic we will notice that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/us-coronavirus-100000-daily-cases&quot;&gt;100K new cases yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time record. But until we all focus on it, full time, and take our medicine, for real, we will never get out of this mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe next week the news can somehwat get back to reality.  And if the Biden win doesn't prove to be a mirage, we can all breathe a sigh of relief that the Orange Monster will be going back to where ever they will have him. I hear Florida voted for him, good -- he's theirs now. No backsies. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trump probably impressed the rest of the Republican Party by turning out so many voters, and keeping Congress competitive, even if he did have to spread a lot of virus to do it. Rallies make for better television if you don't mind killing hundreds of rally-goers, and making thousands sick.</description>

			<description>Funny thing, James Carville, who I love, has now been wrong about the last two elections. In 2018 he said it wouldn't result in Dem control of the House, and it did. And this time he predicted 2020 would be a landslide for the Dems, and unless some mistake has been made, not so.</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How did you spend your night? I watched MSNBC, love Kornacki, you can have the rest of them, but I hated whenever the sound came on saying &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.9em;&quot;&gt;IT'S TIME TO CALL SOMETHING&lt;/span&gt;. It was always something like Kentucky or South Dakota, Vermont or New York. At one point I wrote on Twitter we're on the roller coaster now. That feeling of this is being done to me, I don't like it but at this point I have no choice, I'm on for the ride. I watched as Kornacki flipped over the counties in Florida, a remarkable number of which I was familiar with either from having been there or listening to any number of podcasts instructing me what to look out for. Very depressing. Oh shit. This feels like 2016, I said -- as did everyone else watching the returns. I started nodding off around 9PM and finally decided to go to bed at 10, and woke up at 1AM, and went looking to see how things had turned out and I literally screamed out loud when I saw Trump was ahead in Wisconsin. Oy oy oy. So here we are. And where is that exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well, Biden is very likely to win. And that is good news, even though they're already spinning on the webs that it would have been better if we won the Senate and lost the presidency, which is such utter bullshit. People are so stupid. Getting rid of Trump was job #1, and it seems we will get rid of him. No I didn't watch his campaign rally in the White House, and yes, I have heard it quoted, and yes, he is trying to be a dictator, and no doubt his voters will listen and believe him, and will drive their cars around running people off the road, and they might even kill people, but we're already dying in great numbers, so what the fuck difference would that make. Here's what getting rid of Trump means. Goodbye Bill Barr. Hello Paris Climate Treaty and let's get back together with the Iran deal. Let's start playing to win in international trade instead of just abdicating and sounding tough. And btw, let's get the babies out of those prisons, find their parents or at least get them into a home-like situation. And then think about all the things Trump won't be able to do if he's just a private citizen. Yes, he can be a first class asshole, and have rallies, but he will also be tried and probably convicted and go to jail. And for sure McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do, but think of it this way, Biden will block everything McConnell wants to do, something Trump didn't do. So fuck you and your fancy theories about wishing Trump were still president and McConnell would be Minority Leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's something I write every time a Republican wins, even though this time a Republican didn't win. We need to organize on a permanent persistent basis. It's not enough to ask for our money and phone banking at election time. We the non-elites have to be part of governing. You don't get to just ask for our money every four years and then say thanks now go away. We need to be part of this. Luckily we have this great technology that enables this, and we need to use it. Howard Dean was on the right track in 2004, but there was no follow-through (and of course he didn't even get nominated). Facebook and Twitter et al aren't the only models. We can create new media where people get to participate and where spamming means nothing. Today's networks are set up in a way that makes the most money for advertisers. We can set up networks that are great for governing and organizing. Until we do things will just keep getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was depressed at 10PM and 1AM but by 6AM I was over it. I'm ready for the next season in the great drama of American politics.&lt;i&gt; Let's have fun! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm loving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/better-things&quot;&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt;. It's smart, funny, classy, nutty, loving and lovable, and sexy. The characters are great because they all remind me of someone dear to me. It's not Le Grand Binge, it's more like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuse-bouche&quot;&gt;amuse-bouche&lt;/a&gt;, something to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser&quot;&gt;cleanse the palate&lt;/a&gt;, before going onto more serious fare. Right up there with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock&quot;&gt;30 Rock&lt;/a&gt;, another of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my favorite&lt;/a&gt; shows.

			<description>Assuming Biden wins tonight, I look forward to articles in &lt;i&gt;The Redneck Country Bugle&lt;/i&gt; about how they failed to understand the coastal communities, where there are plenty of people who are not elites, rather people who pay attention to what politicians do, instead of how funny they are.</description>

			<description>All the commercial publishing services are broken in one way or another. Twitter has a character limit. Substack makes you use their editor, Facebook has no links, styling or titles.

			<description>Back in 1994 I had what was then a revolutionary idea. That a software developer could write about the world just like a columnist does. Not after stopping being a software developer, but as &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of being a software developer. People really didn't understand.</description>

Let's hope we can do better. Start by getting rid of the character limit in Twitter so we don't need to invent new channels just to distribute essays. Twitter can already do photos and video. People do all kinds of hacks to distribute writing. Let's re-legitimize it. Also can you imagine how pissed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter co-founder and founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, would feel if Twitter bought Substack? Leaving Medium out in the cold. It's long been assumed the reason Twitter didn't relax the character limit is because of Medium. As we say in the blogging world, oy.</description>

			<description>On Facebook, I'm getting another look at all the things I posed in the run-up to the 2016 election. One of the threads was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/01/clintonOdds2016.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FiveThirtyEight&quot;&gt;538&lt;/a&gt; graph showing the probability of a Clinton win over Trump over time. It took a real dive when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html&quot;&gt;Comey&lt;/a&gt; announced he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/lone-fbi-agent-reopened-hillary-clinton-investigation-2019-10&quot;&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; emails found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner&quot;&gt;Anthony Weiner's&lt;/a&gt; laptop. Nate Silver said, in the aftermath of the election, when people complained about the polls, that Trump had a greater than 30% chance of winning. A baseball player who hits .300 is a pretty good hitter. 30% ain't zero. That said Comey &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; it 30%. The odds were a lot lower before his announcement.</description>

What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today. Luckily for Trump as he rises in stature, from poll-leader, to presumptive nominee, to one of two possible Presidents, his tweets automatically get more outrageous, because now they have half the weight of the office of POTUS behind them.&quot; Four years later his stature has not increased, and the tweets are just as crude.

			<description>I wish I had a big Pause button, let's just hold here for a while. I'm more comfortable living in limbo than knowing the outcome of Tuesday's election. I'm sure everyone feels the same. I don't have any advice. Maybe buy something sinful and consume it with wild abandon. Or maybe read up on emigration out of the US, or painless ways to end it all.</description>

			<description>I finally understand what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; means in programming, and of course, I've been doing it from the beginning of my programming career. Get something working, try it out, learn from it, perhaps go in a different direction, but always checking what I'm doing by using it and listening to users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor&quot;&gt;Mitch Kapor&lt;/a&gt;, who I learned a lot from at Personal Software in the early 80s, worked this way. I ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; on these principles. Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; did was developed this way. Now that I understand what it means, I might try to factor all the writing that's out there about it into a few words that explain the difference. I once encountered &lt;i&gt;anti-agile&lt;/i&gt; development in a company where the software was developed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://dod.defense.gov/&quot;&gt;DoD&lt;/a&gt; procedures. Their philosophy was design the whole thing up front and give pieces of the project to different groups of programmers, who never saw the full spec, so no one knew what they were working on. The company went out of business very quickly. The team went on to form the core of another company, which also went out of business, each time because the product widely missed the mark.</description>
