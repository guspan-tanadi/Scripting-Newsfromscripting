			<description>The goal of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple&lt;/a&gt; project is to have lots of devs doing lots of experimentation with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, and having all their work be totally compatible.

			<description>The people who say our democracy is teetering on the edge are a few seasons behind. It's time to design a political party that fits the political system we have.

			<description>A Covid theory... My friend visiting from out of town had Covid. We were together 3 full days. I didn't get Covid. Why? I got my second booster less than a month ago. At the same time I got pneumonia and shingles vaccines. The theory: My immune system was standing by.</description>

			<description>BTW, I might be missing something about Julian Assange. Isn't he the asshole who &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=Hillary%20Clinton&quot;&gt;dumped&lt;/a&gt; all of HRC's emails and gave the NYT all the ammo they needed to tank her candidacy thus giving us Trump? I could be wrong, there could be two people named Julian Assange. I guess.</description>

			<description>I take note when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1538135017079054337&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi forwards&lt;/a&gt; one of my posts. Yesterday it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/17.html#a132248&quot;&gt;my bit&lt;/a&gt; about Ron DeSantis. I think for sure he's running for president in 2024, and if the Repubs are smart, they'll nominate him instead of Trump. He gets a clean slate. He's just dog-whistle-level racist enough to get all the votes Trump got and enough of Biden's to win without having to resort to an insurrection. But he is a solid white supremacist, return-to-slavery type Republican. Won't make even the slightest attempt to win support from blue states or minority voters. All white all the way. At the same time, it's a good bet that by the election in 2024, Twitter will be run to please the MAGAs. Why do I think so? Well, everything Musk says about free speech is just another dog-whistle for the MagaVerse. Joe if you're listening, please tell your friends in the the political consultant sphere that we need to at least start a social network for electing Dems in 2024 and beyond. Don't depend on Twitter being useful in that election. We'll need new ways to organize that go beyond fund-raising and advertising. We need to have a 365-by-7-by-24 connection with voters. Organizing isn't just for elections anymore.</description>

			<description>I finished two series -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Ftehran&quot;&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fgentleman-jack&quot;&gt;Gentleman Jack&lt;/a&gt;. I would not recommend the first, it got really tedious and kind of bullshitty toward the end. And completely not believable. You'd have to believe that Iran, a country that has been at war continually since the 1979 revolution, wouldn't have the most basic security for its leaders. Gentleman Jack on the other hand is a sweet story, a bit melodramatic, the bad guys are just a little too bad, esp at the end of the second season. But instead of leaving us with a horrible cliffhanger, as most shows do, they have so far ended each of the two seasons with a kiss. If there's a third season I will watch it. I've been saving the new season of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fborgen&quot;&gt;Borgen&lt;/a&gt;, pretty sure that will be the next binge.</description>

			<title>What people want in a president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The perfect candidate for president from either party is a clever, confident, handsome, young, white man you'd like to watch on social media every day. He can lead a cheer, tell a joke, kiss a baby, knows how to eat pizza, and will get angry in a debate and then tell another joke. You would love to have a beer with him, or ride with him on a chair at Vail even if you're too poor or old to ski. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched Trump's rally last night for a refresher. Yup. He still looks and sounds good if you overlook the criminality and lies, narcissism and mediocrity which people are happy to do. He meets the important criteria. He's funny, looks okay and is white and a man. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Trump's term people were completely wiped out from the consequences of hiring such a loud-mouth punkass papa's boy loser, but memories are short, and Biden really is old, and he stumbles through his speeches. Biden will do, as long as he's running against Trump, but doesn't inspire. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look if you're willing to compromise, and I am, although I would love an America that would embrace a really black president (not Obama who is a black man designed to make white people feel comfortable) or a woman president like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Demings&quot;&gt;Val Demings&lt;/a&gt; who is smart, thinks on her feet and hasn't been battered by the press and Republicans for 30 years when she runs, but that is not this America. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the best compromise for Democrats is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom&quot;&gt;Gavin Newsom&lt;/a&gt;. He checks all the boxes and he would also be a good political leader and is not a fascist. Any Democrat would get my vote, but I'd be confident Newsom would win. Almost anyone else I'd hold my breath and hope for the best, and expect we'd lose. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The US is openly white supremacist, but for sixty years has been trying to become less so. That peaked when we elected a black president in 2008. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Oprahs-Book-Club-Discontents/dp/B085VXLKRJ/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcSLpCIAggnuGi0Z8ZnGrwIc2tg4021vRgIxgUdxMA9dZMDLYLoUCr4aAvPrEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=552574215490&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=16381147703423192585&amp;hvtargid=kwd-938508291970&amp;hydadcr=7438_9611178&amp;keywords=caste+the+origin+of+our+discontent&amp;qid=1655516954&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;caste&lt;/a&gt; system here, and blacks were the bottom rung, and still are, largely, but there has been progress away from that, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society&quot;&gt;laws&lt;/a&gt; passed in the 60s, and supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; decisions. All that is turning around. DeSantis, a smoother Trump, will be more careful about arousing his opposition. He will seem to be a likeable Republican and many will overlook his racism, or worse, quietly support it. I have no idea what the answer is, the racism is deeply ingrained in America.</description>

So I feel pretty good about dodging this. It's the first time I took a test. I play it very safe re Covid. I have too many risk factors to want to take too many risks, and as far as I'm concerned the pandemic is still raging.

			<description>More on EEAAO -- I think what we're seeing here is that commercial movies have changed, they have to be action superhero type movies because they have to sell all over the world, and that's basically what the world likes. So they snuck a little &quot;I'm ok you're ok&quot; psychology into it, so it would have appeal for adults, kind of like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY&quot;&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; movie, but like The Matrix or Kill Bill instead of Iron Man and the Marvel Universe. It's like we stumbled into an alternate metaverse that wasn't intended for us, the response of its people would be basically OK boomer, time to move on. And it's no accident that the dialog is half English, half Cantonese. Two big markets for blockbuster movies.</description>

If it had worked I am told that I might get a YSL Beauty NFT. &quot;Acting as a recognition token of the community engagement, those 10K YSL Beauty Golden Blocks (ERC721 minted on Polygon with the Arianee Protocol) will unlock utilities throughout the year including a premiere launch, whitelisting for NFT drops and much more.&quot; I'm making a note of this here on my decidedly old school tech blog. We have so much to learn from their brave and daring experiment.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06/14.html&quot;&gt;6/14/2002&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;It's going to be a light day here on Scripting News. Lots of non-Internet stuff going on.&quot; In other words, I was going for a doctor's appointment to check out the problems I knew I had with my heart. They put me on a treadmill, didn't like what they saw, walked me over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Hospital&quot;&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography&quot;&gt;angiogram&lt;/a&gt;. Didn't like that they saw. A few days later I had heart surgery, and a week later I was back home, weak as a kitten, with lots of new meds to take, and a non-smoker. I felt like I was in the house of a dead relative, that's how profound the change was. In accordance with Bruce Sterling's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that you can make big changes when something big happens, a few months later I was more or less recovered, strong as a bull, determined to make good use of the time I had been given. A few months after that I had moved to Boston, was starting up blogging at Harvard, then BloggerCon, podcasting, and a new life. Lesson learned, don't wait for the bottom to fall out before making the changes you long to make. Also it's a lot easier to quit smoking if you're in a hospital for the first week. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Didn't like that they saw. A few days later I had heart surgery, and a week later I was back home, weak as a kitten, with lots of new meds to take, and a non-smoker. I felt like I was in the house of a dead relative, that's how profound the change was. In accordance with Bruce Sterling's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that you can make big changes when something big happens, a few months later I was more or less recovered, strong as a bull, determined to make good use of the time I had been given. A few months after that I had moved to Boston, was starting up blogging at Harvard, then BloggerCon, podcasting, and a new life. Lesson learned, don't wait for the bottom to fall out before making the changes you long to make. Also it's a lot easier to quit smoking if you're in a hospital for the first week. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 14 Jun 2022 12:55:16 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/06/14.html#a125516"/>

			<description>Ted Nelson was a mentor for all developers of my generation. We studied his book and were both thrilled to find other people thought the same way we were thinking, before we came along, and pissed (a little) that we weren't the great inventors we imagined ourselves to be. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/06/19/thehypertextman.html#1&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Nelson in 1995. &quot;He saw the complete picture when I was only getting a glimpse at the parts.&quot;</description>

			<title>Jack, let the hostage go</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think capitalism, practiced honorably, is great. You make a product, convince people to buy it, make a profit, attain financial security, live well from a material standpoint. Good for you. But some of the most successful people in business don't stop there, they seem to get a thrill from destroying things for profit, especially it seems, things that don't belong to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A great example, the oil companies. They sell a product they know makes our planet uninhabitable. Eventually it will fall to all of us to clean up after them, but also thanks to them, not before lots of people die and our quality of life is dramatically downgraded. That's just one example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now a very successful tech entrepreneur, Jack Dorsey, a man who has made billions, and until now has had a reputation for caring about the impact of his creations on the rest of the world, has taken something that is not his, the idea of an open web that belongs to everyone, that is the actual technology that made it possible for him to be so successful. Instead of giving back, he proposes to dismember it, deposit what's left in his bank account, and build something in its place that of course is designed to make him even richer, and have more control, while saying it will do the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I never have understood why people who have made billions want more. It can't possibly do anything for them. They aren't smart enough to run the world, no one is -- I don't care how lucky you got, or how competitive, hard-working, even brilliant. No one is so smart that they can plan on a world scale how technology will work in the future. We can all put our ideas out there and let them mix with other people's and hope there are enough people who want to work with others (as opposed to destroying them) to actually do something good at a large scale. That's as good as it gets. There is no example in our past, when tech was much simpler, of a human who did anything more than add an idea or two to the mix. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So please Jack Dorsey, stop pretending you have invented the next web. No one knows if what you have invented, if you actually have invented anything, will be any good. It certainly doesn't deserve the name of the one technology that got us past all the greed and arrogance of previous generations of tech gods. Back off. I'll help you find a great name for what you're doing, and maybe we can even help each other create more useful tech. Maybe you can start listening more and stop looking inside yourself for all the answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But some of the most successful people in business don't stop there, they seem to get a thrill from destroying things for profit, especially it seems, things that don't belong to them." created="Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:33:48 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/06/11/144229.html?title=jackLetTheHostageGo#a143348"/>
				<source:outline text="A great example, the oil companies. They sell a product they know makes our planet uninhabitable. Eventually it will fall to all of us to clean up after them, but also thanks to them, not before lots of people die and our quality of life is dramatically downgraded. That's just one example." created="Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:43:31 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/06/11/144229.html?title=jackLetTheHostageGo#a144331"/>
				<source:outline text="And now a very successful tech entrepreneur, Jack Dorsey, a man who has made billions, and until now has had a reputation for caring about the impact of his creations on the rest of the world, has taken something that is not his, the idea of an open web that belongs to everyone, that is the actual technology that made it possible for him to be so successful. Instead of giving back, he proposes to dismember it, deposit what's left in his bank account, and build something in its place that of course is designed to make him even richer, and have more control, while saying it will do the opposite." created="Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:44:12 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/06/11/144229.html?title=jackLetTheHostageGo#a144412"/>
				<source:outline text="I never have understood why people who have made billions want more. It can't possibly do anything for them. They aren't smart enough to run the world, no one is -- I don't care how lucky you got, or how competitive, hard-working, even brilliant. No one is so smart that they can plan on a world scale how technology will work in the future. We can all put our ideas out there and let them mix with other people's and hope there are enough people who want to work with others (as opposed to destroying them) to actually do something good at a large scale. That's as good as it gets. There is no example in our past, when tech was much simpler, of a human who did anything more than add an idea or two to the mix." created="Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:45:16 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/06/11/144229.html?title=jackLetTheHostageGo#a144516"/>
				<source:outline text="So please Jack Dorsey, stop pretending you have invented the next web. No one knows if what you have invented, if you actually have invented anything, will be any good. It certainly doesn't deserve the name of the one technology that got us past all the greed and arrogance of previous generations of tech gods. Back off. I'll help you find a great name for what you're doing, and maybe we can even help each other create more useful tech. Maybe you can start listening more and stop looking inside yourself for all the answers." created="Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:46:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/06/11/144229.html?title=jackLetTheHostageGo#a144623"/>

			<description>Early podcasts on YouTube? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoUers8RwM&quot;&gt;This is an experiment&lt;/a&gt;. I used an &lt;a href=&quot;https://tovid.io/&quot;&gt;online tool&lt;/a&gt; to convert the MP3 for a podcast interview Chris Lydon did in July 2003, with me -- to a video, I'm not sure if they added any advertising to it, so I'm posting it here for people to listen to and get feedback on, before proceeding with the rest.</description>

I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ace.c9.io/&quot;&gt;Ace Editor&lt;/a&gt; in read-only mode to view the contents of the XML file provided as the &lt;i&gt;url&lt;/i&gt; parameter. If no URL is provided I show the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News (my blog). There are still a couple of problems, at least, with the vertical and horizontal scrollbars. Ace has a great community and everything in the software is configurable, but I've had trouble at times putting it all together. I'll swing back to this at some point, but in the meantime what's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/09/xmlViewerToday.png&quot;&gt;there now&lt;/a&gt; is far more useful that what's been there &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/02/25/viewingRssInABrowser.html&quot;&gt;since 2011&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, for comparison, this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/09/chromeManglesMyBeautifulRssFeed.png&quot;&gt;how Chrome mangles&lt;/a&gt; my beautiful RSS feed. Remember this next time you get excited when a big tech company decides to love something you built. Not only do they chop off the last 23 posts, and complain how there are no titles on the items, but they also suggest I subscribe to this feed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;, which has been defunct for (according to Wikipedia) &lt;i&gt;eight years.&lt;/i&gt; There are some things big companies do well, caring for things like RSS is not one of them.</description>
