			<description>The pandemic came closer to me yesterday, I heard from a friend whose sister died of Covid. I feel lucky to have been vaccinated, but am confused about where we are now, and the future is still hard to have a feel for, or to even have a theory of. At least we have solid management on a national level, and that will help everyone, everywhere. The US never forgot how to be the US, even though we had an insane clown-like president for four years. The vaccine is here now, and more are on the way. And I know enough math to understand that the benefit of the vaccine starts as soon as one person is vaccinated. The more people who are immune, the slower the spread of the virus, complicated by its mutations which give it new power to evade. We're running a race now. At least we're &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the race now. That's something. But think of all the unnecessary suffering and death we're leaving behind. Today, it has a more substantial meaning to me than it did just a couple of days ago.</description>

			<description>BTW, when you get vaccinated you are told to sign on to a CDC website and create an account. I did that. I want everyone to know it looks very well done. They're going to use a government network to track progress of the vaccine. First smart thing I've seen from the government, with my own two eyes, since the pandemic started.</description>

			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/29.html#a215557&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; one of my AirPods. I can replace it for $89, or try something new, which is what I'll do. I'll let you know. In the meantime, I solved the problem with the crappy UI for the LG screen I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;. I bought the top-of-the-line &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08Q34DRLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Roku device&lt;/a&gt;, plugged it in, and it gives the same great picture, and lets me control everything from the much more &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;elegant Roku remote&lt;/a&gt;. I loaded on all the apps I need, including Fubo, which is not available for the LG, and after a few hours I realized why the Roku remote is so superior. There are so few buttons, and they're big enough, that I don't have to look at the remote to operate the UI. This is important for a TV where you use it in a dark room, ideally. Roku is the best. People say it's dated, I think it's really that it works, and that's what I want. ;-)</description>

			<description>I think some people think if you can develop software that you can't have interesting ideas in, or deep knowledge of, other topics. We're a mystery to them. People have no idea how the bits do their dance to make the things happen on the screen. So if we talk about politics or media, well there can't be much there. They won't look into that box. Interestingly, it seems our supposed ignorance also extends to how the computers work. They always have to get an expert who if they ever wrote software hasn't done so for 20 years. If this theory is true, can you imagine how much damage this ignore-ance is doing?</description>

			<description>Now you can get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluecheckhomes.com/&quot;&gt;blue checkmark&lt;/a&gt; for your home. Brilliant idea, and probably will be a hit.

			<description>A newly elected congressperson says Jews shoot lasers from space to start fires on earth. Lots of news stories spell her distinctive name carefully.

			<description>I read in a NY Times op-ed that we have to tax the rich to pay for pandemic relief. Not an income tax, which most would support, but an asset tax. So if your house has increased in value, you have to give the government money. Even if you didn’t sell it. There is no rule that you have to pay for the relief btw. The government prints money. There is no inflation, kind of the opposite pressure on the economy, we’re in a depression. Part of the reason for relief is to stimulate the economy. So a wealth tax could cause a stock market crash, I’m sure economic advisers would warn the president. All those rich people selling stock to pay the trillions in tax. Maybe we should tax people who write stupid op-ed in the NY Times instead. 🤪</description>

			<description>Biden sought unity, but he should not have connected it to bipartisanship. Unity means solving problems for the whole country, not just states that voted for him. That was Trump's CrazyTown USA. A total loser for Repubs. But the Repubs are the party built around one race supreme, über alles. They left a wide open field for the Dems. The Repub politicians, every one of them, are vestigial, members of a party with nowhere to go. Lost souls. You don't get bipartisan with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=58&amp;v=QUYKSWQmkrg&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;dead people&lt;/a&gt;. We're in a loop here. Whites, if you insist on ruling, you lose. The &quot;others&quot; are even stronger in 2021 than they were in 1865.</description>

			<description>A rite of passage. A few months ago I bought some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4&quot;&gt;$250 headphones&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. They were great. Today one of them fell out of my ear when I was taking off my mask, and disappeared into my jacket or the ether or whatever, but it's gone now. Oh well.</description>

			<description>When I was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bxscience.edu/&quot;&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of us asked to be excused from class at the same time. We went to the bathroom and flushed all the toilets at once. We figured the plumbing system hadn't been designed for that. The moral of the story is our whole system is designed that way. The stock market, the political system, the police, health care, the national guard. With 300 million people in the US, we could overload and destroy any system on any day, by coordinated action. That we &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; do it is a key feature of civilization.</description>

			<description>I read on twitter earlier that women have feelings and men have opinions. I didn't respond because I would have gotten excoriated. This is the kind of bullshit you read on twitter all the time. I'd like to see this, gender hate, be made illegal. It kind of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when every time a male child shows emotion they're punished for it. And who is doing this regulating, creating such unhealthy beasts? A lot of times it's women, our mothers, aunts, friends, etc. Men are people, full people, with all the human features. When you present us as horrible inhuman beings you are doing the greatest harm.</description>

			<title>The story of the filibuster</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;NYT Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes very good, riveting even, and certainly useful. Esp covering the pandemic. But on politics, they are often in the woods. Taking something simple and not only making it sound complex, but &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt; that they're doing that. It's tricky. If I tell you right now there's no point reading further because you'll never understand what I'm saying, you might keep reading but you wouldn't understand. A certainty. Or if I say &quot;You're not going to like this..&quot; you won't like it. I've seen myself react this way. And later thought, hold on, I never got a chance to like it or dislike it! Oy.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the history of the filibuster. It's one of those things like stock options that people feel they can't understand and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/podcasts/the-daily/filibuster-senate-mcconnell-democrats.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; they didn't help demystify it. I can't believe the reporter and interviewer didn't understand, but they kind of pretended they were confused. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's a rough timeline of the advent and demise of the filibuster in the US Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was a rule first adopted for the US Senate in 1917. It said this. If someone is talking endlessly, you can stop them, with a 2/3 majority. When you stop them, you can vote, and then a 51% majority rules. Simple. Before 1917 there was no way to shut up a speaker and start to vote, believe it or not. The vote to shut someone up is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloture&quot;&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In 1974 they made it so that when you're voting on money only, 51 percent rules. No filibuster allowed. You'll hear this referred to as &quot;reconcilliation.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In 1975, they dropped it to 3/5 or 60 votes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then a key change. The speaker who wants to hold up the vote didn't actually have to take the floor and do the speaking. They just said they would do it if they had to. That was enough to prevent majority rule. One senator. That's pretty fucked up if you ask me. BTW, they call this a &quot;virtual filibuster&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. Cool.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In 2013, they made it so that it didn't apply to confirming cabinet members and judges, except for Supreme Court judges. Only in Supreme Court confirmations would 60 votes be required, all other confirmations required 51. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And finally in 2017, they made it so it worked that way for Supreme Court judges too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's the Repubs and sometimes the Dems that change the rules. It's a dance. When it's the Dems it's the Repubs who forced them to do it. Not so sure about the other way. The Repubs are the obstructionist and flamethrowing party. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems are Charlie Brown, the Repubs are Lucy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now the filibuster can only be used for non-budgetary laws. There's a lot to that. For example, if  you wanted to overhaul health care in the US, you'd need a &quot;filibuster-proof&quot; majority which is a fancy way of saying you need 60 votes. Practically speaking neither party can get that many, so if it holds the current Congress can only pass legislation about money, and of course confirm judges. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the TL;DR version is that they're whittling it down, and probalby next time, it'll go away altogether, going back to where they were before 1917. Simple majority rule, speaking time limited by rule, not vote (as it is in the House). I think everyone understands that's the fair way to go. Otherwise 40 percent of the Senate, which often is much less than 40 percent of the people, can stop anything from happening. That's what happened during the Obama presidency when teh Repubs controlled the Senate, and they are poised to do it again. But this time the Dems have it in their power to nuke the filibuster, and end the tyranny of the minority. And if they have the votes and guts to do it, they should. Because someday soon the Repubs will do it, and the first to do it, gets the greatest reward. They can change things so that it's unlikely the Repubs ever get a majority in the Senate again. And since they have been a solid minority party for quite some time, it's time for their party to end. Regroup, come back to earth and try to get a majority of the votes. They'll have to stop being autocratic authoritarian conspiracy theorist nutjobs to get the votes, one would hope. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ideas may have to wait for their time</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I may boast a little, it's frustrating to know where things will eventually go, and wanting them to go there sooner, so we don't have to suffer while we're waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcasting was like that. If I tried to explain it to any of its most avid supporters today, back in 2004, they would have ignored it as the rantings of a crazy software developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now there's so much distance in time, and there are many more media things to do with networks, things that we need now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But nothing's changed about listening. I can't get an idea on the air for the life of me. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Everyone relax. The Repubs are a fascist party. You don’t have to pretend you’re just discovering this. You’ve actually known it for quite some time. But it was worse. Previously they were the fascist party that ran the country with no checks. Now they're the minority party. And if the Democrats have the guts to nuke the filibuster they can add a couple of new states that are likely to vote Democratic, adding four members to the Senate. That should help a bit. And they can fund the recovery through reconciliation even if they aren't willing or able to get rid of the filibuster.</description>

			<description>Here's a picture of a plate of sushi waiting to be eaten. The best sushi I have ever had. If you have this sushi in front of you waiting to be eaten, you are the richest you can possibly be. It does not matter how much money you have in the bank. Or how long you will live. Or who likes you. You are about to eat the best meal possible. You can't be richer than that.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=damage+Facebook+is+doing+to+our+political+system&quot;&gt;We hear a lot&lt;/a&gt; about the damage Facebook is doing to our political system, but why are we so complacent and accepting of the damage Fox does? We could bring political and economic power to bear. They may have a right to speak, but we should be able to get news, pay for news, without paying for Fox. I don't accept that we can't do anything about it which seems to be the consensus.</description>

			<description>All of a sudden Twitter doesn't work in Safari on my iPad. Neither does GMail. Everything else works fine. I thought it had to do with the East Coast outage a lot of services had the other day, but this problem persists. I much prefer to use them in the browser, there are all kinds of unnecessary barriers in their iPad apps (they try to keep you in the apps, I prefer to work in the web). Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/27/twitterInSafariOnIpad.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what I see on Twitter in Safari. And this is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/27/gmailSafariIpad.png&quot;&gt;GMail looks like&lt;/a&gt; in Safari on the iPad.</description>

			<description>If you live in the US and subscribe to cable TV it's almost certain that you are finanically supporting Fox News which is primarily responsible for the rise of Trump and downfall of democracy in the US. If I were you (and I am) I would want to do something about this, like demand that your cable company stop giving your money to Fox. How can I get your attention, and get you to tell other people. This is really important, simple, and something we can do to make things better.</description>

			<description>So if impeachment were taken off the table for Trump, every time an incumbent president was not re-elected, they would automatically attempt to overthrow and assassinate Congress. Why not? It might work, and there’s no penalty for trying.</description>

			<description>Today's song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DFhuE_XeT8&quot;&gt;Georgia on my Mind&lt;/a&gt;. In the mess of January 6, we didn't get enough time to savor the wonder of Georgia. Two Repubs gone, two Dems take their place. This can be replicated all over the country, where ever there are Repubs in charge of states with large African-American populations. The power of the ballot. It's something, as long as democracy rules. And I suspect it wasn't a coincidence that the white racists got violent the day after Georgia.</description>

			<description>Today I am in agreement with NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Yang about the Knicks and Jeremy Lin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bflats2020/status/1354055404393811969&quot;&gt;He says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the Knicks dumped Jeremy Lin that was the last straw for me. This is the franchise that gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/5-worst-contracts-handed-out-in-nba-history/2&quot;&gt;Jerome James&lt;/a&gt; $30 million. You let the most beloved Knicks figure in years who lit the Garden and City up walk over money?  Come on.&quot; Amen. Under his note are a mix of comments including the usual that Lin wasn't that good, but who knows. If the Knicks had loved him maybe he would have continued to be an inspiration to the team and to New Yorkers. Instead, the Knicks stuck with Melo, who clearly was jealous of the attention &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html&quot;&gt;Lin&lt;/a&gt; was getting. Lin might have done great if they had kept coach &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni&quot;&gt;Mike D'Antoni&lt;/a&gt;, but they let him go too. Who knows. But nothing was known at the moment the Knicks said goodbye to Linsanity. And for all the Asian-Americans who live in the city, a cause of celebration disappeared. I think I may have loved the whole thing mostly because of the way it made them light up in civic pride. And I couldn't help but feel that the NBA was being a bit racist in their treatment of Lin. My suggestion to the mayoral candidate, Mr Yang, is that he campaign on giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;James Dolan&lt;/a&gt; the boot. Find a new owner for the Knicks. I also agree with commenters who said you can't decide to leave a team. Once a Knick fan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/02/punchingGlassInALockerRoom.html&quot;&gt;sadly&lt;/a&gt;, always a Knicks fan.</description>

			<description>Followup on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21.html#a140859&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about why &lt;i&gt;neo&lt;/i&gt;-Nazi instead of plain old Nazi and there is an answer. The original Nazis came with a lot of stuff the new ones don't. They had uniforms, a symbol, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nazi_Germany&quot;&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt;, a leader and his manifesto. The new Nazis don't have any of that. In Germany the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_memorabilia&quot;&gt;paraphernalia&lt;/a&gt; of the old Nazis are illegal. In the US that would be too offensive. There is still a memory of WW II, we remember who the enemy was then. If they walked around with swastika armbands people would know for sure they're the enemy. Maybe at some point they will decloak, but that hasn't happened yet. I thought of putting a swastika in the right margin, but felt that would be too shocking. That's the point. So there is a difference. I got emails from several readers. Thanks!</description>

			<description>I also have a definitive answer on what the difference is between rain and showers, a question that has come up here before. When they call for rain in the forecast, they mean water is going to be coming out of the sky uniformly, both in terms of geography and time. If you go out when it's raining, you will get wet. However if they call for showers that means it will rain on and off, and it might be raining in one town and not in the other. It's more intermittent. You can risk it, you might not get wet if you don't bring an umbrella.</description>

			<description>While we're at it, my first real car (not counting a Renault junker I bought hoping it would magically work, it just barely made it home) was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/tag/datsun-b210/&quot;&gt;Datsun B210&lt;/a&gt;. I think I paid $3300 new. Those were the days. It was a very reliable little car. I called it the Lawn Mower because that's about how powerful the engine was (slight exaggeration). Back in those days, the mid-70s, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.cfm&quot;&gt;Interstate Highway System&lt;/a&gt; wasn't finished, and I drove it all around the country, and a lot of it was on two-lane highways with heavy truck traffic. My poor little lawn mower (with me inside!) would get blown around a lot. But it was very reliable. Only broke down once, and that was due to operator error. I ended up trading it in for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/25/voyager.png&quot;&gt;hippie van&lt;/a&gt;, a high mileage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsqWuR9JI54&quot;&gt;1974 Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, which I also drove all over the country. The van ended up dead in a ditch in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemeketa_Park,_California&quot;&gt;Chemaketa Park, California&lt;/a&gt;, a little community I lived in off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/CA-17,+California/Comanche+Trail,+Lexington+Hills,+CA+95033/@37.1575867,-121.9911122,15z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e37e7e8678013:0x54ed81a461ad50b9!2m2!1d-121.9879274!2d37.1479208!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e37c36d2bf239:0x11177495e7605172!2m2!1d-121.9794407!2d37.1614182!3e0!5i1&quot;&gt;Highway 17&lt;/a&gt; between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz.

			<title>What's the alternative to piracy?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think ultimately the only way TV can work in the future is completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_la_carte&quot;&gt;a la carte&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have subscribed to FUBO and YouTube TV, each for just one channel, both costing about $65 a month. But the money isn't going to the one channel each, it's being spread over hundreds of channels, and some of my money is going to Fox News and I totally object to that. I might cancel both just to avoid paying any money at all to Fox. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile when something comes out on HBO, Apple TV or Disney that I'm interested in, there's no way for me to pay to watch it without buying into everything they sell. (I'm only subscribed to Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what alternative is there to piracy? They've created such a convoluted system, that costs so much money for so little, they've completely destroyed their own business. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the only thing that can make money in the new system are live sports shows. Or ceremonies like the inaugural, that you want to watch as they're happening. And this is all rent. The technology was paid for a long time ago. The system is screwed up beyond recognition. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the really nice things about Facebook is that every morning after breakfast they show me my posts from the past. So right now I'm re-living the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March&quot;&gt;Women's March&lt;/a&gt; after the Trump inauguration. And this makes me wonder -- why aren't we in the streets marching now? In 2017 it was mostly symbolic, a cry of pain that we all heard, ourselves, but it didn't help make the government better. Today if we were all in the streets the Repubs might not be so bold in Congress. They all saw what happened in Georgia. Show them it could happen in Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, North Carolina and Florida too. Make sure they know what we demand. They're scared and confused now. It's a good time to apply pressure. And to the Democrats, why aren't you organizing us! What are you waiting for? How many more chances to save American democracy do you think we're going to get?</description>

			<description>Yes I know these rants don't accomplish anything. At some point it has to stop. When I ran a startup in the 80s I remember trying to visualize the last day there, but I couldn't. Then one day I realized I had left, and I didn't even remember the last day. Like the last time I saw my mother, or an old girlfriend -- I don't remember most of those days either. But I do remember the day Trump took office. And I remember marching, and wondering if it would do any good. Like the rants I write today. Anyway one thing is for sure, we won't get many more chances to fix the country. I believe I know the answer -- look to the left and right not up or down. We don't have to unite with the miscreant Republicans in Congress. Most of them work for Moscow. We have to connect with other Americans who vote against democracy. This is not optional. So it's important to remember that and think of things we can do to shake ourselves out of our ruts and get out in the streets, figuratively and literally.</description>

All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.”</description>
