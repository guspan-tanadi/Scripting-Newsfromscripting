			<description>If a baker may not be forced to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding on the basis of religious freedom, surely a woman can’t be forced to give birth.</description>

If you go back far enough she was a blogger on Tumblr, so we feel pride, a local girl did good. And she adds a bit of open web, user-centric thought to everything. As a software developer, I see things the same way. I don't care how much money Zuck or Bezos or Musk have, like most journalists seem to, I care how empowered the users are, because that's how we will solve the problems of our world, by smart people who see things from important perspectives, who say what they see. Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3sBrFLS&quot;&gt;recent piece&lt;/a&gt; in the WP is about a group of startups who want the big silos to make it easier for their users to migrate to other platforms. This is a hard problem both economically and technically, and I'm not sure the startups are sincere, it could be they only want the publicity. There are no details &lt;a href=&quot;https://myfriendsmydata.org/&quot;&gt;on the website&lt;/a&gt;, and a project like this is all about the details. Also VC-backed startups are the last devs I expect to go this route and I don't imagine if one of them is successful that they're going to rush to share their user lists with the others. The only way something like this can work is if they share a membership system from the start. And if they do that, and want credibility, there should be some non-VC open source devs in their group. One more thing, why not just use Twitter's identity system. It's got a great API, scales really well, and other devs (such as me) are using it that way. Instead of building my own identity system, I just use theirs. I have no interest in controlling my users, so it's a no-brainer. Sure the day could come when Twitter shuts off the API, but I could also get hit by a car riding my bike on a country road, or any number of other calamities.</description>

Much later, in 2015, I ported the World Outline software from Frontier running as a server, to Node.js, but I left the site private, probably because I wasn't planning to build in this direction, I just wanted to get some sites that were running in Frontier to work in Node. This morning some of my work led me to this software, and I saw that it was private, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/worldOutline&quot;&gt;made it public&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the &lt;i&gt;wo&lt;/i&gt; is like the &lt;i&gt;www&lt;/i&gt; except with outlines instead of HTML. You can of course render the outlines as HTML, and that's what the WO software does. Given all the interest in outliners these days, it seemed like a good time to open this stuff up. However at this point I don't plan to run the server software here. If you get it running, all I ask is that you continue to support OPML. Interop is everything. Thanks.</description>

			<description>I was out driving the new Model Y with a fresh pizza on the passenger seat, rounded a corner and there was a fat turkey waddling across the road. Slammed the brakes. They work, but turkey keeps waddling as if nothing happened. Pizza mess on the floor of the new car. Where the Model 3 had the new car smell even six months after getting it, this car smells of pizza. Hey at least it was good pizza. Heh.</description>

They want to be famous for having an idea first, whether or not they did have it first. I don't think I do that. I like setting precedent in software. But even there, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Only%20steal%20from%20the%20best&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;Only steal from the best.&quot; My goal is to find ways to work with others so that the sum is greater than the parts. I think that's the challenge of our generation and all subsequent generations. We're not dealing with climate change, for example. We're losing our minds as a country in other ways, for example the decision the Supreme Court is contemplating. You know it's not going to work, it'll be as big a disaster as climate change, but we'll feel it right away. We can't connect enough so that the people who we've supposedly trusted for being wise to avoid jumping unnecessarily, with no possible gain, into an abyss that will certainly lead to war. It's that big a deal. At age 67, I don't have the same goals I had at 22. I'm not trying to set the world on fire, I'm trying nudge people into working with each other, even today's 22 year-olds. We should be giving out Nobel Prizes to people who find ways to work with others. That's the challenge for the human species, from now on, imho of course.</description>

They certainly are coming back, unless you think Twitter is over. These things go in cycles.

			<title>OPML package update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -- there's a new &lt;i&gt;expandIncludes&lt;/i&gt; function in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage#v0424----51122-by-dw&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt; for JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you know I'm working on a refresh of all the stuff I have related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, and part of that is the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for subscription lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription list&lt;/a&gt; is an outline containing nodes of type &lt;i&gt;rss&lt;/i&gt; that have an &lt;i&gt;xmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute that points to a feed. Even though the type is rss, it can be used to point to feeds in any format, including Atom and RDF. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The lists can contain anything else you like, feeds, docs, and they can include other subscription lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Example: You could maintain a list of people you follow and plug that into your reader's subscription list, and also offer it to friends, where they could include it in their list. And because you're using pointers, when your list updates, your friends are automatically updated. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To include a list in another, just insert a node of type &lt;i&gt;include, &lt;/i&gt;with a &lt;i&gt;url&lt;/i&gt; attribute that points to another OPML file which should include nodes of type &lt;i&gt;rss&lt;/i&gt; and possibly other &lt;i&gt;include&lt;/i&gt; nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They work like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_directive#C/C++&quot;&gt;includes in C&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the name came from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the new thing is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt; now has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/opmlpackage.js#L322&quot;&gt;expandIncludes&lt;/a&gt; function that can be given an outline, in a JavaScript object, and it returns an outline with all the include nodes expanded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had code that does this for decades in various environments. It's trivial in a language like C, Python, or Frontier -- any rational language that takes care of I/O under the hood, but it's a difficult problem in a language like JavaScript where you have to manage your own synchronization. This code first appeared in 2014 as part of PagePark, then moved to the daveopml package, and finally, today into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;opml package&lt;/a&gt;. This is where it belongs, where everyone else can easily get to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new version, 0.4.24 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;in NPM&lt;/a&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage#v0424----51122-by-dw&quot;&gt;release note&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/tree/main/examples/includes&quot;&gt;example code&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/examples/includes/includes.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments post an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This should also be useful in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Tools%20For%20Thought&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I haven't seen him in a few years, and at this time in our respective lives people's appearances can change dramatically. He looked good but old, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=colonel+sanders&quot;&gt;Colonel Sanders&lt;/a&gt;. I think he got a stylist and I'm guessing the Colonel Sanders look is deliberate? I'm sure he'll tell me. Anyway &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/11/nerd.png&quot;&gt;the nerd&lt;/a&gt; is going on and on, and if that really is Doc, I can't imagine he knows what he's talking about, and why the hell should he. The guy was talking very fast about problems that I thought would have been solved long ago. This is 2022 after all. I guess that's just nature of computer stuff, we're always re-inventing things. I do it too.</description>

I need this because my work requires me to look at XML files. And as far as I know there isn't a great way to do that, and given all the XML that's out there (web pages are XML, RSS feeds are XML) it would make sense to solve this problem well, as a very useful upgrade to the user experience of the web.

			<title>None of us learned the real history of the United States in school</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've spent most of the last 1.5 years reading about slavery in the US, mostly from the perspective of descendants of slaves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not done yet. I think I could spend the rest of my life reading only about this, and with every book learn something important about my country that I never knew before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm now reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-South-Won-Civil-War/dp/0190900903&quot;&gt;HCR's book&lt;/a&gt; about slavery, it's from a very different perspective, that of a current-day (white) historian.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find this piece fits in nicely with the others I've read. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the missing history book, the one we didn't read in school. None of us did, of no American generation. As far as I know, the truth about America has never been taught in an American school, to American kids.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Never. And that means you got the wrong story as I did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And please don't assume you know what the story is. You can't and you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An OPML-related project</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren't into &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; you can skip this post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have yet to organize all the bits going into my next project, the one I've been working on all year (so far). It doesn't even have a codename yet, which is unusual for me, I usually come up with them at the beginning. It will eventually have one. Anyway at this time I don't have a good place on GitHub to put the bits, the data and scripts, so I'll hang them off this post on my blog until a better place shows up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a really good example of an OPML subscription list for the RSS-related project. The canonical example is the collection of feeds for the NY Times. They have them all assembled on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/rss&quot;&gt;single page&lt;/a&gt;. I did a view source, and saw that it's good HTML. I selected the part of the HTML with the feed list, and opened it in an HTML source editor, and cleaned it up until it validated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/frontierScriptSource.opml&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to read the file into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/scratchpad.nytstruct.fttb&quot;&gt;object database structure&lt;/a&gt;, and then wrote a script to create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/flatlist.opml&quot;&gt;flat OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt; with the data. I opened the outline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/nytFeeds.opml&quot;&gt;organized it&lt;/a&gt; the way they have it organized on their site. I then opened the outline in my feed reader app and copied a few of the feeds from the NYT list, pasted them into the list for the test app, and it worked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we also have a current, complete and well-organized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/nytFeeds.opml&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of the NYT feeds. It should prove useful in the work to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It'd be interesting to see the results of a poll: 1. Do you wear a mask to protect against transmission of Covid? 2. Are you in favor of repealing Roe v Wade to force people who are pregnant to go through months of painful, risky and expensive medical procedures?</description>

There's a basic bug in the American myth of self-reliance, the bug is this -- it's a lie. Humanity is like an ant colony. Our lives follow a rigid template that's &lt;s&gt;hard&lt;/s&gt; impossible to break out of. Unless you're a hermit, you pay taxes, get the same medicine as everyone else, celebrate the same holidays (even non-Christians in the US observe Christmas in some fashion). You are only unique in your mind, but even there, where you are free to be different, there's a lot of conformity. We rely on each other, there is no such thing as a pioneer on the open range, fending for himself. Richardson doesn't say any of those things, at least not in the beginning of the book, instead she describes the American myth. And as I'm reading it, I recognize it as the argument between the people and the oligarchs that's still raging. We think of it as North vs South but that's all part of the puppetry. We're being manipulated into blaming each other for nothing, distracting us from what we could be if we didn't pander to the oligarchs. Really looking forward to this read.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalists and pundits have been doubting that Twitter/Musk can double their revenue with subscriptions. I don't doubt they can because Twitter in all the years they've been around has never even tried to make products that run on their platorm for money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's a Twitter package I'd pay for and so would a lot of other people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Call it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1523656621833875457&quot;&gt;Twitter Pro&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Posts can have titles.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Simple styling.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Podcasts. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited length.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;$10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd pay.

The way values have been going, I'm paying very little to make this switch for cars of comparable value. The mileage on the 3 is low.

The Y, which has a different seating arrangement, is easier.</description>

			<title>I fear for Ukraine...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I fear for Ukraine. What happens when we decide it's over even when the war is still raging, as we have done with Covid, not caring how many people's lives will be ruined, or ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I expect it'll be the same with Roe v Wade, until we really get woke and see the big picture. We need societal mechanisms to stay focused on what matters, and not lose focus in meaningful ways, until the problem is solved or the threat is over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of other things fall into that bucket btw: climate change, regulating guns in the US, black lives matter, LGBTQ rights. We only focus briefly, leaving us vulnerable to dishonest power-hungry people who are more patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Social networks can help, but only ones that are carefully crafted to stay focused on the goal they are assigned to. Twitter and Facebook et al were invented and bootstrapped in chaos. I understand this process as well as anyone. There are other ways to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I posted this as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1523320792536449024&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I know no one there will latch onto it, because it's not the kind of thing Twitter-the-network pays any attention to. Which is the point. The only way to get something like that going is to go first, the same way podcasting and RSS and blogging before it got started. Do it until it seems obvious, and then there's a FOMO, and let the people with the loudest voices pretend they were there at the beginning. All those things have to happen. So we're a long way from being able to work together, but until we start, we'll still be mired, and the people who think and act long-term will keep running everything.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Abortion made better families. People have the choice to grow up before becoming parents. They can have some life on their own, to find out who they are before they have to live with another crazy person with no experience as a standing on their own.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/05/30/elephant.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;This is what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mims/status/1522569173645369344&quot;&gt;tech columnist&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/&quot;&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt; says is the difference between Twitter and Facebook. &quot;Twitter has always been toxic, having a series of 'cool' CEOs tricked journalists and wonks into using it vs the uncool Facebook, new ownership will highlight that all (currently) social mediums are fundamentally toxic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay that's what a columnist at the WSJ sees. He's pretty clear it's from the point of view of a journalist.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My observations follow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter grew out of the blogging world and the people of blogs and the norms of blogging moved here. That's why Twitter is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook started with students, then moved to families. That's why it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trolls follow crowds online. To say a place has trolls (Mims uses the word toxic) simply means enough people congregate there to attract trolls. Journalists btw were the ones who decided FB was evil and Twitter was fun. Some of us were shaking our heads and protesting loudly that they're missing the big picture. Journalism was wrong about Facebook, in a lot of ways that they still don't understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For non-journos, both Twitter and Facebook are useful, and if I had to choose I'd say FB is a little more useful. Twitter these days is choked with grievance, from people who aren't very toxic in real life, but choose Twitter as the place to purge their bile. But inbetween ventings, it's a place to be heard, maybe just a little. And if you listen carefully you might find out about something new. I first heard of the leaked Supreme Court opinion on Monday on Twitter, a few minutes before I heard about it on MSNBC (I was watching Chris Hayes at the time). By the time Maddow was on I had fully read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473&quot;&gt;Politico article&lt;/a&gt;.

And stay in touch with friends we otherwise would not be able to stay connected to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;blind man&lt;/a&gt; sees. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>To Democratic marketers (I hope there are some) -- it's time to introduce a new actor to American politics -- The Federalist Society. Treat it like the right treats Sharia Law or Critical Race Theory, only of course the FS is real. And the conspiracy is real. It's how we got here. I heard Biden on the radio this morning talking about MAGA being behind this. That's not useful and it's not true. The MAGA people will really be hurt by this. Now is a good time Mr President, to try to unite us. This is the real anti-people Republican Party. The 1%. The Federalist Society. It's a plot to rob us of our rights. To turn America into a religious dictatorship. Mr President here's your chance to be transformative. But first you need to learn how to talk about it.</description>

			<description>The events of the last few days are proof that reporters should never guess the outcome of an election months before it happens. Even today, after the news of the Roe v Wade decision leaked, they're saying that Repubs are expected to take control of Congress in the November election. Let's dive into that supposed fact. Who is doing this expectation? Shouldn't they say? Isn't it just reporters who expect that? Like so much news this is like barbers cutting each others' hair. They isn't any actual news. They should always be aware that anything could happen and almost always does that could change the expectation, so stop advertising your expectations, they have no value as news.</description>
