So far it's going well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's an unusual project, a bit like traveling back to 2002, and then considering the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; world as it exists now, and try to do something with the incredible amount of data flowing by, but with limited tools to actually see what's available. That, of course is exactly the challenge. To create tools that suit each type of data people push through feeds and make it visible and useful to people who want it. There's a wide variety from linkblogs like Hacker News, to description-only feeds from the NYT to full text from WordPress sites. And podcasts. And the totally possible Twitter feeds. And who know what else will be possible. We haven't been creative here for many, many, many years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember a long time ago when I worked at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing#Time-sharing&quot;&gt;timesharing&lt;/a&gt; company. We had a big computer facility in New Jersey and I worked in Manhattan. We leased our customers teletypes where they would type queries and we're send back data. They could also program in BASIC. My job was to write tools for them so they would run them and use them for hours and of course very hour was money to my company, so I was incentivized to come up with things they'd use a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the most fun I had was writing a scroller of headlines from an AP wire we had hooked up to the system. You'd just leave the app running and it would show you the news as it happened. People got addicted to it. Really simple. No one says it has to be complex to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A reporter asks if Jan 6 is a &quot;bridge too far&quot; for Trump as an at-large criminal (they didn't put it that way). If it isn't what would be? If he nuked a major American city? Would that be enough to put him in jail. Do people listen to their own words?</description>

			<title>A screed of no importance</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Knaster&quot;&gt;Scott Knaster&lt;/a&gt; who was a doc writer at Apple in the heyday of the Mac, and who went to General Magic and then Google, has been going through his various closets and digging out things from the ancient software past. He dug up original &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/25/userlandFrontierDisks.png&quot;&gt;Frontier disks&lt;/a&gt; from 1992 or so and posted a picture to Facebook. Here's what he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hey Dave, I was watching the Cooperstown inductions today including Gil Hodges, and I thought of you. I was a big fan of the 1969 Mets. Then later I was cleaning up old stuff and found these discs, thought of you again. I hope you’re doing well!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These disks brought up a story, which I shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid022PujwpmPkX8GVRYBFBbsbjsdtkJuFXuudew4G8TdR5pAAPzprJxxpgMfvts8vjV7l?comment_id=440585781308326&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, and now here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Frontier on the Mac  was about 30 years ago believe it or not. People born in that year, cute little babies in cribs, are now 30 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That experience completely wrung out my last hope for corporate platform vendors. Not only did I get a close-up look at Apple, but I also got to know the platform people at Microsoft and Aldus. Corporations have too many conflicts to pull it off. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A wise Apple would have let us run scripting on the Mac, and let us put it where ever we wanted. What they ended up with was a pure corporate creation, runs only on one OS, and has its utility crippled by an idea that top execs understood -- &quot;Programming in English.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Corporation&quot;&gt;Aldus&lt;/a&gt; had a deal with developers, they'd wait two releases before crushing them (ie pulling the features of their plugin into the main product). At least they were up front about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft people were mostly nerds and they gave their programmers a lot of freedom. I hooked up with one of the devs on Microsoft Word, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.c2.com/?DavidLuebbert&quot;&gt;Dave Luebbert&lt;/a&gt;, and we had a scripting party, and Word was the most scriptable app out there, even though no one knew. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After that experience, I left software. I realized there wasn't going to be anything left for me, because no matter what I did, i'd either have to work inside one of these beasts, and I didn't see that working out too well, or they'd just anihilate us if we achieved any success, even if we did it on their terms.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A year later -- I got a demo of HTTP and I saw the answer. It's like being a devotee of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#R'hllor&quot;&gt;Lord of Light&lt;/a&gt; in Game of Thrones. Oh there's the answer -- Unix! (I programmed in C on Unix before going to the Apple II.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm doing one more push folks, no one has been doing anything with RSS for many years, even though it's very much still out there. I've had a productive year. Really good software almost ready. We'll see if there's any hope for independent developers in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's bad politics to alienate a whole gender</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley&quot;&gt;Hawley&lt;/a&gt; but he's onto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/11/11/1054615028/is-masculinity-under-attack-sen-hawley-wants-to-defend-the-men-of-america&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems probably unintentionally do things to push male voters away. He, and the Repubs are milking that for all it's worth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can argue the righteousness of it, but it's bad politics to alienate a whole gender. Bad for winning elections, assuming that's what the Dems want to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also by making him &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=hawley&amp;geo=US&quot;&gt;famous&lt;/a&gt; you're helping him, even if you say nasty shit about him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GeorgeLakoff&quot;&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt;. People don't care whether you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2021/11/07/josh-hawley-masculinity-porn-video-games&quot;&gt;like him&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/josh-hawley-masculinity-obsession-1254776/&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;, but when you push him, you're creating a bigger space in their minds labeled X where X is the name of the asshole you're writing about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm doing it right now, I know it -- can't think of a way of avoiding it and still make the point.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet the Dems could pick up 10% more male voters just by doing a little marketing saying the Dems care. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But she misses an important point. Men saw what happened too. And while we were effectively silenced in the public debate, men do vote and that's a private thing. I don't doubt that #metoo contributed to more men voting for Trump. So there's another reason to regret forcing Franken to quit without any process, it was stupid politics. I think something similar contributed to Elizabeth Warren's failure as a presidential candidate in 2020. I enthusiastically supported her at first, but then I guess trying to get stronger women's support, she said some awful things about men. It didn't get any press, but I, as a man heard it, and as far as I was concerned it disqualified her. A president has to be for every American, regardless of gender. A woman president is also a president for men. And we can vote. We will I hope have a woman president someday, and when we do, she will appeal to all genders. Men can be feminists, but if you think that equates to attacking men for being men, you won't win. Men still have a lot of votes.</description>

			<title>Do you feel you're better than me?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1550156845976879104&quot;&gt;A poll on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason I ask is that I'm often surprised when people act as if they are better than me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like a person I knew before he was super rich, when I suggested we might work on something together, responds as if I was a lunatic to think he would bend that low. I'd love to ask why he responded so negatively, but I can't do that, because I don't want to go there, to really hear the nasty bits or intonations inside this person. But I wouldn't mind knowing if I didn't have to be present when he gave his answer. It's kind of like what Woody Allen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azquotes.com/author/291-Woody_Allen/tag/death&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; about death. &quot;I am not afraid of death. I just don't want to be there when it happens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have friends from another country, a country that in general feels superior to America. The friends have always acted as if they were better. It sometimes comes out as a joke, but the behavior is there too, indicating that like most jokes, they are also truths. Anyway I think &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; better because my country is a lot bigger and richer than theirs, we have more nukes, and we create more kickass tech and culture. But then I remember my own country is net-net such a jackass internationally, and I remember that we also had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; for 250 years, and we still haven't turned the corner on that. But you have a queen and I know you think that's a positive, but I think it's quaint and more than a bit sad. A family of fat boring people who supposedly have a special connection to god? Please spare me. We have people like that here too, and we're trying to put them in jail. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically the lesson is this -- we all suck. Judge us on what we've done, our actions. Inside we all have ugly thoughts, the question is how much do you act on them. If you think I've created something interesting, consider that perhaps I could do it again. If I've been generous maybe I am generous. Maybe you have prejudices. I can't tell you how many times I've been dismissed as too old to do what I actually did. Like the time, at a conference, a young person asked if I knew what a podcast was, with a doubtful look on her face as if oh god I can't believe I'm actually talking to someone this ignorant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find I do it too, and I've tried to consciously overrule my prejudices, and consider the possibility that someone who doesn't look like they could know anything actually does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Which Markdown?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/discussions/6#discussioncomment-3187614&quot;&gt;Joseph Zitt&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;It's very cool that you're supporting Markdown -- but which Markdown are you using?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This of course is a great question. I answered it, the way all Markdown questions are answered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course as you know there is no One True Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The approach we all take with Markdown text is to stay within a reasonable subset of the syntax, and hope for the best. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I go by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;, which I keep in an icon in the chrome of my browser, easy to reach for. And it seems to work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the Markdown processors I use --&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the client side -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/markdownConverter.js&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; called MarkdownCoverter, which I downloaded many years ago. I seem to recall it's the one that StackExchange uses, so I figured it's got to be pretty good. In all the years I've been using it there haven't been any complaints as far as I know.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the server side -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked&quot;&gt;markd&lt;/a&gt;. I don't recall how I decided to use this one, but it has also served me well.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As I understand it Gruber likes the way it has evolved. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The shit does kind of hit the fan when it comes to using Markdown in something like RSS where interop is the primary thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But this was one of the first enhancements I wanted to get out there in 2022, the 20th year of RSS 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: See the previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/18/163658.html?title=twitterRssMarkdown&quot;&gt;day's&lt;/a&gt; posts about Markdown in RSS feeds.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dev notes for Markdown in RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/18/163658.html?title=twitterRssMarkdown&quot;&gt;blasted&lt;/a&gt; out a lot of information about RSS feeds from Twitter accounts that support Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This note explains how developers can generate feeds with Markdown and handle them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generating feeds with Markdown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suppose you've written blogging software that allows users to enter Markdown text. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you render their posts to the web, you run the text through a Markdown processor which returns HTML which you then copy into the page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You also save the Markdown source text in case the user wants to edit it later. They don't want to edit the HTML you generated, they want to pick up with the Markdown version of the text. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You do something similar in the RSS feed, probably, putting the rendered text in the description element of the item. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now you can also include the Markdown text in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element. To get an idea how that works, have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://feedland.org/twitterfeeds/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for my Twitter account. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/19/swimmingScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the RSS item for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549420878764691458&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The existence of the source:markdown element tells the reader app that it can either use the text of the description as it normally would, or it can start with the Markdown text, render it and then display it. Or perhaps you're sending the text somewhere that understands Markdown -- then you'd just send the Markdown text without rendering. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reading feeds with Markdown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suppose you have a feed reader and want to do something nice for feeds that have source:markdown elements. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is what you do: If you can handle Markdown rendering in your reader app and you spot a source:markdown element, use that in place of the description element.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you're passing the text on to an app that can deal with Markdown, for example a database, save the Markdown text in addition to the rendered text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I am developing both an editing tool that generates Markdown text and a feed reader that knows how to render Markdown text.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, post a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/discussions/6&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter + RSS + Markdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://feedland.org/twitterfeeds/cluelessnewbie/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for the tweets on my cluelessnewbie test account. This is new. Look at the items in that feed, you'll see each has a  &lt;i&gt;source:markdown&lt;/i&gt; element. It's explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the Source namespace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I entered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549068783066791937&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter, using Markdown to style lists, text, links and code. Also note that the first item in the Twitter thread begins with a single #, which my processor interprets as it being the title for the RSS item. Believe it or not that fixes a pretty big mismatch in the connection between Twitter and RSS, titles. If you remember reading Twitter feeds in Google Reader you'll know what I mean. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The text starts in Twitter, goes out through RSS, is processed by Markdown, and rendered predictably in my reader app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/18/aBunchOfMarkdown.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549068783066791937&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/18/markdownInAFeedFromATweet.png&quot;&gt;as rendered&lt;/a&gt; in my RSS reader.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Summary: We've added Markdown to RSS, and hooked Twitter up to RSS.

I couldn't work without one. After almost 10 years of working in JavaScript I've got the debugger working almost as well as the one in Frontier. I use the debugger to write code -- if I want to see the data my code has to work with, I don't have to figure it out, I can see it. A debugger isn't just for fixing mistakes, it's for exploring the inner workings of code you might not be familiar with. The first really great debugger I used was THINK C. It made it possible for me to do much more complex projects, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Won't get fooled again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You can invent and evolve a new sport if you are all the elements, yourself. If you're can play all the roles, have a venue, journalists (cover it), and you have fans. If you want to change the rules, you don't need to get anyone's approval, you just need a vision. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how I got blogging going. I had tools for writing, and reading, and I generated feeds myself because I am a writer. I don't have to wait to find a writer who will try out my latest ideas. Or get a feed reader to support the feature, or have editing tools so that other people can do it. It happened even faster with evolving podcasting because it was the second time around, and people were paying attention to the blogs we created in Step 1. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With RSS 2.0, I was intimidated when big companies and VCs got in the way. In the future I'll keep cruising because I know I have a better sense of what's needed than they do because they just hire bored employees to work on my ideas. None of them had the guts, curiousity or frankly enough intelligence to work with the person who put it all together. Learned that lesson after twenty years of stagnation in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rss.land/&quot;&gt;RSS-Land&lt;/a&gt;. No more of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I turned this post into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluelessnewbie/status/1549146834689556481&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: You can read the feed &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http://feedland.org/twitterfeeds/cluelessnewbie/rss.xml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

They got some things right. The protocol was designed in a couple of weeks by four people, two at Microsoft and two of us not. The Microsoft people were from their networking group. They wanted a cross-platform protocol to do what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model&quot;&gt;DCOM&lt;/a&gt; does. It was and is a brilliant idea. I wanted it as a way of designing APIs for scriptable blogging systems. We were in the process of shipping a new Windows version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we already had a Mac version, and I wanted the two Frontiers to work beautifully together on LANs and on the net. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it, when I figured out that it would be done with XML and HTTP. I then got an email from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft asking if I wanted to work with them on this. I always admired Bob and people like him at Microsoft, they had an excellent engineering culture imho, so of course I said yes. What followed was one of the most productive collaborations of my career. And as a result not only did Frontier get great cross-platform compatibility, all the early blogging systems has compatible APIs. To the Hacker News folks, that's what matters in a protocol, what kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; did it enable.

			<description>I want Biden to step back after the election and let the Democrats have a great primary campaign where we really discuss, as a country, what our options are going forward. Not limited to things considered too daring, like expanding the court. It's clear Biden will not do what we need. But that's okay, his greatest contribution would be to create a stage for the next generation of leaders to work things out, along with Bernie Sanders and others.</description>

A lot of things have to be right for it to happen, and when it does, please -- don't get in the way, it's a miracle. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 15 Jul 2022 12:41:25 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/10/loveRss.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/07/15.html#a124125"/>

			<title>The Dems are the problem now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who say we shouldn't criticize Dems are crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're losing on every front and all the Dems have to say is we need to vote so they can codify reproductive rights, which is, sad to say only a small part of the problem, a symptom of the disease, not the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic leadership has yet to commit to doing anything about all the other chaos that the Supreme Court has inflicted on us. It's not good enough to bring back reproductive rights, we have to neutralize all the other attacks as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a voter, citizen, taxpayer, human being -- this is unacceptable. If the current leadership of the Democratic party can't get this together, now, then we must act quickly to get new leadership. We don't have any time to waste. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There may be other reasons. I think that also goes for damning with faint praise.

			<description>Have you ever seen an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed where the &amp;lt;description&gt; text was &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;? Probably not, because few if any of the readers would understand it. We could start this as a bootstrap later this summer.</description>

			<description>BTW -- is it a coincidence that Evan Williams stepped aside at Medium as Twitter, which he co-founded, is without a leader?</description>

			<description>I think the person who runs Twitter should have a sense of humor and love good entertainment. There's so much potential in this medium, that's just been left there for everyone to figure out. Which is great, except there's been little or no coordination with the tech.</description>
