			<description>President Biden does something I thought Democrats forgot how to do. He goes around the obstruction in DC, bringing his ideas to the people. Journalism could learn from this. If they understood and took the side of the people more, they'd have more support from the people.</description>

			<description>I've thought more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613&quot;&gt;Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt;. It's amazing to hear the Beatles' perspective on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band&quot;&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;, I had never really thought how it was created, yet as a creative person myself, I’m often surprised and even offended that people don’t consider my point of view about the things I created. But at one time, Sgt Pepper was their thing, their secret. That's why the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/01.html#a155654&quot;&gt;final quote&lt;/a&gt; was so strong for me. &quot;You just wait,&quot; says McCartney -- echoing the feeling in 1967 when he knew he had something great, that was going to shake the world (as it did) and no one but he and a few others knew what it was. And the lesson of the Making of Sgt Pepper is that you and I will never know Sgt Pepper the way McCartney does. And one more thought, if only John Lennon could have been there, what would we have learned.</description>

			<title>The Making of Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wear a lot of hats. One of them is as a developer of scripting systems. I did a big one, Frontier, developed mostly in the late 80s and 90s. People seem to refer to it in the past tense, but I use Frontier as do others. it does things no other product can. It works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you may know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; is my new outliner-based scripting system for the web. It's still at least a few months from shipping, maybe more. But I'm making big decisions about how it works right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same way Frontier was designed around an &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/manual/objectDatabase&quot;&gt;object database&lt;/a&gt; and the Mac filesystem (and later Windows), Drummer works with public and private files on a server.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Frontier is a very broad and deep product, but it wasn't originally designed to be so big. The initial idea was to integrate it with the Finder, add a Scripts menu, and have it do things with the file system, and provide a way to program and connect scriptable apps. That was it. Simple.  I offered it to Apple. At the time, the early 90s, I knew all the decision-makers there, but I asked for too much money, they thought they could do it for less. So now I had tipped my hand, showed them my product, I figured to be competitive I'd have to add more stuff, which I did have available to me, since I always try out ideas that don't make it into the final product. The product got deeper, but it also got more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always wondered if it would have worked better if we had started with the small product. We could have shipped sooner. It would have been more approachable, more immediately useful. I think there is a good chance it would have worked better, but it didn't go that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This time, I'm trying to keep Drummer small, focus on a few innovations, and make a lot of the parts replaceable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am creating a product, but as with Radio UserLand, I also want to try to create a new use for our computers. With Radio it was blogging and RSS. This time it's a richer, better connected working environment on the net for power users and devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Power users is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user&quot;&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt; that has fallen into disuse, but they still exist, and you can design for them. Some users are very skilled with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation&quot;&gt;key innovation&lt;/a&gt; in Drummer is JavaScript without the callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I posted something about Drummer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1378357655874498561&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A proposal for newsletter tools</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we could help one of the newsletter distribution companies support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi.html&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt; or  equivalent.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to help design it, and would implement an editor as open source example code to help seed the market. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This would be an easy upgrade for the web, and good publicity for an innovative platform. Let's create a great new market for writing tools for the web. All it takes is one developer to get this going. It's something I would support with all the influence I have.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Writing tools for the web have been languishing. This is easy to fix, it just requires a little leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Pleading for Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I feel so sad about what's happening to Stallman.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;He's 68&lt;/a&gt;. I know what that's like, I'm 65. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has fixed his whole existence on a single idea that software should be free. Not free of charge, but free to use and to adapt. It's not that far from the kind of openness I believe in, that I believe is an ethical responsiblity for developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's useful to have a person like Stallman around, consistently marking an extreme view. It's like knowing there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backpacker.com/survival/how-to-navigate-by-the-stars/&quot;&gt;North Star&lt;/a&gt;, you may not be going to it, exactly, but knowing where it is makes it possible to go other places. And some people agree with Stallman in total, and to them he's their leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you step back and look at what's being said about him, basically people don't like things he says or the questions he asks. I read these things completely factoring out the non-factual stuff, where they tell you what his questions mean in some pure sense, when what they're really saying is what these questions mean to them. To a reasonable person imho they're just questions. Some people don't argue with questions, they just ask them. For the people who attack him, it's the opposite, their questions are accusations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Stallman is actually a naive innocent, almost child-like &lt;i&gt;harmless&lt;/i&gt; person. That's based on years of observing him, being connected through communities. Maybe he did terrible things I don't know about. But maybe you have too.  Is this how we're going to coexist? All of us worrying about who's going to make a credible case for destroying each others' lives? This isn't about Stallman, it's about your sense of justice and how far it extends, and how unfair that is for the rest of us who fear being judged by you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A quote from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/05/randombreathlessstuff.html#2&quot;&gt;1994 blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I try not to get offended on principle.&quot; I was quoting someone else, but I've remembered that. Just because I should be offended, doesn't mean, if I'm not actually offended, that I have to pretend I was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If you still think Stallman should be destroyed, go see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others&quot;&gt;Lives of Others&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful film about intellectuals in East Germany during the Cold War. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="He has fixed his whole existence on a single idea that software should be free. Not free of charge, but free to use and to adapt.

				<source:outline text="It's useful to have a person like Stallman around, consistently marking an extreme view. It's like knowing there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backpacker.com/survival/how-to-navigate-by-the-stars/&quot;&gt;North Star&lt;/a&gt;, you may not be going to it, exactly, but knowing where it is makes it possible to go other places.

				<source:outline text="Now, if you step back and look at what's being said about him, basically people don't like things he says or the questions he asks. I read these things completely factoring out the non-factual stuff, where they tell you what his questions mean in some pure sense, when what they're really saying is what these questions mean to them. To a reasonable person imho they're just questions. Some people don't argue with questions, they just ask them. For the people who attack him, it's the opposite, their questions are accusations." created="Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:57:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/02/145549.html?title=pleadingForStallman#a145743"/>
				<source:outline text="I think Stallman is actually a naive innocent, almost child-like &lt;i&gt;harmless&lt;/i&gt; person. That's based on years of observing him, being connected through communities. Maybe he did terrible things I don't know about. But maybe you have too.  Is this how we're going to coexist? All of us worrying about who's going to make a credible case for destroying each others' lives? This isn't about Stallman, it's about your sense of justice and how far it extends, and how unfair that is for the rest of us who fear being judged by you." created="Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:59:38 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/02/145549.html?title=pleadingForStallman#a145938"/>

			<description>The best part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613&quot;&gt;The Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt; is the very last line, with Paul McCartney. &quot;The musical papers which you used to read, started to slag us off because we hadn't done anything, because it took five months to record. And I remember with great glee seeing in one of the papers 'ohh the Beatles have dried up, there's nothing going on, they've been in the studio, can't think, what are they doing. And I was sort of sitting rubbing my hands just saying Oh you just wait.&quot;</description>

			<description>A famous John Lennon quote. He was asked if Ringo was the best drummer he knew. “Ringo wasn’t the best drummer in the world,&quot; Lennon is said to have said. &quot;Let’s face it, he wasn’t even the best drummer in The Beatles.” Ringo complains about that in the video. He says all the other Beatles wish they were drummers. I think we were having our legs pulled.</description>
