			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; testing is going well, still more features in development, but it is pretty stable. So I'm looking for more people to join the test group. I'm looking for people with either blogging experience or scripting experience, best if you have both, and even better if you've done development in Frontier. Think of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; as the continuation of the blogging work we were doing at &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/span&gt; before we took the turn toward &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Radio&lt;/span&gt;. Drummer is unabashedly about the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/span&gt;. It's the most fluid way to write, and I want to hook it up to as many rendering engines as possible, using open protocols, as possible. I see outlines as the center of the writer's universe, but you already knew that if you read my blog. Send an email or DM on Twitter if you're interested. Not guaranteeing access, and not saying when. We're still a ways from opening up to the public.</description>

			<description>I'm reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)&quot;&gt;Player Piano&lt;/a&gt;, Kurt Vonnegut's first novel. I probably read it before, but didn't remember. It's a slog unlike later Vonnegut novels. This was Vonnegut before he was Vonnegut. His writing is very relaxed, American, and irreverent. And very much his. If he wants to go to some weird place in his story-telling he just goes there. I think the peak of this was Breakfast of Champions which was about a character he invented (of course all fiction is) but he writes about &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; he invented him, and why. It's hard to explain. But in Player Piano, he's sticking to the basics of novel-writing. Only hints of a Vonnegutisms to come in later writing.  It's dull and my mind wanders while reading it. I guess that's the thing about later Vonnegut writing. He gets your full attention while you're reading. More than other writers.</description>

			<description>As a lifetime &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Mets&lt;/span&gt; fan, I'm glad the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-mets-celebrate-his-thumbs-down-fans-20210829-rjt54obqunbrjma3w33557cevm-story.html&quot;&gt;players pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that other fans are being assholes. I'm glad because I want to let the players know that I used to mow Mets' players lawns in the 60s. I went to games with my parents, uncle, grandfather, brother. We had a slogan &quot;Shea Stadium Rules&quot; which meant that even if we had our differences underneath it all we're still rooting for the Mets. So-called &quot;fans&quot; who dis the team when they lose really are Yankees fans and they should just go to the Bronx and shut the fuck up. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy&quot;&gt;Mets philosophy&lt;/a&gt; stands, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html&quot;&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt; are the Mets, win or lose or whatever.</description>

			<title>Oh really?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I listen to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/podcasts/the-daily/afghanistan-withdrawal-us-taliban.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; I often want to say &quot;no it doesn't work the way you say it does.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, they said today that the age of American solving problems by going to war is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh really? Yeah, we thought that too after Vietnam. Lotsa luck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The interviewer asked the reporter what we would do if there was a future terrorism attack inside Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reporter began &quot;Sadly...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh really? Their new government is, as far as we know, a terrorist organization itself. So it seems a terrorist attack against them is something we'd support, not want to prevent. It certainly isn't our job to save them from terrorism.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, all the time the reporters are fussing about Afghanistan, and they are doing a lot of that these days after years of completely ignoring it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Haiti_earthquake&quot;&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; is in a world of hurt. Maybe we should save some of our sympathy and good deeds for them?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Debuggers aren't only for debugging, they're also programmer's way of looking inside the body of the software. We can stop the heart beat and look anywhere we want. We can put our attention in any organ we want. Or more than one at a time. It's how you can watch the organism doing its work, if you forget how it works because you wrote it a long time ago, or if someone else wrote it. If you aren't using a debugger in all aspects of your programming work you're limiting the amount of complexity you can deal with in your code.</description>

			<title>A place for urgent news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1431959907927040001&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that about collaboration in the news industry to help disseminate critical information. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;An idea for the news industry to collaborate on. Sometimes a news org takes down the paywall on a story because it's important that everyone see it. Make an RSS feed that combines all such stories across all pubs. Make spreading the news even more efficient.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A simple idea, really -- not much tech, and news orgs are already doing it. The post got a lot of traction on Twitter, and favorable notice from a fair number of people &lt;i&gt;inside news orgs, &lt;/i&gt;people who would be critical to making this idea a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what's needed, technically, beyond what's already there? Probably just this -- a way to tell, in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed, that an item is outside the paywall.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How to do that?

			<description>As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/28.html#a150550&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I really liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chair_(2021_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Chair&lt;/a&gt;, but there was something in the story I wish they had explored. Spoilers follow. One of the faculty, a young white male superstar, is accused of being a Nazi by students. They have demonstrations. Make demands. The faculty freezes. He tries to respond, his colleagues tell him this never works, when men try to defend themselves, it only makes it worse. He's seen as not contrite. We see the issue only from the faculty standpoint, all we hear from students are slogans and soundbites. We do hear from one student who will be hurt by the takedown. We understand from the start that the professor is not a Nazi. As I watched the confrontation, I wondered if the individual students knew they're wrong. Why was this not explored? Do any of the students argue that they should help the professor instead of attacking? (He's a sympathetic character, his wife died recently.) I know this is TV and they're subject to the same dishonesty they're portraying (Netflix defends Nazis). As I said yesterday, the acting is great, the characters are appealing, it's a page-turner of a binge-watch. But with one small exception, the students are portrayed as flat angry unreasonable monsters. They can't be that single-minded, unconflicted, thoughtless. It left me feeling dissatisfied. Now that I've written it up, I can move on. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Over the past couple of days I binged season 1 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chair_(2021_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Chair&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. I liked it. It's quick, only about three hours. It's a Sorkin-like show, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-west-wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-newsroom&quot;&gt;The Newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, fast dialog. Fun and really pulls on the heartstrings. There's cute smart little girl, and a timely plot of a second-tier Ivy League school that reminded me that campuses can be interesting places to hang out. I gave it a 4 of 5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-chair-2021&quot;&gt;on BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Twitter says no soup for you!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Still the most annoying thing is when you switch into Twitter you get about 1/2 second to scan what's there, enough time for pictures to register, and boom it refreshes with new content. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This also has another painful side-effect, if you're watching a video, it'll just refresh in the middle of it. I was intently listening to the chairman of the Fed the other day, and then part of a Grateful Dead concert, when Twitter decided enough! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/28/weReserveTheRightToRefuseServiceToAnyone.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSTiKHOFEI&quot;&gt;No soup for you&lt;/a&gt;!  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a CNN commercial where a white guy in a suit, probably an actor, is talking to the camera. He says (paraphrasing): &quot;The NRA is not going away. Every American should have a gun.&quot; I wanted to ask if he felt that every Black man should have a gun, or just Whites. What about religion? Should Jews and Muslims have guns too? Should only rich people have guns, or should poor people have them too? If a Black man came to your all-White neighborhood would you like to see him with a gun? Would you call the cops if a Black man came into a convenience store with a gun? I suspect he was thinking, when he said every American should have a gun, of Americans like himself.</description>

			<title>API for newsletter publishing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I keep beating &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/24.html#a211637&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/02/153208.html?title=aProposalForNewsletterTools&quot;&gt;drum&lt;/a&gt;, because it's important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thej/status/1431230072103440389&quot;&gt;Thejesh posted&lt;/a&gt; a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.buttondown.email/v1/schema&quot;&gt;Buttondown's API&lt;/a&gt;. I like it -- it's really simple. But it could be even simpler! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First a summary of why this is important. I want to use my own editor to write a newsletter and publish it through a commercial newsletter service. I don't want to use their editor. Why? Because as a writer, I have the best editor for me. And I don't like being a copy-paste-bot. My writing has too many ways to get out to make it possible to do that for all of them. And I want someone to go first, to make it easy to publish without forcing me to be creative in their world, with their inadequate (for me) editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So to further the discussion -- here's how I would do the API .&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The user, through the app's user interface, enters the URL of an RSS feed. That interaction is of course authenticated.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When a new item appears in the feed, publish it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For extra credit, accept a simple unauthenticed ping message with the username, which tells your server to check the feed. That way your server doesn't have to check as often.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Voila, super simple API.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's the thing about the Taliban and ISIS -- they're competing for the same soldiers, and as long as ISIS is attacking and hurting the US, they're going to recruit more soldiers, primarily from the Taliban. So the Taliban &quot;controls&quot; Afghanistan in a temporary way. They're going to be fighting other radicals for a long time to come.</description>

This is wrong. He's doing the job we hired him to do. Our mistake is we give up our power and responsibility and look to a parent figure to take care of us. But that's not how America works. The president isn't all-powerful, isn't a god, or even god-like. The president is a human being. We should judge the president on their honor and intelligence, and ability to listen, and we should take responsibility for &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; power.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember a couple of years ago people were confidently saying that by now the streets would be full of autonomous cars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They snickered when people like me who have spent a life programming thought that was a pretty shitty idea. Who would even want to go out for a walk with driverless cars all over the place, subject to programmers' mistakes, or the callous deprecations of platform vendors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagined a car plowing into a crowd and killing twenty innocent people because some idiot at Apple decided to change the order the params of an API because they felt like it, and the car software dev missed the notice and didn't update the car's OS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oh sure I want software doing all the driving after less than two years of a burn in. Yeah that makes all the sense in the world. (Sorry for the sarcasm.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Graduation day, 1976</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here I am, in 1976, holding a college diploma. My parents, grandmother and brother came down to New Orleans for the occasion. They were happy because no one expected me to get a college degree. This came from my father's photo scrapbook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Yes, I am. I'll keep beating the drum. I won't stop. That's how I am until I get what I want. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>When will someone launch a newsletter service that lets you use whatever editor you like. I predict that I will support that product in the new editor I'm working on. I don't want to do a newsletter service myself. Let's get something fun started.</description>

			<description>What makes a bug report good? It makes it easy for the dev to reproduce the problem. I have to see it myself to understand what the problem is. Your theory on what the problem is, or judgment on whether you followed the instructions is secondary.</description>

			<description>Unfortunately journalists don't stand for re-election. They are not term-limited. There is no journalism for journalism. Our opinions are not sought. But if we ever do get a chance to vote one of them out in some significant way, I bet a lot of people will line up to do it. I know I will. And I'm not talking about the people on Fox.</description>

			<description>I'd say &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; didn't work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/23/bingeworthyScreen.png&quot;&gt;Nice software&lt;/a&gt;, but the goal was to keep an easy to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;public list&lt;/a&gt; of shows I recommend, and those that my friends recommend. A couple of weeks ago I discovered, entirely on my own, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/a&gt;. I loved it from the first scene in the first epsiode. I started telling everyone I know how great it is, and with few exceptions they said &quot;old news Dave.&quot; They loved the show since it started in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_episodes#Season_1_(2013%E2%80%9314)&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;. Why did I struggle for years to find something great to watch when Rick and Morty was out there. I'm sure there are a dozen other delicious shows I don't know about, and it's only getting worse. What is the answer? It seems like a simple problem to solve, yet it evades an answer.</description>

			<description>They've had the same tired old guests on the cable news shows for years. They always say the same things. How is it that people don't just change channels and tune into 30-year-old Law &amp; Order reruns instead. I've been enjoying watching the reruns for the 15th time. Compared to the news they seem fresh and strangely relevant.</description>

			<description>When you check into Twitter after being gone for a while, you see, for an instant, some posts, not sure when they're from, but they might be appealing, but too bad, they disappear just after your mind registers that they're there. Happens regularly.</description>
