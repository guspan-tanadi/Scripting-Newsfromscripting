			<description>I‚Äôve always thought the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=leftist&quot;&gt;leftist&lt;/a&gt; was silly and meaningless and made the people using it seem like idiots. People like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannity&quot;&gt;Hannity&lt;/a&gt; who is a known idiot. Anyway, I‚Äôve decided to change it to ‚ÄúLeft Tits.‚Äù  And Hannity is a ‚ÄúRight Tit.‚Äù  God gave us two tits.  Thank you.</description>

			<title>What about unemployment?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough coverage is that the stock market is back to where it was before the pandemic.   How to interpret this? What message is it sending?  Get ready, because this is harsh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're unemployed, it says this. The stock market doesn't need you. Literally, that is its message customized for the unemployed. The market doesn't consider Depression-level unemployment to be a problem for the companies it values.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about bad apples?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We could probably get by with a lot fewer police, something the police might not want to ignore. When they beat up citizens they are not only hurting the citizens, they're burning our money. We are literally paying them to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we can't find the bad apples, we could just start firing  police randomly. Maybe at that point, they'll see the value in helping find, remove and prosecute the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Simplicity is a virtue</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_marcba/status/1268092311587651584&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The value of having a standard language is simplicity for newbies. But it takes discipline to remove barriers, instead developers add them. Eventually (maybe now) the weight of the totality will force the whole thing to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW there are many other virtues of simplicity, not just limiting barriers for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a familiar pattern. When I first got into software, I learned C on Unix. Simplicity. Heavily factored. Less is more. Then I looked at the jobs available in the real world, and they had a stack like the one in the cartoon. I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal&lt;/a&gt; on the Apple II instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because on the Apple II, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Woz&lt;/a&gt; machine, less is more. To display a character just write it to a location in the machine's memory. Again, a fresh slate.   How many fresh slates would it take to get to networked apps? Lots. How many were actually needed if we had discipline?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One. But you have to have a culture where we only add features if we're adding functionality. I have a motto for this.  &quot;Two ways of doing something is worse than one, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had to say this many times over the decades of my career, as other programmers added complexity to an already-too-complex system.  JavaScript *was* a good idea. Now it is a huge hairball because programmers keep wanting to solve the same problems over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maddow had a good point last night. If militia-like police are deployed by the government, without any identification, what's to stop civilians masquerading as police to start acting like government police? Maybe that's the point, if what you want is civil war.</description>

			<description>Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1268716877355810818&quot;&gt;Buffalo police shove&lt;/a&gt; the tall 75-year-old man to the ground yesterday I was struck by two things.  1. If you put people with all the flaws of normal people in uniforms like that they're going to act like pigs. 2. Seeing an old white dude be almost killed that way was jarring, as an old white dude myself.</description>

			<description>BTW in the video of the Buffalo police almost killing a 75-year-old man, what is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/05/copWithHugeLauncherOfSomeKind.png&quot;&gt;this police person&lt;/a&gt; carrying? Looks like a machine gun.</description>

			<title>Listen to the critics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Alan Kay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now#:~:text=Jobs%20always%20admired%20Kay%2C%20who,the%20Dynabook%20built%20in%20Cupertino.&quot;&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt; the Macintosh is the first computer worth criticizing. Really eloquent, makes-you-stop-and-think type quote. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was raised by parents who reacted as if criticism was an attack. If you don't deflect it, you will be hurt. They taught me that. I learned later in life that listening to criticism is the key to success. Alan Kay revealed a truth. We criticize something because we want it to be better. We are invested in it being better. Listen because you want to learn how to be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software, we call such critiques &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/06/30/writingGoodBugReports.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;.  Some problems only happen on the users' machines. Or you may have learned to not do something that they do because they never learned not to do it. Or they use features in a way you would never think to, that seem natural to them. Or they don't read the docs (and btw, neither do you). People see facets of your creation that you can't see because your point of view is different from theirs. If you want to improve, if you want to see things that are possible that are invisible to you, you must pay attention to criticism and brush aside the fear it invokes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT and criticism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In all mess around the Cotton op-ed -- to me, a lifetime reader, subscriber and former partner of the NY Times, someone with a complicated long-term relationship, the most important flaw in the pub that is its unwillingness to listen to criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So there's a huge hole in the perception of the NY Times of the world it is contained in, the point of view of their community. What a loss, for all of us. We are smart, educated, thoughtful people. We, collectively, know and see far more than the people they employ. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been the opportunity of blogging and news -- a way to tap the minds of the world in a way that supports journalism. An opportunity news people gave up on before they even understood that the net gave it a new life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need journalism to be much smarter than it is. We know a free source of smarts. Use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Also we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;more money for you&lt;/a&gt; if you can listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I dreamed last night I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow&quot;&gt;John Perry Barlow&lt;/a&gt; riding a bike. We talked. I said wow I'm so surprised to see you. I told him to stay here and not try to find out what's going on in the world. I don't know why I said that, but it seemed real. He's been gone for a couple of years now.</description>

			<description>According to my Twitter timeline NYPD cops went &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshfoxfilm/status/1268366550475603969&quot;&gt;crazy&lt;/a&gt; last night. I grew up there, and as a kid I crossed the NYPD a number of times. They were always bastards, but they never caught me, though they came close. So what were they doing last night? It seems they were trying to prove that they don't want to hear about Black Lives Matter. Or the First Amendment. Or Protect and Serve. Or any of that nonsense. This is their city, they seem to be saying. And fuck you. I can understand that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/08/23.html#a193830&quot;&gt;fuck you&lt;/a&gt; is like &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;top of the day to you&quot; in NYese. But they were really fucking people up. Stealing stuff and assaulting people. So this wasn't the loving and respectful form of fuck you. This was the &quot;I'm going to fuck you up&quot; version of fuck you.</description>

			<description>I use my iPhone when I ride my bike, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://abvio.com/cyclemeter&quot;&gt;Cyclemeter&lt;/a&gt; and to play a podcast, so it‚Äôs not easily available to take pictures. I want a relatively inexpensive phone mainly to use as a camera. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be such a thing. I considered getting a regular camera, btw -- but it isn't what I want. I want a small, cheap phone with a decent camera. Update: Michael Lougee suggested an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/?afid=p238%7CsOVs1i18h-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_427418702531_pgrid_80259604514_&amp;cid=aos-us-kwgo-ipod--slid---product-&quot;&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>There shouldn‚Äôt be a season for causes. So right now anything other than #blm is off-topic. Until it's knocked off the top rung by a mass killing. Or a #metoo scandal. A climate crisis catastrophe. Or something Trump said (actually that doesn't seem to work anymore, thankfully). The virus is going to break that, because it's not going away, and it kills and disables more people, every day, than anything we've seen, ever. The suffering it causes is off the scale. But we should be able to see the thread that connects all these things. A lack of collective consciousness. An unwillingness to listen. We don't think, we only feel and feelings are easily manipulated.</description>

			<title>Trump in charge! So there!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The lights were out in the White House while the president hunkered in the bunker freaked out and humiliated. His enemy comes into focus, it's the people out there, complaining, again, like everyone else. They can't see how smart he is. He's got to do something about this. His speech on Saturday welcoming a new wave of space exploration didn't replace the protests as the top story. Alone in the dark White House, ignored, he hatched a plan to get the spotlight back on him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of his aides had discovered that he could order the military into DC, due to a loophole in some law, so he was going to use that to bust out of the bunker, and get back in charge. I'll show him (er them) he said to himself (the &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; he was referring to was his long-dead father). I'll bring in the military and have them do something spectacular, even better than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/blue-angels-thunderbirds-trnd/index.html&quot;&gt;Blue Angels&lt;/a&gt; flying over the cities to get all their attention (another of his spectacular plans that didn't win him the adulation he feels he deserves). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Timed to perfectly coincide with his speech, like the music playing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30QzJKCUekQ&quot;&gt;Apocyalypse Now&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pByJkuv0q3Y&quot;&gt;Rocky&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg6MqWYyts0&quot;&gt;Patton&lt;/a&gt;, the soldiers, on horseback, zoom in and clear the park for Trump's dramatic escape from the bunker! Super Trump. Accompanied by his sidekicks, The Law (Barr), The Gun (Esper) and The Troop (the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). Wonder Woman, of course, and the The Boy Wonder (Ivanka and Jared). Should we bring the dogs? Nahh that's too much he thought to himself but accidentally said out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He spent two full days planning it out, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlV3oQ3pLA0&quot;&gt;Captain Queeg&lt;/a&gt; and the strawberries. He would prove conclusively he was really in charge, even if his father didn't think he was good for anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;We have to stop being so modal about the big social issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be fighting to stop mass killings with guns -- all the time -- not just after a mass killing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with #blm and #metoo and fighting against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Asians are blamed for the virus, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Letting the news cycle control our lives is ceding too much power to the media corporations, platforms, political parties.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can see the wedges the Repubs create to try to separate us, but we don't see the wedges we put between ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can mourn a black man killed by a cop at the same time we mourn a country music fan killed by a shooter in Las Vegas or a school teacher killed in Connecticut. And we can stand between a mob and Asian-American doctors trying to save us from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Warren's candidacy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;BTW, after Elizabeth Warren pulled out, we could have had a  discussion about why her candidacy failed, but every time I tried to speak, I was told I couldn't understand because I am not a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Too bad, but 1/2 the electorate is male, and if you want to win, you'll need a lot of male votes. It's the same old shit, drive a wedge in the electorate, &lt;i&gt;your own electorate,&lt;/i&gt; as a supposed winning strategy? It's nuts to think that could work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Warren appealed to imho the worst in women, based on the belief that men should shut up and do what we say. Not unlike the flavor of the #blm discussion, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The women wanted some uninterrupted time to wallow about how fucked up the world is and how women would never gain full equality. There will never be a woman president, they explained, because Warren was the best, and she didn't get the nomination. But Warren wasn't the best, and that was not the message of the Warren failure. They didn't want to hear it, and some of them, people I (used to) respect were incredibly abusive about it. These people don't want to win, they want pity. They were pretty clear about it. But I don't offer my pity in situations like this, because I don't accept the premise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Warren wasn't a good-enough candidate. We aren't doomed to never having a woman president. But it isn't going to be Warren, until she's ready to be president for everyone. Obama did that, he didn't try to be the president for blacks, though blacks were rightfully proud, as I was, that our country had finally broken through on race, or so it seemed at the time. I will cry the day a woman is elected president, as I cried the day Obama won. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I supported the hell out of HRC, and at first supported Warren, until she started dropping in nasty bits about men into her speeches. At that point I knew if she got the nomination, she'd never get enough votes from men to win. She would've gotten my vote, but I wouldn't have liked doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet my women friends in politics still don't see the wedge they're putting in the electorate, and possibly haven't considered the idea for next time there's a woman candidate with something to offer. Listen when a friend says you've made a mistake. You have to do it to win. If you won't do it, don't blame the world, take the blame yourself because you don't deserve to win.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I make a point of RTing people who are:  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Smart.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Creative.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Have no stake in returning to how things were before Trump, Barr, Covid-19. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people who do have a stake fill the pipe with punditry that confirms their desire to return to the G.O.D's. *&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who are unemployed and either insolvent, approaching insolvency, or who have &quot;essential&quot; jobs, have every right to tear down the system because it has written them off as expendable. If the system had no use for me, and I had the strength to tear it down, I would too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why this struggle is no longer just about race. Which is good for blacks, in a perverse way, because now a lot more people are in the same boat, with lives that don't matter. And given the Repubs' unwillingness to fund local government, that includes cops too, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing -- for a long time I've felt we needed to have a constant citizen's presence on the streets in DC. I had given up on the idea once Covid-19 came along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But guess what -- &lt;i&gt;it happened anyway.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They turned the lights off in the White House and Trump went to the bunker. He's just Captain Queeg, Old Yellow Stain himself, scared of the people he was elected to (in his mind) rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Last night. The White House with the lights turned off.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how well Mitch McConnell slept last night. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;During Vietnam we used to chant &quot;Bring the war home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well it's happening again. When the people of government feel the fear we feel, then you've set up inevitable change, right now, in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1267483078018109447&quot;&gt;Poll&lt;/a&gt;: Will Trump resign today, tomorrow or next week?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If he had a &lt;i&gt;tiny&lt;/i&gt; bit more imagination he could have seen CV-19 as the biggest opportunity any president ever had. He wouldn't have had to have developed any empathy, just pure greed. Imagine how dependent we would be if he had saved our lives. He'd win in a landslide.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A police car burns last night in NY.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;*good old days&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
