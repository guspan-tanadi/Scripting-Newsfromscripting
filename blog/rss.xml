This one works with any Mastodon server. Requires some technical competence, but not much. The idea is to get the example code out there, for reading feeds easily and posting to Mastodon, again easily. I want feeds to melt into the fediverse, forming sort of a feediverse, which is maybe just a little bit bigger. I am so on board with decentralizing everything we do. My pitch for user-run servers goes back to the beginning of the web. Now having knocked down one of the biggest silos, all of a sudden lots of blue sky! Let's not give up our freedom this time. Anyway watch for a release later today or tomorrow.</description>

			<description>As you may recall, I had the lens in my right eye replaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/11/28.html&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Simple outpatient deal. The result is amazing. Everything is so sharp and clear, colors so vivid. I had been living in a visually foggy and blasé world, now it’s the other extreme, a total acid trip.</description>

			<title>Using Twitter for identity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hear every day that people don't like that &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; uses Twitter for identity. Some comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Using Twitter for identity, at this time, gives Twitter nothing other than the fact that you logged into my app, data which is already publicly &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml#1663337058000&quot;&gt;accessible&lt;/a&gt;. In return they give me a unique name for you, so your data on my server doesn't overwrite someone else's data. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Changing the identity system would take a lot of time, time that isn't going into adding features, interop and fixing bugs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've had lots of experience being misdirected by the wants of non-users. If only I'd do this then I'd reap the benefit of their usage. But usually that doesn't materialize. Making new features for people who love my product, and leading other developers, is a much better use of my time. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At some point I hope to offer choice, for reasons that clearly help the product. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fixed a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; FeedLand bug</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It happened for newly logged-in users at startup, as FeedLand loads for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first thing the app does is load the user's &lt;i&gt;appPrefs.json&lt;/i&gt; file -- it fails, of course -- it hasn't been created yet. It's not an error, although in the JavaScript console it looks like one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The code as originally written allows for this, but I added something on Nov 8, as part of the &lt;i&gt;Your Feed&lt;/i&gt; feature, code that copies something from the place that doesn't exist yet to a place that does, without checking. Boom. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This meant that &lt;i&gt;the rest of the startup code didn't run.&lt;/i&gt; The app is sitting there waiting for the first-time user to do something. Everything is blank, none of the commands work, and yet two of them persevered, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; reported the problem. That in itself is kind of a miracle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The second &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/132#issuecomment-1331894225&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; provided a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/30/jsConsoleScreenShot.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the JavaScript console, which pointed me to the problem, almost by accident -- he didn't realize that was the problem, because there were two errors reported before it (as noted above those aren't real errors). If the screen shot had been slightly shorter, I would've been pulling my hair out looking for a needle in the haystack. Instead it pointed exactly to the problem, the code had a comment providing the date it was introduced (Nov 8), and sure enough the first report came after that change. We had tested this functionality at least a dozen times before Nov 8 without problems, so the first time I wrote it off as cosmic rays. Not a good call Dave, in retrospect. A very bad call actually.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, since the problem cures itself as soon as they get a good logon, it simply wasn't repeatable. But this time, having a theory about where the error was, and I had a virgin Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/friendsofdave&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; ready for the test, one that had never been used with FeedLand -- I logged in and it was fixed, which I could see as I stepped through the code in the debugger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But -- I should have tried to repeat it after the first report. But I guess I didn't want to believe the problem was as bad as it was, and I didn't feel like searching for the needle. However if I had done it, presumably I would have looked in the JavaScript console and seen what the problem was and a few hundred more people would have had a good initial experience with FeedLand, instead of the really awful one they actually had. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Many apologies to the people who endured this, it is so freaking embarrassing. I am sorry this happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy. I have to do better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I learned how to use the web from reporters in 1994. I volunteered to run the SF newspaper strike website, and they were shooting me articles from all over the country, in HTML, and telling me how they wanted them published. Most important -- preserve the links. It was an incredible time of learning and fun and working together. That's when I'm happy, making software for people who have a vision.</description>

			<title>Twitter as a backup</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A good reason to keep a Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon's scaling is an unknown at this point. And it's growing very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Had this thought just now when I couldn't get through to either of the instances I frequent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least think of Twitter as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Still diggin!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The thing I like about the end of 2022 in this part of the internet. My toys are very much on-topic now, after many years of being aggressively ignored by those in-the-know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I kept wanting to say this. I've been counted out many times only to rise again. Sometimes even I believe that bullshit. I'll keep digging until I can't dig no mo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Was it worth it? Well I had a good all-afternoon nap, so that was pretty good. Now my vision sucks in a new way, but the how-to guide says it'll clear up in a day or two, at most a week. At times the colors are intense, like I imagine an acid trip to be, and some light reflects off objects like a Fourth of July sparkler. I think this is just foreign material being assimilated into human material. Was it worth it? Hmmm. I'll let you know. But I'm pretty sure it was. Your faithful correspondent -- Davey.</description>

			<description>I was looking for links to prior eye surgeries, on the left eye. Not a good story. I started with decent vision, and a left-eye floater freaked me out. An eye surgeon said they could get rid of it, they did, but there was a new dead spot in the middle of my left eye. This surgery, in 2007, has given me crappy vision since then. Finally I had to get the lens in my right eye replaced, that's what was done today. After this, when the dust settles, my vision should be closer to what it was after the first surgery. The lesson: when a doctor says they can fix a condition, find out in advance if the cure is worse. A floater, I learned later, is harmless. Your brain gets used to and and factors it out, you stop seeing the floater after a while. The best thing to do is wait it out. Bigger lesson: if you can avoid surgery, avoid it.</description>

I wrote posts of all lengths, some with titles, on their own pages, and others just a sentence or two or a paragraph, many on the same page. They used to coexist in one flow, and it was great! All of a sudden there was a fork, on one side you had to use Twitter and the other side you could use blogging software, on one side you were locked in and in the other you had choice. We've been suffering this division since 2006 or so. But we're in a really good place now because we could rejoin the two flows, and let &lt;i&gt;writers&lt;/i&gt; decide how much writing each idea deserves, not a random limit imposed years ago without any clear idea of why. Right now please everyone think about what the world would be like if we had blogs and tweets flowing through one pipe. All kinds of new ways of visualizing flows will develop, the boundaries will melt. You can have it all, I promise, as a software developer. As a writer, we'll learn how to play with length without having to edit to fit an engineer's idea of how writing works. It's as if a geek said to a painter you can only create on a 140 pixel canvas. You could make good art that way, but think of all the art you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; make. I promise, you will be inspired by the new kinds of software we make. Most people using computers today have never been around for a blue-sky boom, where all the rules that were holding us back are gone in an instant. We are there right now folks, let's make the most of the moment.</description>

			<description>Some Mastodon posts are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/27/mastopost.png&quot;&gt;gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;. And they're going to look even better when Masto has Markdown support. The version I'm testing has Markdown now (also a 10000 character limit btw). Think of how long it took for Twitter to not do Markdown in tweets. And we've got users to play with. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Users and developers party together.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Where we're headed is a world where it doesn't matter where you write, you can use the tools you love, and it doesn't matter where you read, again what you love, in the moment is what you will use. Computers used to be like this. In the 80s you could use any writing tool you wanted and any printer. There was no concept of a writing tool that was bound to a printer. We're very close to that now, closer than we've been in a decade. I am determined that we do not pass up this opportunity. Seize the moment.</description>

			<title>To MastoDevs re RSS + Markdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I posted this on one of the discussion boards for Mastodon devs, but it may not have been the right place. So I'll try here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm the author of the RSS 2.0 spec, and actively working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and hooking it up to Mastodon. Very excited about what we're building and how well it works with MD.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon's RSS feed is also great. Items that don't have titles don't have titles in the feed. Stick to your guns on that, we have to get the feed readers to stop calling title-less items errors. They are totally valid RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Love the Markdown support, I've been advocating for it. And it's fully supported in both directions in FeedLand. We do it the same way you do. Render the Markdown in the description element and in the HTML rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing I'd like to see you do here -- include the Markdown source in the item using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;&lt;source:markdown&gt;&lt;/a&gt; element. That's how we do it and others are as well. As far as I know we're the only ones doing this, so it's possible at this point to get everyone swinging the same way, for interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For a model see how I do it in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;FeedLand feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/27/screenRssFeedMarkdown.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a demo item with styled text, a link and a list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if there are any questions and congrats on a phenomenal product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I have a whole language already designed to go with that name. Mastodoctor, for example. For a while we were all adding &quot;bunny&quot; to our names, so I became Mastobunny and then Mastobun for short. Most of these names are available, so I'm tempted, but so far I've resisted. I have bought a couple though. Like most domain names I buy, I'll probably never use them. But it's nice they're there. I keep hoping someday to come up with a service that deserves the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://ou.rs/&quot;&gt;ou.rs&lt;/a&gt; which I've been renewing for many years.</description>

			<description>I had a great talk with Doc Searls yesterday. They're always expressive and irreverant. We had fun at the expense of New Jersey, Kevin Durant, The Nets and of course the current mess at Twitter. I keep thinking we should do a podcast. If there was anyone in the world I want to do one with it would be Papa Doc.</description>

			<title>Mastodon nomenclature?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bullmancuso.com/&quot;&gt;bullmancuso.com&lt;/a&gt; is an imaginary friend with a personal home page. This is a well understood concept. It could be a blog, or an about page, a resume. A web page that is associated with a person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There could be subdomains like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;ftp.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;smtp.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;news.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If he set up a Mastodon server, what should it be called?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;social.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;masto.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;microblogs.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;friends.bullmancuso.com&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or is the Mastodon server so important that it should take the top spot, with just the naked domain. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're also going to need domains that serve as API glue, just like we have for Twitter. What should those be called? That's a less important question because the only places such a domain would appear is in an app that interfaces with Mastodon servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/241&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have very vague but strong memories of the JFK assassination. I was 8, in second grade, my teacher, Miss Ruffino, rushed out of the classroom in tears, no idea why. My mom picked me up to walk me home, we lived a couple of blocks from the school, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7548979,-73.8742838,3a,75y,1.49h,103.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stH-FAYMIFIYDPVFnFvREhg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DtH-FAYMIFIYDPVFnFvREhg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D46.733856%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;PS 149 Queens&lt;/a&gt;. I understood Kennedy was President, but he was the only president I had known. The idea of someone other than Kennedy being president didn’t make any sense. I asked my mom, what now. Someone named Johnson would be president. It didn’t make any sense to me. Kennedy was president.</description>

			<description>To &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; users. If Twitter turned us off for some reason you’d still be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/11/17/122301.html&quot;&gt;read your news&lt;/a&gt; while we worked around the outage. But so far there have been no problems that I’m aware of, and rushing to change tested software is a sure way to break things. That said we're making good progress on hooking up to Mastodon. Planning to show off a new way to do news products with FeedLand, and I want to write Mastodon threads in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. Those will be the first steps. ☘️</description>
