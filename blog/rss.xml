			<description>Another problem with people getting upset when something they depend on on the internet goes away, for whatever reason, is that it's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; going to go away, probably sooner than you expect. If you want things to be long-lived, then we need to make some major changes. And no one, absolutely no one, is working on making a long-lived net.</description>

			<title>RSS-spect</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping that people would see &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; as a key to decentralization, but it's hard to draw the picture because people have the wrong idea about RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a similar problem explaining why a Pub-sub company should support RSS without thinking of it as a &quot;third party opportunity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pub-sub could use a &quot;really simple&quot; interface. You could send any kind of message with RSS, and the knowledge of how to find the new stuff in a feed is totally established in developer-land.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that's what the Pub-sub people wanted. Ideas for new simple APIs. They look down on RSS as beneath them. I've seen &quot;serious&quot; devs do that over and over and it's a mistake. Simple is better, not trivial. Microsoft, for example, had something &quot;much better&quot; than RSS coming in the late 90s. Eventually they did get on board with RSS, to their credit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the answer is so obvious you can't even see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Twitter API still works. If that changes I'll let you know. Yes, they shut down the clients, but the people who make the clients should have known that was coming. It happened before. Every corporate platform vendor will defend their cash flow. If you bet otherwise, you're probably going to lose. If you don't like it, develop for an open platform or stay out of the platform vendor's path.</description>

			<description>I went to Davos in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2000&lt;/a&gt;, just once, with a white badge (access to everything). Not as a journalist. I was a representative of the web, which was the hot thing at the time. Not sure what other people were doing but I was a celebrity and enjoyed all the attention.</description>

			<description>After Davos, I went to Amsterdam, to write and enjoy the local herb. Back then it was the only place in the west where you could buy and consume the weed openly and semi-legally. Scroll to the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/02.html&quot;&gt;February archive page&lt;/a&gt; for pictures from Davos and Amsterdam, as well as a few pieces with closing thoughts about my experience at Davos. This is one of the advantages of blogging and keeping relatively decent archives. You get to relive experiences like this.</description>

			<description>I let a domain, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodestorage.io/&quot;&gt;nodestorage.io&lt;/a&gt;, lapse. That's why we're seeing problems on scripting.com. One of the files we include is from api.nodestorage.io. I renewed the domain, so the outage should hopefully clear soon.</description>

			<description>We (Adam Curry and myself) approached the Zune people at Microsoft in 2004 to ask to work with us to make a perfect podcast listening and recording device. Basically the PC of podcasting. I wanted to work with them, lived in Seattle at the time, was only working on podcasting at the time. Still to this day such a product does not exist.</description>

			<title>Twitter's developer program</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've seen recent editorials about Twitter's developer program. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't great. The first time I ever spoke with a person from Twitter who worked with developers was in spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have been developing for the platform since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of what they developed for developers wasn't what we needed. It was what they thought of based on not having much contact with actual devs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What we needed more than anything was a way to be validated by the platform and promoted to users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/05/the-art-of-evangelism&quot;&gt;evangelism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/26/letathousandflowersbloom.html&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Apple should stop looking inward for the answer. Do your software shopping in the developer world. You get there sooner and it costs less.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Users never heard about our products and struggled with limits in Twitter that our products overcame. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realized there was no point pouring effort into the platform because users would never hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter except at the very beginning had almost zero entrepreneurialism in its dna.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt; et al did a great job of promoting it at first via SXSW. They had some kind of exclusive marketing deal with them. And then momentum carried the service, not innovation or creativity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then, with no where to go, Elon Musk bailed them out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I was a very small shareholder and was bought out by Musk. I didn't want to sell. I wanted Twitter to get with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My apps still work with the Twitter API. I don't think any developer should try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/make+hay&quot;&gt;make hay&lt;/a&gt; out of the pain of another developer. I wouldn't do that to you, even if I had questions about the foundation of your product. You see this in sports, no one puts down a competitive team just because one of their star players is injured. For good reason -- it can happen to you too and you don't want to see people do that to you. Remember this isn't just about Twitter, it's about developers too.</description>

But Google deliberately &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;breaks their browser&lt;/a&gt; and blames my blog, people don't seem to care, probably because it sounds like Google is being benevolent when they're actually engaging in a huge act of piracy.</description>

			<title>On owning a Tesla</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Tesla Model Y.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will no doubt get a new EV in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I bought a new PC every year or so when they were new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn't miss driving a Tesla now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMo36SfyQhw&quot;&gt;Harry said to Sally&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how I feel about EVs. It's like driving an amusement park ride every time I go out. I deserve this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Lots of choice, but one timeline. And there has to be a basic agreement on what goes in that timeline. What are the elements of a message. A way to define more types, without going to a standards body, which always crush the individual in favor of the bigco's. Something minimal, orderly, easy to document, lots of example code. Once I get finished with the new FeedLand release, I want to work on this.</description>

			<description>The WordPress user interface must be seen as a platform, a command line, and much higher level writing tools built to run on it. It should be possible to never see the UI of WordPress except for configuration and global settings, much the way you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/16/systemPreferencesMac.png&quot;&gt;System Preferences&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac. This is why blogging software has languished. The software we use for blogging must fit into the One Timeline paradigm, above.</description>

			<description>When I think of obvious missing tech products, I can’t do most of them, because as soon as the idea gained traction as a product it would be taken over by a big company, partly because users prefer that. So a lot of gaps never get filled. That’s the lesson from twitter shutting down the clients again. It isn’t just twitter, you as an independent developer, can’t step into any platform vendor’s territory, they will eventually take away your business.</description>

			<description>If Google  succeeds at burying the open web, we'll create a new open easy to write for web that Google doesn't own. In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about this I suggest we should just use the web since it already does what we will ultimately need. There will be too much creativity locked up behind Google's blackmailing, and it has an easy way to escape, we just need to create a new open web.

			<title>Gmail shut me down</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while I writing some stuff Gmail said it detected that my computer was sending some kinds of unspecified messages, and they were concerned about it, so they logged me off. I could still check my email on my other systems. I tried to go through the &quot;prove this is you&quot; process, but when it said it had sent a message to my phone, no message arrived. When I got to that place on other systems, the message did arrive on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed my account on Google, everything looks fine. The phone I have hooked it up to is an Android. I have a backup email address connected to my account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I changed my password, and re-logged-in on my various other systems, everything worked, but not on my desktop. The problem is -- no confirming message ever appears on my phone, or anywhere else I can read my Google chat messages. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their help system is unhelpful, they keep telling me things I already know and have tried. I can live without accessing Gmail from my desktop because oddly while Gmail won't work with Chrome, it works fine with Safari. But there are often links in my emails and when I click on them the pages open in Safari. So this is very disruptive to my workflow. I'd rather still use Chrome on my desktop because everything is set up to work there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/248&quot;&gt;post a note here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, still can't get GMail to open on my desktop. I've had it try to send me a security message to my Android phone, without luck. I've quit ever app, removed every extension to Chrome, still no luck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Bingeing report. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/band-of-brothers&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt; all the way through. It's good, but I had forgotten how bloody it is. Since I was in that mode, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-2022&quot;&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix. Same idea, with 2020's production, a different war, and from the other side. I think the next thing will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/they-shall-not-grow-old&quot;&gt;They Shall Not Grow Old&lt;/a&gt; on HBO.

			<title>FeedLand roadmap</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of new stuff here and I don't go into great detail. There is a link to a place to comment or ask questions at the &lt;a href=&quot;#a161849&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;FeedLand is a feed management system for individuals and groups. So far it's only been offered as a free service on the web. This roadmap explains how that will change.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The next version will by default &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use Twitter for identity. When you sign up you'll specify both a name and an email address. Both must be unique. An email confirms. Click the link and you're sent back with the credentials your browser needs to access your account. The usual dance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I do not plan to transition &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt; to work this way. Recall that we haven't been accepting new members since December 12. Everyone who uses it has a Twitter identity and it's working, and I don't want to screw with that. As long as Twitter is willing to let us use their identity service, we'll keep using it on this server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the big news: The new FeedLand server software will be available as open source, so anyone will be able to run a FeedLand instance. It's a Node.js application. Uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to hook up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; bucket for special features like RSS feeds for Likes. At first email sending will be via &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ses/&quot;&gt;Amazon SES&lt;/a&gt;, the method I currently use. It will be possible to plug in new drivers to use other email services. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The open source model is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/license/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; which uses GPLv2. I want to make it as easy to set up a FeedLand instance as it is to start a new WordPress server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People can set up commercial services to host FeedLand for individuals and groups. Every instance is set up to do that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's efficient software. I'm spending about $25 a month to host feedland.org for almost 1000 users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The client, which runs in the browser, will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be open source. I don't want to spawn a bunch of incompatible forks. I want FeedLand and its API to be solid. By maintaining control of the client, which btw need not be the only client, I can help be sure that we're starting a developer community with some basic rules about interop. If you want to run FeedLand it has to behave like FeedLand. I've been down this road and watched others go down this road. I think this is the right way to start. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Typical use-cases: A university department maintaining a FeedLand server to gather new writing from other departments at other universities on topics of interest.  Workgroups at companies. It would make a lot of sense for a news org to offer a FeedLand service to readers and their internal news writing staff. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't have dates for any of this. But at this point the path is pretty certain, so I felt it was time to say where FeedLand is going. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Friday I posted an earlier version of this roadmap on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;FeedLand support&lt;/a&gt; repo. I'm sure there will be other changes to this document as we go forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have comments or suggestions, you can post them as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;comments to Friday's post&lt;/a&gt;. Comments must conform to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="There's a lot of new stuff here and I don't go into great detail. There is a link to a place to comment or ask questions at the &lt;a href=&quot;#a161849&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:03 GMT" flNumberedSubs="true" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161103">
					<source:outline text="FeedLand is a feed management system for individuals and groups. So far it's only been offered as a free service on the web. This roadmap explains how that will change." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 17:28:18 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a172818"/>
					<source:outline text="The next version will by default &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use Twitter for identity. When you sign up you'll specify both a name and an email address. Both must be unique. An email confirms. Click the link and you're sent back with the credentials your browser needs to access your account. The usual dance." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:06 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161106"/>
					<source:outline text="I do not plan to transition &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt; to work this way. Recall that we haven't been accepting new members since December 12. Everyone who uses it has a Twitter identity and it's working, and I don't want to screw with that. As long as Twitter is willing to let us use their identity service, we'll keep using it on this server." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:12 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161112"/>
					<source:outline text="Here's the big news: The new FeedLand server software will be available as open source, so anyone will be able to run a FeedLand instance. It's a Node.js application. Uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to hook up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; bucket for special features like RSS feeds for Likes. At first email sending will be via &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ses/&quot;&gt;Amazon SES&lt;/a&gt;, the method I currently use. It will be possible to plug in new drivers to use other email services." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:15 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161115"/>
					<source:outline text="The open source model is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/license/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; which uses GPLv2. I want to make it as easy to set up a FeedLand instance as it is to start a new WordPress server." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:17 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161117"/>
					<source:outline text="People can set up commercial services to host FeedLand for individuals and groups. Every instance is set up to do that." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161119"/>
					<source:outline text="It's efficient software. I'm spending about $25 a month to host feedland.org for almost 1000 users." created="Mon, 16 Jan 2023 04:08:37 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a040837"/>
					<source:outline text="The client, which runs in the browser, will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be open source. I don't want to spawn a bunch of incompatible forks. I want FeedLand and its API to be solid. By maintaining control of the client, which btw need not be the only client, I can help be sure that we're starting a developer community with some basic rules about interop. If you want to run FeedLand it has to behave like FeedLand. I've been down this road and watched others go down this road. I think this is the right way to start." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:22 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161122"/>
					<source:outline text="Typical use-cases: A university department maintaining a FeedLand server to gather new writing from other departments at other universities on topics of interest.  Workgroups at companies. It would make a lot of sense for a news org to offer a FeedLand service to readers and their internal news writing staff." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 17:31:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a173100"/>
					<source:outline text="I don't have dates for any of this. But at this point the path is pretty certain, so I felt it was time to say where FeedLand is going." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:11:07 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161107"/>

				<source:outline text="On Friday I posted an earlier version of this roadmap on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;FeedLand support&lt;/a&gt; repo. I'm sure there will be other changes to this document as we go forward." created="Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:15:26 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/15/160957.html#a161526"/>

			<description>I don't use WordPress very much, but recently I had a chance to try out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/&quot;&gt;block editor&lt;/a&gt; and my reaction was that I can't imagine writing this way. If you're a writer who uses WordPress, do you use the block editor, if so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1614261301466865664&quot;&gt;what do you think&lt;/a&gt; of it?</description>

It took a lot of iterating to get the right version of the OS running on the machine and to then restore a Time Machine backup on the machine without having one or more extra accounts on the machine. One thing I will never understand is why Macs are so slow at transferring stuff over a local wifi network. All the advice on the net says you need to use faster wifi, but my wifi is very fast. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/14/speedtestresults.png&quot;&gt;speed test results&lt;/a&gt; communicating with a server in NYC, about 100 miles away. Why is it so much faster to communicate with that server than it is to communicate with a laptop that's in the same building?</description>

It's worth another listen because he's explaining why news is like it is, from the point of view of someone who was an insider for years.</description>

In the past when new markets appeared, like the personal computer, desktop publishing, the web -- there were always publications that grew up along with the platform, because there's such demand to know about the latest developments. I contacted my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/109682144184951137&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches journalism at CUNY to ask if there was interest in one of their students forming a news site to gather news of the Mastodon world. He liked the idea and now they've taken the next step. They're offering a full scholarship to their &quot;100-day, online certificate program that helps creators establish their own enterprises to serve specific communities/markets.&quot; Apply by Feb 3 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/j-plus/entrepreneurial-journalism-creators-program/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
