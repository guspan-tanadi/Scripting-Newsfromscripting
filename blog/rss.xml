			<description>I'd love to see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze&quot;&gt;Waze&lt;/a&gt; for supermarkets. How it would work. I'd register with (for example) Google, and ask it to notify me when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adams+Fairacre+Farms/@41.9766612,-73.9882775,246m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x59f95f28dad1a9b2!8m2!3d41.9767848!4d-73.9881112&quot;&gt;parking lot&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/&quot;&gt;favorite market&lt;/a&gt; is mostly empty. I'd also like to know how long ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Bread Alone&lt;/a&gt; delivered. I'd rather go when the store isn't packed full, and when my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/peasant-bread&quot;&gt;favorite bread&lt;/a&gt; is likely to be on the shelf. This would have saved me a trip earlier today, when literally every spot was taken. Not a good time to go shopping, esp during a pandemic. I did not even go in.</description>

			<description>I read a lot of audiobooks. Sometimes the narrator is so excellent, it's worth calling out. I just got through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/One-Flew-Over-the-Cuckoos-Nest-Audiobook/B008N1TVDU&quot;&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&lt;/a&gt;, narrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly&quot;&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt;. The book is wonderful, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey&quot;&gt;Kesey&lt;/a&gt; is a great writer, it's funny, warm, a great story beautifully told. Reilly does all the voices. Usually male narrators have trouble pulling off the female characters and vice versa. Somehow Reilly does it. Highly recommended. If you know of audiobooks that are great because of narration, let me know. I'm always looking for a good read. My next book is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Biden biography&lt;/a&gt; by Evan Osnos. Also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Rudy-Rucker-audiobook/dp/B00RBZFYF8/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;first book&lt;/a&gt; by Rudy Rucker.</description>

			<description>The way Trump relates to his base reminds me a lot of the way big tech companies talk to their users. In tech it's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22FUD%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt;. You can't tell who's lying a lot of the time. They take advantage of the fact that their customers are confused, and they try to keep them that way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt#:~:text=FUD%20is%20the%20fear%2C%20uncertainty,might%20be%20considering%20Amdahl%20products.&amp;text=This%20is%20a%20recognized%20phenomenon,fired%20for%20buying%20IBM%20equipment%22.&quot;&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; as an example made many billions off this approach over decades. There are exceptions, companies who value their customers and users enough to tell them the truth. Not many, and not always.</description>

			<description>As you may have heard, I got a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;OLED tv last week&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm starting to come to terms with it. I've added an old Roku stick to the device, and 99 percent of my interaction with the TV is through Roku. I'm not sure I'm getting the best video this way. Also the annoying LG user interface keeps popping up. And to adjust the hardware of the TV, I still need to use the LG remote. Which makes me wonder if there are any external devices, Apple TV, or some kind of Chromecast or something from Amazon that can also manage the hardware? I'd love to get it down to one remote. I still think &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Roku%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;best remote&lt;/a&gt;. Almost as simple as possible. I loved the way my old TCL did everything from Roku. Perfectly integrated, and one less OS is better than two.</description>

He wakes up in a sanitarium or monastery in Hungary or Rumania, maybe Russia, surrounded by incriminating evidence.

			<description>We should be supporting Americans during the pandemic. A country that won't come together in a crisis like this isn't imho a country. We support rich people who don't need help -- and let people wait out the pandemic with no money for food or rent and no hope of getting out of debt, people who may have been middle class before Covid, who are now broke. The importance of health care is something everyone can understand now, even young people. We are a stupid country. We waste so much, yet we don't take care of our basic needs. A small number live so extravagantly, when there is only so much a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; can use. This is about to come home in a huge way. This isn't working, hasn't for a long time, but it's getting worse, and about to get much worse. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It’s still true — we aren’t getting out of this pandemic until we work together and care about each other. Until we do, it’ll keep getting worse. I thought for a while the vaccine could eliminate the need to work together, but it’s just another me-first thing. Seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9076349/Iowa-Sen-Joni-Ernst-fire-jumping-people-COVID-vaccination.html&quot;&gt;Joni Ernst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/12/21/ana-navarro-marco-rubio-coronavirus-vaccine-sot-vpx-nr.cnn&quot;&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpde.com/news/local/help-is-on-the-way-sen-lindsey-graham-gets-the-covid-19-vaccine&quot;&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt; (among &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/pelosi-covid-vaccine-af8dcbfc-846c-4e17-bc22-71d8a339d58f.html&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;) getting their vaccines was all the proof needed. It’ll get worse. America is still stuck in selfish hell. And btw if you’re still trying to get ahead, when working together could save lives, you’re the problem.</description>

			<description>Five &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_neighborhoods&quot;&gt;neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; in Queens have more people than Wyoming. Here's the math. The five largest neighborhoods in &lt;a href=&quot;https://statisticalatlas.com/county-subdivision/New-York/Queens-County/Queens/Population#figure/neighborhood&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, by population, are: Astoria, Jamaica. Corona, Elmhurst and Flushing -- for a total of 581K. Wyoming's population is 578K. The point being this is just part of one county in New York State. It gets zero senators, probably a total of one member of the House (hard to figure). This came up as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KMCRadio/status/1340816003203252224&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on how the counties, if votes were allocated to them, one per county, would have given Trump a landslide win over Biden. Yes, and if every one of my toes were worth $1 billion, I would be a billionaire. I'm sure you can tell a story that makes you sleep easier at night. But that's not how elections are won and lost. And of course everyone knows that. Oh can we stop being idiots some day, perhaps? That would be nice. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/20.html#a155757&quot;&gt;ranted about journalism&lt;/a&gt; and the way they report on Facebook, from their own conflicted point of view. Toxic stuff, completely unrestrained by any effort at balance. I just came across a thread in a private FB group where a parent, considering buying a house in a small nearby town, asks what people think of local schooling. What came back is an incredible thread with real-life experiences. So far 70 comments. Not the kind of stuff you can get from journalism or books. Since it's private, I can't quote it, sorry.</description>

			<source:outline text="Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/20.html#a155757&quot;&gt;ranted about journalism&lt;/a&gt; and the way they report on Facebook, from their own conflicted point of view. Toxic stuff, completely unrestrained by any effort at balance. I just came across a thread in a private FB group where a parent, considering buying a house in a small nearby town, asks what people think of local schooling. What came back is an incredible thread with real-life experiences. So far 70 comments. Not the kind of stuff you can get from journalism or books. Since it's private, I can't quote it, sorry." created="Mon, 21 Dec 2020 14:51:23 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/21.html#a145123"/>

			<description>Listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-facebook-owns-future&quot;&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt; about Google and Facebook. Such hype and propaganda. When you hear &quot;news&quot; talk about something you understand better than they do, you can hear how evil they are. And they are very evil at NPR. For example, they talk about how Facebook is used by white supremacists to organize so they can kill protestors. They interview the girlfriend of one of the dead protestors. What they leave out is that it's also used to plan charity events in my hometown, and every hometown in the world. It's like saying the telephone is used to plan terrorism. Yes, it is, but most people would know that's bullshit. Unfortunately they are so good at sliming Facebook in journalism, and it is still relatively new, that they mislead a lot of people who could benefit from using it. I know because I hear the bullshit coming back through them. They're scared of it, that's for sure. They should let some people use their air to explain how NPR exploits &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; users. Yeah I don't see that happening anytime soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW this is why blogging and podcasting are so important. They represent checks on the power of journalism. I was naive in the beginning to think this would negate the power of journalism to mislead, it hasn't had that effect. They are as oblivious to criticism as the Republicans in Congress are. But there's still hope.</description>

If the people at NPR understand how, why aren't they reporting that. Both are choking the open protocols of the web, and keep competition from rising up to exploit their weakness. This is something that probably sounds &quot;technical&quot; to them. Most journalists are intimidated, for now at least, by the technology of the internet. To our detriment. Maybe over the years that will ease as the old folk move on and young people who grew up with the tech replace them. But I'm not really that hopeful about that. The young folk seem to have inherited the blindness and hypocrisy of previous generations of journalism.</description>

			<description>There's another reason to be in a hurry to get everyone vaccinated. As time goes by, the virus is mutating. Maybe a strain will come along that's resistent or immune to the vaccine. It makes sense that will happen faster as people are vaccinated. To work best it should happen fast. There's a lot of subtlety that is being missed in the press coverage. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-20/uk-new-strain-covid-19-more-infectious-spreads-faster-urgent/13001198&quot;&gt;new strain&lt;/a&gt; apparently in the UK now that is more communicative. Also, if history is a guide, the new strains will be less lethal. That's good news of course.</description>

			<title>Really Simple Investing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 90s, I was doing pretty well in business and life. My company merged with another, and we went public. I left shortly after the merger. I was writing software and riding my bike around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/933+Hermosa+Way,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4423546,-122.1904147,3a,75y,225.13h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWpxKaYp2CLoVfYdOzKC9og!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fa4b8c4919d37:0x737bbc1511131c2c!8m2!3d37.4422438!4d-122.190613&quot;&gt;Menlo Park, CA&lt;/a&gt;. I had a pool. Things were clicking. Life was good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried a lot of things with the proceeds from the company I sold. Most of them lost all the money I put into them, highly speculative stuff -- learning experiences for sure. One investment stood out among all others, it went up, consistently -- the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to know why this one fund is so good at returning value.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out the answer is really simple. Presidents are evaluated on the performance of the economy, and that means the stock market, and that means one of two indexes, the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500. Presidents have a lot of power to move the value of stocks relative to other ways of looking at the economy (there are lots of them, all valid). Because they are evaluated on the value of these two virtual stocks, they try to move them up. And you can go along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you hitch your wagon to the S&amp;P train, and basically do nothing else, you'll do the same as &quot;the market&quot; or &quot;the economy.&quot; If it's good times, you'll do well, and not good times you'll probably still do well. It's really weird that wealth is such a simple game, but it appears that it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things they don't tell you on TV because the really rich people worry that if everyone knows it, the value of the indices might no longer go up all the time.

When he points out that the &quot;stock market&quot; is doing great even though thousands of Americans are dying every day he's talking to his constituents, not you. He's saying the silent part out loud. But there's nothing stopping you from listening. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is all completely arbitrary. Just in case you're wondering. It's why &quot;the market&quot; can be booming in a depression. It's arbitrary and an illusion.

				<source:outline text="Back in the early 90s, I was doing pretty well in business and life. My company merged with another, and we went public. I left shortly after the merger.

				<source:outline text="Turns out the answer is really simple. Presidents are evaluated on the performance of the economy, and that means the stock market, and that means one of two indexes, the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500. Presidents have a lot of power to move the value of stocks relative to other ways of looking at the economy (there are lots of them, all valid). Because they are evaluated on the value of these two virtual stocks, they try to move them up.

			<description>YouTube TV does something smart that all TV services should do. They have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt;. So you can go there and edit your preferences, menus, program your DVR, whatever. Roku should do that too, as should &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/02/211604.html?title=hboMaxIsAHistoricMess&quot;&gt;HBO Mess&lt;/a&gt;, or the arcane UI of LG-land. Set up your watch list. Integrate with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;! (i.e. have an API). Connect your world to mine. It's amazing how much of the design of the LG television assumes their TV is the center of our world. It's for watching. Not controlling. Relaxing, meditating, self-medicating with boredom. Not a place where you get big ideas, and if you do it's a lost cause because the UI tools are limited to what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1475971-REG/lg_an_mr19ba_magic_remote_control_with.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6zq6C-7XppTkISht-dKLTIKU4-C25MtD4GvWbqQurqJkDVJ8RRRUOhoCRH4QAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;remote&lt;/a&gt; can do.</description>

I really should write a book with some of these projects and the philosophy behind them.</description>

So he'll go to Mar a Lago, take the &quot;presidential&quot; oath while Biden takes the actual oath, everyone's happy.</description>

			<description>The key point that the Democrats keep missing is that we want to do more. We will give you money and we will vote, but that's not all we can do. Each of has special talents, abilities. Some of us have more time to give than others. But almost to a person, we want to be part of this, not spectators. Trump kind of got that, with his rallies. He didn't condescend. He included them in his speeches. Talked to them like humans. This stuff isn't hard, you have have to try to see things differently. We're not just dollars and votes.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean_2004_presidential_campaign&quot;&gt;The Dean campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 2002-04 was on the verge of turning a campaign into a social network. I was there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;Here are my notes&lt;/a&gt; from the last night of the campaign, the Iowa Caucus in 2004. I was at Dean HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont&quot;&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt;. I was blogging on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; and on the main Dean weblog. We also rolled out &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html&quot;&gt;Channel Dean&lt;/a&gt; that day, basically a linkblog managed by campaign people, linking to articles and blog posts their community would find interesting. These were all precursors to the social nets of today.</description>

			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fbetter-things&quot;&gt;watching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Better Things%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt; very slowly, one episode a night on average. The nice thing is how the mom and her three daughters have open affection for each other, it's their baseline. They get pissed off, mostly the kids with the mom, but they quickly get back to hugging and being motherly to each other, across generations. It's sweet. Nothing at all even remotely like the environment I grew up in btw, just sayin. Anyway, I'd kind of like to see Donald Trump as a guest on the show. They would listen to his sad stories, and try to help him. I think there could be some good jokes in there.</description>

			<description>I used to put Donald Trump's image in the right margin of this blog quite frequently, but I've stopped. He's a vampire we've managed to lock in a crypt, and I worry that just showing his image here might wake him up. He's now got the smell of loser on him, like an old version of Sarah Palin. She was pretty charismatic too, in her day. And about as talented as the lame duck. Better to let him fade away. Think of him as a dead relative. Maybe he was an asshole, it's hard to remember, it's been so long.</description>

			<description>Trump did Barr a favor by firing him. In the future it will be better to have been fired by Trump than not fired by Trump.</description>

			<description>One of the nice things about using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22outliner%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; to edit my blog is that I can move things around quickly, but sometimes things get moved to the wrong place. That happened yesterday. I was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;my new TV&lt;/a&gt; and all of a sudden there's a paragraph about how screwed up journalism is. And then there was a post that I thought I had deleted and didn't. Oy! That was pretty disturbing. I left it there, but edited it a bit so it made more sense. Yesterday was a good day in general, but a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; day on the blog. Anyway, I've corrected it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html&quot;&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;. Ooops. I'll try to do better in the future. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html&quot;&gt;Ben Smith explains&lt;/a&gt; why it's bad that Apple is now a media company. He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html&quot;&gt;biggest media buyouts&lt;/a&gt; in history (at the time). I wanted to know when he/she was going to write about it. Never. That opened my eyes to something I should have been able to see much earlier. We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us. Yet they feel transparent to us, the mere conveyors of information, or so they would have you believe. We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory&quot;&gt;triangulation&lt;/a&gt; here. A source of news that is &lt;i&gt;totally disconnected&lt;/i&gt; from the media industry.</description>
