			<description>A little computer design/philosophy. Everywhere you look on a computer you see the same pattern repeating itself. Folders, sub-folders, files. If you're looking for it you see it everywhere. So why not have one really great browser for such structures, and use it everywhere. That way when you add a feature to the core, it improves everywhere. I think very quickly the computer itself would become simpler. BTW, this was the basic idea behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22outliners%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/a&gt;. We never got close enough to putting code &quot;in ROM&quot; to complete the vision. But that was the idea.</description>

			<description>A favorite recent Twitter feature: I can filter replies so I only see, by default, replies from people I follow. It has made Twitter more civil for me. But it has a downside, that I realize when I reply to someone who doesn't follow me. They probably can't see my idea.</description>

			<description>If Joe Biden were running the government in March last year, the USPS would have sent free masks to every mailing address in the country. That would have been a master stroke. Someone at the USPS thought of this and got buy-in. Amazing. The politicians put a stop to it.</description>

			<description>In a brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1356988600483799041&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/globalvoices&quot;&gt;Global Voices&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, I mentioned the idea that news has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;unbundled&lt;/a&gt;, today no single publication delivers the news, as they used to. A story to illustrate. As a student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW-Madison&lt;/a&gt; in the late 70s, I'd often go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/&quot;&gt;Memorial Union&lt;/a&gt; with a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, on a sunny afternoon perhaps, and sit on the patio by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mendota&quot;&gt;Lake Mendota&lt;/a&gt;, people-watch, and read the news. Today I'd do it in a minute if I could, but today I'd read news on an iPad or laptop using &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds. I'd have an all-in-one bundled news experience as I did in the 70s. But: My system kind of sucks, I never put any effort into maintaining it, and my system is vastly better than what most people get as a news experience. No wonder the truth has trouble getting out. The news industry blames Facebook, but as a former entrepreneur, I blame them. They've invested so little in understanding how their readers use their product. Their system is based on an incomplete understanding of their roles. The news industry product needs to be re-bundled. I believe the rewards will be huge for the first publication that bets on this idea. They wouldn't be the first, btw -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/19/whatToDooWithYahoo.html&quot;&gt;My.Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; did it in the 00's. Have the guts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;point to your competition&lt;/a&gt;. And if you have a paywall, send them some money &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; some readers. Now that Jeff Bezos is retired, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; such a platform, I would stand up and applaud if they had the guts to try this out. I'd also line up to hook my blog into such a network. Not because my writing depends on making money from it, it doesn't, but to help disrupt the news industry that's daydreaming itself to death over distribution, competition and economics.</description>

After writing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/30.html#a174046&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that I am writing too much, I decided let's do one or two ideas every night and see what if anything changes.

			<description>There is a consensus among scientists that Covid will be with us basically forever. It will not be eradicated, it will continue to evolve, circumventing our vaccines, which will have to evolve too. It will kill approximately 10 times more people than the seasonal flu, and will make people a lot sicker for a lot longer. It may mutate into something less damaging, but it might go the other way too. No one knows. The probability of a return to what we used to consider normal is zero. So maybe no more movies or restaurants, in-person spectator sports, theater, art museums, bowling, singing, long distance travel. The smarter we are and the more we work together the less damage the virus can do. It eats &quot;deeply polarized&quot; cultures, like ours.</description>

So maybe no more movies or restaurants, in-person spectator sports, theater, art museums, bowling, singing, long distance travel. The smarter we are and the more we work together the less damage the virus can do. It eats &quot;deeply polarized&quot; cultures, like ours." created="Tue, 02 Feb 2021 16:59:42 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/19/coronavirus.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/02/02.html#a165942"/>

			<description>Political journalism is as broken as the Republican Party. Of course you'll never hear about that in the news. And there will be no discussions on CNN or MSNBC on how to work around their brokenness. The system self-perpetuates until it collapses, which is has been doing lately.</description>

			<description>Some people misunderstood &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/31.html#a162601&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; and sent codolences. I was just observing that this is what's going on around us. If I have personal news that I want to disclose publicly, I will be much more direct about it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video/6Xworas9tjW5uXBFMo3zUekCqWgMsNwT/1-31-2021-left-behind-the-biodata-race-dna-for-sale/&quot;&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; had a segment last night on just this subject, by coincidence. For some people who lose people they are close to, it never will return to normal. I suspect it won't for any of us.</description>

			<description>I'm waiting for the mass arrests of the people who attacked the Capitol. I have heard that locally the courts just think it was a joke. We need to make it clear this is not a joke. Long prison sentences. People begging for forgiveness, saying they thought it was a game.</description>

			<description>I remember as a young child of eight or nine, my father told me when we saw the Beatles, on the Ed Sullivan show, that their hair wasn’t real. They wore wigs, he explained. I told him that I thought he was wrong.</description>

			<description>We should study how QAnon delivered its story, and do what they did, except put out the truth instead of made up stuff. The truth is strange enough. Whatever they did it worked, and I have to say the people who I've heard talk about it seem pretty sane to me.</description>

			<description>This is not a request for support. If Spectrum had decent customer service they could probably get me to subscribe again. But last time I had to wait an hour on hold to talk to a rep to cancel my free trial to a service that wasn't well-explained on their site. That said, they have service that's a lot cheaper than the unbundled version, because you have to buy everything twice just to get CNN and MSG because of exclusive deals they've made. I guess the old cable companies are grandfathered in?</description>

			<description>The supposedly legit press is making the lunatic from Georgia into a major political force in the US. And they have the chutzpah to say social media is destroying the political system of the US. Why don't we all get together and wake the fuck up to how this works.</description>
