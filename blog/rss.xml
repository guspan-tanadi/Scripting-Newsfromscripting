			<description>I'm glad we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3hrN0cP58Y&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; of Trump trying to bully the Georgia secretary of state. As this is going on the country is botching the administration of the vaccine. And the states and cities are running out of money. And his &quot;supporters&quot; think this situation is fine. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ”¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I wish the Washington Post would open source the audio. Upload it somewhere. The full conversation, not excerpts. This should be on the record, for all to hear, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html?fbclid=IwAR35bsuw5uv5HvLF7QFG7-1UF6UA2TPj3f5uV9yNuQyNwkbh67dy0RnInGs&quot;&gt;behind a paywall&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not saying they should or have to, but this is history. We should get it all, right now. Everyone should hear it.</description>

			<description>I said something in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/02/143005.html?title=podcastsPleaseGetToThePoint&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; about podcasting that caused some understandable confusion. Here's what I said. &quot;There are rules about this medium.&quot; I think that's true, not one rule for everyone at all times, but genres and practices, conventions. Any art has them, and then every artist breaks them. That's part of the art. Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3753122&quot;&gt;only steal from the best&lt;/a&gt; -- another &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt;. Every artist steals. If there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; for standards-makers, there must also be rules for podcasters, no? I don't claim that what I say are the rules. But there is one rule imho that art must follow, it must respect the observer, as a participant. If your art doesn't do that, I'm probably not going to like it. Doesn't mean I won't come back. Art is weird. If it isn't, it isn't art, imho.</description>

			<description>The Repubs backing Trump should be careful not to break the law. Trump wonâ€™t care, and wonâ€™t have the power to pardon, anyway. I bet heâ€™d enjoy seeing Ted Cruz go to jail. I bet a lot of people would. Seriously, they would be easy scapegoats, everyone could agree they deserve to be punished.</description>

			<title>Podcasts please get to the point</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/01.html#a190023&quot;&gt;short admonition&lt;/a&gt; about podcasts that tell you about the experiences and feelings of experts who I don't know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aweissman/status/1345375764544421888&quot;&gt;Andy Weissman&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it might be the unlimited length of podcasts that encourages people to go on and on. I'm sure that's part of it. I also think producers aren't listening to their own podcasts, so aren't aware of how poorly these indefinite ramblings about nothing go over.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other day I was on a walk in the country, bundled up with three layers covering everything including my head and the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4&quot;&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;. I was walking basically inside a podcast pillow. I choose the podcast I'll listen to before I get all bundled up. This walk, I wanted to learn all about the pandemic from a reporter who had been covering nothing else for a year. I had been reading his articles. But the interviewer wanted to know about about the author's personal feelings about the pandemic. I went with it for five minutes, they were still talking about the author's feelings, so I tried another podcast. Same thing! And another. The topics were all interesting to me. But they took forever to get going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally I hit on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000q9b6&quot;&gt;BBC podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution&quot;&gt;Chinese Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in the 60s and 70s, which I was fascinated by as a kid. I got what I wanted, I learned something, but I'm sure there was good stuff in the podcasts I skipped. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are rules about this medium. It's not a joke -- it's for real and it looks like it's going to be here for a while. So we should be thinking about how to do the best possible podcast for people who are really interested in the depth the podcast medium offers that isn't available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Sanford Dickert%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Sanford Dickert&lt;/a&gt;, a friend from the Kerry campaign and the first BloggerCon, does a daily thing on Facebook live video, riding a bike around London. I just kind of interviewed him, while he was riding, me on the keyboard, him on video and voice. I realized his is a podcast that's totally about how he's feeling, and of course it's interesting because &lt;i&gt;he's&lt;/i&gt; interesting. So that's an obvious exception. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Facebook is useful. Journalism is evil. This contrarian view is brought to you by open media. You will never hear these simple ideas on closed corporate media.</description>

			<description>The best podcasts are the ones with experts who simply share their expertise. So many podcasts begin with a long discussion about how everyone feels, with lots of chuckling and self-praise and inside jokes. No. One. Cares. The first time I noticed this was a podcast about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans&quot;&gt;The Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a great show that I loved, with cast members. That's cool. Talk about the characters you play. But I really don't care where you, the actor, grew up. Exceptions are obvious. If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot;&gt;Beatle&lt;/a&gt;, go ahead and talk about yourself. If you're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson&quot;&gt;Jack Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep&quot;&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;, yes please. I would like to know what makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Ernst&quot;&gt;Joni Ernst&lt;/a&gt; tick. But most experts aren't interesting as people. Your audience is looking to learn something, so teach us.</description>

			<description>As was pointed out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianstorms/status/1345045516644659211&quot;&gt;Brian Dear&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, it's now January 1, 2021, and I still haven't received a letter or email from the US government telling me how and when I'm going to get my Covid vaccine. As a user of Medicare, I am surprised they haven't yet sent me an email about this. This is actually the kind of thing they do at Medicare.</description>
