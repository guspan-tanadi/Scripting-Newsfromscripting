			<description>I've been using Twitter's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/22/twitterAsBlogPostEditor.png&quot;&gt;edit box&lt;/a&gt; to write long posts, just because I have it open when I want to vent. Then I copy the text and paste it into the Scripting News outline. Edit it, review it and then decide it's not worth the trouble and hit the backspace key. Back to work.</description>

I've written about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/18.html#a161837&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. As I go deeper into this project, I'm becoming more resolved that I'm only going to support a subset of feeds. What will come out of it will not be a feed reader in the sense that people think of them for the last 20 or so years. They all try to read everything, and that makes it hard to go beyond the intersection of features found in all feeds. I don't see any point in producing yet another one of those. If people producing blogging software want to give this another shot, they should be ready to retool, a bit. Not very much. Maybe not at all (if you've been considerate in your feeds). And not breaking anything. This is absolute. I will not break anyone either with feeds I produce (I write a popular blog and make blogging software.) Which is a bit tricky because there are important features in my feeds that most readers don't support thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. This is how everything got broken. I want to go back to before this all became such a mess, and slowly and carefully pull through something beautifully simple and easy to work with. And then go from there. Not leaving the past behind, but also not being limited by it. It's possible. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I gotta say there are a few public figures who, if they died tonight, I'd do a little jig, drink a toast, in private of course. In anticipation my heart beats a little faster. Oh could we be so lucky! I'd put a George Harrison &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIbVWNy7HBk&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; on the speaker, only &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; with sarcasm.</description>

			<title>If money is speech...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1505904993223725058&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi tweets&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You're probably paying for Putin TV.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's right, you are. If you have a basic cable package that includes Fox News, you're paying your share to keep Tucker Carlson on the air. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Joe, I think this would be an incredible political cause to raise a fuss about. Focus the spotlight on how we're subsidizing Fox. I think that law, whatever it is that makes this possible or necessary, needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's as fundamental as the First Amendment. I should not be required to fund speech that I find abhorrent. The Supreme Court ruled that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC&quot;&gt;money is speech&lt;/a&gt;. Let's get some lawyers working on this! Make news. It's the kind of issue Repubs raise huge money on. And it pisses me off that my money goes to fund the destruction of our political system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote about this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/27.html#a160229&quot;&gt;1/27/2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Something I learned from reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811&quot;&gt;Elie Mystal's book&lt;/a&gt;. The Second Amendment’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-slave-owners-dictated-the-language-of-the-2nd-amendment&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; was to enable slavers in Virginia to put down a slave rebellion without depending on the federal government. It wasn't put in the Constitution so people could protect themselves against robbers, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and if appropriate there could be laws that allow it specifically. But it isn't really a Constitutional right.</description>

			<title>A Wordle hack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/20/wordleResult.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; is an addictive word game that became popular and then was bought by the NY Times. It's free to play, as far as I know (I have a NYT subscription so if it weren't free it's possible I might not know). The diagram to the right is a standard, produced by the game. It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's the hack...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you know the second and third letters, as above, and have eliminated a fair number of consonants, and are sure the first letter is a consonant…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Type one of the eligable consonants and the next two letters into a web browser and check out the auto completes. Repeat. That's how I figured out the answer to today's puzzle after I got to the situation in the third line. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty consistently getting the answer in four steps. In the first two steps I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just gathering data. By the third, I constrain my guess by the information I've gathered so far, assuming I've got one or two hits.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case I got two green squares on the first one. I thought for sure I'd get the answer in three instead of four, but I hadn't eliminated enough consonants to be able to puzzle it out. I was surprised by how hard it was after step three, mostly because (I think) this was a weird word, letter-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT editorial is a good sign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of time to write this morning but I wanted to get this out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, my goal for the web has always been that I want the bright minds to be on the web, sharing important stuff that comes from what they do. These people would be considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; in journalism, not reporters. I've been working on this since I first started using the web as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;writing platform&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that keeps bright minds from fully expressing their ideas on the web is the sense that it's a savage place, where people cut you down, make your life miserable, possibly lose you your standing, even your job. So they don't take the step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This idea comes from journalism. From organizations like the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They paint us all with the same brush. They talk about us as monsters. All the same. They don't listen. Only their ideas get out. Reporters are easily fooled, we've learned, with great cost for all of us. Journalism says Facebook sucks, a lot, and that scares some of my neighbors from using Facebook, and keeps us from making connections that would make things work better on a local level. We need more of that. Journalism has stood in the way of good uses of the web. Maybe they don't know they've been doing it, but they have been doing it just the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when a big influential organization like the NYT says, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;its official voice&lt;/a&gt;, that this is a problem, and presumably we should do something about it, I see that as huge progress. We have an ally in organizing our knowlege and passion, the good stuff of human intelect, with their support, instead with their derision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I am so sad when I see people who already have mastered the tools predictably try to put the NYT down for noticing this problem which &lt;i&gt;all of them know about, &lt;/i&gt;I'm sure of it. So who has the old idea and who has the new one? Who's wired and who's tired?  In my mind, the NYT has made a breakthrough. I love it. Build on it. Bring that philosophy into the NYT itself. Look for the good on the web, not just the mean stuff. Set the example. I think the light will come on for others, not all of them, some are too dug in, but progress can be made here, I feel it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Save me the lecture about the First Amendment. I go way back with the fight against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;CDA&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. You use the First Amendment as a hammer, the same way the gun lobby uses the Second Amendment. I see you as exactly like them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I used one of my montly gifts as a NYT subscriber to provide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;link to the editorial&lt;/a&gt;.

I think the light will come on for others, not all of them, some are too dug in, but progress can be made here, I feel it." created="Sat, 19 Mar 2022 13:20:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/19/131555.html?title=theNytEditorialIsAGoodSign#a132023"/>

Much like the update I did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; last year. Really simple sample code. It was time to pull together the code I use to parse feeds these days in JavaScript apps and publish it as open source. It builds on Dan MacTough's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; package, so it inherits its support of different feed formats: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, Atom and RDF. The result is what developers want in 2022. A simple JavaScript object containing the information in a feed and nothing more. One system call to parse it. Works like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse&quot;&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a simple feed reader could be built. Or any other feed-consuming software. I felt it was time to try to bring this together, enough time has passed, don't you think? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>My two cents: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1504807644963479562&quot;&gt;The NYT Editorial Board is correct&lt;/a&gt;. We all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/220318/p17#a220318p17&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt; what we say to avoid all kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsuris&quot;&gt;tsuris&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it's cops at your house in SWAT gear, guns drawn, responding to a call there's been a murder. Or a knock on the door from a stranger, saying they just wanted to know if this is where you live. It could be a small thing, or it could drive you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape&quot;&gt;out of business&lt;/a&gt;. The key point is people hold back what they think because they don't want the drama or danger that would come from expressing the idea. The rebuttals are stale. Heard them for decades. It doesn't change the fact that there's important ideas not being exchanged. And we need the best minds, with the freshest ideas to deal with the issues of the day.  And btw this kind of suppression is just as effective as what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/florida-senate-approves-dont-say-gay-bill-00015120&quot;&gt;Repubs are doing&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, for example. Think about that, and look in the mirror. You aren't that different from them.</description>

			<description>On Tuesday, just after doing a workout on my Peloton bike, I saw a question on Facebook, pure clickbait, that asked you to take the color of your underwear and the last thing you ate, put them together to form the name of your 80s rock band. I never go for these things, but I did this time. I was wearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M6TWDLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;biking shorts&lt;/a&gt;, the kind with padding so you don't get a sore butt. So I wasn't actually wearing underwear. I had sushi for lunch. The combination: human sushi. It was too good not to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/370691617969252/posts/465664631805283?comment_id=490879942617085&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Already 96 likes.

			<title>How to get the public writing system we want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw comments from two noted journalism thinkers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/jeff.jarvis/posts/10158648424506905&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/1504459556939776004&quot;&gt;Mathew Ingram&lt;/a&gt; saying more or less the same thing. It's amazing to me, because it's the flipside of what I've been wanting to do for years -- develop software for writers and thinkers without trapping them into a tech industry business model. Today the software is inexpensive to make and operate. That isn't the problem, we know how to make the software, the problem is attracting a critical mass of users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a way to do it. The challenge is not making the software, it's getting the users have to show up. What will convince them to use a system that lets them write for free, gives them a permanent archive of their writing so they don't get locked in and lets them use whatever writing tools they like? I can't convince them on my own. I'm not famous enough, trusted enough, or whatever. When I do it, it doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I think would work is to get the support of foundations. Then, with the resources, hire professional testers to be sure that as we add features, the software keeps working. Use some of the money to hire a real PR firm to pitch the idea to pubs, tell writers we want to make the tools they want, without the gotchas. But wait to pitch until there's something they can actually sign on to and use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was at Berkman, a very long time ago, we tried to get support from the tech industry, AOL, Microsoft, Apple, Google -- but they wanted to do this stuff themselves. Now I'd suggest asking the Knight Foundation, Newmark, MacArthur, not sure who else. This is far from my area of expertise. And it's not the money we need so much, but the endorsement. Grants would say: We looked at the idea and the people involved, and thought it was worth creating the service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The users are the key. They have to trust it. Just going out straight, as a pitch -- well I've tried it. The problem is they expect software they use to come from VC-backed companies or huge multinationals. The foundations invest in projects at news orgs that are more proof-of-concept than actual systems people can use. This project would be different, its goal would be to get a public system up and running, cloneable, free to use, with features competitive with Medium and Substack. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Summary: Foundations acting as VCs, to get specific production software built to enable reliable and open systems to flourish, where the VCs always have gotchas, these projects would be guaranteed not to have them. The only ROI is the system itself, developed and up and running and freely clonable. No business model, guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Also why I wanted to be at Harvard in 2003. And how lucky it was that Chris was there too. I ramble a lot, if you listen to me, you know that.

			<description>I can’t imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2022/3/16/22980192/lebron-james-knee-soreness-injury-swelling-video-medical-explainer-lakers-video&quot;&gt;Lebron&lt;/a&gt; has any fans left after he’s dumped so many teams. It’s not just that he wins championships, it’s that he leaves behind wrecks. Fans don’t want to win as much as we want to love. I’m glad he never chose the Knicks. I can’t imagine another team accepting LeBron unless he swears he will leave the team in better condition than he found it. That would be something worth giving a try. Go to Orlando, for example, and don’t bring any stars with you, just work. And do it for a dollar a year. Then there will be at least some goodwill for you going forward.</description>

			<description>I wrote something the other day that bears repeating. &quot;When you read something, you're not in touch with the author's emotions, not when they wrote it, and esp not now, long after they wrote it. Emotions are fluid things, and unless you're very careful, it's unlikely that the emotions you are feeling, as you read the piece, are the author's. It would be a remarkable coincidence if they were.

			<description>Twitter is still the easiest blogging platform out there. Just add titles, styling and links, and get rid of the character limit and Twitter will own the world.

I hope people who get other electric cars have a similar experience. It's just such a smooth ride, and so much power. I have also mostly got the getting in and out part down, just the right way to twist my body, thanks to advice from my friend Chuck Shotton who is a longtime Tesla owner.</description>

			<description>At one point in the ride I was shuffling podcasts and thinking this is too dangerous and then I remembered I'm driving a car that theoretically can drive itself. So I clicked the right stick down twice to activate the driving functionality and took my hands off the steering wheel. I talked to the car as if it were a 17-year-old learning to drive, giving it encouragement and preparing to take over when it started to drive off the road. Something weird happened, it started flashing red, and then really started flashing red, which I interpreted as &quot;I can't handle this, you take over, Mr Human.&quot; Which I did. But I was driving on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_209&quot;&gt;US 209&lt;/a&gt;, basically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9641439,-74.0222502,3a,75y,200.84h,80.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D284.48877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;, two lanes in each direction, divided, lots of room everywhere, good weather, well marked lanes.

			<description>I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/a-new-nuclear-age/&quot;&gt;latest Open Source podcast&lt;/a&gt;. You must listen to this one. It's about the new reality of nuclear war. Chris Lydon talks to all the most interesting academics, and it's clear they really like and respect him. If you watch MSNBC, skip Rachel Maddow one night every week and listen to Chris and his guests. I think they should put him on TV with exactly the same guests as he has now, and let him cover exactly what he covers. It's much higher quality than anything you get from any other source. Swear to god. It's for adults, smart ones. It's not a bedtime story (and that's a good thing).</description>

			<description>So I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how I have really good friends for a long time who have never used an outliner, and somehow must think they understand me at some level, when they just can't. Imagine for example you had a friend who was a guitar player. Not the most famous or best ever, but still someone who had devoted their life to creating music with guitars. And then imagine not only had you not listened to your friend playing the guitar, but you hadn't listened to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; play a guitar. You didn't know what a guitar was. You sent them a link to a story about someone humming while driving and asked if it was like that. That's been my experience. I live with it. But I've never liked it. My software actually isn't hard to learn, at least not compared to other software like Twitter, Facebook, a word processor, an ATM. It's a low-grade source of frustration. Most days I write stuff on this blog and hear back nothing. But it seems some people read it. I just write for myself. I think I'm going to go back to doing that with software too. 2021 was an exceptional year, I decided to devote the whole year to creating a real end-user piece of software -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I never hear anything nice about it. Mostly from people who refuse to read the docs complaining that they don't know how to do something that's covered in the docs. This isn't what I had in mind when I spent all of last year building the product and writing excellent docs.</description>

			<source:outline text="So I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how I have really good friends for a long time who have never used an outliner, and somehow must think they understand me at some level, when they just can't. Imagine for example you had a friend who was a guitar player. Not the most famous or best ever, but still someone who had devoted their life to creating music with guitars. And then imagine not only had you not listened to your friend playing the guitar, but you hadn't listened to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; play a guitar. You didn't know what a guitar was. You sent them a link to a story about someone humming while driving and asked if it was like that. That's been my experience. I live with it. But I've never liked it. My software actually isn't hard to learn, at least not compared to other software like Twitter, Facebook, a word processor, an ATM. It's a low-grade source of frustration. Most days I write stuff on this blog and hear back nothing. But it seems some people read it. I just write for myself. I think I'm going to go back to doing that with software too. 2021 was an exceptional year, I decided to devote the whole year to creating a real end-user piece of software -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I never hear anything nice about it. Mostly from people who refuse to read the docs complaining that they don't know how to do something that's covered in the docs. This isn't what I had in mind when I spent all of last year building the product and writing excellent docs." created="Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:25:05 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/15.html#a152505"/>

			<description>Another example. I probably spent in total a whole month doing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2022/01/23/153755.html?title=howToUseTreechartFromDrummer&quot;&gt;Tree Chart&lt;/a&gt; app. Two comments. One saying they wanted more features, and another from a semi-famous person who said he missed MORE, so I pointed him to Drummer. He complained that the tree chart part of Drummer wasn't as good as MORE's and that's it. Nothing beyond that. I wonder if people know how much effort it takes to create something like this (obviously they don't) or are willing to invest anything at all in helping? Obviously not that either. So I think the only way to go is to create software for a market of one -- me -- and leave it at that. Maybe I'll share some of it, maybe I won't. It's a lot of extra work to share it, and from my point of view, the work is an utter waste of time. Basically most people are selfish assholes. I think the Beatles felt this way about their fans too. I've been learning so much about them this year. But at least we all listened to their music, even if we had no idea who they were, and how they created the music.</description>

			<description>A few months ago I read a comment on Twitter, not directed to me but with my name tagged, that said that RSS will be able to move again once Dave Winer is dead. Isn't that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwoUKhZQbg&quot;&gt;special&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure that's not true btw, but to be thought of as only contributing obstruction. I think it's like that in a lot of things I've worked on. People have tried to buy my products away from me, not realizing I still owned them. That was comedy. Other people, supposed friends, told me they were taking over, I should get out of their way or I'd get hurt. The first couple of times that happened, from someone who was very rich, I fell for it. It wasn't true. His products were flops because he had no idea what people valued in the products. I did because I had connections with the users and I listened, systematically. At LVT we got very good at listening, we knew in advance that new releases would be loved because were simply giving the users what they wanted. Once another rich guy offered me $1 million for my company or he was going to blow me out of the water (his words). Yeah I said, i've heard that before. Go right ahead. He never shipped anything even remotely competitive. BTW, our product was making more than $1 million &lt;i&gt;a month&lt;/i&gt; at the time. He didn't even bother to get the numbers. All this says to me is that &lt;i&gt;we should fucking work together dammit. &lt;/i&gt;Look at the Beatles and how individually they reached out to other musicians and recorded with them. Why don't we do that in software. If there's going to be more RSS, why shouldn't it benefit from what I've learned? You might be surprised to find that a new RSS can't happen &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; I am involved, Mr Waiting For Me To Die. Why take the chance? I didn't save the tweet because I didn't want to ever close that loop. Imagine how that felt. The world is full of self-important assholes, and we've given every one of them tools to express their assholyness. You can quote me on that.</description>
