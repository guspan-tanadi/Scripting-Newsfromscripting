			<description>Think about it, how is Ukraine doing such a great job of making sure they aren't forgotten. Their president is a comedian. It would be great if Biden had comedian friends. Let them explain what's going on. Let Biden do the behind the scenes stuff, he's doing that well.</description>

			<title>Google Reader, nine years later</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/15/wickedWitch.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, after Google Reader had its plug pulled. I'm guessing most people who read that piece have no idea what I'm talking about, because most don't think about online systems as defining a base of content they can move around. Think of it this way. Imagine if you couldn't fly into one city, you had to take a train, but to another city you had to fly, there was no train. The obvious thing would be to build a train route to the city without one, and do the same for air. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simply: Twitter says posts have no titles and Google said posts must have titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the online world has been so dysfunctional that here we are nine years later, and RSS readers still can't deal with Twitter style content. I see Twitter is advertising that they're going to open up. Then this is going to be a problem they have to deal with too. I also believe it can be solved. I've been using a reader that handles both kinds of posts since the advent of RSS, there to be copied by anyone who dared to look. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway... Maybe we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They think it'll give him a new platform, a new cause. He'll fundraise like crazy. Something to campaign on in November and in 2024. But I see a silver lining. Let him campaign in 2022, and make the issue about whether the US wants to go where Russia is. Do we want a Putinite running the US? If so, vote for Trump. Let's have an election about what it's really about for a change. Straight out, do you want to be ruled by an autocrat or do you want to keep trying to have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution#To_form_a_more_perfect_Union&quot;&gt;more perfect union&lt;/a&gt;? I think a very compelling campaign could be had. And if, in the end, the people want to be ruled by an autocrat, then that's where we're going next. I don't think it'll last very long, when Americans find out what it really means. There's a good chance it all falls apart when the Supreme Court overturns Roe.</description>

			<title>Worldle and Wordle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I play both these games it seems every day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt; is the less famous of the two. It displays a map of a country at the top of the screen. As with Wordle you guess what the country is in a stack of six boxes. It tells you how close you are for each guess, what direction the correct country is in and a percentage representing how close you got, 100 percent is perfect, the furthest you can be is 50 (I assume). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is 5398km from Bermuda, due east.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/todaysCountry.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;There's a lot of info you don't get, most important is the scale of the map. It could be 1000 miles or 3 miles wide. There are a lot of countries that are islands in the Pacific, Carribbean or Indian oceans. They have unique shapes just like the bigger countries. Although I think I have a good grasp of geography from having loved maps as a kid, there a lot more countries than I ever realized. For example, get out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://geology.com/world/cia-africa-map.shtml&quot;&gt;map of Africa&lt;/a&gt; sometime and ponder. The names may be familiar, but I had little sense of relative position or the shape of most of them. It's also fun to try to figure out where the ocean is based on the shape of the borders. There are no straight edge shorelines as far as I know. Some of the puzzles are easy, like Indonesia or Poland, and some are surprisingly difficult, like Greece. Did you know there's an island country in the English Channel? I didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler! Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/worldlerSolution.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of today's puzzle, I just guessed wildly in the last slot, knowing Spain was wrong. I basically gave up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/wordleSolution.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; puzzle really screwed with a lot of people's heads, mine too. I was lucky, my strategy made it possible to solve this puzzle, though in general I get lower scores overall because of the way I do it. For the first two or three guesses, I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just trying to find out which vowels are in the answer, and to eliminate most of the popular consonants. So in today's puzzle when I had two slots left, I had the last four letters right (as did most people) but unlike the others, I only had two possible choices left for the first letter. I guessed incorrectly first, and then got the correct answer in the sixth slot. Wordle's comment was &lt;i&gt;whew.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, my standard first word these days is &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.8em&quot;&gt;PENIS&lt;/span&gt;. I like it because it's got two vowels and three popular consonants.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt; is the less famous of the two. It displays a map of a country at the top of the screen. As with Wordle you guess what the country is in a stack of six boxes. It tells you how close you are for each guess, what direction the correct country is in and a percentage representing how close you got, 100 percent is perfect, the furthest you can be is 50 (I assume)." created="Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:07:50 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a160750"/>

				<source:outline text="There's a lot of info you don't get, most important is the scale of the map. It could be 1000 miles or 3 miles wide. There are a lot of countries that are islands in the Pacific, Carribbean or Indian oceans. They have unique shapes just like the bigger countries. Although I think I have a good grasp of geography from having loved maps as a kid, there a lot more countries than I ever realized. For example, get out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://geology.com/world/cia-africa-map.shtml&quot;&gt;map of Africa&lt;/a&gt; sometime and ponder. The names may be familiar, but I had little sense of relative position or the shape of most of them. It's also fun to try to figure out where the ocean is based on the shape of the borders. There are no straight edge shorelines as far as I know. Some of the puzzles are easy, like Indonesia or Poland, and some are surprisingly difficult, like Greece. Did you know there's an island country in the English Channel? I didn't." created="Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:32:50 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/todaysCountry.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a163250"/>

				<source:outline text="Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; puzzle really screwed with a lot of people's heads, mine too. I was lucky, my strategy made it possible to solve this puzzle, though in general I get lower scores overall because of the way I do it. For the first two or three guesses, I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just trying to find out which vowels are in the answer, and to eliminate most of the popular consonants. So in today's puzzle when I had two slots left, I had the last four letters right (as did most people) but unlike the others, I only had two possible choices left for the first letter. I guessed incorrectly first, and then got the correct answer in the sixth slot. Wordle's comment was &lt;i&gt;whew.&lt;/i&gt; Indeed." created="Fri, 11 Mar 2022 16:12:59 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/11/wordleSolution.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/11/160726.html?title=worldleAndWordle#a161259"/>

Ideally I'd have good communication with the devs who work on their blogging software. But writers and readers drive the process, ideally ones with experience with user testing software. All the while I'd publish my notes so other designers could emulate them. See, the thing is: RSS is supposed to be a standard, but in the early days there was a free-for-all wild west mentality that meant no one worked with anyone else because they were all hell-bent on world domination. The idea was I don't need you because I own this shit. Well you can't all own it. That made a mess of things. &lt;i&gt;Now it's almost 20 years later,&lt;/i&gt; and it should be obvious that hurrying up isn't the answer. We can create another mess, or we can slowly rebuild and create a strong, well-understood standard, and forget about world domination, let's just make a nice reading and writing environment. Software is an art, not just a way to get rich. That would be what I would focus on. I have a motto &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; Think about the 15 wasted years in RSS-land, and you'll see what I mean.

I think there's a chance we'll see a return to the more thoughtful blogosphere of the late 90s and early 00s, and I think Substack is part of it. I also would love to know, without having to dig through the app, if they've extended RSS, added a new namespace with Substack-specific data, or if it's straight RSS with common namespace extensions. Also it looks like their reader requires items to have titles. Is that so? I've been playing around with some new reader ideas, no claim that anything will ship, but one thing we have to accommodate is title-less posts, otherwise we're going to end up right back where we are now with a division -- the quick stuff on Twitter, and only long stuff in RSS. That was a divide forced on us by the now long-defunct Google Reader. Also factor in the idea that Twitter might be about to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/21/224554.html?title=twitterArticles&quot;&gt;longer titled posts&lt;/a&gt; to their ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: This is how Substack's reader deals with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/10/substackTitlelessPosts.png&quot;&gt;title-less posts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They generate a title from the permalink of the post. I don't think this is necessary, I think designers of readers have to pick a different starting point if they want to work with the way writing in the web works today. I know they don't pay any attention to me, which is really weird, because I do know a thing or two about this. But it is a fact, a lot of posts don't have titles. If your reader can't accommodate them, you have a problem, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Writing, reading and projection</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you read something, you're not in touch with the author's emotions, not when they wrote it, and esp not now, long after they wrote it. Emotions are fluid things, and unless you're very careful, it's unlikely that the emotions you are feeling, as you read the piece, are the author's. It would be a remarkable coincidence if they were. They're your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It just happened to me on Twitter, someone thought a tweet of mine was rage. I never feel that when I'm writing. Because writing is different, transcribing thoughts and feelings I had long ago. Writing feels very different. Usually I'm laughing out loud if I'm writing something that I really like. Writing is like riding a roller coaster. Often it's an exercise in frustration, but when you get it right, it's a wonderful feeling, it's a joyful act, paradoxically, even when you're writing about something that is far from joyful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case, I was writing an idea I had in the early 90s, and first wrote about in the mid-90s, at much greater length than in the tweet. In all that time, I've continued to hold the belief that we create each other, that we're a single species, not two. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, projection isn't fun, on the receiving end. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This was discussed at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/podcasts/the-daily/zelensky-putin-ukraine-war.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, where the reporter and host agreed that Putin will have a problem if he has Zelenskyy assassinated. I'd like to propose an alternate theory. Once Zelenskyy is gone, Putin will give a speech saying that the Nazis did it. He will have a black ribbon on his lapel, the standard thing people will wear to mourn the death of Zelenskyy. He will say Russia entered Ukraine to &lt;i&gt;protect&lt;/i&gt; Zelenskyy, not to kill him. They will round up some Ukrainian &quot;Nazis&quot; and kill them. The Russian army, their job done, will return home, leaving Uktraine to be run by a Putin puppet. I think this is much more likely than Putin repeating his mistake of invading Ukraine, or at least wait until a Putinite is in power in the US, and they've had a chance to withdraw from NATO, rendering it powerless,. Then all of Europe will recalculate and accept Russia as Stalin 2.0, and try to coexist, without the protection of the American nuclear shield. Putin can continue looting the United States, and get started on Europe.</description>

			<description>I went to the grocery store today. Gone are the masks and the plastic shields between the clerk and the customer. I was still wearing my mask. I wondered, when exactly did we conquer Covid? How did we do it? Spoiler: We didn't. It's very much still out there. Maybe the infection rates are low but they're not zero. I'm in the habit of wearing a mask, and I was far from the only one at the market today. I think I'm going to keep doing it. I see it as a way of saying to my fellow citizens that I care about your health.</description>

			<description>Last night, shortly before the net went down here, I saw an interview on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allinwithchris?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;Chris Hayes&lt;/a&gt; with a Ukraine legislator in the US lobbying for more assistance. She said something I forgot about, that Hayes didn't respond to, and he should have. We are actually obligated at least morally to defend Ukraine because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances&quot;&gt;agreement&lt;/a&gt; we entered in with them when they gave up their nuclear weapons after the break-up of the USSR. They were the third largest nuclear power. Had they kept their nukes, Russia attacking them would have been a far riskier move for Putin. It would be the exact thing we're all worried about if the US and Russia engage militarily. The doctrine of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction#:~:text=Mutual%20assured%20destruction%20(MAD)%20is,nuclear%20strike%20and%20second%20strike).&quot;&gt;Mutual Assured Destruction&lt;/a&gt; kicks in. We said we will protect Ukraine because they gave up their nukes. Oddly so did Russia, btw. Why didn't Hayes acknowledge this? Instead he rushed her off. He should've cancelled the rest of his program and asked his experts what they think of that. Doesn't bode well for Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, or Poland, Moldova, Rumania, Hungary, et al.</description>

			<description>Today was a internet outage day. I have a generator but the internet goes down when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cenhud.com/en/outages/&quot;&gt;Central Hudson&lt;/a&gt; power goes down, I guess they feel they're entitled to a day off, whatever. I hate it when the internet goes down. And I thought &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; would be fine without the net, but I guess not. I had this long excellent post written, but when I tried to move things around well it turns out it wasn't saving it. I wish I hadn't lost it. It was a lovely post. Score one for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit_happens&quot;&gt;Shit Happens&lt;/a&gt; crowd.</description>

It had been doing that once in a while during the day, Apple TV saying there are new episodes of shows available. Each time that happened I thought well that's it, the power is back, only to find out it's not. Those messages from Apple must be done on a calendar sort of thing. I had written a long post which I lost saying the power never comes back on in a way you imagine, because God is listening and one of Her favorite messages to poor humans is &quot;YOU HAVE NO CLUE&quot; and power outages are one of the most moral religious things out there.

			<source:outline text="I was on my way out to go for a walk, cabin fever hitting me hard -- and all of a sudden the phone in my back pocket starts buzzing as if I had messages. It had been doing that once in a while during the day, Apple TV saying there are new episodes of shows available. Each time that happened I thought well that's it, the power is back, only to find out it's not. Those messages from Apple must be done on a calendar sort of thing. I had written a long post which I lost saying the power never comes back on in a way you imagine, because God is listening and one of Her favorite messages to poor humans is &quot;YOU HAVE NO CLUE&quot; and power outages are one of the most moral religious things out there.

			<description>A non-kleptocratic Russia would consider NATO pointless, obsolete, go ahead have your NATO, just buy our products and come here on vacation. Russians would spend their rubles in other countries and eventually NATO would wither and die on its own.</description>

			<title>Between Taylor and Maggie</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://espiers.medium.com/do-journalist-need-to-be-brands-5e0510dfa67b&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by Elizabeth Spiers about a spat between Maggie Haberman and Taylor Lorenz which I had seen some of but didn't understand the bigger context. Now that I've read her summary, I wrote my own thread, reproduced here. BTW, I write my threads on Twitter using my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://thread.center/&quot;&gt;thread.center&lt;/a&gt; tool. I think everyone should use it. It's not about me making money, it's free, but I like to make software for users, and you can help by being one. Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't realize what the disagreement was between &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maggieNYT&quot;&gt;Maggie Haberman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I, as a user of news, represent a third point of view. I think we need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=rebooting%20the%20news&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;reboot the news&lt;/a&gt;, have needed to do that for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want news that is of the people, by the people and for the people. I don't think people should have big careers in news. A journalist is like a piece of networking hardware or software, they connect the experience and expertise of all of us to each other. They've gotten so far off track, they don't have any actual contact with people who aren't influencers in the TL sense of it or people in power in the MH model. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want any of that. I want to be informed and I want fresh ideas. And if I can't get it from journalism, I'll seek it out elsewhere. I had hoped that that process would have yielded something more tangible by now, but we are still controlled by journalism, and as I've written &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/05.html#a170242&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, they are not in any way accountable to us. That's not a good situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I doubt if any journalists will read this and if they do, I'm sure they'll find a way to dismiss it -- they always do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I used to be an influencer, often quoted in journalism, both off and on the record. I even did a little pseudo journalism as a contributing editor at Wired for a couple of years in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thing I heard but cannot place is that at one point Putin said he could buy anyone he wants. I wonder what would happen if Putin decided to talk to the people of the west, rather than rattling the cages of the people who own the west. Talk about a nuclear option.</description>

			<title>I'm flying blind about energy use</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's an idea of how to cut fuel consumption for electricity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My electric bill has been going up, dramatically. Not sure how much this is due to rising energy cost, or my purchase of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tesla&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; electric car last year, or something else. I use electricity for lots of things. More all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's the difference in cost between keeping the thermostat at 65 vs 60? Maybe it's insignificant, or maybe it's very significant. I have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have no tools to tell me what my electric consumption is graphed over time. If I did, I could for example, unplug the car and see how much the consumption goes down. Or turn down the thermostat to 60 and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who knows what my car is doing when I'm not watching? It has a mind of its own. Not like old cars that did nothing when they're turned off, my Tesla is always waking up and doing stuff. I bet that uses energy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of my devices is somehow malfunctioning and using a lot of energy and I could reduce consumption by replacing it, or leave it turned off unless I'm using it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all flying blind. Let's create the tools to optimize energy use. I bet it would save a lot of money and be a good way to cut energy consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeff Jarvis posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1500107275872133121&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about Ukraine on Twitter. My reply was too long to fit in a tweet, so I'm posting it here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read your whole thread, and agree -- it's confusing because norms are being busted now, norms of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction&quot;&gt;nuclear deterrent&lt;/a&gt; that has been present for all our lives. Putin went first. A nuclear superpower, which Russia is (which until now most seem to have overlooked), is not supposed to provoke another nuclear superpower so blatantly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin's complaint is he isn't getting the respect a nuclear superpower is entitled to. The expansion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO&quot;&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; into the former Warsaw Pact was insult #1, but that wasn't enough, NATO then added former states of the USSR. And that wasn't enough, the US promised to add Ukraine to NATO, as I understand it that was one of the final acts of the Bush II presidency, no one noticed here because we were obsessed with the financial collapse of 2008. This happened in a NATO meeting in Bucharest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I think the US and NATO sitting out the war in Ukraine is probably the right thing to do, because either way Ukraine is destroyed, and we're giving up a chance for politics in Russia to stop the next more provocative steps, if we were to intercede before Ukraine is settled. The sanctions will hurt, and I bet the Russians who care know what a debacle this has turned to. Why not take the chance that could work? If we go into the war in Ukraine, the war all of a sudden isn't the war with Ukraine, it's a war with the West. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I have a dream however unrealistic that Ukraine will defeat Russia, and then cross the border into Russia and take a few towns and maybe destroy them just to send a message to the Russian people that Putin is bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I've read your whole thread, and agree -- it's confusing because norms are being busted now, norms of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction&quot;&gt;nuclear deterrent&lt;/a&gt; that has been present for all our lives. Putin went first. A nuclear superpower, which Russia is (which until now most seem to have overlooked), is not supposed to provoke another nuclear superpower so blatantly." created="Sat, 05 Mar 2022 14:41:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#a144110"/>
				<source:outline text="Putin's complaint is he isn't getting the respect a nuclear superpower is entitled to. The expansion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO&quot;&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; into the former Warsaw Pact was insult #1, but that wasn't enough, NATO then added former states of the USSR. And that wasn't enough, the US promised to add Ukraine to NATO, as I understand it that was one of the final acts of the Bush II presidency, no one noticed here because we were obsessed with the financial collapse of 2008. This happened in a NATO meeting in Bucharest." created="Sat, 05 Mar 2022 14:53:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#a145343"/>
				<source:outline text="But I think the US and NATO sitting out the war in Ukraine is probably the right thing to do, because either way Ukraine is destroyed, and we're giving up a chance for politics in Russia to stop the next more provocative steps, if we were to intercede before Ukraine is settled. The sanctions will hurt, and I bet the Russians who care know what a debacle this has turned to. Why not take the chance that could work? If we go into the war in Ukraine, the war all of a sudden isn't the war with Ukraine, it's a war with the West." created="Sat, 05 Mar 2022 15:11:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#a151100"/>
				<source:outline text="Also I have a dream however unrealistic that Ukraine will defeat Russia, and then cross the border into Russia and take a few towns and maybe destroy them just to send a message to the Russian people that Putin is bullshit." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/05/144104.html?title=replyToJeffJarvis#aNaNNaNNaN"/>

At first you think okay I can understand that. But why should he care. We had Cuba 90 miles away from Florida for decades, they were a client of the USSR, and were spreading revolution all through Latin America, which according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine&quot;&gt;Monroe Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; was our sphere of influence. We didn't like it, and we did try to invade Cuba, but in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion&quot;&gt;small way&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn't work and that was the end of that. So why does Putin care if Ukraine becomes part of NATO. So what if they don't like Russia. Russia isn't going to get invaded the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia&quot;&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa&quot;&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; did. Why would they bother dealing with all the mud and the ferocious Russian soldiers. Why not just hurl a few nukes at them. I think we all know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340&quot;&gt;World War III&lt;/a&gt; will be fought with nukes. So what's the point in Putin owning Ukraine? Why not just launch some nukes at us. That's where this is headed, right? I'd love to see someone sit down with Putin, like a therapist, and work this out with him. What would his dream outcome be? What would make him feel like he won? This is all so confusing. The basic premise of the nuclear age was that something like this can't happen.</description>

			<description>I remember how wearying the Vietnam War was. Starting to get that feeling again. As with Russia and Ukraine, we were told to not think of it as a war, but it was a war.</description>

			<description>I recommend watching this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stellabelle/status/1499200399768752131&quot;&gt;Randi Zuckerberg video&lt;/a&gt; with the sound off. Apparently she's very excited about crypto currency. I wonder why. Isn't she drowning in money already?</description>
