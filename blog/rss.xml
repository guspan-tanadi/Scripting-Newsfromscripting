			<description>If Fauci had a podcast we'd hear what he thinks every day. You wouldn't have to go hunting for him. The public needs a pulse for guidance about what's going on. Not getting him on the podcast network at the time that say Cuomo was booting up was a mistake. I think it would have saved a lot of lives. I don't know, maybe he's being so effective inside the government that they can't spare him. But I've seen his main value this year as a reliable communicator.</description>

			<description>Saddest moment yesterday was when Trump said he was learning all about Covid. This is why the world should pity us. We have a no-president president. Can you imagine how much Obama would know by now if he were president. Oy.</description>

			<description>It's hard to believe but Repubs plan to challenge every absentee ballot in swing states. When they say it might take months to get a result, that's because they plan to make it take months. More info like this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/10/01/919131327/what-happens-if-trump-contests-the-election&quot;&gt;Thursday's episode&lt;/a&gt; of Fresh Air. You probably have no idea how screwed up this election is going to be, &lt;i&gt;by design.&lt;/i&gt; (Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-election-2020-donald-trump-local-elections-lawsuits-4298a514550323d39931f3e5fff2ccae&quot;&gt;Check out&lt;/a&gt; what they're doing in North Carolina.)</description>

			<description>You know how sometimes your brain as it scans sees one word but the word that's actually there is something else? It happens every time I see NakedJen's logo on Twitter. It says &quot;nakedjen anarchist &amp; agitator.&quot; But my brain always sees &quot;antichrist&quot; in place of anarchist. It keeps happening, finally I had to mention it. Sorry Jen, I have no idea what it means, if anything.</description>

			<title>What's wrong with Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about what's right with Twitter these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today -- Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing overshadows all other considerations. They swapped out the old user interface in favor of a new more modern-looking one. It is more attractive, better use of fonts, the text is generally more readable, and it has a brighter look. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But that's all that I can say about it that's good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's bad? The product is depressing. Almost everything it shows you is junk. They must be trying to get us to stop using Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the usual thing, users hate redesigns, but get used to them and after a while see that it's better in some ways, worse in others. I've been using it for a while, and it's every bit as ridiculous today as it was a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First all the spam friend requests are treated as super important, higher priority than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like opening your real-world mailbox and all you get are catalogs, mailers, special offers, political ads, notices, most of it goes in the garbage, but you have to look at everything, because there will be things you have to pay attention to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How can their code fail to see that all the friend requests I get are spam? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No one with any influence inside Facebook is using the version of the software we are using or they'd revert it immediately and then fix it. I've seen companies ship upgrades so bad the company failed, and this one is right up there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC yesterday. He talked for several minutes uninterrupted. Riveting. No doubt he's the best communicator the Dems have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; is great too, as is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt; (he should run for something). &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; excels, esp the last few weeks.

			<description>Also, I tried listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alfranken.com/listen&quot;&gt;Al Franken's podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He has a long ad at the beginning, and I don't do that. He should find a different revenue model. He's got a long road ahead to come back. The podcast should be instrumental in that, but the advertising disgusted me, and I won't listen to it. Too many people with something to say do this. Shame. Podcasting wires you directly into people's brains when they have the attention to really listen. Don't waste that selling some cheesy house ornament or utility.</description>

			<title>Checking in on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing in Twitter just now and it turned into a short list of where Twitter is at from my point of view. Likes and dislikes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One thing I dislike in Twitter is seeing links to interesting stories that I can't read because they're behind a paywall.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is happening more, it seems. I expect it is because the pubs are getting better at building circulation that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It seems Twitter could do something to help here. Either work out a deal with publishers that would allow Twitter users to read articles on a per-story basis. Act as a distribution platform. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Or give users the ability to say &quot;I don't want to see links to these pubs, because I don't subscribe to them.&quot; If we can't have the former, I want the latter. I'm tired of seeing links to stories I can't read. And subscribing to all the pubs with paywalls is ridiculous, of course. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I also dislike that Twitter is so hierarchic. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People decide whether something is important based on who the writer is. There doesn't seem to be much room for ideas to circulate on their own merit. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is a circle of commentators and you're either in or out. I'm out and you are probably too. (And I have a blue checkmark and tens of thousands of followers.) &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can say all you want, but if it's outside your perceived area of expertise, no one will hear it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm an expert in using and building the kind of networks we use today. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But everyone thinks they're an expert in this, so that expertise counts for little. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Having money automatically conveys value to your ideas. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the most transportable form of expertise, because (I guess) people think you can buy whatever expertise you personally don't have?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like writing in Twitter, and that makes me think a tool something like this for offline writing might be good.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a lot like an outliner. Chunks of text. Twitter has fuzzy ways of navigating the structure. Hard to feel it. Outliners are pretty clear about the structure. And the structure is editable in an outliner. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've often wondered if an outliner wouldn't make a good writing tool for Twitter. I don't do it that way, so obviously at that level it's not there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I dislike how hard it is to find something I wrote on Twitter. I pretty much have to get an idea into my blog so it can be indexed by the search engines. That's the only way I have any hope of finding it in the future. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Imagine you're a kid in a house where they love Trump. It's weird because they're admiring a bully, yet trying to make sure their kid knows bullies are bad. Every family has to deal with this one way or another. I wonder how they do it. Now there's a moral to the story. See, even the bully needs help from other people.</description>

			<description>When people said it was virtually certain that the new Supreme Court justice would be confirmed, you have to question it, because now it's anything but certain. All it took was for the White House to get infected. It's a central node in the US government. Seems likely its infection spreads to Congress and even the Court. Hard to imagine orderly business taking place in DC for a while, but who knows. Can't wait to hear what Mitch McConnell has to say, and if he was exposed.</description>

			<title>Judging Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of us, privately, will tell our friends that we're glad that Trump got the virus. He was living far more dangerously than he should have. It was amazing that he stayed uninfected this long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm ten years younger than him, I exercise every day, and I limit my interactions with other people drastically. Last week I went out to lunch with a small group of friends, outside. I've done that a few times since March, mostly in the last month. I also have serious pre-existing conditions that make me more vulnerable. My life is dramatically altered since we all went into hiding earlier this year. If I consider myself lucky to be virus-free so far, then Trump is blessed beyond belief that he got away with what he was doing for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the virus rages through the United States, and &lt;i&gt;he's responsible&lt;/i&gt; for that, and all the misery that comes from it. So yeah, it's good that he got it. If he survives, perhaps he'll do something to help, at least he won't be able to do more harm. If he doesn't survive, may he rest in peace -- and at the same time, good riddance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get over the impulse to cut him slack here. This is not a time for that, especially with the election so close. &lt;i&gt;This is our last chance to get rid of Trump&lt;/i&gt;. Stay focused on that. Is this event a positive for that? I'm not certain about many things but I am certain about this. Yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's totally okay to judge Trump. That's what elections are all about. We're trained not to do it, esp when someone is sick. This is not the time for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-alert-ny/&quot;&gt;Covid Alert NY&lt;/a&gt; on my Pixel 4a. It uses Bluetooth to collect IDs of phones I spend ten minutes within six feed of and remembers them for some period of time. If one of them reports positive with Covid, I get notified. It's contact tracing with phones that we've talked about for a while. Does it work? I guess I hope not to ever find out. Yes I know it probably is a huge drain on the battery and privacy.</description>

			<title>Happy birthday Uncle Vava</title>

He didn't even make it &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;to 60&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure he's happy on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie&quot;&gt;hippie&lt;/a&gt; beach in the sky. See you soon &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;Uncle Vava&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, people may not know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/28/212326.html?title=uncleKenAndAuntDorothy&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; was an early blogger. He, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;, were the first two users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, outside of UserLand. In 1998 or 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was my mother's brother, and nephew of German novelist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first member of my family born in the US. I was the second. He was only 10 years older than me, and was as much a brother as an uncle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems so weird that he could ever be as old as 75, but it's even more weird that he's been gone so long already. He died in Jamaica, in 2003, a few weeks before the first BloggerCon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ken and Dot, with a few of Ken's cars, on their land in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crescent+Beach,+FL+32080/@29.7387049,-81.2768389,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e69977c882aea5:0xe61a1afbdfe01fae!8m2!3d29.76886!4d-81.2536786&quot;&gt;Crescent Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
