			<description>Earlier today I used Google to try to find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few years ago. I am the author. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;. Well a bunch of people copied my file and posted it on their sites, with their template and their ads (I don't have ads), and for whatever reason Google ranks their docs higher. Mine isn't even on the first page. So tell me, how is that Google isn't implementing a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack? Why aren't they taking the heat for delivering incorrect results?</description>

			<description>Same thing happened with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;. There is only one original. Try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=rss+2.0&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=rss+2.0&quot;&gt;find it in Google&lt;/a&gt;. Lotsa luck. There's so much bullshit on the search results page. It's amazing we're trained not to see the lies that Google passes off as facts, but somehow we're supposed to hold the startup accountable instead.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT breakthrough</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I achieved something of a breakthrough with ChatGPT yesterday. I can now do the following: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Search for something in ChatGPT.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on a bookmarklet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A static HTML page opens, ready to be linked to from a blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB2RVlhm5SM&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/march-8-birthdays.html&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; generated in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; I am using, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcubic&quot;&gt;jcubic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/36bec44af6892abb870c5fa798bf7431&quot;&gt;Frontier script&lt;/a&gt; that runs on my desktop, every second.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;the app&lt;/a&gt; that syncs a folder with a location on Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Podcast Wars</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/15/chihuahua.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Re the supposed re-invention of podcasting, coming to a tech tabloid soon... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I probably should have explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/07.html#a182022&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; why having two or more groups claiming to be the future of something that currently no one is fighting over might damage the thing they say they’re trying to help (assuming they are saying that). We've been to this place before. How long before the press starts calling it The Podcast Wars. Some of us will try to douse the flames, to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/bombastic-meaning-4-words.html&quot;&gt;bombastic&lt;/a&gt; names because they want more for themselves than they want for podcasting. I have a lot of experience with this. People are always looking for a way to make a billion dollars. It never occurs to them that if it all has to be for them, there will be nothing. Now a whole new generation has to learn that again, and as usual the thing that pays for it is podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know all the people, or what they're planning to do, but the names they chose for their efforts tells me they don't want work with anyone, they may say they do, but they've reserved for themselves the authority over -- &quot;podcasting,&quot; if you can believe that bullshit. They're all little people trying to sound like big people. If you want to do some good for podcasting, throw your ideas out there in the middle, and fight for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;. When the other guy does something that you do, do it their way. That's how you build.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My sense is it's too late to fuck over podcasting, that it's mostly for the people involved that I ask them to lower expectations, and don't try to make this a business model. But if they want to do it, they'll do it and the press will have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22podcast+wars%22&quot;&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; to write about, and in the end &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/podcasting-definition.html&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; will stay what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/05/immanuel-quickley-carries-knicks-over-celtics-in-double-ot/&quot;&gt;Last night's Knicks game&lt;/a&gt; was wonderful. As the Nets gave up on their buy-a-championship nightmare, the slow-growth Knicks approach has been going great. I'm sure the Knicks would've signed KD or Kyrie if they had offered, but so thankful they diss'd the Knicks instead. Idiots. Now the normal order has been restored. Hopefully the Knicks continue to add pieces slowly and let home-grown stars like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;IQ&lt;/a&gt; continue to grow. It's intoxicating to watch him get the chance to excel as in last night's game, and completely exceed all reasonable expectations. The whole team is fantastic. Our loyalty to the team has paid off.</description>

			<description>It's time to see what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; is up to these days. I've had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; there for many years. Of course it has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.tumblr.com/rss&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. Previous posts are in March 2014 and then May 2011. The feed looks pretty straightforward.

They wanted me to put this text in a blog post so they could quote it. There was no request, no &quot;please,&quot; just here's the job. I didn't do it, and got a flamey email from the guy which surprisingly included a threat to never quote me again. What shocked me then and still shocks me today was how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma&quot;&gt;pro forma&lt;/a&gt; it seemed. The kind of thing they do for each other all the time in the news business? As far as I recall, I never wrote about it, and certainly never mentioned the name of the reporter. All that's interesting about it to me is that it appeared to be standard practice.</description>

			<description>BTW, I wish ChatGPT would statically render their results pages, so I don't have to do screen shots just to quote them. Make it easier for us to promote our discoveries. It's so ridiculous that in 2023 we're still using screen shots as the way to hook networks together.</description>

			<title>Dirty Shirt</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been to Jamaica a couple of times and I swear I've heard people use the term &quot;dirty shirt&quot; as a verb. My uncle Ken who lived in Negril for years, used the term too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What it means. When someone &lt;i&gt;dirty shirts&lt;/i&gt; you, it's as if they did something that left a stain on your shirt, something obvious and not nice that everyone can see.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Example: When my cousin sell me bad ganja he &lt;i&gt;dirty shirt&lt;/i&gt; me man.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when I searched for the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzWNBsqdLDa4woVMkIinhiwcSHSpNg:1677792242754&amp;q=%22dirty+shirt%22+%22jamaican%22+slang&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiegYuVl779AhVhMVkFHcFaDOoQ5t4CegQIMxAB&amp;biw=1551&amp;bih=1097&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;on Google&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/rastafariah.png&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, they offered weird and wrong ideas for what the term means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I checked in with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Dave+Jacobs&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; about this, he has the same understanding of what the term means, but he couldn't find our definition anywhere on the web either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/googleScreen.png&quot;&gt;correct&lt;/a&gt; definition will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dirty+shirt%22+jamaican+slang&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; up &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/2023/03/02/211954.html?title=dirtyShirt&quot;&gt;here on my blog&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find I'm starting to write like ChatGPT.

			<description>Tonight's Knicks game was pure delight. Haven't enjoyed basketball this much since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+linsanity&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;. I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; have left, everything is back to normal. Dallas and Phoenix can have them. Good riddance.</description>

I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; have left, everything is back to normal. Dallas and Phoenix can have them. Good riddance." created="Thu, 02 Mar 2023 03:34:49 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/03/01.html#a033449"/>

			<description>I continue to take a break after much michegas converting to email identity and HTTPS. I've got Electric Drummer more or less working, and I think I'm going to stop short of getting all of it working, given that I want to keep taking this break and am not up for more grinding away. Something changed over here, and I'm more inclined to let you all take care of yourselves for a while. Mastodon is fine, even though I can't write for it using the tools I like to use. So far only my blog qualifies, and my docs and this.how stuff. I'm enjoying the winter here in the Catskills and dreaming of other cool things to do. Software right now far from my mind. That could change at any time.</description>
