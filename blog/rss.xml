And on top of that, they took a series from the great Dodgers, boosting the team confidence even more. Then they lost a series to the Marlins and now were swept by the Cubs, both sub-par teams this year. The Mets might still win, because the Braves, their main competitors in the NL East, are slumping too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why people who really engage with sports laugh when the politicos on TV say they know how elections will go. Fuck you, you don't know shit a Mets fan might say. A Dodgers fan probably would be more polite but the sentiment would be basically the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm debugging memory usage of a database app in Node. As I do this high wire act, because to do these tests I have to change code and every time I do that, I run the risk of introducing a serious low level bug, I realize I'm using experience I got taking chemistry in my freshman year of college, many years ago. I've done this kind of work before, obviously -- I built a full featured commercial product for the Apple II when it had 48K of application memory. I swapped code in from disk which made the app kind of modal, and wrote in a high level language that generated dense pseudo code, much more memory efficient than machine code. People think that if you make software that regular people can use that you don't have to have deep technical skills. The opposite is true.</description>

			<description>From 2019: Trump is a TV show. If you want to get rid of 10 or more percent in his following, program a Trump TV show every night that isn't news, it's actors in a soap opera, playing the roles of people in Trump's white house. We hang out with him during oval office tantrums, and during pajama time in the morning with fox and friends, and watching tivo of rachel maddow at lunch time. If this gets too boring, have him masturbating. His fans just want to be at home with Trump. Give them what trump won't. Change the conversation from one about trump that he controls to one that is focused on his boredom, sloth, immaturity, depravity, bad hygiene (false teeth), criminal behavior and shitloads of lying. Introduce new characters, like his cardiologist.</description>

			<title>New strategy for feed text</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In the new feed management system, instead of stripping all HTML from the descriptions of feed items, we're now allowing &amp;lt;p&gt;s to get through. I want to have full text in my rivers, with a MORE icon that lets you see all the text. So the flow isn't dominated by long posts, but the text is there if you want to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I don't want all the quasi-malware that comes with feeds these days. My plan was to strip all the markup, but it really wasn't workable without the &amp;lt;p&gt; elements. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I put out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/215#issuecomment-1242749537&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; yesterday and got two good answers. Use regex or the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html&quot;&gt;sanitize-html&lt;/a&gt; Node package. I went with the Node package. It builds on a full HTML parser, so it's legit technology, not a hack (though I was happy to use a hack, have been for years). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/11/before.png&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/11/after.png&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; in screen shots. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a good call. I thought about enabling other HTML elements, but decided to stop here for now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Recall we already have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss&quot;&gt;support for Markdown&lt;/a&gt; in the feed system. So there's an even better way for friendly feed writers to do this, rather than trying to gum things up so badly that all we can do is nuke &lt;s&gt;all&lt;/s&gt; most of the markup. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A testbed for HTML in feeds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/stripMarkupInFeedItems/source.opml&quot;&gt;link that opens in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It contains the package.json, a template file and the JS code that reads an RSS feed and produces an HTML rendering of the items in the feed after running the description text through sanitize-html with the p's removed. Once written it made it easy for me to try out a lot of different combinations for the options, but I settled on the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple package&lt;/a&gt; to read the feed, and is thus a good demonstration of how easy that is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I usually would have done the work to put it into a GitHub repo, but this is a lot easier for me, because this is how I work on my code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If people can read the code in the outliner (you can!), that will make it possible for me to share a lot more code. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Mets are slumping now. I haven't even looked at the standings this morning, but they are in a deep rut, and who know when or how they will come out of it. Another thing that's like developing software. Sometimes everything's clicking, you go through each step methodically, and you do lose your way but you get back on track quickly. Even a team that's booming hits into double plays. And even teams that are winning, lose no less than 1/4 of their games. The league leading hitter only gets a hit 3 out of every 10 times they come to the plate. But when it's all clicking, you want to stay in the game.</description>

			<source:outline text="The Mets are slumping now. I haven't even looked at the standings this morning, but they are in a deep rut, and who know when or how they will come out of it. Another thing that's like developing software. Sometimes everything's clicking, you go through each step methodically, and you do lose your way but you get back on track quickly. Even a team that's booming hits into double plays. And even teams that are winning, lose no less than 1/4 of their games. The league leading hitter only gets a hit 3 out of every 10 times they come to the plate. But when it's all clicking, you want to stay in the game." created="Wed, 07 Sep 2022 14:23:42 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/09/07.html#a142342"/>

			<description>If you watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/06.html#a152242&quot;&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, creating a software product is done the way the sous-chef Sydney develops a new item for their menu. If you're going for the full effect, you iterate and test, think, go back and do it all, over and over until you've struck a good balance and compromises with reality. A product goes from dream to reality in many stages. In food and software, in everything.</description>

			<description>Most tweets promote the author rather than good ideas, although they think they're promoting good ideas. Most of the people who read them, if any do, already agree with them, or don't and are using their tweets to evoke strong body chemistry that they are physically addicted to.</description>

			<title>Would you like to be a slave?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was an excellent MSNBC show about the Civil War last night. At one point they interviewed a current-day Confederate. They almost got to the best question to ask such a person, which is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would you like to be a slave?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear the answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I asked if, when we were in our 20s, he thought we'd live to see marijuana legalized. He gave a vague answer. I said that's it! That's how it is with Trump facing justice. I have no idea, but it &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; happen. Stranger less likely things have happened.</description>

			<description>Inside your head is a thing called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious&quot;&gt;subconscious&lt;/a&gt; that's primitive, has little understanding of the world. It mainly sees you, and projects all its memories on you. It's looking out through your eyes the same way you view the cosmos. WIth awe but little actual understanding.</description>

			<description>I had a doctor who retired recently who always referred to me as a friend. I never doubted her sincerity, and it was a really good thing to do because it reminded me at a conscious &lt;i&gt;and subconscious&lt;/i&gt; level that there was trust between us. It's a given. If you can't trust your doctor, you need to get a new doctor. So I've started to do that in my own mind as I narrate projects to myself. Okay that's done &lt;i&gt;my friend. &lt;/i&gt;Let's figure out what's next friend. &lt;i&gt;My friend&lt;/i&gt; this is a hard problem. I just add the punctuation to remind myself that I trust myself, I'm doing something I'm good at, and know it. It really does manage the mood of my subconscious, it's reassuring. I got this, really means &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; got this.</description>

			<description>A friend who was an early blogger sent me a link to a story about how blogging came about and no mention was made of how blogging actually came about. He thought I should give them hell. It's the way it goes. All we are is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2w6Oxx0kQ&quot;&gt;dust in the wind&lt;/a&gt;. The journey is the reward. Live in the moment. It is what it is. Yadda yadda.</description>

			<description>We should all be fired up to vote Democratic thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization&quot;&gt;Dobbs decision&lt;/a&gt; and all the other rights the Supreme Court is poised to remove from all of us.
