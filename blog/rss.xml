			<description>Drummer users, we're almost ready to switch over to the new Drummer. If you want your files moved to the new server, you have to register your Twitter address and email address a new utility app. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/177&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; carefully. It takes less than a minute. All you need is access to the Twitter account you used for Drummer and to know what email address you want to use for your Drummer identity.</description>

			<description>What if friends treated their friends as nicely as they treat dogs. When you sensed they needed a little support, you'd look them in the eye and say &quot;Who's the good girl?&quot; Rub behind the ears and when they sit give them a treat. Inside of us, everyone, including you, is a little pup who just wants to know they're in the right place doing the right thing.</description>

The revulsion was gone. These were two New York teams, roughly comparable, and there weren't any carpetbaggers or Nazis on the floor, at least none that I knew of. The weird feeling was pride. This is NY basketball. I like it. Both teams have a good foundation to build on, and lots of first round draft picks in the bank, so there's hope for more talent. But don't import people who already have their championship rings who expect us to root for them. We want a unique experience, suitable for our great city. I'm still a Knicks fan, but I could see myself rooting for the Nets. BTW, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/heat/miami-news/nba-top-performers-of-the-day-feb-13-jalen-brunson-has-big-game-to-lead-knicks-past-nets&quot;&gt;Knicks won in a blowout&lt;/a&gt;, that also contributed to the good vibe. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If I were giving advice to NBA team owners, don't sign players who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving&quot;&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt;. No one wants to see a team win just because they bought famous players with no hunger, and no link to the hometown. I love where the Knicks and Nets are now. I think NY is the best basketball city in the NBA.</description>

			<title>It's Melotime!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It'd be cool if the Knicks or Nets bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; in for the rest of the season. For the fans! For history. Or just fun. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have the announcer say this when he scores... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carrrrmmmmellllllllllo&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Anthony!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have to, only put him in in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_time&quot;&gt;garbage time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's Melo!

I've been in that place, with Apple, a number of times. It would be really poor form for a Windows developer to gloat. I hope friends who have invested in other platforms remember the Golden Rule. Today we're moving as fast as we can and burning out, to get out of the way of Twitter's careening dumpster fire.

			<title>ChatGPT clearly has a place</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/16/simcity.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1624392828154712064&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; is worth money. I've given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chatgpt&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; programming jobs like the ones the author descibes, and it's saved me huge amounts of time. Last one was asking how to do something with the Twitter API. I could have spent fifteen minutes trying to find it in the docs, or on Stack Exchange, but I got the answer instead in a few seconds, and there was no bullshit, no preambles, just the answer to the question I asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example. Last summer I had a medical problem, and the local clinic that I go to is having problems keeping people on staff. My normal primary care physician, who I loved, had just retired (in her 40s) so I had to see three different doctors, and they all guessed wrong about what was afflicting me. Finally I got a new doctor and after two visits and one visit to a specialist, we had it nailed down, I got treatment and it's getting better. That's a full year of dealing with a problem because no one doctor could focus on the problem long enough to see what the problem was. As an experiment I tried entering the symptoms  to  ChatGPT and it warned me I should see a doctor, but then proceeded to get the diagnosis correct. This is the kind of thing that will save lives, improve overall health, and help our awful health system in the US cope with the fact that doctors are retiring because they have burnout jobs. It might even help the doctors cope with that reality and maybe not burn out in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that most of medicine is doing what ChatGPT does so well. Getting some data and then applying best practices. We all get the same treatment for the ailments we have and most of them are ordinary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam's Razor&lt;/a&gt; maladies (ie it usually is what it looks like it is and it usually is what everyone else has). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalists, who do most of the writing about news, immediately focus on how it might affect their careers, and imho educators zoom past the purpose of education, to create more better-educated people. As a kid, I had a party the day my parents bought us an encyclopedia. That meant we could settle arguments by getting facts. We could've gotten them before but that would've meant a trip to the library. Better tools make for better information. ChatGPT is a revolutionary tool. Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista&quot;&gt;Alta Vista&lt;/a&gt; was when the web first came out. I'm sure people screamed that it would screw up something. People always say that about change, esp people who are invested in the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there will be negative consequences of ChatGPT, but I'm sure we're not in a position to see what they are now, based on experience with similar changes. And maybe we'll look back on this moment twenty years from now, and not be able to imagine what life was like before we had this fantastic tool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You can scan from top to bottom and see who updated, and by clicking on the wedge next to feed, you can see the five most recent posts. It's a new kind of feed reader. You can see how it works by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;clicking this link&lt;/a&gt;. That's my feed list. You can view anyone's list. For example here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=ScottHansonDE&quot;&gt;Scott Hanson's list&lt;/a&gt;. You want to see a list of who has lists? &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?userslist&quot;&gt;No problem&lt;/a&gt;. All this without logging in. Unprecedented, goes far beyond feed readers. It's a group feed management system. New ground. Soon you'll be able to run your own server. It's getting close.</description>

You can scan from top to bottom and see who updated, and by clicking on the wedge next to feed, you can see the five most recent posts. It's a new kind of feed reader. You can see how it works by &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;clicking this link&lt;/a&gt;. That's my feed list. You can view anyone's list. For example here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=ScottHansonDE&quot;&gt;Scott Hanson's list&lt;/a&gt;. You want to see a list of who has lists? &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?userslist&quot;&gt;No problem&lt;/a&gt;. All this without logging in. Unprecedented, goes far beyond feed readers. It's a group feed management system. New ground. Soon you'll be able to run your own server.

			<description>One of the funny things about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/10.html#a020506&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; is that they pitched developers saying &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; I'm sure they meant it, but once &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot; title=&quot;All about RSS.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was established, they tried to replace it with an incompatible format. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; wasn't as powerful as Apple or Google, and their format didn't replace &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot; title=&quot;All about RSS.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. But, imho, when you push an open tech and someone takes you up on it, you should help, not fight them, ie if you really meant it.</description>

It was supposed to be the week we launched testing of feedlandInstall, enough of a stretch on its own, but it also simultaneously became the week that Drummer had to be converted to a new identity system and HTTPS, all happening at the same time, thanks to the implosion of the API at Twitter. It's okay, it is what it is. I went into it with my eyes open, I knew there could be a day when we had to quickly get out of TwitterVille. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This added some extra chaos to the feedlandInstall process because the products share a package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;, and I had to make changes to how it works to get Drummer working, and there was a risk of FeedLand breakage as a result, and some breakage has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will get there. A new Drummer without Twitter for identity and a new open source release of FeedLand's server so a thousand instances can bloom. Everyone will want to be part of a FeedLand workgroup the same way they are joining Mastodon instances. Communities of feed readers serving larger communities of news users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; responds to things you say when you didn't say &quot;Alexa,&quot; which contradicts everything Amazon says about privacy. If it doesn't listen, then how does it wake up exactly? BTW, Google does this too. Sometimes I'm recording a voicemail or a podcast using my iPhone and my Pixel 6 starts responding to what I am saying. It's funny, even cute, until you realize &lt;i&gt;it wasn't supposed to hear any of that. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Under development, not yet ready for users. But here's something cute. If FeedLand supports HTTPS in all its functionality, it will end up demanding that people with feeds support HTTPS too, and will fail for those who don't. If we continue down this path, I will be doing Google's work, helping them take ownership of the web. Here's the deal. Suppose you're displaying an item from a feed that includes an image. Suppose that image is served from an HTTP website, but your reader is running HTTPS. You won't see the image. The browser will refuse to load it. This came up when Scott Hanson tried to look at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/08/022722.html&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from Scripting News that contained a painting from RenÃ© Magritte.

The old moral of the story -- give an inch, they'll take a mile." created="Thu, 09 Feb 2023 16:55:37 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/09/magritteForMargin.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/02/09.html#a165537"/>

Why build something huge if the idea is small. The cost of staying with Heroku would have been totally diseconomic when full servers could run all my apps for $10 a month. Why should I pay Heroku $500 for the same thing, even though I had to do a lot of work to dig out of the hole. Now with Twitter, I think I'll just bow out, and let other people find out if this is workable or not. I'll leave my servers running, and if they stop working, we'll figure out what if anything to do then. None of the apps I've made that depend on Twitter are worth $100 a month to keep running. That's another story, because the Twitter ecosystem for cool utilities was practically non-existent. All that energy from now on clearly is going to Mastodon where there is no vendor who can turn the cart over, at least not yet (don't rule it out, it could happen).</description>

I am shipping the first open source version of FeedLand at the same time, working on both -- and this is really precarious work. Drummer will work as an outliner.

			<description>One of my favorite things on Twitter are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/lists/1389951899424677888&quot;&gt;art channels&lt;/a&gt;. The curators post reproductions of famous works of art. And occasionally RT another art channel they feel is related to their artist, that their viewers would enjoy. It's a way to broaden the art you get to see. When they talk about how horrible Twitter is they leave out stuff like this. However, without use of the API these channels can't exist, and since each is a labor of love, it's unreasonable to expect them to pay for it.</description>

			<description>A question for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt;. If you are off Twitter, where are we supposed to meet? What's our common ground? Serious question. Maybe it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@brentsimmons@indieweb.social/109815316574037279&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109818552360089269&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;. Is that the best we can do, feature-wise and from a UI and open formats and protocols standpoint, in 2023?

Far in advance of what we're using on Mastodon. I've been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml&quot;&gt;instant outlines&lt;/a&gt; feature of Drummer lately to organize my work on this complicated corner-turn I have to do because (as Brent points out) Twitter has become unreliable. I'd rather take care of this now than put it off for much longer. I'm asking this question in a lot of places. Why have we let the web stagnate? Why be preoccupied with the machinations of Musk et al. Why don't we take advantage of the new freedom we have in light of their chaos to build new stuff! Taking features out of products seems like giving up to me, or perhaps it's lightening the load. We'll see I guess.</description>

I'd rather take care of this now than put it off for much longer. I'm asking this question in a lot of places. Why have we let the web stagnate? Why be preoccupied with the machinations of Musk et al. Why don't we take advantage of the new freedom we have in light of their chaos to build new stuff! Taking features out of products seems like giving up to me, or perhaps it's lightening the load. We'll see I guess." created="Mon, 06 Feb 2023 15:43:59 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/07/drummer.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/02/06.html#a154359"/>

			<description>I changed my Twitter bio, removing the phrase &quot;I'm not trying to get rich or famous.&quot; I felt that was a bit holier-than-thou. And at times I most definitely am thinking about that. So it's a matter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt;. My rule is when what you appear to be is different from what you are, you should change one or the other or both. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/06/partITookOut.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; that highlights the part I took out. I am still dedicated to fixing things that are broken, but there's no unawkward way to say that, so I removed it too for now.</description>

			<title>A quick story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A little story I probably have written before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I once made an exciting product called Frontier just for the Mac, and this turned out to be a mistake, because while I was making the product, Apple changed, and they eventually attacked and destroyed my investment, which was considerable, and also set us back a long way, all of us, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm typing this on a Mac because right now this is the best computer for me to use. But what Apple did to us was terrible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is life. You have to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;s style=&quot;opacity: 0.9&quot;&gt;Note to people who read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog tab&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News and in the nightly email. &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, the tool I use for linkblogging, relies on Twitter identity. Twitter is not allowing me to log in. I see that's happening for other users too, but I've also heard of users who are able to log on to Radio3 via Twitter. Obviously I'm going to have to fix that app too. Until that happens, the linkblog will not be updating. Can't be helped.&lt;/s&gt; I'm not against Twitter btw, I see it as something that stretches back in time, and likely has some kind of future. It's struggling now, that's for sure. Maybe it'll come back together. I am most definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; rooting against it, and it bothers me to see other people doing it. This isn't a sport, it's a world-level communication system that we use. While Mastodon has taken the Twitter idea for its own, it is not in any way a replacement for Twitter. In the past few days it's become painfully obvious how much we depend on it, and how it's negatively impacting my work when it's in trouble. I don't see any victory really for anyone in this other than people who get a charge from of other people's misery.</description>

It would take too much time to try to keep both versions running at the same time. So I have redirected it to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.lucky.wtf/&quot;&gt;temporary placeholder site&lt;/a&gt;, and when the new site is ready, it will redirect to that site. We will then have to figure out how to have your data meet you on the other side. So this will happen in several steps, of which this is the first. And in doing this I will learn how to do it for other sites such as Radio3, BingeWorthy, etc. If you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/174&quot;&gt;see this thread&lt;/a&gt;. Please don't ask when will it be ready. This is still seat-of-the-pants unfortunately due to the randomness of the changes at Twitter. Also, your data is safe.</description>

I tried to clue Jack into this, but he was always dreaming of really cool shit, and all we want is a simple package of services that work and have no patience for science experiments. Identity and storage that the user pays for and grants access to our apps. We'll do the creative stuff. Storage and identity has to be boring and reliable, and not subject to having the rug pulled out from us. It's something we need to build on, at the very lowest level of the stack.</description>

			<description>BTW, yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/03.html#a020601&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with my Android phone was solved quickly by a number of readers. Thank you all very much. It was right there in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/03/androidscreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow &lt;i&gt;Do Not Disturb&lt;/i&gt; mode got turned on. I never would have done that on purpose. This is a phone I use mainly for listening to podcasts and audiobooks and for 2-factor identity. Why does it turn off media? What kind of sense does that make. And from a UI standpoint, there should be some clue somewhere near the slider as to why that it's disabled. I tried to find the answer on Google and ChatGPT before broadcasting the question. Neither had any good advice about this.</description>

			<description>Speaking of audiobooks, Amazon's service, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+audible.com&quot;&gt;audible.com&lt;/a&gt;, which I used to subscribe to, is a huge ripoff. You have to be an active member to listen to the books you bought. So you can't, if you have too many unread books, suspend the service so you can start to catch up. For the most part Amazon is pretty good at not keeping money it isn't entitled to. If something goes wrong and you jump through all the hoops, they give you your money back. They want a long-term relationship, it seems. But this policy of Audible's seems to be the exception. As if they don't give a shit what you think of them. How very un-Amazon.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;this started out as a mastodon post in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@billseipel@fosstodon.org/109807807318592852&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; but i went way over the 500 char limit, so I just posted it here instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i develop whole products as does marco.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;a funny thing happens when people think you do much less than what you actually do, they hire people to replace you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;that's what happened with adam curry and myself back in 2005. he had no idea what i do, he and his partner ron bloom thought they could save some stock and they thought i was being &quot;difficult&quot; (I guess) by not taking orders from bloom, so they hired a couple of programmers to replace me, and guess what happened. nothing. they wasted $100 million in vc money, and barked up the wrong tree. if they had worked with me they wouldn't have done that, but they would have had to listen to a mere coder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;same thing happened when RSS became a VC thing, none of them wanted to work with me, so they hired &quot;software engineers&quot; and they created products that somehow weren't up to the opportunity. all the companies failed. none of the VCs had the vision or just common sense to bet on the only developer who had proven he knew what was actually going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;all my career people have been minimizing what we do with disastrous results. go back to my first silicon valley gig, with personal software in 1980. the ceo of the company told me to my face he could do a better job writing the software i was doing, but was too busy to do it. he was full of shit. you had to be really motivated in ways few &quot;coders&quot; are to get a 256K program to run in 48K. (which is what the app turned into when we ported it from the apple ii to the ibm pc) Not to mention invent a new freaking category of software. (To his credit the CEO did think of doing outliners before he met me, though his idea of an outliner didn't amount to much more than a start down the path.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;you can't make things better by giving into the bullshit money people and marketing people and people who took a few college classes in comp sci impose on our craft. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In the new world, Drummer will manage identity for itself using email addresses, and thus it will use HTTPS. So the first step in the conversion is getting rid of all the hard-coded http URLs in the app. I'm sure they're not all gone yet, but the app does boot up without errors now both on a test server (which uses HTTPS), and the same code runs on the current Drummer site (which uses HTTP). You can help test it out by using Drummer with the JavaScript console open, and note any errors that have to do with HTTP and HTTPS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/173&quot;&gt;report them here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>This is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/03/androidscreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the Sounds panel of my Android phone. Note that the Media slider is disabled. This means that while the speakers work, I can't listen to any podcasts, audiobooks or music. How do I get the slider to be re-enabled? I've already tried restarting the phone a few times.</description>

			<description>Starting to do small things for the corner-turn away from Twitter. We no longer have RT icons on items on the Scripting News website. And there no longer is a button in the upper left corner that lets you log on and off of Twitter. Watch this space for more updates, and I'm also adding notes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/252&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about changes people are making.</description>

			<description>When you build on corporate APIs you have to know there's a fair chance the owner will pull the rug out on you, as twitter is doing now. The only APIs you can trust are open APIs that arenâ€™t owned by anyone -- like the web -- http, html, rss. You have to watch out because the bigcoâ€™s will try to own those too. Journos are oblivious. Canâ€™t get their attention. To a large extent Google &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; owns the web. And they are throwing their weight around in much more consequential ways than twitter. But Google is invisble to the press. That will end some day.</description>

			<description>So journalists, thereâ€™s nothing surprising about twitter screwing with their api. But we should be nailing Google for trying to steal the open web.</description>
