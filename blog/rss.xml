			<description>What did Trump imagine he would do if he got to the Capitol? Was there a plan? Was there a team of Proud Boys waiting for him. Would he have presided over VP Pence's lynching? Did he imagine giving a speech to a joint session of Congress? Too bad SNL isn't in season.</description>

			<description>Biden is keeping the seat warm for DeSantis. Unless he steps aside after the November election and lets the next gen of Dems duke it out.

			<description>My blogging ethos came from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog&quot;&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/a&gt;. They moved from technical howto-type stuff to whatever was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand&quot;&gt;SB's&lt;/a&gt; mind. If the ideas come from the same mind, and the pub is a product of that person's mind, it's perfect. I remember reading it at my uncle's house in Florida, totally off the grid little geodesic he made himself. I loved the Whole Earth book because it seemed like my uncle. an engineer and hippie. He was another big influence in my path to eclectic, jumping where my mind wanted to go, even if it took years.</description>

			<description>One of the miracles of the web. I sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1541813885870788608&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; to Heather Cox Richardson, and she responded. Even though I'm not a historian. I love it when the quality of an idea makes a difference, not the qualifications of the person asking the question.</description>

Until we do that, honestly, we cannot be a country.</description>

			<description>BTW, the best Silicon Valley novel ever imho is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;Microserfs&lt;/a&gt;. After you read the book, it programs you to think you're &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the book. Amazing how complete the virtuality is.</description>

			<title>Can I have a TLD please?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/register-domain-name-2017-06-20-en&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that companies can register and run &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain&quot;&gt;TLDs&lt;/a&gt;, I've been somewhat obsessed by the idea of running one myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea, a TLD for the feed-o-sphere. I'd like to have a feed named &lt;i&gt;dave.feed.&lt;/i&gt; When you access my domain it returns the content at a URL you specify and can change. So where ever I may be blogging today, you may find my feed at that address. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the questions are basically: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How much money does it take, up front and periodically? Who gets the money? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How much time does it take to apply for the TLD, and what are the requirements to be approved?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you make a TLD non-profit, and does that affect the cost?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it only for companies or can individuals register TLDs?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What questions have I missed?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/236&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on my blog's repo to discuss, or you can respond &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1541872442024550403&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but I'd prefer on the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Not &lt;i&gt;dave.rss.&lt;/i&gt; I tried that for a while and got all tied up in a revolutionary movement in India, or something like that. No thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An analog for software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect analog for the software we develop. We strive to make it simple, but under the covers the simpler it is the harder it is to master. After a while you can't add more functionality without breaking it every time you make a change. So the challenge to make more powerful software is to invent ways to simplify what's going on behind the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simple user interface, complexity behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: This illustration came from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SharadBishnoi05/status/1540552557856161792&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SharadBishnoi05&quot;&gt;Sharad Bishnoi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Roe v Wade overturned</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Roe v Wade &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0&quot;&gt;overturned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/24/theDemocratsAreLame.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: The Democrats are lame, that's also a problem, just as bad at the Repubs being Putinites.

Declare the Constitution defunct, and go on from there. One side respecting the Constitution and the other side ignoring it is not a workable situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Politically, tag every Republican candidate for *anything* with this decision. It's a referendum on freedom. The Repubs, each and every one of them, are on the wrong side of this. Make them defend it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you haven't seen it yet, now's the time. The last minute.  This is what the majority said: Basically the right to an abortion is nowhere in the Constitution. If you want a right to an abortion, get Congress to pass a law. Or, I suppose it could have been more extreme, that the reason it isn't in the Constitution is the same reason murder isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know, I'm the furthest thing from a legal scholar. But we have entered a new reality, leaving one where almost everyone alive today came of age in a world where abortion was safe and legal, trying to deal with the consequences of that no longer being true. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, how do we respond to the idea that anyone in NYC could be carrying a concealed weapon. Someone might bump into you on the street and draw a handgun and someone else could draw one too, and there would be a shootout on 5th Ave in broad daylight and there wouldn't be a law you could pass that would prevent it, that wouldn't ultimately be struck down by the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what hasn't changed and must, first, before anything else can really. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've written about this at length. It should be the people's party, and that means organizing the people every minute of every day of every year. Our political parties used to be machines for getting people elected, and that worked when both parties agreed the role of government was to govern, but that hasn't been the case since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need a party that spans all political ideaologies. We're already seeing this happen, it was predicted on this blog years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, everyone agrees, is a gift from god. A possible savior of our sanity. And she's probably okay with people carrying guns in Manhattan or not having sex so they don't need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepLizCheney/status/1540361645159055360&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah she's crazy all right. But she's our kind of crazy, &lt;i&gt;American&lt;/i&gt; Crazy. Not Putin Crazy (which is what the Republican Party is now).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, when the Repubs have gone Russian, the Democratic Party as it was previously conceived no longer works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this at some length in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;The Getting-Shit-Done Party&lt;/a&gt;, May 4, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It shouldn't be 6-3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court shouldn't be 6-3. At worst it should be 4 conservatives, 3 liberals and 2 moderates. That is, if two Democrats had behaved rationally and with courage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;President Obama. He didn't have to accept what the Repubs tried to do to Merrick Garland. He could have waited a decent amount of time for the Senate to advise and consent, and assume they consented, and walked Garland, himself (with the Secret Service) over to the Supreme Court to take his seat. Who would've stopped them?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Justice Bader Ginsburg. Yes we love her, but.. She was sick, and the chances of her dying were too high for her to stay on the court past Obama's tenure. Then Obama would've nominated a moderate like Garland, and gone through the same process of walking the new Justice to the Court himself with the Secret Service.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;4-3-2 is a pretty good configuration, so much better than the 6-3 disaster we're dealing with now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The last couple of years have been good for the Knicks, not because they got anywhere near a championship, they didn't -- but they had a group of exciting players that we fell in love with. I don't want to follow Quickley or Toppin if they're playing for some other team. I want them in Knicks uniforms, for years to come. In 2012 I wanted to root for Jeremy Lin and his supporting cast for at least two or three years, but Knicks management broke up the team before the beginning of the next season. I guess that like all industries they mainly care what their peers think, and they have narrow and mostly wrong ideas about what the fans care about.</description>

I'm also making sure that we don't break urls as we go along and I change things. For example, this is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmailbox?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; that changed in two ways. It should still work, getting us a mailbox view of the feed for this blog.

			<title>Mailbox-style readers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed how some feeds look great in a mailbox-style reader while others don't. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffallows.substack.com%2Ffeed&quot;&gt;feeds from Substack&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadamsinger.substack.com%2Ffeed&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; in mailbox readers because their items are full-text titled essays. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnytimes.com%2Ftimeswire%2Ffeeds%2F&quot;&gt;NYT feeds look terrible&lt;/a&gt; in mailbox readers, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;does Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The mailbox reader, which was popularized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/12/154157.html?title=googleReaderNineYearsLater&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, is designed for titled full-text feeds. The NYT has titles on its feed items, but not full text, just a synopsis. There's so much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/22/wastedSpace.png&quot;&gt;wasted space&lt;/a&gt; in the display. It feels unbalanced. I like whitespace, but that's not what this is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The incredibly useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=https://news.ycombinator.com/rss&quot;&gt;Hacker News feed&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty weird in a mailbox-style reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt;, and feeds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;Drummer blogs&lt;/a&gt;, some posts have titles, but most don't. A mailbox reader can't deal with untitled posts, I've given up on trying to make it work, it just doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The NYT and Scripting work much better in a river-style display, which is the pattern that Twitter and Facebook use, as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: We have to move away from mailbox-only feed readers. Mailboxes are great when the items are like email messages. But that's far from all there is. We have to try out new ideas, lots of them. And to do that I'm making it easier to try new ideas out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Echoes of 2002</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have the same attitude about &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 as I did in 2002. I wanted to move, to clean up the mess, start with a fresh new foundation. It worked then, and I believe now twenty years later it'll work again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much has changed. There was no Twitter or Facebook in 2002. None of the writing systems we use now existed. I think RSS 2.0 even predates Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have found a way to make it much simpler and easier to evolve feeds on the web, and I'm not waiting for permission I'm just going ahead. That's in fact what happened after RSS 2.0 with podcasting. We just did it, no one objected, and off we went. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The theme is totally opposite of the one in 2002, when I was basically finishing RSS, and giving it over to everyone to do with as they please. The roadmap said it clearly. This is it. No more new stuff in RSS itself. If you want to add to it, you can, but to get support for your ideas you're on your own. I wasn't signing up for another stint as notetaker for this particularly community. It was too thankless a job. But guess what, not much happened. The RSS people are using today is pretty much what they were using 20 years ago. There have been some new applications, and there are some respectful projects to add a new namespaces. That's more or less what the roadmap called for. So without any leadership, it kind of took care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, RSS as they say is what it is. There's also Atom and RDF, these exist and are in use. Very little if any innovation across the whole market, all of the new stuff has been in the individual products, but there are severe limits on what they can do because the format isn't moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My thought is that I can write some new software, as everyone else is, but with the thought that I want people to do the same as I am doing. At the same time, I don't care if you do it or not, if you pick up the ideas or don't. All I'm looking for is a critical mass of people who want to experiment with a new cleaned-up simplified feed system built on what was built before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Holding grudges, fighting forever wars, trying to cancel others is childish &amp; petulant. We move forward faster when more people join the former category.&quot;</description>
