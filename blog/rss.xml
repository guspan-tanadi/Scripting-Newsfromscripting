			<description>An idea re Andrew Cuomo. Do a full investigation. Invite all accusers to come forward. The allegations are published by a 9/11-style commission. Then have an election, let the voters decide. I explained in some detail how I feel about this situation in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/02/theCuomoProblem.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I recorded yesterday. Summary: No I don't think Cuomo deserves our mercy, I think &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; deserve it. He led us very well during the darkest days of the pandemic, and for all we know even darker days are ahead. We are not out of the woods yet, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972952844/texas-and-mississippi-to-lift-covid-19-mask-mandates-and-business-capacity-limit&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/us/texas-governor-mask-mandate/index.html&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; are acting as if we are. The very things that make Cuomo such an asshole may also make him a great leader in times of trouble. In this way it's totally parallel to the Al Franken cancellation. Also I suggest his daughters, whom we've heard a lot about (too much, although his critiques of their boyfriends were funny, I guess, you may have to be from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; to get the humor), have a talk with him. Sit him down and make him listen. Dad we can possibly save your ass if you listen now. I'm guessing they know how unacceptable his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-209&quot;&gt;non-apology apology&lt;/a&gt; is. But ultimately this is not a decision for the press, or for other politicians, it's for the voters of New York to make. I think that in all but the most egregious emergencies, that's the right answer.</description>

			<description>BTW if you asked me when I was a kid if Queens would someday elect a president, have the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grubstreet.com/bestofnewyork/absolute-best-chinese-restaurants-in-flushing-nyc.html&quot;&gt;Chinese food&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and pretty much every other kind of Asian ethnic food, I would have thought you were out of your mind. On the other hand no one expected the Mets to win the World Series in 1969, so there's that. Queens is a weird place. But it's kind of nice that the world comes to Queens these days, and it emanates from Queens too.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/03/144317.html?title=myFatherApologized&quot;&gt;On this day last year&lt;/a&gt;, in a dream, my father, who never apologized for anything to anyone at any time in his life, as far as I know, apologized for something. I accepted it, and we became friends. Does it mean my subconscious is ready to forgive and move on, or did my father, after being dead for 11 years, process his life and realize it was time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_step9.pdf&quot;&gt;make amends&lt;/a&gt;? I don't know, but re-reading the post, I was able to feel the relief today that I felt last year. One of the many wonders of having a blog. I went back looking for comments about the looming (then) pandemic.</description>

			<description>Yesterday with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/02.html#a171711&quot;&gt;power outage&lt;/a&gt;, I listened to a lot of podcasts, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/opinion/the-argument-congress-filibuster-senate.html&quot;&gt;The Argument&lt;/a&gt; from the NYT. They had a two-sided discussion of the filibuster. One side for getting rid of it, and the the other for preserving it. The latter was argued by a establishment Republican &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JessAnderson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/&quot;&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I kept thinking, they aren't the other side any longer. They represent possibly 10 percent of the Republican Party which represents maybe 40 percent of the electorate. The real &quot;others&quot; are the nutjobs and fascists. They want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc&quot;&gt;burn the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; down. I doubt if they have anything specific to say about the filibuster. I'd love to hear a debate between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein&lt;/a&gt; faction (smart, thoughtful, polite) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy&quot;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; who runs the US Postal Service or Josh Hawley. I also listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mea-culpa-with-michael-cohen/id1530639447&quot;&gt;Michael Cohen podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He has something. A real radio personality. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lawn%20Guyland&quot;&gt;Lawn Guyland&lt;/a&gt; guy for sure. Surpringly it held my interest.</description>

			<title>Sex in the workplace</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was founder and CEO of a small Silicon Valley company in the 1980s. A few dozen people at its peak. I had invested everything in the company, and it was touch and go all the way. If I lost, I would have been totally broke, financially and personally, so I didn't have time to play around. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also had a girlfriend, a long distance relationship, and remember being frustrated that her friends told her no man could be faithful that long, but I was. Maybe I was a fool because I got blamed for it anyway. But that's not the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of women in the company, including execs. I wanted the best people I could get for the job, and I was raised by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt; who was accomplished and smart, so I believed in the idea of gender balance and practiced it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also was propositioned a fair number of times by women who worked for me. Totally inappropriate. I brushed them off, but occasionally had to sit down and say this was something you could get fired for, if it didn't stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was so much sex going on in the company. And there was also gossip about who I was sleeping with (CEOs get gossiped about, no surprise). The whole thing was depressing. Our company was often on the brink of going under, and to some it was just a job, and maybe they felt it was hopeless, but I couldn't afford to. And there was no way to stop the gossip without making the issues even bigger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually we had a hit product, and noticed that when the company was growing the gossip became less important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of the story is that sex in the workplace is complicated. It isn't just about men with power using it to take advantage of lower level employees. I think a lot of people must know this, and are overlooking, deliberately or not, when discussing this topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330&quot;&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; I made a change to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute&quot;&gt;script scheduler&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to get rid of drift, so that the nightly email would go out more or less precisely at midnight. The fix worked. Sometimes it's one second after midnight, but usually it's exact. The important thing is that any difference is not cumulative, it gets back on track on its own the next day. Here's a screen shot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/02/footer.png&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/a&gt; on last night's email.</description>

			<description>The weather. Oy! Very cold very windy and the power has been out, on and off, since yesterday afternoon. I charged up all my devices before the power went out and loaded up lots of podcasts, so I'm very entertained. Made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy82ekHbVpM&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;nice fire&lt;/a&gt;, but the house still got down to about 45 degrees. I was worried about pipes freezing if the outage lasted much longer. But the power is back at about 12:20PM Eastern and I'm feeling pretty good now.</description>

			<description>DocServer was a Mac app, before there was a web, that let you read the verb docs for the UserLand scripting language. Once we transitioned to the web, DocServer became a web app, managed by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;. I had forgotten it was an app before it was a website. And, btw, it was fully scriptable, as were all the apps we were making at the time. Here's a screen shot.</description>

			<description>I was asked what would you do if you were in charge of the Dems. Okay. I would do the equiv of what Trump did on Jan 6, but do it legally, within the limits of the Constitution. Turns out the Constitution gives the Dems enough power to do what's needed. Yes, it will provoke what remains of the Repubs. So when are you going to stop worrying about that and realize that the rest of us have been totally provoked. They don't worry about provoking us. Maybe that's something we have to fix.</description>

			<description>Like many others I learned to live with an alcoholic parent. You try desperately not to provoke them. They drink and that's all the provocation they need.

			<description>I am pissed that the press is going after Andrew Cuomo, who led us through some very dark times, when it helped to feel like someone was in charge. We may need that again, and thanks to this purge, he may not be available. But if you really want to nail him, learn about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_New_York_City_mayoral_election#General_election&quot;&gt;1977 campaign&lt;/a&gt; between his father and Ed Koch, for mayor of NYC. It was very mean-spirited, and Andrew was part of it. I find what the Cuomos did utterly abhorrent, but you know what, we still need people who can lead. Perfection is nice, if you can afford it. We can't.</description>

I loved my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen&quot;&gt;first editor&lt;/a&gt;, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes.</description>

I loved my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen&quot;&gt;first editor&lt;/a&gt;, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes." created="Mon, 01 Mar 2021 14:09:09 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/01.html#a140909"/>

			<description>I have Apple's credit card, and it's got good integration with iOS as you would imagine. I get a notification every time some business charges my card. That's a killer feature.</description>

			<description>Good morning! March is coming in like a lion for sure. It sucks. This afternoon a super cold front is blowing in, after a warm few days, with slush everywhere, and it's all going to freeze. Oy. I got so tired of living in California. Oh no another beautiful day, when will the torture end. Right now I'd give anything for a warm breeze, a bit of green, some flowers, a bike ride perhaps. Can't come soon enough. Anyway welcome to another month of my life.</description>
