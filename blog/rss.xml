			<description>I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/11/air-fryer-explained.html&quot;&gt;air fryer&lt;/a&gt; and had a chance to try it on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_eye_steak&quot;&gt;rib-eye steak&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and omg it was sooo good. It took six minutes to cook, and then a few minutes to &quot;rest&quot; and it was as delicious as a steak off the grill, but without any of the work.

I don't think I judge anyone based on their conformity. But I think I am always judged negatively for not conforming. It's all very confusing.

This item is about last night's episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt;. I'm aware that one of the reasons I like to binge-watch TV series is the simulated community of it. Social contact is a basic human need. But our society has moved online, and then there's Covid, and that's why simulated communities that satisfy our requirement for social contact are so popular and valuable. It's relaxing to check in with a group of fictional people every so often, to see them behaving with ordinary human dysfunction, so our subconscious can project itself into their drama. The death of the central figure in a simulated community is why I feel so unsettled today, I think. At first I couldn't place it. What happened? I have a fairly ordinary week planned. Spring is arriving in the mountains. Then I remembered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/tv/23674287/succession-season-4-episode3-logan-dead-conners-wedding&quot;&gt;what happened&lt;/a&gt; last night.

After programming in JavaScript for almost a decade, I still don't accept the basic design choice they made to require that whether or not a function does I/O is visible in the syntax of the program. It's exactly the kind of thing that should be sucked down into the interpreter. It makes the code 10 times more expensive and fragile. And achieves absolutely no efficiency. Zero benefit. I don't know why other people don't see this, but I'm going to keep going until others join up and help. It's the same approach as we used in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, only in this case the scripts run at the command line, like bash scripts. And they run as Node.js apps, so they have access to all the packages Node apps have. I'm just starting to use it myself, just for little utility things. It works great.</description>

After programming in JavaScript for almost a decade, I still don't accept the basic design choice they made to require that whether or not a function does I/O is visible in the syntax of the program. It's exactly the kind of thing that should be sucked down into the interpreter. It makes the code 10 times more expensive and fragile. And achieves absolutely no efficiency. Zero benefit. I don't know why other people don't see this, but I'm going to keep going until others join up and help. It's the same approach as we used in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, only in this case the scripts run at the command line, like bash scripts. And they run as Node.js apps, so they have access to all the packages Node apps have. I'm just starting to use it myself, just for little utility things. It works great." created="Mon, 10 Apr 2023 15:57:32 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/28/ifyoudontlikethenews.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/04/10.html#a155732"/>

I asked how much they were spending to keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/&quot;&gt;my personal chatbot&lt;/a&gt; up, and they said it would fit in their $99 a month plan. Not wanting to depend on their generosity in this way, they're young and just starting up, I signed up. I think it's worth that much to have a personal playground and have them do the hosting and also collaborate on new features. I'm going to help them recruit really special people to use their service, because that's where I think the juice is right now. People who already have interesting content flows (ie blogs) that could be pushed through this new kind of software machine. At the same time I've been trying to encourage my friends at Automattic to get involved in helping people with ideas flow them into chatbots via their chatblogs. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>About Radio3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a164206&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml#1680702347000&quot;&gt;linkblogging&lt;/a&gt; capability in FeedLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was always the plan to add this to FeedLand, but I moved it up because someday soon I expect &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; to stop working because it depends on the Twitter API for identity, and they seem to be breaking devs all the time these days, but so far not Radio3. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rather than converting Radio3 to email identity, I decided to move its core features into FeedLand which already has email identity. It took a few days, and they were mostly enjoyable, because I do dialog stuff much better today than I did when I wrote Radio3, which was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/08/29/#a1409347551&quot;&gt;long time ago&lt;/a&gt;! It totally needed a rewrite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But -- for now I'm continuing to use Radio3, because it can post to Twitter and Mastodon, and anyone who's subscribed to that feed should keep subscribing. I never like to rock the boat, too many other things worth doing, and maybe Twitter will never break Radio3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE&quot;&gt;It could happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime as far as I can tell &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; still works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the day that Radio3 stops working, at least this is some work I won't have to do. I will have a linkblogging tool ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And no one will be bothered by my Radio3 feed going quiet because nothing was going out that way anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And FeedLand's linkblogger will be infinitely better than Radio3 because it works. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my advice is, don't depend on FeedLand for linkblogging if you already have your Radio3 act together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

One of the reasons I rarely see links from them is that they still apparently don't have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=semafor+rss+feed&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for their stories. If they had a feed, I'd be subscribed and I'd be much more likely to notice, and would probably occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/110146691152214416&quot;&gt;pass a link&lt;/a&gt; on to my followers. There is a distribution system that helps new pubs like Semafor boot up. My advice, do two things: 1. Put a linefeed at the end of each line in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/05/viewsource.png&quot;&gt;HTML source&lt;/a&gt; so I can get some ideas where you might have put your RSS feed. 2. If you don't have a feed for your top stories at least, stop everything and do it. Every day you delay is more exposure you don't get. I asked them to do this when they started, so this is the second request.</description>

			<description>The journalism industry ought to form a news Twitter. It could be part of the fediverse, but it should also have its own easy UI. There are ease-of-use advantages to centralized systems. A lot of the people who use Twitter need the simplicity. A service can be both centralized and open at the same time. A lot of people got their first exposure to the web on AOL, for example. But news needs to have a single point of congregation. Twitter was providing a useful service there.</description>

			<description>I woke from a dream where I was smoking as I was saying “I don’t smoke” in the dream to a disbelieving friend, but, by the time I finished the sentence I was awake saying it out loud and telling the truth, to myself. I haven’t smoked a cigarette since &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06/14.html&quot;&gt;June 14, 2002&lt;/a&gt;, except in dreams, still.</description>

I want to tell Google where &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; is. Have it be a preference setting. Then when I do searches it automatically gives priority to anything on my blog. Why would this be so incredibly powerful? I'd have a way to leave notes for myself on my research trips through Google's database. And if they let me do this in an outline and represented the structure in the query results, it would be explosively powerful. All without any AI, btw. Really cost effective.</description>

			<description>What would it take for Google to do stuff like this? Invent a new department, the department of User Lovers, or Product Lovers (same thing of course). No tech company has ever had such a department. They mindlessly assume that love of the product is ingrained in all their people when the truth is the opposite, they have contempt for users. I've seen it grow in my own company, and in the blogging community. A sense that because I work for the company that made the product, I know everything all the users know and more. It's the same fallacy that applies to Silicon Valley billionaires. You have to step into a new perspective to love the product, one that has nothing to do with who you work for or how validated you are by reporters and the public.</description>

			<description>I find this interesting, maybe you do too. But with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/&quot;&gt;personal chatbot&lt;/a&gt;, the next step is to have a Dave-emulator, right? Wouldn't be that big a stretch. I basically write like I talk. It's almost dialog. I do go back and edit and take out the parts where I'm thinking while talking, and in the end those parts aren't needed to make the point. I'm sure you could write an AI thing that did that. It probably already does it. I knew there would be a reason to put an effort into having a good archive. (I deliberately left this bit unedited.)</description>
