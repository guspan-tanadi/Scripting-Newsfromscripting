			<title>Why is everything shit in America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Everything should be great in America, but it isn't. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FIrst watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/seyitaylor/status/1373646185311969285&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from a 60 Minutes interview with Fed chairman Lewis Powell on how he creates money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misperceptions about how money works, even among educated people, is that we have to pay for projects by raising taxes. The fact they're missing is that the Federal Reserve creates money. So we don't have to raise taxes to provide relief to victims of disasters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When they say the debt is something our children and grandchildren will have to pay off, that's not true either. We can pay the debt by printing money. If we owe you $100 who's to say if we got that money by taxing Americans or simply by giving you new money we created for that purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Money has to start somewhere, and unlike a household budget, the US government has an infinite supply of it. Basically the only country with the power to create new money that can be spent everywhere is the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The United States is unique because our dollar is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; for the world. So if say Egypt owes money to India, they pay them in dollars. If a small country is reserving some money for a future project, they store it in dollars. Our currency, unlike all others, is in demand all around the world. Which means we can give them dollars we just printed and they will send us goods that cost real money, because of course when we printed the money, it was real, simply because we printed it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are the richest country there is, it's not &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=hyperbole&quot;&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;. And yet we have one of the worst benefit systems for our people in the world. If people really understood how this works (just re-read this piece) they would be enraged about how health, education, infrastructure, everything basically, in the US, is shit. You see this when you travel to Europe. A sense that everything is first class. And they don't have the economic advantage that we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, why is it this way, such a rich country that lives so poorly? Some of it is the rich self-dealing, grift, the 1%, inequality, etc -- but a lot of is the dysfunction of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The quality of life for Americans hasn't been a priority in Washington, at least not until very recently. There is cause for hope of that changing. Just don't believe the politicians when they say something good for the people has to be &quot;paid for.&quot; Tell them you understand how it works, and the exact opposite is true, it does not ever have to be paid for. We, the United States, can buy whatever we want. And we need to start doing that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I remember those times differently, and very well. Microsoft was in no danger. They could have let Netscape grow, it never would have hurt them. For all of Netscape's bluster about &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14610341&quot;&gt;device drivers&lt;/a&gt;, they had a really bad codebase, and a chaotic team that while blessed with a product that the web was growing around, had a long way to go before they could compete with Microsoft.</description>

			<description>Microsoft could played a senior role, and &lt;i&gt;helped&lt;/i&gt; the rest of us add all kinds of editors and databases to the web, and at least try to bring across some of the GUI innovations of the 80s. Instead all that was lost. Today, decades later, because of the chaos Microsoft brought us then, the editors on the web still suck. They are really inferior. Far less useful than the editors we had before the web. What if Microsoft had chilled and brought together the best minds from the PC era and asked some basic questions like how are we going to make the web better for everyone, at least as good as what we had before. What a time that would have been to do just that. But they acted like spoiled children. Andreessen et al could be excused, they really were basically children then. Gates had a dream of world domination forever, or at least until he was tired of it. So selfish, narcissistic, and so wrong. And the gloating and self-importance today, they still don't, even in retirement, understand that they held all of us back, that's why they failed to continue to dominate. Holding back progress is not ultimately a good strategy for world domination, esp at the leading edge of technology.</description>

			<description>BTW, I think Microsoft knew very well that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/90s-startup-terrified-microsoft-got-americans-go-online/&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt; was falling apart all on its own, but they used the device drivers crap to convince reporters that they were terrified of Netscape. Maybe they even sort of psyched themselves up for it, probably because they were bored. Who knows, but what could have been, and how much time we wasted, for their vanity.</description>

			<description>BTW, in yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TO-OkIMtI&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't mean that it was literally for Roam devs, that's just how I got started on this thread. I'm beginning to understand that Roam is a world unto itself, and that other products such as Obsidion and others are outgoing. Obviously it's the latter group that we'll be able to integrate with.</description>

			<description>I've been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; a lot lately, the usual stuff, outliner, object database, verb set, threading, integration, etc. But I realized I leave out the most important thing about Frontier when I recite the features. Whenever we saw a protocol we could support, we did. And we even created new ones when there was a void, as with XML-RPC, OPML and RSS. The best part is we extended the language to make inter-app communication use exactly the same language syntax as local procedure calls. Factoring was also a very big part of the process. So it is kind of a central station, and always getting more high level through factoring. Our software is all about communication, and making it as effortless as possible. It still is, very much.</description>

			<title>A tale of two podcasts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two podcasts, one good the other one awful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good one was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/18/978687605/could-trump-be-convicted-of-criminal-charges&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a long interview with New Yorker reporter, Jane Mayer, about whether or not former president Trump could be tried and convicted of a criminal offense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The awful one was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-rebecca-traister.html&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein interview&lt;/a&gt; with Rebecca Traister, a reporter for New York magazine, about Andrew Cuomo. It was about how offensive and sexist governor Cuomo is, but the ironic thing, that I can't believe Klein couldn't hear, is how incredibly offensive &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; was being, in a sexist and racist way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first thing that hit me the wrong way is she described a conflict between Cuomo and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio as a &quot;dick swinging contest.&quot; That quote (about 9 minutes into the interview) is as bad as anything Cuomo is accused of saying, and she did it publicly, with a member of the press listening, and he didn't say a word, didn't question it. Try to imagine something like that being said about two women politicians, using the female equivalent of &quot;dicks.&quot; You'd never hear it, and a respectful discussion of politics can't be at that level. It's not just disrepectful of the people she's talking about, but it's disrespectful of the audience and the interviewer, and the NYT which hosted the interview. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She admits she was furious that her &quot;liberal peers&quot; were liking Cuomo's leadership, leadership we desperately needed at the time, but that is not grounds for removal, and you have to wonder, could New York Magazine, and Klein, have found a more dispassionate person to tell this story, someone like Jane Mayer, for example. And maybe present another side of it, about what it was really like for us one year ago. Why were her liberal peers so willing to overlook their dislike for Cuomo? Perhaps because they, like the rest of us, were scared out of their minds. Just a theory. (I certainly was.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later in the interview she admits her issue is with &quot;white, male politicians.&quot; I turned the interview off at that point. This isn't a scandal, as she almost admits, there was vulnerability, a coverup perhaps, a mistake for sure, in a perilous time, and now, the fear having subsided, a bit (and imho irrationally) the opportunists move in. That's a story I'd love to hear on a future Ezra Klein podcast. How and why did we give journalism so much power, was it a good idea, and how can we put it back where it belongs -- with the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Traister should run against Cuomo next year, and her writing should be clearly labeled as partisan, but come on, we have to do better. And Klein, you can't support this kind of partisanship without at least questioning it, or properly labeling it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A fair journalistic treatment of this supposed scandal has yet to be offered, by anyone. The best indication of that is that the people aren't buying the product that journalism is offering, for some reason, a big majority of NY voters are not calling for his head. Maybe it would be worth finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another podcast I listened to recently was a Fresh Air interview with author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978185402/novelist-kazuo-ishiguro&quot;&gt;Kazuo Ishiguro&lt;/a&gt;. I'm reading his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972841445/klara-and-the-sun-is-a-masterpiece-about-life-love-and-mortality&quot;&gt;Klara and the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, based on listening to the interview, and &lt;i&gt;loving&lt;/i&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: On this day a year ago, I proudly scored a thermometer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A year of pandemic-imposed isolation takes a toll. This might be the worst moment of the year. It's rainy and cold. Spring keeps teasing, but it never comes. There's nothing you can do that would be a normal rainy day. When the sun comes out, this weekend, I hope it'll feel better. I'm sure it will.</description>

Their audience likes to hear about liberals freaking out. If you can make them cry, even better. All they have to do is come up with a few things that piss off the libs every week, and they're gold.

As Maddow says, watch this space. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it's not my business model or any other kind of model to get anyone upset. Quite the opposite.

			<title>It's not really a scam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been fascinating to watch writers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/210317/p16#a210317p16&quot;&gt;come to grips&lt;/a&gt; with the idea that Substack is not a level playing field. They recruited some famous writers, paid them advances, in some cases (apparently, not verified as far as I know) of up to $250K. The rest of the writers got nothing but the opportunity to make money from their newsletters. By seeding the market with this money they could honestly say that some writers were making six figures from their Substack work, implying perhaps that you could too. Maybe you could. But honestly -- you won't. The system they've set up doesn't work that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One writer called it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so&quot;&gt;scam&lt;/a&gt; but I'm not sure that's a good word for what's going on. It's more like &quot;business model&quot; or &quot;growth strategy.&quot; This is how the tech industry works.

				<source:outline text="It's been fascinating to watch writers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/210317/p16#a210317p16&quot;&gt;come to grips&lt;/a&gt; with the idea that Substack is not a level playing field. They recruited some famous writers, paid them advances, in some cases (apparently, not verified as far as I know) of up to $250K. The rest of the writers got nothing but the opportunity to make money from their newsletters. By seeding the market with this money they could honestly say that some writers were making six figures from their Substack work, implying perhaps that you could too. Maybe you could. But honestly -- you won't. The system they've set up doesn't work that way." created="Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:13:29 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/18/hamsterCage.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/18/141318.html?title=itsNotReallyAScam#a141329"/>

			<description>I was having a philosophical conversation the other day about the difference between an app being scriptable or having an API. This has always been a big question. It's like this question: when does an actor become a star? Aren't they doing the same thing? Yes, they are, but no they aren't. An app being scriptable means that its API went through a process, it was conceived from a user's point of view. The designers looked at the user interface and made sure everything you could do there was also possible in a script. The terminology matched the UI. You didn't have to learn a new vocabulary. There were examples provided that showed how to do things the app couldn't do on its own, things that a user would want to do, and would inspire a script-writing user to want to do more. You're looking for the tiny fraction of users who in their hearts are developers, but don't know it yet. These people make software system devs don't think of, and aren't impressed with, because what drives the user-programmer is utility, not programming prowess. Further if you tell them they're programmers, they'll disagree for a long time -- no, I'm a lawyer, no I drive a bus. No I do this or that. But eventually quite a few will come to see that they are programmers. Then, as the programming priesthood takes hold, these people are confined to niches where the devs thought to add a scripting interface. That becomes a platform and the process begins again.</description>

			<title>When your parents die</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you learn when your parents die, the people whose goals and dreams you studied for your formative years, is that our goals and dreams don't matter  much.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that matters is that my mother made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/17/evesQuilt.png&quot;&gt;quilt&lt;/a&gt; for me because she wanted me to have it after she was gone. That she walked my brother to school one day 50 years ago and someone took a picture so I can put it on the wall of my living room today. She planted trees on her street, trees that wouldn't give shade until she was long-gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That my father wrote about what he learned about using a computer to organize his work, with software I had written. The time after I was home from the hospital and he took me to the toy store and said I could have whatever I wanted. I have no recollection of what I chose, but I remember that he did it. I imagine that day he was glad I was okay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The things they give you, their love, the small incidental memories -- they end up mattering more than any of the battles they fought or the impossible dreams they never achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Following up on Roam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got some feedback to my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct&quot;&gt;questions/observations&lt;/a&gt; about Roam's product, which does appear to be an outliner after all. This was my most basic question. I could see that users had the ability to control detail with a familiar expand and collapse operation, but could it reorganize according to structure, the second major feature of outlining? Text on rails. It does have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I have a couple more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is there a directory of interesting public graphs created by Roam users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it a web? Can I link to other people's graphs? What if I create my own Roam-like product, can my graphs be incorporated into other people's?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Observations&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I spent some time a few years ago brainstorming with Ward Cunningham, the great wiki dev, about how we could combine outlining and wikis. We didn't figure it out. It seems Roam, or one of the products it has inspired, may have it. Andrew Shell, who has spent more time with Ward recently said he had the same thought.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should really spend some time learning this product, but it's hard to find that kind of time. This is one of the problems with software development. It's not like listening to music, which you can do while you are driving a car, or seeing a movie, which takes at most a few hours. Learning to use a software product can take months or even years. Very few products get used by most developers, which is a big reason we keep reinventing each others' wheels.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Long story&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to distill this down to something shorter, but don't have the time right now..&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I first showed up in Silicon Valley, after spending a couple of years in Madison making my first outliner (and getting a CS degree), I was disappointed to find out that someone else had thought of outliners before I had, years earlier, and had developed one, and made a big splash, of sorts -- but opinion-leaders were just as puzzled about his product as I found people were with mine. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I'm having a different feeling, after I stopped trying to make outliners pop up everywhere, and turned to other interesting products such as system-level scripting, RSS readers and web CMSes -- that now a new generation of devs is trying again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We had tens of thousands of users of our outliners in the 80s, not millions. People who use outliners are rare, I found. I think it may be possible that doesn't have to be that way, there's nothing very hard about using an outliner, but people have to be interested in how they organize and use info, to see the possibility of tools to make that more efficient, and most people aren't that interested.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The product didn't take off until it did something other than outlining -- presentations. Some people asked if they could just have the outliner, and others wanted just the presenter. Which raised the question, why are these two very distinct functions, in one app? Shouldn't they be split into two, so users could plug them into other tools? This is a big idea, that still hasn't seen its day in the sun.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That made me turn to making glue that could combine the features of products to make a hybrid product. That's the germ of an idea that led to Frontier. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, when I knock on any developer's door and ask about their connections to the outside world, this is what I'm getting at. I once approached a company making a notification system if they supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. They said it was a third-party opportunity and sent me back a link to their developer site (it cost money to be a developer, btw). This felt like when I approached &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/06/whatHasPodcastingAccomplis.html#yesPodcastingIsHugeHeSaysButLookAtHowItsDominatedByNprThatMeansRadioWonHeSaysThePromiseOfPodcastingWhichWasAnOverturningOfTheHierarchyWasALosingProposition&quot;&gt;WBUR&lt;/a&gt; at the dawn of podcasting to offer to work with them on a new kind of public radio, and they sent me a prospectus for giving them money. Or the time in 1978 that I cold-called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/18/pressFreedomIsNotMyFreedom.html&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt; and told them I knew how to create a computerized encyclopedia and would they like to work with me, and they sent a salesman to try to sell me books! The guy was persistent, we kind of became friends, but he never understood one word of what I was talking about. Heh. I guess it was hard to understand that someday they would be on the web, but this was way before the web existed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, I want to know what kind of product Roam is making. One that welcomes the rest of the world, or one that wants to be its own world. Not really judging, just trying to understand. It's like asking if you want to be a cop or the Chief of Police. (A rabbi, or god?)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: Ultimately I personally decided I wanted to be a cop. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;👮‍♂️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PPS: Anyone else working in this area, if you're planning an API, let's collaborate, I have some working code in this area. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PPPS: I wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Michalski&quot;&gt;Jerry Michalski&lt;/a&gt; has looked at this? He was and is an advocate of a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jerrysbrain.com/&quot;&gt;The Brain&lt;/a&gt;, it seems a lot like Roam too. If Jerry likes it, that means something, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's about it for now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="When I first showed up in Silicon Valley, after spending a couple of years in Madison making my first outliner (and getting a CS degree), I was disappointed to find out that someone else had thought of outliners before I had, years earlier, and had developed one, and made a big splash, of sorts -- but opinion-leaders were just as puzzled about his product as I found people were with mine." created="Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:55:41 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/17/144935.html?title=followingUpOnRoam#a145541"/>
					<source:outline text="Now I'm having a different feeling, after I stopped trying to make outliners pop up everywhere, and turned to other interesting products such as system-level scripting, RSS readers and web CMSes -- that now a new generation of devs is trying again." created="Wed, 17 Mar 2021 15:14:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/17/144935.html?title=followingUpOnRoam#a151443"/>
					<source:outline text="We had tens of thousands of users of our outliners in the 80s, not millions. People who use outliners are rare, I found. I think it may be possible that doesn't have to be that way, there's nothing very hard about using an outliner, but people have to be interested in how they organize and use info, to see the possibility of tools to make that more efficient, and most people aren't that interested." created="Wed, 17 Mar 2021 15:26:43 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/17/144935.html?title=followingUpOnRoam#a152643"/>
					<source:outline text="The product didn't take off until it did something other than outlining -- presentations. Some people asked if they could just have the outliner, and others wanted just the presenter. Which raised the question, why are these two very distinct functions, in one app? Shouldn't they be split into two, so users could plug them into other tools? This is a big idea, that still hasn't seen its day in the sun." created="Wed, 17 Mar 2021 15:27:44 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/17/144935.html?title=followingUpOnRoam#a152744"/>
					<source:outline text="That made me turn to making glue that could combine the features of products to make a hybrid product.

					<source:outline text="Anyway, when I knock on any developer's door and ask about their connections to the outside world, this is what I'm getting at. I once approached a company making a notification system if they supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. They said it was a third-party opportunity and sent me back a link to their developer site (it cost money to be a developer, btw).

			<description>I was telling one of the devs I work with yesterday about Lotus 1-2-3's macro language. I'm going in that direction again, I think the web needs a scripting language. Not one written for devs, but for people who think of themselves as users. That was the thing about 1-2-3. Also Hypercard. And my own product, UserLand Frontier. The idea that there are programmers who would reject the idea that they are programmers. It's a very subtle idea, people who are great hackers in the sense that they will work endlessly to find a way to do the thing they must do, who will develop a deep understanding of the problem they want to solve, but not as much depth on the nature of programming. Mitch Kapor was one of these people. He wrote a product in 1980 or so called VisiPlot. Written in BASIC. It sold really well. Programmers didn't like it. But they sold a lot because it worked really well with Visicalc, the leading spreadsheet of the day. He went on to found Lotus, and they put a macro language into 1-2-3, and the loop was closed. A user created a tool for other users to create tools for other users. The beat goes on. I love the idea of empowering users to create the products they want out of the components us &quot;serious&quot; devs create.</description>

			<description>I had a bunch of errands to run today and thought to get my car washed, to get rid of all the caked-on mud from the winter. It was so dirty, you couldn't even tell it was a white car. When I pulled up to the car wash the guy was just waiting for me, far away from the entrance way. I kind of got annoyed and opened the window and asked if he worked there. He asked if I have a mask. I wasn't wearing one. This is the attitude of a vaccinated citizen. Sometimes we forget to wear the mask, even though I know that's no excuse. Rather than say &quot;Hey bud, I'm vaccinated,&quot; I just put the mask on. I felt a bit ashamed because I used to be so militant and vigilant about masks. I wonder if other vaccinated folk are having a similar experience.</description>

			<description>About politics, I'm not one of those people who cherry-picks bits of news to support a cherished theory. I try to see all the info that's available to me, and I do change my mind, sometimes in a very big way. I used to vote for Republicans, don't ask me why, I can't believe it myself. But I stopped that nonsense in 2004, and ever since I can't imagine why any sane person would. I also know that Andrew Cuomo was part of a very nasty campaign against Ed Koch on behalf of his father, Mario Cuomo, when both were running for mayor of NYC. They were &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/ed-koch-held-decades-long-grudge-against-cuomos-over-vote-for-cuomo-not-the-homo-posters&quot;&gt;picking on Koch&lt;/a&gt; because he was a single man, questioning his sexual orientation. Back then this was nasty bullshit, but it didn't disqualify his father. Today, if the word ever got around, if people knew the slogan they were using, it would probably ruin Governor Andrew, as it should. To this day I can't hear the name Cuomo without thinking of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=cuomo+homo&quot;&gt;bit of nasty&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the Cuomos ended up fucking themselves, and they deserve it.</description>

			<description>I'm also curious about how short people's memories are, apparently, and if people have any thoughts about how close the journalists came to throwing out Joe Biden's candidacy for president in April and May of 2020. Now, as president, he's doing a great job (I think he is, despite my not supporting him in the primary). But he was almost Frankened. There was no process with Biden, it was as if by magic, the journalists decided to give him a pass, and let him run for president without making an issue of the accusations of sexual assault. No explanation. They just erased our memories and went on. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_sexual_assault_allegation&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; didn't forget. :-)</description>

			<description>I think business, politics and journalism must have a code of ethics, and that includes treating everyone fairly. But we don't do that. We destroy lives of innocent people in the name of justice, which is exactly why I oppose the death penalty. Decisions about life and death must not be part of a political process, and neither should someone's banishment from public life. If the charges stick, if we believe the person is really guilty, first take steps to protect potential victims, then have a process for determining innocence or guilt, and apply that process to everyone equally, regardless of whether they are a nominee for president, governor of a big state, or just some random schmuck. This is America. We believe in protecting people from mobs. We are nothing if we allow mobs to tear people down. And we are living through a period where people do just that. This is not acceptable.</description>

			<description>I'm sure at the time many people thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; was doing god's work by protecting America from un-Americans. That was really a concept in postwar America. American citizens who were un-American. Now, from the perspective of history, we can see how wrong that was. And I'm sure in the future, if America survives, we will look at this time the same way.</description>

			<title>Personal publishing machines</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sad moment. I was doing a lookup for a bit about a programmer of my generation, I wanted to write about some of his ideas. I found they had a lot about him in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://computerhistory.org/&quot;&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;. I started looking around at the other people they interviewed. I knew all of them, they knew me. But for some reason my ideas and my work are not part of their record. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? Probably because I was the main blogger in Silicon Valley in the early days of the web. You've seen how they respond to journalism. How do you think they felt about one of their own writing publicly about what he thought of what they were doing. I was hoping they would join me. That's how I develop. By doing. And then building the software to support what I'm doing. That imho is part of the history that belongs in the Computer History Museum. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they must be missing a good 50 percent of the story. The literature of the web. They didn't understand how these were not just personal computers we were developing, they were personal publishing machines. Now in hindsight, they should adjust the image they're trying to project into the future. These machines were used for something they have never appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Sad moment. I was doing a lookup for a bit about a programmer of my generation, I wanted to write about some of his ideas.

				<source:outline text="Why? Probably because I was the main blogger in Silicon Valley in the early days of the web. You've seen how they respond to journalism. How do you think they felt about one of their own writing publicly about what he thought of what they were doing. I was hoping they would join me. That's how I develop. By doing. And then building the software to support what I'm doing. That imho is part of the history that belongs in the Computer History Museum." created="Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:19:47 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/16/161904.html?title=personalPublishingMachines#a161947"/>

They didn't understand how these were not just personal computers we were developing, they were personal publishing machines. Now in hindsight, they should adjust the image they're trying to project into the future. These machines were used for something they have never appreciated." created="Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:20:40 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/16/161904.html?title=personalPublishingMachines#a162040"/>

			<title>About Roam's product</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my correspondents on Twitter, I think I'm starting to figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=roam+research&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roam's&lt;/a&gt; product. I am guessing about some of these things, using the blogger's ethos, put your mistakes out there for everyone to see so you can learn faster. :-) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Roam's world an outline is computed, not stored. There is no &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; file for an outline, as with my outliners. There is a database with blocks of text, and they are connected to other nodes/blocks through links that are represented textually by double-square brackets or with a hashtag as in Twitter. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Roam, the outline hierarchy is a way of browsing the results of a query. I've often thought of this as an interesting way of doing things, and even have an experiment up that I think is Roam-like, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=roam&quot;&gt;thesaurus.land&lt;/a&gt;. It's a way of navigating a database of synonyms, using an outline structure as the presentation format. It works.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you reorganize an outline in Roam? I haven't heard about anyone doing that. This is one of the reasons I'm not sure Roam actually is an outliner. In my world, an outliner has two defining functions: 1. You have control of detail, via expand and collapse and 2. You can reorganize according to structure. The text is on rails. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People expect by entering all their ideas into Roam's database that there will eventually be serendipities, things they will learn by seeing connections they had not seen before. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You are expected to use Roam for all your note-taking. Many people see Roam as a replacement for Evernote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In my world, OPML support is not incidental. Each of my outliners is a church, but the religion is OPML. There is no lock-in in this world. You can use any other tool that can read or write OPML. So when I ask if Roam supports OPML, I'm asking if their product can play with products that are compatible with mine. This is like asking, imho, if a news reader can deal with RSS. With OPML the standard is rock solid. For some reason no one has screwed with it (thankful).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can I use my own editing tools to get my ideas into their database? I don't know. I suspect a developer could create a bridge. Most of my writing is available in OPML. There are lots of examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that holds my blog content starting in May 2017. The rest of it is on the web, and I can provide a zip archive for a developer who wants to try importing all 26-plus years of my blog. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Cuomo, BBC, men, women and hate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why do I write so much about men, women and hate. Because I guess it's taboo, and my life was in many ways formed around dysfunction between genders, and I feel fear when I see a man taken down, fear that it's going to happen to me. I'm pretty sure many other men feel the same, because I've been in places where men can talk privately, and this is a big topic, the fear that our lives will be ruined. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so, I don't think I'm alone as a man who seeks the approval of women. This might be the single driving force in my life, probably going back to birth. I kid you not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I appreciate not being &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=excoriate&quot;&gt;excoriated&lt;/a&gt; for touching this third rail. I tiptoe up to this topic, but then I'm getting older, with less at stake, and the world is crumbling anyway, so why not take a chance. I think there may be a resolution possible, maybe it'll come at the last minute, in time to get us focused on solving the problems we share, not just the ones that divide us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wrote earlier...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just heard, on the BBC, about a book entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Hate-Women-Misogyny-ebook/dp/B08QY6PXX5/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Men Who Hate Women&lt;/a&gt; written by a woman. I don't doubt that there are men who do hate women. On the other hand, I also don't doubt that there are women who hate men. Maybe if we worked on all the hate, what an idea that would be. In the interview the author said that hate speech by men includes the statement that not all men hate women. We always have to be so careful because you never know what's going to be considered hateful. Not hating women and saying so is not hate, imho, it's more like pleading for mercy. To think it's hate is straight out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6146-war-is-peace-freedom-is-slavery-ignorance-is-strength&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;. Further, it's exactly this kind of crap that makes people fear women, because they can ruin a man's life so easily. I've seen it happen. And when it does, it does not, imho, in any way help anyone. It's just more of what you hated about men being applied to men, and probably feeding more hate all around. You can't stop hate with fear. Also: every man had a mother, and early in life that little man was putty in that woman's hands. If you want to fix the problems, and make life better for women, you have to work on women's attitudes too, and help that little dude love &lt;i&gt;himself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/invictus&quot;&gt;Invictus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70118779#:~:text=2009%20%7C%20PG%2D13%20%7C%202h,Watch%20all%20you%20want.&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, a 2009 movie about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela&quot;&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; and rugby in South Africa. It's not an incredibly great movie, but it's worth watching to learn how Mandela treated the whites who oppressed blacks during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid&quot;&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;, which was ended, as Mandela became president. It's hard to summarize the whole philosophy in a short blog post, but I'll try. When you win, try to protect the dignity of the people you defeated, assuming you have to live with them. He would say the women's movement in 2021 is doing it wrong, by aiming to destroy the lives of men. It may make you feel good in the moment, but it's only going to perpetuate the problem, perhaps even make it worse, as the fear becames betrayal because some men who are charged really are innocent, and that turns into the hate we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; want to try to overcome. Everyone suffers when people are abused. I know this first hand, from the experience of my parents and how that was passed down to my generation. The thing to do is to stop all abuse, learn where its roots are, and help people overcome the history that makes them view the world the way they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's not an incredibly great movie, but it's worth watching to learn how Mandela treated the whites who oppressed blacks during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid&quot;&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;, which was ended, as Mandela became president. It's hard to summarize the whole philosophy in a short blog post, but I'll try. When you win, try to protect the dignity of the people you defeated, assuming you have to live with them. He would say the women's movement in 2021 is doing it wrong, by aiming to destroy the lives of men. It may make you feel good in the moment, but it's only going to perpetuate the problem, perhaps even make it worse, as the fear becames betrayal because some men who are charged really are innocent, and that turns into the hate we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; want to try to overcome. Everyone suffers when people are abused. I know this first hand, from the experience of my parents and how that was passed down to my generation. The thing to do is to stop all abuse, learn where its roots are, and help people overcome the history that makes them view the world the way they do." created="Mon, 15 Mar 2021 14:22:44 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/162043.html?title=cuomoBbcMenWomenAndHate#a142244"/>

			<description>Earlier today the NYT published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/opinion/andrew-cuomo.html&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; about Cuomo &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/14/nytEditorialScreen.png&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The governor has lost his political allies and the public’s confidence.&quot; There's no question about the first part, lots of Democratic office-holders in New York have called for him to resign. But there are no polls that show that he's lost the confidence of the voters. For a few days last week I thought it was over, he should resign, because they're never going to let him be a functioning governor again. But I get an email from him every day, and he's going forward with the business of helping New Yorkers deal with the pandemic. Without him, we'd be as adrift as every other state. So I say, stay in office Governor Cuomo. Let the investigation run its course, let the people see, clearly, what the charges are, and how they're substantiated, and then we'll talk. The idea that such a huge decision that has so much affect on New Yorkers, should be made in a rush, without our participation &amp;mdash; no one has made that case yet. This is our decision to make, collectively. Times editors get one vote, the same as every other voter in New York. And imho, it's wrong for them to say the public is losing confidence and then offer no evidence to back that up.</description>

			<description>I wonder if they have arguments within the NYT Editorial Board about whether or not &quot;the public&quot; is something they can fudge. When they say &quot;the public&quot; is losing confidence in the governor, should they back that up with data, or just say it because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8UZn7PmyXc&amp;t=58s&quot;&gt;feels right&lt;/a&gt; to them.</description>

			<title>Cuomo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone polled New York voters on whether they want Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign? I haven’t seen any results. The journalists and politicians pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; out just like they’re pushing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/13/politics/andrew-cuomo-chuck-schumer-kirsten-gillibrand/index.html&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; out now. Why not have a &lt;i&gt;somewhat&lt;/i&gt; democratic process? Wouldn’t the cause be better served?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why Cuomo matters. First, being fair to everyone matters. And when you see someone rushed off, as is happening with Cuomo, and what happened to Franken, and other people you probably never heard of, this has a nasty side-effect with people who identify with Cuomo and Franken and the others. They think you're going to do the same to them. Some would say if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about. Hah. You know where that comes from. That's the kind of shit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; used to say about people who worried about being purged in one of his un-American trials. It's a common thread, and totally anti-democratic. We believe in due process here, not in mob rule. And what's happening here is mob rule, even if you aren't willing to say so publicly, you know it is. Take a close look at why you're not willing to say it publicly. What does that say about where you live. And what does it say about you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The more they try to rush Cuomo's resignation, the more I want it to stop. I'm a NY voter, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
