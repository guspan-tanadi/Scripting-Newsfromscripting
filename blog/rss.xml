What we should do is stop them from turning our government into an autocracy. Imagine if every night Ari Melber ran a profile of one of the people who could be funding the Republican push to autocracy and Manchin and Sinema's obstruction. Just say hey this is a billionaire who, according to recent Supreme Court rulings, can turn the US into a fascist hell, and might be one of them who's doing it. You could film Ari calling his office and asking the receptionist if he could speak to the ruling class member who could be quietly pulling the strings. No talk of &quot;kill shots&quot; or the like. No mobs invading their offices or homes. Just let's find out who they are and what they've done that we know of that fucks us over. And call Elizabeth Warren and ask why she talks about taxes all the time, when that's not the actual problem.</description>

			<description>If the people on TV weren't tools for the ruling class, if they really cared about you, they'd say the truth about Omicron. 1. We have no idea if it will kill you. 2. You should probably stay home if you don't want to be one of the test cases.</description>

I started by reviewing the top level folders on scripting.com. I saw a folder called opmlArchive. In there were folders for the years 1997 through 2010. I opened them up, and saw folders with each of the months, 01, 02 and so on. Then I opened each of those, and there were OPML files for each of the days. And inside the OPML files, the source text for that day's blog. And they're pretty much exactly the same format as the format I use today. My CMS isn't called Old School for nothing. Anyway I'm just merging the daily files into monthly ones, to be consistent with the archive that I've been keeping on GitHub since 2017. In few minutes I'll be adding 12+ years of source text. And then after a bit I'll load all this into Daytona. My memory is so weird, I vaguely remember setting this up. I mostly just do things like that and forget them. What this tells me is if I hunt around on my hard drive, I'll find the editing tools I was using then. It's almost as if someone else did all this stuff.</description>

			<description>BTW, yesterday a Radio UserLand blogger asked me if there was a way to convert their blog archive to OPML. I'm sure we could do it, probably fairly easily. The thing to look for is a file called radio.root. It's the object database that contains everything, including your blog posts. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/227&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.</description>

			<description>Food for thought. Suppose the web was started by venture capitalists. And suppose only venture capitalists made web sites and apps. They would have gotten a lot of press, that's for sure. But do you think the web would have amounted to anything?</description>

			<description>I haven't been listening to a lot of political podcasts these days because political reporting is asleep at the wheel, like the Biden administration, re the coup that keeps going, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/transcripts/Z3FUKzFDL2x0NURwZmJ2RmdnL0dXQzc4cUVwVmUyUzBzeWRrempwVElpYz0=&quot;&gt;this week's Amicus podcast&lt;/a&gt; is the exception. Though they are too kind to the press, the guest, Walter Shaub, has a clear mind re the coup, and the Biden's lack of response. I highly recommend a listen.</description>

			<title>I want gists in Drummer blogs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub has a nice feature called gists. They're little documents you can edit and share with other devs. GitHub hosts them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For fun here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting&quot;&gt;all my gists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can also embed them in web pages. I tried it, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they won't for some reason let me embed them in blogs that my users use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So maybe I'm missing something? Or maybe I have to replicate the functionality of their plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I really want the look and feel of their plugin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy! There must be an answer to this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I embedded a gist here, manually. Hey maybe this is good enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/3e5454f2b7a10029dfc301d7deabb576.js?file=package.json&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reading OPML in JavaScript apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking on the phone yesterday with Scott Hanson, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; user and programmer, and longtime friend. He's been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things it reads OPML files into JavaScript structures, and goes the other way, writes them out as OPML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like reading and writing JSON. It parses and stringifies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well Scott was surprised at how simple it is. I was surprised that he was surprised, but pleased that he used it, and happy to shine a light on what he saw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So -- here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/states.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the link to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/examples/browser/index.html&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; that uses the OPML package to read the file and it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/opmlpackage/examples/browser/index.html#json&quot;&gt;displays what it gets&lt;/a&gt;, which should look familiar to any JavaScript programmer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From there your code and do anything it wants with the data it has. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should write some high-level routines that do common operations to an in-memory OPML structure. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about the OPML package, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues/2&quot;&gt;good place to ask&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;If there is actual substance to the hijack called &quot;Web3&quot; then they should do two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Come up with a name I can use for it that doesn't begin with W-E-B  because I don't want to support hijacking the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; I'm going to keep working in JS and Node, and writing my blog, but give me bridges into your world. I am not under any circumstances moving my act into your space. Only suckers would do that, so you have to build these bridges so you might as well start there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why podcasting isn't dominated</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/22/paulBunyan.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I asked this question &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/20.html#a142628&quot;&gt;on the blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1472930147137466372&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. And so far all the answers have been about the companies, and imho they've been wrong. First, there are plenty of huge tech companies that have set out to own podcasting, and were fairly sure their dominance in other categories would help them achieve dominance in podcasting. I've listened to their bluster and at times have been worried that it might work. After all Google owns search, and Apple made the iPod (and therefore it's assumed by many that they invented podcasting). Amazon owns Audible which dominates audiobooks. Spotify is huge, and they've set out to dominate podcasting, and maybe they will, but they haven't so far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, how do I know that no single tech company dominates podcasting, or as some people claim a few of them do? Because the market doesn't behave like one that is dominated. There is no gatekeeper that can turn down your podcast, make you not cover topics they don't want covered or use language or images they don't think are acceptable, or compete with them. All these are features of dominated product categories. The press doesn't turn to Spotify or Apple to blame them for something someone said on a podcast that incited a riot or threatened a celebrity or politician. They don't turn to the companies because they are not dominant and they know it. I know no big tech company dominates podcasting because if you want to start a podcast there's no one who can tell you you can't. If you want to listen to a podast on your favorite player, yes there are some you can't, but you can for the vast majority of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now to the question that I actually asked that no one seems to want to answer. Why? Why is it this way? Why podcasting and not the other tech-based media. Why is podcasting still open after over 20 years? Drumroll please. The answer: there are enough users who understand how it is supposed to work. They expect to be able to listen to any podcast anywhere they want. Most probably don't understand why they have this ability, about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=podcasting&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and technology design that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/21/metaImage.png&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; it possible, but they understand that they have the ability. And it doesn't have to be all of them or even most of them, just &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; of them, whatever that means. And for right now, at the end of 2021, there are enough. Podcasting has always been and remains an open platform. I can't say it will be for the future, but so far so good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/23/mrNatural.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I'm not saying this as a form of self-congratulation, or an appeal for kudos, though I gratefully accept any that are offered. I'm focusing your attention on this because &lt;i&gt;we can do it again.&lt;/i&gt; Start a new medium with the understanding that users have the right to move, the right to use any tool they want to create media or listen to (or read or view or experience) it. That there are no gatekeepers that control them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words the example of podcasting says there's hope. We don't have to accept a bad answer. We can have freedom, and users are the key to that. I've always said that, because it's true. Users have the power, but they have to use it. But first developers have to set it up from the beginning so they are not locked in and so creators are not controlled. To set the expectation that they have the freedom to not be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>New blog archives in Daytona</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did the initial Scripting News collection on Daytona with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;current archive&lt;/a&gt;, started in May 2017. It's in OPML, so it was ready to be imported into the database as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have now converted the previous months, August 2016 through May 2017, from a JSON-based format to OPML, and published the result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017&quot;&gt;in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, and also imported this archive into Daytona. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Along the way I found another eight months of blogging that's in the same format. I plan to convert those as well, and flow the result into Daytona.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to march back in time, looking for OPML versions of the blog, or OPMLizable data. The goal is to see how much of the 27 years of Scripting News I can get into Daytona. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017/chatlogToOpml&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that converts chatLog.json text to OPML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbsrjRrDOw&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the tool I used to edit my blog in this period. The software is 1999.io.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When the web started, setting up a server was not particularly hard to do, but it was very hard to understand how something so little could be so big. The hardest part of evangelizing in those days was being believed when you said Yup that's all there is to it.</description>

			<title>Following my tweets in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now follow my tweets in outline form in Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click this &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://tweets.opml.org/davewiner/tweets.opml&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. It'll open a tab in Drummer with a live outline of my tweets. When I write a thread, it will be nested in the outline. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing more to do and it doesn't cost anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to broadcast your tweets like I do, no problem, just go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweets.opml.org/&quot;&gt;tweets.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions are right there. Basically all you have to do is log in, the server will do the rest. No cost, my treat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if your outliner supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, you don't even have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. The same way you didn't have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=radio%20userland&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; to get the benefit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. It's exactly analogous, and it worked, so  if you have your doubts remember that bootstraps work.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to create an ecosystem around outliners and OPML. Twitter is sort of a go-anywhere outliner. That's why integrating Twitter and outliners is so good. I can jot a note down on my phone and it'll be in my outliner when I get back to my desktop. I think this is an important combination. It is for me, as a writer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt; .

			<description>It's a good idea to re-read the docs after you've been using a product for a while. You find things you miss when you were new to the product.</description>

			<description>In general journalism should report tech that is actually being used to do new things, not on VCs hyping ideas of things that will make them even richer but don’t actually do anything for anyone. If a VC is promoting something that fact alone should make you suspicious.</description>

			<description>Idea for a TV miniseries for HBO or Netflix. In 2022 a variant of Covid comes out that kills Republicans and leaves Democrats unharmed. Two thirds of the Supreme Court is wiped out. The state governments of red states are decimated. Within a few months there are no more red states. Series ends with the main characters enjoying a beautiful sunset reveling in the bright future ahead.</description>

			<title>Why Daytona is a game-changer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I spent all of 2021 working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and part of 2020, and I'm going to keep working on it in 2022 (which is just a couple of weeks away gulp). One of the goals of the project was to have great &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, and I think they came out pretty good, but there was still a major problem -- where to put things. This is the problem in all docs. Even if you're a good docs writer, and I've had a lot of practice, and you know the product well, and care about the users, some things just won't have a place. So you document them on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, or in the Change Notes outline, and hope people can find them in a search engine. But they keep doing a worse job of indexing our stuff, and they don't know what is a Drummer doc and what isn't, so you can't say for example, &quot;search the Drummer docs for instructions on how to restore a blog.opml file in a myfiles archive&quot; which is a question a user posed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/140#issue-1082790948&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I smiled when I saw it. This is a job for Daytona. So here's the query I entered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Import%20opml&amp;collection=drummerdocs&quot;&gt;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Import%20opml&amp;collection=drummerdocs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I laughed out loud when the result came back. Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't in a place a user would have looked, and Google &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; would have found it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point is this -- it's past time to take responsibility for finding the stuff we write, and if we do it well, and Daytona does, all of a sudden blogging works so much better, and the incentive to write stuff, to document, to narrate our work, to index everything you can, makes total sense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We crossed into a new generation. I think this is a lot closer to &quot;Web3&quot; than the hyped up garbage the VC industry is selling, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That way when you want to try Drummer, you won't have to switch, you can just use it, and use the other one too, whenever you like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something I struggle to explain to people. I'm 66 years old, and have spent decades making software, so I think about it differently than I did when I was say 22 and wanting to take on the world. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=runway&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;horizon&lt;/a&gt; is obviously 44 years shorter now than it was then. And my goals are adjusted as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/14.html#a144920&quot;&gt;other day&lt;/a&gt;, I've been lucky because of when I was born and my interest in technology, to be part of several &quot;bare metal bootstraps,&quot; where we got down to a basic set of functionality, a complete machine that everyone agreed on, and we as developers built up from there. Some amazing things can be accomplished if the baseline is powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of my &quot;product&quot; today not being Drummer or Daytona or whatever's next, rather it's wanting to have my passion, outlining, experience the same kind of birth as a platform as the Apple II did, or CP/M, MS-DOS, Windows, the web, RSS, podcasting. Look at that string! Wow. But today's users and developers haven't even really experienced &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; exploding platform. That's my product now. I want outlining to be the basis for growth the same way those others were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you don't have to use Drummer but do insist on the highest level of interop with it from the people who make your software. Don't accept no for an answer. I'm not. Hopefully that makes sense? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Drummer is more than a piece of software -- it's an interop &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt;. It's going to sit there and grow, inviting others to interop with it, and every feature and service I add will make the proposition more enticing. Think of Drummer less as a product and more as a seduction. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They are cynical about tech, and have every right to be, based on experience. They know all about lock-in. Most of them have never experienced the wide-open &quot;blue sky&quot; feeling of the early days of a platform with huge potential. I have experienced that many times, because of when I was born. It's not too late to transform Tools For Thought into that kind of platform. It can be even better than the web, why not -- we come after the web.</description>
