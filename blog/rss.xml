			<description>Podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/07/15/theQuestionWereNotWillingToDiscuss.m4a&quot;&gt;The question we're not willing to discuss&lt;/a&gt;. We need new leadership, and it's not the Lincoln Project. Their war is within the Republican Party, which is not the war we're fighting. Our war is whether we go back to slavery, or do we live up to the promise of the country post-Civil War and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society&quot;&gt;Great Society&lt;/a&gt;. We need black leadership. We need to respond to the slavers very clearly, no, we will not discuss what you want to do. Your only choice is whether you will change or you will crawl back into the hole you came out of. There is no other choice. And we need to expel from Congress every traitor to the Constitution, and there are many of them. No half-steps. Nothing that makes people feel like everything is okay, that our war is winnable with stark advertising.</description>

			<description>Trust me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&amp;t=4s&quot;&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; this 18 minute video. It's a real &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;mind bomb&lt;/a&gt; on racism. 18 minutes, for a brain explosion. That's a pretty good deal.</description>

			<description>I have not been able to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki's podcast&lt;/a&gt; feed. The usual tricks aren't working. Here's his Apple Podcasts &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827&quot;&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; page. Usually if you give that URL to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getrssfeed.com/&quot;&gt;GetRSSFeed&lt;/a&gt; app, it returns with the address of the RSS podcast feed. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; it took me. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377&quot;&gt;viewed the XML&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows me an HTML page? If anyone can figure out the URL of his podcast feed, please let me know. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I get stressed, like everyone else. I have a technique for working my way through it. I ask myself this question: What would Dave do if he wasn't stressed out. Change the perspective. I'm now outside myself, am an observer of myself. Often I have no trouble writing down a few things. Then I do one of those things. If it works, I get into it, and an hour or two later I forgot why I was stressed.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1414945524101287938&quot;&gt;tweet about GitHub&lt;/a&gt; yesterday got a fair amount of attention. I'm glad, because the idea is powerful and works. Further if GitHub/Microsoft made this a business priority, it could be streamlined for end-users, and be a revenue source, and an incredible developer platform, beyond what it already does. I would love to begin a conversation with MS, privately if they want, to figure out what's possible here.</description>

			<description>I've been reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Malcolm-Told-Alex-Haley/dp/0345350685&quot;&gt;Autobiography of Malcolm X&lt;/a&gt;, and it's transformative for me. He's talking about whiteness from the point of view of a black man of my parents' generation. I can't agree with some of what he says, he's talking nasty shit about my people, and it's as oppressive as anything anyone says about blacks, even the stuff he quotes. Don't respond to oppression with more oppression. But overriding that is the bigger point, that the United States has been destroying the lives of black people since inception. I just spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&quot;&gt;18 minutes&lt;/a&gt; with the flipside of Malcolm X, a white academic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://documentarystudies.duke.edu/people/john-biewen&quot;&gt;John Biewen&lt;/a&gt;, explaining what it means to be white, in the same context as that which X describes, but from from the other side of the relationship. I think if you watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&amp;t=1095s&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, it'll be the most transformative 18 minute video experience you've had in a long time.</description>

			<description>Good morning sports fans! The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; finals resume tonight, I'm actually going to miss basketball when it's over.

I take my bike ride every day, rain or shine. I used to skip rainy days but this summer that's not an option because it rains every damned day, and not just drizzle, hours of downpour. And the thunder last night. Who could sleep through that. Not this sports fan. I just want some beautiful warm summer weather. On the other hand the new rose bush I planted really seems to like all the wetness.</description>

			<description>Something very scary just happened. There's a bug in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; that it sometimes updates the wrong outline when an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;I/O&lt;/a&gt; update comes in. This can result in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=sarcasm&quot;&gt;hilarity&lt;/a&gt; when somehow the updates overwrite the file for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems there is no backup. It's a bug. And bugs hurt! I looked everywhere and kicked myself virtually for not maintaining a backup of this vital file. Every time I publish there should be a copy preserved. Well, it turns out that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; happening. I post the outline to the instantOutlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/outlines/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the power and elegance of GitHub, there's a snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main/outlines/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;every update&lt;/a&gt;, going back to when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main?after=8131158da2d286bb63af971a89c286e1e6f6c217+349&amp;branch=main&amp;path%5B%5D=outlines&amp;path%5B%5D=scripting.opml&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/845ff95bfb4be0f23decf8293c87bd1265f2e6a3#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/3786362d531109220bafe8f62b9689692f03f92b#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc&quot;&gt;June 17&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>We're finding that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; people and I have the same values re software and users. In yesterday's Twitter thread, they asked what would be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1414588756389023744&quot;&gt;perfect storage system&lt;/a&gt;. I said: &quot;my answer, for now, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;. But it isn't perfect, it's what we can do now that meets the criteria for now and the near future (the vision, the direction I want to go in). I think we share that. We want users to be as independent as possible, and to empower all levels of technical interest. I don't want the responsibility of keeping the world's ideas online. I want that distributed with rock-solid interop.&quot; I think that's about as concise a definition of why I do things the way I do them. As I was sure they would, the Logseq folk agreed.</description>

			<description>The best approach to solving our problems is to spread the gospel of journalism, to everyone who wants to learn. Teach elementary school students. Make a semester of journalism required for all college grads. The model of journalism of the past no longer works. That's why lies are winning, people have no idea of the elements of good journalism.Teach senior citizens how to do good journalism.</description>

			<title>How my apps do storage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a technical post, written in response to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1414472093589114880&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Logseq. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/api.js&quot;&gt;the API&lt;/a&gt; I use to access my storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The names begin with &quot;tw&quot; because I use Twitter for identity, so initially thought of these as twitter ops.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you scroll to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/api.js#L1195&quot;&gt;bottom of the file&lt;/a&gt; you'll see a &lt;i&gt;nodeStorageApp&lt;/i&gt; function which is how my apps are organized to access the storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first implementation was in 2014, it was an NPM package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I came up with a smaller, more streamlined package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;daveAppServer&lt;/a&gt; that I've been using for all my latest projects. Key point -- it supports the same API as nodeStorage. I like to do things that way. It's also a proof of concept that it's possible to put another server behind the API. This will probably be necessary at some point to augment or replace Twitter as the identity system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm very much thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/07/09/142855.html?title=drummerForPoets&quot;&gt;Drummer for Poets&lt;/a&gt; where not-very-technical users can run their own servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted you to know how I do storage. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Oatmeal and RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This piece started as a Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1413871847238782990&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Oatmeal&quot;&gt;Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; person &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Oatmeal/status/1412854719475712002&quot;&gt;lamented&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was not a wave anymore. It's more like a big lake not a roiling ocean.   People go boating, have a picnic, swim in RSS-land, but it isn't like a moon mission or even a Sting concert. :-) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1412856765083947019&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; that RSS could be fun again if people would work with each other.

Its growth feeds off collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't know this, but RSS got its initial wave, the one you all remember so fondly, from a collaboration between UserLand Software and the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're still coasting off the energy unleashed in that combo. That's how stuff like this happens.   People still have the myth of The Great Visionary who sees the right path and leads us out of the wilderness. But that's not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead, two parties with enough power and influence decide, consciously and deliberately, to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to win big, put aside self-glorification and getting ahead for a brief moment, and focus on how you and someone else can break through, creating something that could never exist otherwise.

			<description>I found it impossible to get excited about last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/9/22569878/nba-finals-suns-bucks-chris-paul-devin-booker&quot;&gt;NBA finals game&lt;/a&gt; between the Suns and Bucks. Two teams I spend no mental energy on. I know the Suns are great. I watch their teamwork, amazing stuff. That's what I love about sports, you see hugely talented people who spend their lives preparing to compete and, esp in basketball, it still matters how the least talented person on the team is doing. You don't see them complaining about each others' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltWN98PTJY&quot;&gt;manners&lt;/a&gt;. They get on with it. They have a goal. Another reason this year's playoffs are interesting, no matter who wins, the players on the winning team will be champions for the first time. So they're playing for something that's real to them. Next year, if they make it back to the finals as the Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Cavaliers, etc have in recent years, you wonder how they get motivated. Another trophy, big eff'in deal. Anyway even with all the drama, I just don't care who wins. Maybe as the series progresses I will, but I doubt it -- it might be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/nba-finals-bucks-suns-one-gambler-made-an-11000-bet-that-this-will-happen&quot;&gt;sweep&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Every time I switch my iPhone to a different computer, I have to start over with music. Why. After 15 years or so, couldn't they offer a way to back it up and then restore it? This must be some kind of copyright thing. I wish I had a phone that was rationally designed with the user in mind. I also have an Android phone, but as far as I can tell they broke the only way to copy music onto the device from a Mac. Not sure if a Windows machine is any better. Same reason I'd love to move my desktop act to Linux, but I can't do it without Frontier. Which is, btw, why I had to buy a new Mac. I mistakenly updated my iPhone and it wouldn't work with the Mac I keep un-updated so I can continue to run Frontier. All I have to say is this: Oy. What a mess.</description>

			<title>Drummer for poets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about how people will host their own Drummers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to run the only server, I might not even want to run the main server. I do want to continue developing the software. This is different from how Facebook and Twitter run, I'm not trying to create another walled garden. It's not the kind of work I like, or am particularly good at. It's much more like how WordPress works. Only I think Drummer can be even easier to set up and manage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to create networks of outliner users. I call this &quot;Communication with a big C.&quot; Not the wires, but the ideas that go over the wires. Nodes in my network are human minds, not computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world I imagine is something like 1980s software model with a much more efficient distribution system. And the product, unlike the one from the 80s, is built around networking, where the networking features of MORE and ThinkTank were barely a twinkle in the eye. There was no software to back it up &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons I wanted Symantec to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/symantec_acquires_think_technologies&quot;&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; Think Technologies: they had one of the leading Mac email packages at the time, a product called InBox. There were two others, and I was friends with them too. I wanted desperately to get real networking support into MORE. Never happened, unfortunately, that had to wait for Frontier. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to put the pieces together. One of them is to get the hosting working on systems like AWS, Digital Ocean and Glitch. So a user can just launch a server from a repo, have it mostly configure itself, have a Drummer server running in minutes. That's the goal. We have some experience with this, the various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22for+poets%22&quot;&gt;For Poets&lt;/a&gt; projects we've done here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/216&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions or suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: For programmers, the key piece of software has a funny name. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;. It's an application server, perfectly set up to host Drummer, because in fact it is what I use to host Drummer. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>People, drugs and feelings</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I once had a girlfriend named Kim. We spent a lot of time together. I really loved her, but she also totally frustrated me. One day I was taking a walk with my friend Bodie, a massage therapist, and I kept complaining about Kim. Oh if only Kim would do this. If only Kim would be like that. I hate it when Kim is this way or some other way. Every time I did that, Bodie would say &quot;Why do you feel that way about yourself.&quot; I started getting mad, but she kept doing it. Finally, as she said she knew I would, I realized I was projecting all over Kim. None of this had anything to do with her, I was using her to examine my feelings about myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like everyone, I like drugs. Alcohol, weed. I like opiates, I was given huge amounts of them when I had my surgery in 2002. I could have gotten addicted, I probably did to some extent, but luckily it was easy for me to stop. I was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15799595/&quot;&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; fiend for over 30 years. And I like sex, and in a way sex is one or more people sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/news/20131125/how-the-love-hormone-works-its-magic&quot;&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;. You feel love because your body bathes you in great drugs! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about drugs, I learned, is there is no such thing as a drug you enjoy that your body doesn't already produce on its own. Feelings work like that too. If someone's anger or fear upsets you, it's only possible because you already had the anger or fear yourself. It's also why people sometimes completely miss how other people feel, they mistake their own feelings for the other person's feelings. If someone does X that evokes my fear, I assume they caused the fear, and therefore are somehow to blame for it. It's usually not the experience the other person has. If you ask them &quot;Are you scared or angry?&quot; in a non-judgemental way (very hard to do I know) you might find they are not. Or if they were, it has passed. Do you remember how, as a child your emotions would flow so easily, one second a baby is smiling and happy, and two seconds later the baby screaming in apparent agony. Inside you're still doing that, even if you pretend not to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think in some sense we all want to go back to the womb, to find the perfect container, where everything you need is provided: warmth, shelter, food, and probably some very good drugs too. But no matter how much you love someone, how much you expect from them, they can't take you there. It's not the way it works. We're all on solo trips, fending for ourselves, and beneath it, not too happy about it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is one important caveat. Fear and anger are useful feelings when you're really in danger. If a bear is attacking you, fear is correct! It doesn't matter if you had the feelings before, you're not projecting, you have to decide right now in real time to fight or run. And your brain is flooding your system with drugs that increase your chance of surviving the attack. But, if you mistakenly feel fear, ie there is no real threat, your body still releases the drugs. It's why we accumulate tension in the neck, because it's part of the fight or flight response. If you're in constant fear, your neck never relaxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Web devs -- if you work in JavaScript and sometimes think of adding a feature that uses OPML but think it's too much trouble, I've put together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt; in the form of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;NPM package&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/client/opml.js&quot;&gt;browser-based code&lt;/a&gt; that makes supporting OPML as simple as JSON. There's a new explosion of interest in outliners, so now is a great time to start wiring these things together to create truly world wide applications. We're on the cusp of greatness, again. Imho, ymmv, mmlm. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>
