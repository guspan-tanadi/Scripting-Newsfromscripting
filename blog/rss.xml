			<description>Amazing: No news org has rushed into the space of running a ChatGPT that is totally up to date on the news. I think if one put their mind to it, it could be done in a couple of weeks, if that much.</description>

Before the finale, there's going to be a presidential election. Current &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News&quot;&gt;ATN&lt;/a&gt; management is backing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsHYod9tdsY&quot;&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;. But it looks like Shiv and probably Tom are going to run ATN, and we know Shiv wants &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/29/moderate-candidate-not-specified.html&quot;&gt;someone else&lt;/a&gt;. And also don't forget, the oft-overlooked Roy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Connor_Roy&quot;&gt;Connor&lt;/a&gt;, is running for president. It might not matter who's Logan's successor, the show might be about who is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuccessionTV/comments/si0qg8/who_is_the_raisin_based_upon/&quot;&gt;The Raisin's&lt;/a&gt; successor. It's hard to imagine the Swede cares, but we know for a fact that Shiv does. And in this, she's not like a Roy kid, she's a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&quot;&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; person, who's been kept on the sideline too long because of her gender. A Roy might end up in the White House, a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.distractify.com/p/who-is-the-raisin-in-succession&quot;&gt;raisin&lt;/a&gt;, and whoever it is will be in Shiv's pocket? &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; would be a fine ending.</description>

			<description>I see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1652153032791019521&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey is answering questions&lt;/a&gt; in his new Twitter, known as Blue Sky. He talks about new Twitters, but he acts like a competitor, ignoring Mastodon, which is up and running, and has the feature that there is no Jack Dorsey or Elon Musk, and the Silicon Valley cartel doesn't own it. My message to Dorsey if he can hear it: You've got your billions, find something else to play with. Twitter has a job to do, we need choices, we &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; need another Jack Dorsey mess.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;How about instead of emotional appeals, let's do some real old fashioned marketing of Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;List features in the left margin.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;List products across the top.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put checkboxes where the product has the feature. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We used to do this kind of stuff really well. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Products I'm interested in --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Blue Sky&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nostr&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ChatGPT as my editor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I would love to read a chatbot-condensed version of the 28 years of my writing. Maybe in a couple of years they'll be able to do that well. I tend to repeat ideas over and over. We're beginning to be able to find those. Now can we eliminate the duplication and have the writing still be interesting? People seem so scared of having the machine alter our writing, but for me, it would be a service. I never am able to sit down and turn this stuff into a book, I just don't write that way. Maybe I could team up with a bot who would be the perfect editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>ChatGPT as a writing coach</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Another ChatGPT use-case: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/27/market-entry-error.html&quot;&gt;writing coach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's got a weird title, &quot;Market Entry Error&quot; because ChatGPT tried to correct what it thought was an error.  I actually had a question about it, and as a result of the dialog, I simplified the text and avoided using a word some people would mis-read (as the bot had initially).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people trivialize what's going on here, they must not be using it well enough. It has a more intelligent conversation that most humans would because it &lt;i&gt;never gets distracted,&lt;/i&gt; it always tries hard to understand what I said. It's a sad comment on us humans, we're &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; distractable, and even though we might have the intelligence to help with this kind of question, in practice we can't do it because our attention is so scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A thirty-year time capsule</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A quick story. I was once at a workshop, a free-form thing, where a group of people sat in a circle for three days. You could leave and come back, or take a walk with someone you met there, or sit in a corner and read a book, whatever you want. It was open to everyone, no cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got some shit from a 22-year-old who had complained that it was awkward to get an erection at odd unplanned times. I was in my 40s at the time, and responded that some of us would love to have that problem. People laughed and the young man was probably embarrassed, so he shot back -- you think you know so much because you're old. I asked if he thought there was anything a person twice his age might understand that he didn't. He said no. I asked if he had learned anything since he was twelve. Oh yeah no comparison. Do you think learning ends at 22? Yes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mention this because I recently talked with a friend I hadn't seen in 30 years. Very interesting and memorable experience. Like a time capsule. A lot happened in that time, obviously -- lots of learning, some of it intentional (training, therapy), and while I'm still the same person, the way I relate to the world is much improved in the intervening years. I could see it because I was reminded what it was like then, and how different it is now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A rambling 12-minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/26/theBigDavesBasketballPodcast.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the NBA and how it compares to tech. I'm speaking to my bud, Dave Jacobs, we've been chatting during the playoffs this year. His team as you will soon learn are the Golden State Warriors, who I don't particularly like (as you will also be able to tell). It's just what's on my mind in terms of basketball, which is basically a metaphor for everything.</description>

So Google is on the way out, and Twitter while it's here to stay, not as the town square, rather as the global and public news wire service, Mastodon is becoming more of the place where intelligent people discuss their doings.

			<description>I've been linkblogging exclusively to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; for the last week or so. No more posting links to Twitter. Just Masto (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog.) I like it. It's changed the way I see the two networks. Not sure people on Mastodon understand it's my linkblog, I think we still have some more work to do there.</description>

			<description>I don't usually watch MSNBC these days, esp not at 9PM at the beginning of the NBA playoffs, but for some reason I was watching Maddow on Monday and after her long monolog, which was obviously headed to gloating over Tucker Carlson's firing at Fox, her first guest is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22jay+rosen%22&quot;&gt;JAY ROSEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; who we know. So weird to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jayrosen_nyu/110259979835565712&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; in my Catskills living room like that out of the blue. I think TV should be more like that, customized so Maddow mostly interviews (or appears to interview) people they know I know. This is the ultimate in news. And if I don't like Maddow, I can swap her persona for someone I like better. Not sure who that would be now, I find them all pretty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=obsequious&quot;&gt;obsequious&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>While we're at it why don't we have an open api-able dictionary for the English language. Google doesn't really have one, and I don't like pointing to them anyway. When I use an unusual word, I want to link to its definition. (Yes I know about Wordnik. I even wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; to work with it, but they shut us out of the API for some reason. I was hoping they'd adopt the product, even market it. I can't imagine it cost that much to let people use it.)</description>

The first system I really wanted this for was Substack, although I would have liked Facebook or Medium to have it a long time ago. Yes I know there are ways to pipe RSS into systems, I've written plenty of them. But there's no substitute for a content system supporting it as a feature.</description>

			<description>If you're a developer who wants to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;create standards&lt;/a&gt;, you might check in with other people who have worked in the area, describe the problem, ask if they have ideas. I try to do that. Unfortunately the people mostly don't respond, but sometimes they do. It's how we avoid having two or more ways of doing exactly the same thing. And the second person is the one who has the power to set a standard, not the first. So it's the power move if your goal is really to try to set a standard.</description>

			<description>Have you ever noticed -- if you ask a programmer to do something and their first reaction is a vehement &lt;i&gt;no way are we doing that&lt;/i&gt; then they come back a week later and they've implemented it. I learned never to take a hard no as a for-real no. Good developers keep coming back to the idea if it's interesting enough. Sometimes it ends up as disastrous as the programmer initially thought. I could tell you stories. But also sometimes it's how killer features get into products at the last minute.</description>

			<description>FeedLand tweak. Now when displaying a linkblog item, instead of (link) we say what domain the link goes to.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Basic questions to ask of any would-be successor to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is there a character limit in Blue Sky?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does it support simple styling: bold and italic.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#How_hyperlinks_work_in_HTML&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Titles?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you edit posts?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does it support enclosures, for podcasting?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How about two-way RSS, nice to have. Hook up to simple networks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My criticisms of Blue Sky, having never tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's invite-only. Really? On an open protocol? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's founded by Jack Dorsey, a nice enough fellow, who should sit down after the huge mess he left us with Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The FeedLand platform</title>

That's still true, but the product deserves to be out there, so very quietly last week I made the feedland repo public. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/database/database.md&quot;&gt;SQL commands&lt;/a&gt; that create the FeedLand database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided today was the day to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/151114.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about it, because I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/31&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the database that I want to ask questions about from people with expertise in MySQL, and can't do that publicly without referring to bits that are in that repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was both impossible to watch at times, and in some ways the best most revealing most fun episode ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two sons are complete fucking idiots. And Shiv is her father's daughter and the son he never had. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The moral of this story is the feminist complaint, she was obviously pushed aside because of her vagina, in favor of the idiot penises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And like the previous episode which ended with Kendall smiling (over something stupid), this one ends with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/shivSmile.png&quot;&gt;Shiv smiling&lt;/a&gt; (over something clever and kind of evil). So I guess in the next one it's Roman, right? Five episodes to go. Two more siblings, plus Tom and Greg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who's smiling at the end of the last episode? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We like our basketball players to have a reason to want to win, who don't feel they're doing anyone a favor by showing up to play the freaking game, and don't practice race-hate on Twitter. New York is a diverse city, and proud of it. Welcoming the Nets back to NYC. No more carpetbaggers please. And &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; no more Brooklyn Nets/Nazis. Thanks.</description>

			<description>I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/22/msg-world-s-most-famous-arena.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT why&lt;/a&gt; they call &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt; the &quot;world's most famous arena.&quot; I think it's bullshit. If it's the most famous one what's the point of saying it is. Everyone would know that, right.</description>
