			<title>Tagging revisited</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two summers ago I was playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/07/22/135636.html?title=taggingInScriptingNews&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; in Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, if I enclose a bit of text in double-square-brackets it's processed by Old School as a tag. It makes a call to the tag server software, which simply adds the reference to a database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on a tag reference in my post, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/19/tagrefbrowser.png&quot;&gt;dialog pops up&lt;/a&gt; with the references to the tag in reverse chronologic order, and it stacks them, so you can click on tags within tags. It's a deceptively complex bit of software, built into the web page you're reading my blog on.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a core feature of the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/span&gt; category. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I stopped tagging at some poin. It's a nice thing to do, but it's for the future, and I'm busy now, and I find I'm not using it that much, still preferring to find the equivalent of tags in Google, because that requires no pre-thought and thus is likely to be more complete. And since I just started tagging two years ago, there, 26 years of my writing that never will be tagged. So I use Google every time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the technology still seems potentially valuable, for writing that's more of a product, like reference manuals, or specs or standards work, designs, stuff where the dollar value of the writing is clear. And potentially you can hire people to do the tagging, or more likely give the job to an AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you may see me tagging here in the coming days, this is why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;(as they say)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to attach links and recordings to.

MP3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Boring roofs are best</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, if I were shopping for a new house, I'd look at the roof first. I do not want an interesting roof. It must be boring and for that it should be peaked in the middle, and that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/19/houseWithABoringRoof.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/2061203742_zpid/&quot;&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; with a boring roof.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've bought three houses in my life and all have had &quot;creative&quot; roofs because I guess I find them interesting or I don't bother to look, or consider that roofs that are flat in places or have skylights, or worse have skylights in flat places, are going to have problems. Gutters get clogged and the water backs up and forms ponds. And if the ponding is hidden from view, you could think you don't have a problem with your roof when water is leaking into the wood that support the roof, and then you are in trouble. Let me say that again. You. Are. In. Trouble. One day a leak shows up in the ceiling and when you trace it back to the source you find a pond. And you realize it was right there all the time and you never saw it. And then you see a picture like this..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/19/roofrot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;You do not want this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please. Boring roofs only. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if you're building a house, same message. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>House of the Dragon spoilers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Warning, spoilers below. You have been warned! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm finally watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon&quot;&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; -- the prequel of Game of Thrones. In Succession terms, it's as if they made a show about how Cousin Greg became such an interesting character. Or Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But: House of the Dragon is not well put together. I found it hard to get started, I rebelled against the new characters in the same location, Kings Landing, only 200 years earlier. Incongruous, distrurbing and invasive. Who are these people where's the Mother of Dragons and Cersei Lannister fighting for the throne. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I eventually did plow through all that, and just when I was getting into the characters, boooom, they're 10 years older and they're played by new actors that don't look much like they did earlier, esp the star. It's like switching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_York&quot;&gt;Darrens&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Sargent&quot;&gt;Bewitched&lt;/a&gt; only with a dozen or more characters all at the same time. Oy!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And before you could begin to figure out who was who, they went straight into a Red Wedding type thing, and I have no idea who did what to who or why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm now on the second to last episode and back into it. It's finally feeling like Game of Thrones, and I hope they don't blow it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Yeah I can go swimming most days, but it's almost never sunny and it seems it's raining every day. Welcome to the all-new Planet Earth. We have it easy here in the northeastern US, relatively speaking. Outrageous heat in the west where summer is usually cool. The fires in Maui, a place you'd never think would be inundated with fire. Our industrial world had a good run, now that's over. It's only going to get worse from here. What will we do? Hell if I know.</description>

We talked about the technological beginnings of blogging, RSS and podcasting. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I wanted to do this with Andrew because I had not respected his books in the 00s that said the online world we were creating wasn't going to be too great. I thought of course here's a guy trying to make a buck by invalidating our hard and successful work. Well it turned out Andrew had it right -- and so did we. There's no new technology that can't be abused or have serious downsides. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it, because the flipside is also true. The answers to our problems can be found in the new tech. We tend to discount the good things that came from online computer tech and there are many. I don't do many interviews, but I like to do them with old friends like Guy Kawasaki and with people who I didn't respect well enough in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+andrew+keen&quot;&gt;the past&lt;/a&gt;, like Andrew, to try to make amends. It was a good show.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Heh yes I still use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. I do all my JavaScript programming in a suite I developed in 2014, and it's still great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning, I decided to take a minute and streamline something I'm doing a lot of now that I work from two different computers. And that involved doing something like what Jake Savin did in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/17/fatpagesConfirmaddress.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;same place&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.

It's also a historic artifact, it uses a text-based file format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/faq.html&quot;&gt;Fat Pages&lt;/a&gt;, designed to be embedded in a web page that was also the docs for the bit. We came up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+fat+pages&quot;&gt;all this&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/03/31/FatPagesWithWheels.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why NYC is such a great port</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've always been fascinated by the history of NYC. It's where I was born and raised, so for me it's personal, and besides -- it's a very interesting place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For me the most interest is in its evolution. And you can see in this picture, 499 years after it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_New_York_(state)#:~:text=European%20discovery%20of%20New%20York,in%201609%20by%20the%20Dutch.&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt;, why humans decided this was the place to build an amazing city -- look at the size and shape of the port and how it's protected from the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are many other things evident in this picture. You could do a whole semester in college just exploring the &lt;i&gt;whys&lt;/i&gt; of this picture. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/16/newyork.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;NYC from high up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I much prefer working at my house, where I can take a nap when I need a break, or just walk around and mutter out loud or scream in delight when something works that I didn't expect to. Or &lt;i&gt;laugh&lt;/i&gt; out loud when I write something that amuses me, like right now. I'll just smile. Don't want to freak out the people around me. This idea of commuting to work kind of sucks. It's been a very long time since I did this. On the drive into work a guy cut in front of me merging into one lane (from two) with lots of advance warning. Okay I was a dick, I made it hard for him to do it, and the fucker hit my car! My beautiful Model Y. It was just the mirror, and it swiveled so there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xR8hewpOo-8&quot;&gt;no damage&lt;/a&gt; but what the fuck. This wasn't even NYC. I got a picture of his license plate. I honked my horn and yelled. Then I got over it. I admit I'm stressed having to work away from home while repairs are made on the house. As I used to say when I was hanging out in the lobby of the Unix server room at UW with my programming buddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Gary+Sevitsky%22+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;Gary Sevitsky&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;i&gt;oh la&lt;/i&gt; -- which is a way of combinging WTF with a certain level of exhaustion mixed with a bit of resignment to the WTF-ness of everything. Last time I wrote about him I learned that he died. Sarov if you can hear me, I never forgot this philosophy. Okay I'm ready to begin my work day now, I think. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Same for a product that's managed by a large development company with lots of users. It's virtually impossible to re-think the top-level structure of the product. Much the same way you can't re-think how the streets in a city work. Too much is built around the way things are. Maybe it's true for movies and books too? Hmmm. Maybe you can only make big changes early in the life of an idea. What set me going in this direction is the way the UI of Radio UserLand was organized. We decided to start over from scratch in 2001. We already had a blogging tool, Manila, which had grown into a sprawl as we invented new tools to hang on a structure that wasn't designed for so much functionality. With Radio, I wanted to see if we could take the same functionality and make it tight and focused. It worked. There were two main screens, one for writing (the home page) and one for reading (the first link off the home page). Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/14/radioUserland.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Could you rework a product like WordPress to work this way? Yes, I believe technically it's possible. It would just be another interface on the same functionality. It would not be able to do all that WordPress could, but for most people that's fine because most of what most people do can be covered by much less than all the UI, at least in theory, imho, ymmv, I am not a lawyer, murphy-willing, my mother loves me and all other disclaimers.</description>

			<description>An immediate improvement AI could make for developers are making the error messages from language interpreters and runtimes better at pointing to the actual source of the problem, not just where it shows up. That would require some guesswork, but it's better to have the computer do some of that before turning it over to the human. The same way it can make medical doctors work easier.</description>

			<title>Bootstrapping an app ecosystem</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A week ago I wrote a piece about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html&quot;&gt;identity as a product&lt;/a&gt;, summarizing stuff I've written on this topic for the whole life of my blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been on an exploration of what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; is, and how developers and users figure in it. In the intervening almost 30 years (!) we started out with a fresh slate, the open web, but it never turned into the developer platform I hoped it would. Quite the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today it's virtually impossible for an independent developer, without millions in venture capital, to launch a new product or service. Far too many barriers exist. And the money comes at a cost, meaning that many products that are truly useful to users never get out there. Mostly the products turn users into the product as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/willUsersAlwaysBeUsers.html&quot;&gt;cliche&lt;/a&gt; goes, products for marketers, wanting to sell products to largely passive users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I still believe! There are a lot more young people today who are fluent in computer programming, who have been using computers their whole lives, than there were the 80s, the last time there were intentional developer communities where an individual could launch a product and still retain their freedom to serve users, not marketers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now some story-telling to go with this idea...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first deliberate new platform I experienced was the Macintosh in 1984. Before that, there were the Apple II and CP/M platforms which had accidental developer communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Apple II's app ecosystem was bootstrapped by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc&quot;&gt;Visicalc&lt;/a&gt; but at first Apple, did almost nothing to help. There was no idea that the Apple II would be used in business, or that there even &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a business market for personal computers. The Apple II was thought of as a &quot;home computer.&quot; Used for shopping lists, calendars, recipes, and kids doing homework. Ads showed the computer on a kitchen counter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Visicalc, an Apple II spreadsheet with an innovative UI, &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; the business market and a huge wave of apps following it, once they showed it could be done. That wave continued on the IBM PC with another developer product, Lotus 1-2-3, a precursor to Excel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;CP/M had a spreadsheet, Supercalc, and a lot of word processors, databases, programming languages, communication software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first deliberate app ecosystem was the Mac in 1984.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When it first shipped, the Mac didn't run Apple II software, so they had to solve the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; problem. They did it by developing two products in-house that were bundled with the machine -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite&quot;&gt;MacWrite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint&quot;&gt;MacPaint&lt;/a&gt;. So people who bought the machine would have something to use it for before they noticed that there was no developer software for the platform at launch. Only promises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was lucky, our product, ThinkTank, for the Apple II, had just launched in 1983, struggled to find distribution at first, got a rave review from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/personal-computers-software-first-idea-processor.html&quot;&gt;NY TImes&lt;/a&gt;, which had just started reviewing software, and then the authoritative tech pub &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/12/infoworldThinktank1.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/12/infoworldThinktank2.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; it the highest score possible. All of a sudden we had sales, and could grow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our early success caught the eye of Guy Kawasaki who was newly hired as Apple's chief evangelist. We were a tiny startup but they seeded us with an early Macintosh along with the big software companies, and while we ported to the Mac platform it wasn't uncommon for Mike Boich, who was in charge of developer relations at Apple and himself a programmer, to be at our office helping us debug. They got involved with developers. There was no idea that success meant developers succeeding on their own. This very wrong idea would be the fatal flaw of a few otherwise excellent startup platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We raised angel money and by early summer 1984 we had ThinkTank/Mac shipping. Apple bought full page ads for our product in Fortune, Business Week, Time, etc, out-spending us by a lot. Targeted at education and business, the Mac also caught on in government, and esp the military. To be clear, they invested in quite a few other products, not just ours. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had a long way to go to catch up to the IBM PC, which had launched three years earlier and was booming, with magazines covering PC software and every major category deep with product, addons, utilities. But Apple's Mac strategy eventually worked. It took time for the developer community to grow, lots of other factors were at play, mostly that the PC had limited memory and the Mac could grow without practical limits. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to, in 2023&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Assuming one were going to approach the idea outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/130423.html&quot;&gt;Identity as a Product&lt;/a&gt;, on launch there should be at least two simple products that play the role of MacWrite and MacPaint, giving users a reason to try the platform, and give developers a user community to aim at. Early users would get a special price, but it would &lt;i&gt;never be free.&lt;/i&gt; This is a key part of the positioning of the service. Unlike social networks, users pay for this product, and are viewed in every way as the customer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The MacWrite/MacPaint startup apps would be released as open source so developers not only have the ideas in the product to help them get started, but also working source code. The bundled products would also define documented open file formats, that developer products could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; with, and thus would set the precedent that interop is a core value of this platform. More than any idea, it shows that we are investing in user's power and choice and will commit to getting them lots of software they can use without having to leave their favorite tools behind. There never has been a commercial platform with this ethos, as far as I know.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 when Apple was on the ropes, a fantasy about what I would do if I were Apple's new CEO (this was before Jobs came back in 1997). It more or less outlines a business plan for bootstrapping an app ecosystem. We help developers, as Apple did with my product in 1984, and they commit to deliver products in time to be part of the bootstrap of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There would also be a venture capital part of this platform, and it will mainly focus on product quality, not headcount, or even number of users. Value to the platform will be the major concern. Are they filling a need that's under-served? Will they draw more developers to the platform. Will it help build user confidence? Will it be fun? Do we believe in their vision? ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How revenue flows -- from users to the platform, where it's distributed to app devs, based on the utility of the product. They can if they want, in addition, charge users a license fee, offer a subscription, or whatever, for use of their product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if the users get value from the product, developers will receive dollars from the platform. That means this can work for individuals. Just make a product that people love, and this can be your fulltime job, or maybe even make you rich. No more turning excellent developers into managers and CEOs if that isn't their calling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not the iOS model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The prior art for this is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Apple's iOS app ecosystem. The platform vendor here, sells core services to the users, mainly identity and storage, but does not provide any warranty for the developer apps.

I have gigabytes worth of text and images on scripting.com, written over the last 29 years. I would like to be able to pay say $10K to have that writing persist at its current address, after I die. That would be something the platform vendor could offer -- safe storage, renewal of the domain name, whatever other services are needed to make the ideas persist in their current form.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have an extensive collection of Trump imagery from the years he was in office, but I haven't used any of them since he left office. I'd rather never write about Trump again, but he's back in the news so I guess it has become unavoidable. So I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/07/01/orangeBlob.png&quot;&gt;orange splat&lt;/a&gt; image in place of any likeness of Trump himself. I see him as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/medical-magazines/human-scourge&quot;&gt;human scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Punishment for us for lacking honor or integrity, humanity. There will of course be a final post about Trump, someday, but sadly we are not there yet.</description>

			<description>I hung out with some people this week who read my blog, so I heard about things they liked or found amusing. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/05/121628.html&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; got some laughs. &quot;It was a bit breathtaking. A few minutes before I was a schmuck. Now I was an officer at Harvard.&quot; I write these things mostly to entertain myself, but if other people like them that's a super bonus for me.</description>

It used to be if you wanted to do what he's doing, go back to the beginning, study the roots of rock music in episodes, to teach people who love music how things got going, how our culture changes, he would have needed backing of a big media company to get distribution, and for that he'd have had to accept their limits, and also have a good idea up front of what he was trying to do. Without the gatekeepers, he could try out an idea, iterate, and after a few years become so influential, with so much by now obvious value, to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/a-music-podcast-unlike-any-other&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; from the New Yorker. Our culture is changing thanks to pioneers like Hickey and podcasting as an open platform. A local friend pointed me to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, in a conversation in her Woodstock driveway. I gave it a try and was immediately hooked. Now music means so much more to me. I'm a proud sponsor, like so many others. Reminds me of a story from the 80s -- once when I was doing a presentation at MacWorld Expo in a crowded auditorium, I asked for a show of hands of people who used my product. The first hand that shot up, super high, with gusto, was that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Steve Wozniak&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn't even seen him. He must have felt enormous pride that his creation, the Apple II, led to this moment. I feel that way about Hickey's product.</description>

The people-watching there is fantastic. And now that weed is legal in NY, everyone was toking, not that this was vastly different from before, WSP has long been a hippie haven.

Put the two slices of cheese pizza in my backpack, got another Citibike and rode back to the hotel, where I sat down with my laptop and am now updating my blog. I feel like I'm back in the saddle. I have a laptop that works as my mobile desktop. I could cover a convention now. Or write about some new technology (see below) or just take in a vision of Jersey City across the Hudson. I could definitely see living here again. What a transition in a few hours. Bike riding in Manhattan is something I didn't realize how much I missed.</description>

			<title>Miriam is great at summarizing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm having a great time with my new librarian assistant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://miriam.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically she's an AI chatbot that has ingested a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;files&lt;/a&gt; from my archive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did the writing, the development was done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;. I get to be a user here. Very relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the other day I very casually asked Miriam how the weather was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/06/askingMiriamAboutTheWeather.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px dotted silver; padding: 3px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being software, she dutifully answered the question, by referring me to various times I had discussed the weather on Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We don't yet have a way to archive the results of queries, which will, when it's ready allow me to share the actual query with you, so you can take it off in different directions if you're so inclined. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A surprising take-away: I really like how she summarized my posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since Automattic also makes WordPress, which is used for blogging I thought this might be an interesting service they could offer. It could also be used to improve their feeds, esp if writers don't want to include full text. I know this is not a popular view, but I like sites that provide descriptions that are not full text, like the NYT. Much easier to skim. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Miriam's digest of my writing would make a good feed. Maybe this is something we should try. (BTW, I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; provide full text in the feed for all my sites.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to like about her summaries -- they are respectful of the reader. No click-bait anywhere in sight. She's a librarian after all. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Using DALL-E to visualize Miriam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E&quot;&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; to draw &lt;a href=&quot;https://miriam.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt; for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I have a vast library of information nice people are interested in reading. So I have hired a librarian named Miriam. She has a standing desk, in front of a vast library of books, spreading out all around her. She has glasses and a very friendly but wise look to her. She wants to help. She has gray hair and bright eyes and a very big smile.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the first images.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/06/miriamByDolly1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked Dolly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/08/06/miriamByDollyBig.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;elaborate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
