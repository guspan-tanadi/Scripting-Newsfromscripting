Mutations aren't necessarily bad, in fact over time the mutations will make the virus less deadly. It's all about evolution and survival of the fittest. Mutation is how evolution happens. A new variant shows up and if it is in some way more likely to propagate and survive than previous variants, it will stick around and thrive, and continue to mutate. If a virus kills its host -- that's not good for survivability. So what happens over time, a virus like Covid becomes less harmful and more transmissible, that's how it becomes &quot;the flu.&quot; The 1918 influenza virus is still with us today. But it doesn't kill people in the numbers that it did a hundred years ago. Over time Covid will get less deadly too.</description>

I was sure that some of them do, but I had never heard this reported on the news. So far they only talk about threats involving losing their jobs. But if the threats were about physical well-being, that's another thing. That's how it works in Russia for journalism and politics. The one year I was at Davos I spent some time hanging out with Russian journalists. This was in 2000, when Russia had supposedly liberalized. I went to a big session in the main hall where one of the officers of the Russian government was speaking, someone who I had been introduced to by my sponsor, the person who got me my white badge (a journalists' credential, the best one available, got me entry to every session, unlike most journalists attending). At one point I stood up and asked a challenging question of the Russian. He gave me a typical evasive answer. But here's the thing -- after I did that, none of my Russian journalist friends would talk to me. Obviously their political system didn't work like ours. Today when there is no pretense at freedom in Russia, I imagine it's much worse. And according to HCR's reporting, we're headed down that path in the US. The next year seems to be our last chance to turn it around.</description>

			<description>I have continued watching &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/span&gt;. Everyone should watch this, if you're a creative, or your work involves creative people. Creativity needs to be nurtured and protected. I'm sure there are other lessons coming, but I'm going through it slowly, I'm still on the first segment.</description>

			<title>Tesla notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday it'll be two weeks since I got the Tesla Model 3. Here are some thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't been using the autopilot more than just trying it, seeing it veer into a head on collision, I quickly took control. i'm pretty sure it wasn't actually going to kill me, it was a simple situation, Highway 28 from Boiceville to West Hurley, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9792245,-74.2513003,3a,75y,117.7h,55.47t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPO1fyoXuIDtIHcKA4Ip3wRL8bdSc58hv_Qfmlh!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPO1fyoXuIDtIHcKA4Ip3wRL8bdSc58hv_Qfmlh%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-4.4466395-ya52.469-ro-1.6197597-fo100!7i7680!8i3840&quot;&gt;wide road&lt;/a&gt;, easy for the autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's the thing -- like the self-driving features of the Subaru, the self-driving features of the Tesla are always there, ready to take over if it thinks you're fucking up. It did a thing weird on a drive out my little dirt road, it sounded an alarm that I was driving off the road. loud screeching sound. I was doing no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that really distinguishes the Tesla as far as i'm concerned isn't the power, or battery, those are nice -- but the full integration of the computer system in the experience. The Subaru is a hodgepodge of different systems that don't know about each other. Very confusing. i've gotten to just using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CarPlay&quot;&gt;Car Play&lt;/a&gt; for everything and ignoring the rest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What this says to me is that in a couple of years, there will be a Mercedes EV with a big screen like Tesla's and no dashboard again like Tesla. And the same or better integration. It'll be running Apple, Amazon or Google software. and it will be as good as Tesla's software because they hire out of the same talent pool.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; is leaving Twitter again. All kinds of paranoid thoughts go through my head. Meanwhile, he posted his announcement &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720&quot;&gt;as a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, not in text but as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/29/jackDorseyEmail.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; because Twitter &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; doesn't support text in a reasonable manner, even though they support video, images, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clubhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;-style conferences, and email newsletters. This is insane. Twitter is an important platform. Not supporting text is a religious thing, as if they didn't have water fountains in The Vatican. (I just came up with that randomly.) I hope the first thing the new CEO does is fix this situation. Let's move outlines over Twitter. Whatever. Text isn't a new innovation, the blogger said ironically.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I had one of my &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; outlines overwrite another. There were no instant outlines updating while this happened, so that's not the source of the problem. If you've had this happen: 1. I am sorry this is happening, that's first. 2. Make sure you do backups. 3. Were you by any chance editing &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml#1627490175000&quot;&gt;the Scripts menu&lt;/a&gt; when this happened? If so, please comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/127&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I'm looking for more clues. I added more debugging code so if it happens to me again, I'll get closer to knowing that the cause is. I really want to get this bug out of there.</description>

I also hear this is getting a lot of play on the news. My filters must be working, because all I've heard of it are ridiculous rebuttals from people trying to argue somewhat logically that this is an illustration of old white men in charge of the Republican Party. I'm sure that's not it. It's marketing. They are always focus-group-testing bullshit like this to see if the people will pick it up, and then they shoot blasts of this bullshit at news people, and 1-in-10 of the focus-grouped bullshit gets picked up by the press. It's worth it, because it keeps the real news off the air, and helps people forget that Trump paid for his golf vacations at his own resorts with taxpayer money. Hundreds of millions of dollars. There's no logic to any of this. And they're not old white menu, that's bullshit. It's just marketing people, and computers.</description>

			<source:outline text="I hear there's some kind of controversy over a frying pan that VP Harris bought. I also hear this is getting a lot of play on the news. My filters must be working, because all I've heard of it are ridiculous rebuttals from people trying to argue somewhat logically that this is an illustration of old white men in charge of the Republican Party. I'm sure that's not it. It's marketing.

			<description>I have a new project in the works that hooks up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; outlines (really any outlines in OPML) and puts all the items in a relational database and lets you do searches. I have a few applications in mind for this stuff. The codename of the project is Daytona. Coming soon to a theater near you.</description>

			<title>BingeWorthy day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/27.html#a203138&quot;&gt;wrote a bit&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;, the app I wrote a couple of years ago that helps you find new shows to binge based on the ones you and your friends like. We need more users for it to really achieve its potential. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would be &lt;i&gt;happy&lt;/i&gt; to do a deal with a tech company on this product. I think Twitter would be great, but there are lots of companies where it could find a good home. I just want to see millions of people using  so I can meet all the people who like the same stuff I do. I think we'd take over the world, figuratively. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A network of people based on their entertainment tastes would make sense for a growing service like Hulu with lots of highly rated shows, that wants to grow their service. Part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;people come back to places that send them away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/28/peopleLikeMe.png&quot;&gt;readout&lt;/a&gt; of people most like me in their  ratings. I don't know @alisonjfields but we seem to like the same stuff. @jsavin is #1. I also like to see @nakedjen and @leolaporte high on the list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I think it's because they create data mining tools for advertisers. This is a data mining for users. The more users, the better the data. A real incentive to get your friends on board. BW should really be a product offered by Netflix, Metacritic, Twitter, Facebook, even Google. What show to watch is a question millions of people have, esp this time of year. This is what the platform should look like. Share profiles w friends. An interesting twist, it's not just about finding shows to binge, it's about finding friends with similar taste.I was surprised to find that Jake Savin, who I worked with a long time ago, and I, have very similar taste. We like and dislike the same things.</description>

Didn't get the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-great&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I'm only on episode 4. It's about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great&quot;&gt;Catherine The Great&lt;/a&gt; of Russia. The story is pretty heavy, but believe it or not, it's a comedy!</description>

			<description>I am a NYT subscriber, but can't access Wirecutter. It's weird, the site seems broken -- when I try to log in it just sends me back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/25/wirecutterSaysFuckOffNYTSubscriber.png&quot;&gt;the page&lt;/a&gt; that says I have run out of free articles. It could be they want more money for WC, if so, the answer is no. I don't read a lot of NYT articles as it is. I have a very bad feeling about them, and it gets worse every year. That took a lot of work on their part because I was raised on the NYT.</description>

			<title>Paradox in social custom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An example of a social custom from two points of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's wrong to bring sex into a work relationship. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think it's equally wrong to bring business into a sexual relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It has happened, esp in Silicon Valley or New York, when a woman I was dating, or interested in dating, revealed that she was really there for the business. I want to understand up front. If it's business, fine -- I'll evaluate it one way, if it's sexual, another. It's a really awkward situation where someone I was attracted to sexually, wants to do business -- and wouldn't have gotten a meeting if it were clearly about business. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Honestly I think the two sides are the same thing, but we view one as wrong, and don't have explicit rules for the second. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you work for me, or we're equals in a business relationship, either way -- no one is accountable to the other for what they do with personal time. Your boss can't call you up on the weekend and expect you to tell them what you're doing. You don't have to tell them anything, unless it impacts your ability to do the work.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think it's equally wrong when a person who reports to me, or is an equal, reports to me on what they're doing in their personal time. It creates a conflict, am I expected to reciprocate, because I won't. I draw a solid line between work and personal time. If I share personal things in a work context, they are no longer personal.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These concerns are spelled out more carefully in professions like medicine, academics, law. A therapist isn't allowed to date a patient. A lawyer can't represent both sides in a legal battle. When the lines cross, there's trouble ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Thanksgiving</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html&quot;&gt;Last year on Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; we were in the midst of the worst of the pandemic, and the best we could do is stay home and hope we don't get infected. This year it's very different -- thanks to the vaccine. I got my first dose of Moderna on January 20, the day we inaugurated the first post-insurrection president. What a relief, in two ways. The Orange Tyrant who tried to overthrow the US government was gone, and I was on my way to being protected from the virus he let run rampant through the country we all have been told is the greatest on earth, but did the worst job of protecting its citizens. I hope that was the low point, but who knows!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also was thankful for my car. It's funny that I thought about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945&quot;&gt;that post&lt;/a&gt; just the other day driving my new Tesla around the neighborhood, marveling at its intelligence, muscle, and how much it is like the computers I use, the exercise bike I just bought, and the phone I carry everywhere with me. The Silicon Valley design ethos, which I am schooled in and in a small way helped develop, is eating the world, as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/software-is-eating-the-world-5-years-later/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; so well. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945&quot;&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; I drove last year is a fine machine, and in some ways it's more comfortable than the Tesla, and it'll probably do better if we get a blizzard in the mountains. But its software is a jumble of poorly designed components that don't work well with each other from a UI standpoint. In that area the Tesla is perfect. It's a system designed to be understood by a modern user. The pre-Tesla car manufacturers have a long way to go to catch up to Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for the first users of Drummer. We have reached a critical mass where I can add features, and get feedback from users, and that gives us the ability to move forward. I think this happened because I decided to put my head down on Drummer and work until it was really ready. There still are problems with the software, it is far from perfect, and I'm thankful for the users' patience, but mostly I'm thankful that there are users to be patient. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 66, health is no longer something I can take for granted. it takes work to keep going, and I've had my troubles this year, but basically I'm still here, and most of my body is working fine. I'm thankful for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's as if I didn't get a PC until the IBM PC came out. Or maybe later. Here's something I figured out the other night, driving on a mountain road with lots of turns and ups and downs, a road I'm quite familiar with -- the Tesla makes you a better driver. This is something my Subaru does too, you only have to hold the steering wheel loosely while navigating the turns and ups and downs. The road is well-marked and the car knows what to do. The Tesla even more so. It's like my iPhone which takes better pictures in 2021 than the 2011 model did. We like to say &quot;no filters&quot; but the truth is they're just really good filters that make you think you're the photographer, but the phone did the hard work. Same with the Tesla. I like driving it in the same way. It flatters me to think I'm that good a driver. I know the truth though -- I didn't become a better driver, I just got a car that makes me feel that I did. And who wouldn't love that.</description>

The exercise is making me stronger. I don't know why I didn't want to do the classes.

When we're doing something particularly strenuous, I close my eyes, focus on my breathing, in through the nose, out through the mouth, and I listen to her say that this pain is worth it because it'll become strength when the workout is over. It's so true. I don't particularly care for the music she chooses, I don't know any of it, and it's not catchy. But she's a lot younger than I am, so I guess this is the kind of music the young folk listen to? I'd love it if there were a Tom Petty ride or a Grateful Dead ride. I can see riding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFnOfpIJL0M&quot;&gt;Refugee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdPOAhBp2Ag&quot;&gt;US Blues&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Going to do some more cleanup work this morning on Markdown support in Old School. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/14#issuecomment-974824472&quot;&gt;the thread continues&lt;/a&gt;. If you're planning on using Markdown to write blog posts in Drummer, you might want to tune in, because things are being locked down today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are only two rules that govern how Old School generates source for the Markdown processor:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One newline per outline node. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Indentation belongs to the author, generates nothing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I sent a private note to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, letting him know this discussion is going on. As far as I know we are setting prior art for outliners used to generate Markdown for publishing. If there is prior art, I would love to know about it now, asap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is different from the Obsidian model also used by LogSeq -- which uses Markdown as a file format for outlines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Here's a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/11/21/153825.html?title=updatesToMarkdownSupport&quot;&gt;this morning's changes&lt;/a&gt; to Markdown support for publishing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This used to be a complex thing to do, but it's absolutely as simple as it can be. I did something new here. I'm only passing through values that are documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;. That's not as draconian as it might sound, because I'm using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; written by my friend Dan MacTough that handles all the common feed flavors, including Atom. His code translates the variants to a common vocabulary. And I further winnow it down to just the basic concepts. To some extent, RSS grew in an unruly chaotic way, but imho the core is solid. After all this time, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; as a new platform, I think it's a good time to pause and create (hopefully) a simpler future that can work better.</description>

I'm only passing through values that are documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;. That's not as draconian as it might sound, because I'm using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; written by my friend Dan MacTough that handles all the common feed flavors, including Atom. His code translates the variants to a common vocabulary. And I further winnow it down to just the basic concepts. To some extent, RSS grew in an unruly chaotic way, but imho the core is solid. After all this time, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; as a new platform, I think it's a good time to pause and create (hopefully) a simpler future that can work better." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 21:58:57 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/11/tide.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19.html#a215857"/>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/14#issuecomment-974157255&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about how Markdown should be processed for Drummer blogs. Basically, what role if any should indentation play, and how many newlines to generate for each line in the outline. My current position -- indentation should play no role in the Markdown we generate from the outline, it should be ignored. And we should generate one newline for every line in the outline. Note this is not how Drummer works now.</description>

			<title>What people at bigco's say for 2000, Alex</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something I've been hearing from employees of big tech companies for my entire career, going back to the late 70s --&gt; &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what they say and do. So many examples. And almost all of them are gone. They were significant, maybe, for a few weeks. Then poof, some other asshole at some other tech giant comes along, and gets his or her (mostly his) few minutes to be a super asshole. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How much more would we get done if we lived up to the hype about supporting innovation. You can't do a lot of that as some random putz inside of a bigco. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You pretty much have to do what I've done, which is stay out of those monstrous structures, that is, if you want to actually do anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then of course the jerks come along and kick over your sand castle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then they're gone in a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far I've survived them all. Knock wood, praise murph, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A simple XML viewer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you view a normal XML file in the browser, Chrome gives you a simple, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/18/xmlviewofscriptingopml.png&quot;&gt;readable XML viewer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to invoke that viewer from a JavaScript app running in the browser. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some kind of JavaScript call like&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; window.xmlViewer (xmltext);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only other option is to rewrite it from scratch, which I'm open to doing but would rather not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/226&quot;&gt;Does anyone know if such a thing exists&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, one of the things that kind of silently limits the size of RSS is the way browsers display RSS feeds. They can handle other XML types in a normal sensible way. But the RSS viewer is broken. I wish they would just let it be, and show it as a normal XML file. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/226&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
