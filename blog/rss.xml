			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, if you're being asked to log in every time you go to the site, you're probably opening it via a bookmark that goes to the old URL. The easiest fix is to edit bookmark so it goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;https://feedland.org/&lt;/a&gt; -- note the &lt;i&gt;https.&lt;/i&gt; Another fix is to do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;hard-reload&lt;/a&gt; of the page. This will force a new version to reload. It redirects if it gets a non https request.</description>

But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;docs page&lt;/a&gt; to answer this question. Looks pretty good to me! No bullshit in the page either.</description>

If you're signed in, to subscribe to a feed just click the feed's checkbox. You can also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?userslist&quot;&gt;who's been on&lt;/a&gt; recently, when they signed up, how many feeds they subscribe to, and how many pages they've viewed. You can also see the feeds that have recently been &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?log&quot;&gt;subscribed to&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to make feed discovery as easy as it possibly can be. We steal (and improve on) ideas from social media apps that didn't exist last time I took a fresh look at feed systems. I don't think of FeedLand as a feed reader -- it's more of a feed management system, imho.</description>

			<description>Another important feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?userfeedsnews=true&quot;&gt;every user has their own feed&lt;/a&gt;, which you can edit in FeedLand, of course. To write a post, click in the edit box at the top of the page, type some text, click the Post button. It should show up in the list of user-feed posts, below. If you want to edit one of your posts, click on the text, make &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/18/editingAPost.png&quot;&gt;the changes&lt;/a&gt;, click the Update button.

			<description>It's important for users to have their own feed in the same way it was good to be able to develop software for the Mac on a Mac. Most users will never make a software product, and maybe most FeedLand users won't write publicly, but you want to make it was easy as possible for people to contribute to the ecosystem they use. It's a philosophy of the active not-just-eyeballs users. It's a basic democratic idea.</description>

			<description>It will be possible to create better teachers out of ChatGPT tech. What led me to that is that it certainly could help people write better bug reports. It would have far more patience than a busy developer, whose job is to fix bugs, not decypher a user's (justifiably) imprecise understanding of how software works. But a chatbot could help, patiently asking the user questions. Then, of course, over time -- the user would learn how to do it themselves, and get this -- they would also learn how software works. There might be some great programmers out there who don't know they are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I was wondering how I could create something that behaved like an app on the Mac desktop from a page in Chrome. I want to use web Drummer to write docs about something I'm working on in Electric Drummer. It helps to have each in its own window for something like that, rather than switching back and forth between tabs. I was going to post a braintrust query but realized I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/chrome-page-to-app.html&quot;&gt;use ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and get the answer right away.

			<title>Register RSS piece</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was the tenth anniversary of Google shutting down their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/google-reader-shutdown.html&quot;&gt;Reader&lt;/a&gt; product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Register had some questions, which I answered via a voicemail, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/15/interviewAnswersForRegister.m4a&quot;&gt;included here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turned into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/14/requiem_for_google_reader/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, which I offered some corrections:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;UserLand Software&lt;/a&gt; no longer exists, I left in 2002, and we shut it down a few years later. I'm just a person now, not part of any company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS 1.0 was not a fork, not sure how you'd characterize it, but it was definitely not a fork. It was a whole new syntax, had no compatibility with RSS 0.91.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS 2.0, which appears to have been left out, was finished in September 2002, and was supported by the New York Times, and thus was supported by the whole news industry and became the standard. Though some disagree, it was backward-compatible with RSS 0.91 and 0.92.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Atom was a new format, again -- not a fork. It gained some popularity and is still in use.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I wasn't stupid, I understood this was propaganda, but I loved the way they did it -- as a genre. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/13/autographFromSixthGrade.png&quot;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt; in one of my best friends' autograph book when we graduated sixth grade and went on to junior high.</description>

			<description>Another glitch -- the other day I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/11.html#a150413&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; FeedLand users who had not already registered an email address to do so now. It's basically impossible for me to test this, because I don't have any accounts to use to test this since the connection with Twitter has been pretty glitchy lately. It turns out it's too late to do this transition, so we'll go ahead with the switch to email identity for feedland.org. When it switches over, you'll have to log into feedland.org using your email address, which should work for people who pre-registered. I know it's complicated, I hate it -- it's the worst use of both of our time, we get no new features for all this bullshit. But Twitter is no longer reliable in this role, so we had to do it. I'll keep you all posted here on progress, and appreciate your patience. I think it'll all be pretty smooth after this change.</description>

I will have a look at the code during the day today and see if I can figure out what went wrong. I was able to get the correct email to go out at 6AM EDT today by editing the stats.json file for the app to indicate that the email for the day hadn't yet gone out, and it immediately started sending out the correct email.</description>

			<description>On the other hand, we should have an &lt;i&gt;open source Twitter replacement&lt;/i&gt; that's fucking easy to install and runs itself. Node.js. Runs on desktop in Electron for local users. It could be much easier than Mastodon. A fractional-horsepower tweeter. If anyone wants to work on that, let me know, I'd like to be part of such a thing (mostly as a user and app developer).</description>

			<description>Okay now I have to tell you about my latest experience with ChatGPT. The subject is CSS. It's possible to do all kinds of crazy logic on DOM elements, given all the different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt; they have. But how to combine them to do what you want to do? You can stare at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; for hours, and do trial-and-error, but if you're like me, you gave up before you even started. But with ChatGPT, you can formulate the question according to what you want to do, and it creates a docs page that probably never existed before, that shows you, with examples, how to do what you want. I just did that. Amazing. It digs you out of corners. Nothing like this has ever existed.</description>

			<title>TweetGPT?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;what would a chatgpt-like twitter be?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i type a query, and the bot responds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;then you can type a query that builds on mine, starting a new thread, which other people can build on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;the thread to the first tweet forms a stack, a context for each subsequent reply?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;what comes out at the end is pure singularity?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/12/chatgpt-like-twitter-platform.html&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; chatgpt and it says no, it would not be a singularity because &quot;ChatGPT-like models are limited to generating responses based on their training data and do not possess true consciousness or self-awareness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

As an implementer, you have to watch out if you support features that are only in Mastodon and not based on ActivityPub. Which suggests that as the bigco's start implementing AP support, they're all going to face a conundrum. If we want users to think what we're doing is anything more than symbolic, we're going to have to use the Mastodon API and not ActivityPub, because no one else is doing it in AP, therefore there's nothing to interop with or test against. It's hard to promote a feature when you've never been able to test it. The whole thing is pretty shaky. And most people aren't aware of the subtleties. Time to get out a bucket of popcorn and stay on the sidelines until some of this becomes real.</description>

			<description>Earlier today I used Google to try to find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few years ago. I am the author. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;. Well a bunch of people copied my file and posted it on their sites, with their template and their ads (I don't have ads), and for whatever reason Google ranks their docs higher. Mine isn't even on the first page. So tell me, how is that Google isn't implementing a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack? Why aren't they taking the heat for delivering incorrect results?</description>
