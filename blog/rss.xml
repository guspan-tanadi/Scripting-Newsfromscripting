			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; works in a place where people must wear a mask, so she gives out a lot of masks every day. She's going to make custom masks that have a message. That's the first part of this story. Second part, we both started a campaign called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt;, where we promote stories and ideas that save people's lives in this age where lives have all of a sudden become cheap, something our government is promoting (the cheapness, not the saving). So Jen has designed a mask that has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt; message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;#blacklivesmatter&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?</description>

			<description>Yesterday, I was at a store, did my shopping, but when I took the mask off in the car one of the straps broke. I went back to the store and asked if they had an extra. They gave me one, with a smile. No reason that mask shouldn't have had a message on it.</description>

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1280388653433356290&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that showed what the author thought was a cool feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1280388653433356290/photo/1&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript. Labels are 1/2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto&quot;&gt;goto&lt;/a&gt; statements, which we know are &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; to readability and maintainability. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure when I try to grok someone's code that uses this feature, it'll be hard to figure out how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been developing software for a long time. The functionality for users is always at the top of my mind. Getting software rock solid and ideally not requiring any maintenence, that's what I'm aiming for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; thinking about how I can use some new cool feature in the language. I want my code to be as boring and predictable as possible. To look exactly like what it does. Sometimes I get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm using software that I wrote 30 years ago right now, as I write this. That's pretty good for standing the test of time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm thinking the right thing to do for JavaScript is to define a profile, a subset of the language, which if you stick to it, will enhance maintainability and readability, and therefore is more likely to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example, right now I can think of three syntaxes for defining a function. The profile would allow one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function hello () {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;const hello = function () {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;const hello = () =&gt; {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see all example code stick to the profile. Of course once there was one such profile, there would be N. But at least simplifying the language would be up for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would I call my profile? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimplejavascript.com/&quot;&gt;Really Simple JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You might think, of course it is, this is the US, but a lot of the people who are taught that history are not descended primarily from Europeans. So it isn't their history.</description>

			<description>Last night on MSNBC they just now started talking about how Puerto Rico was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine&quot;&gt;canary in the coalmine&lt;/a&gt;. That should have been topic #1 as it was happening. Moderator, ask your pundit, geez if he'll leave Puerto Rico to die, do you think he'll care whether we live or die? And then wonder what if we get hit by a calamity that isn't local, that affects the whole world. Why do they leave the tough questions on the table until it's too late. The point of the canary is to pay attention when the canary dies. When you're about to die, it's too late. It's so repetitious, they say the same things over and over, for weeks and months. Yet all the important questions, the obvious ones, go unasked.</description>

			<description>Every so often you see an article that says men are responsible for all the problems of the world. I don't comment on them very often, I've learned that's a good way to get the online equivalent of a kick in the balls. People can believe what they want, but every man had a mother, I'm fond of saying, and if men are fucked up as a gender, well you made us the way we are, ladies, so there's that. And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/07/republicans-women-senators-348435&quot;&gt;there's this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Apparently not. So we are stuck in this mode until when? Could a vaccine work if there's no possible herd immunity? Anyway, this is like one of those classic fables or myths about the people who were so divided, so hated each other, that they couldn't get together to fight a disease that they can't overcome until they can work together. It's like that famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf&quot;&gt;O Henry story&lt;/a&gt;, which I won't spoil in case you haven't read it.</description>

			<description>I've been thinking of getting a new Twitter account. I'm pretty sure the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I've had since 2006 has a flag on it that says &quot;Don't suggest it.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/16/ifAnyoneFromTwitterIsListening&quot;&gt;Explained here&lt;/a&gt;. I think this stems back to the controversy about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22suggested+users+list%22+twitter&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Suggested Users List&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually did phase it out. And something was done to my account. My follower count, at one time one of the top ten accounts on Twitter, hasn't grown in many years. So maybe it's time to start over, and see if I can have more followers without whatever was done. Anyway, some of the names I've considered are taken: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boomer&quot;&gt;boomer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elgrande&quot;&gt;elgrande&lt;/a&gt; (a few friends call me that), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uncledavey&quot;&gt;uncledavey&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite titles), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scripting&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scriptingnews&quot;&gt;scriptingnews&lt;/a&gt; (not sure what this account is), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savemylife&quot;&gt;savemylife&lt;/a&gt;. Or I could use one of the many names I already have. Then there's the question of how to transition?

			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a195806&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I figured out that the not-pleasant burnt smell in the air came from fireworks. That was incorrect. A neighbor is having work done on trees. I live in a forest, where trees are a big deal. They're always falling over, and then you need to cut them up and haul the wood away or chop it into firewood. When you cut trees with a chain saw the wood burns, and it doesn't stop burning when the cutting is done. And that adds a stink to the air, like a fire that was put out with water. That's what I was smelling. I know this because I had some trees cut last year, and the stinky smell stuck around for a week. It's the sad smell of a dying creature. On the other hand, when you wake up on a summer morning with dew on everything, and a nice warm feel to the air, with a bit of residual chill, the forest smells like life.

			<source:outline text="A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a195806&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I figured out that the not-pleasant burnt smell in the air came from fireworks. That was incorrect. A neighbor is having work done on trees. I live in a forest, where trees are a big deal. They're always falling over, and then you need to cut them up and haul the wood away or chop it into firewood. When you cut trees with a chain saw the wood burns, and it doesn't stop burning when the cutting is done. And that adds a stink to the air, like a fire that was put out with water. That's what I was smelling. I know this because I had some trees cut last year, and the stinky smell stuck around for a week. It's the sad smell of a dying creature. On the other hand, when you wake up on a summer morning with dew on everything, and a nice warm feel to the air, with a bit of residual chill, the forest smells like life. It's a wonderful smell." created="Sun, 05 Jul 2020 13:29:46 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/08/theTruthCanBeAdjusted.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/05.html#a132946"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1279426550748737536&quot;&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; on his love for America. I totally concur. The US welcomed my family in the 1940s. My parents were children, their parents were running for their lives. All of our love of country is being tested, but as it is, it is revealed. It takes on new meaning. We'll come back from this. There are a lot of reasons for the trouble we're in, some habitual, some technical. I've heard Americans say they wish they had left when they could, but there's a reason we didn't leave. This is our country. We can't abandon it in its time of need. We're the ones who stayed. We will make it work.</description>

			<description>I've been smelling burned ash everywhere, esp at night. Everywhere I go. I'm thinking this must be a symptom of the virus, so I'm afraid to ask if anyone else smells it. Then on my bike ride I saw a bunch of spent fireworks on the road. Yeah that's the smell. July 4. That should be over soon enough.</description>

			<description>Why more white people understand &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt; now. We're realizing that &lt;i&gt;our lives&lt;/i&gt; don't matter, and now all of a sudden Black Lives Matter makes a different kind of sense. It's a bit too subtle for some people. But the virus and our society's response to it is making the lights come on, gradually at first, eventually for everyone.</description>

			<description>Another peeve. I was watching a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle&quot;&gt;Dave Chappelle&lt;/a&gt; show on Netflix. He is really funny. Great comic. But he uses the N-word a lot. And get this -- he uses it to talk about white people. Like this: You my &amp;lt;N-word&gt;. I've been told, not by Chappelle, that it's a term of endearment. To me, that's ridiculous -- it's a threat. Because if I use that term of endearment, a 10-ton weight comes down on my head. I don't like it. We're also told this is a word African-Americans use among themselves, and we wouldn't understand what it means. But many of the people in Chappelle's audience are white. We're his N-words. I'm watching it, and reminded every time I hear the world, and he says it a lot, that this is something I'm not allowed to like. The more I listen to him use the N-word, my inner voice, constantly yapping about nothing, repeats what he says, and I'm concerned that will eventually come out of my mouth, without thought because that actually happens in real life. It's a painful word, not just for African-Americans. I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb&quot;&gt;Jelani Cobb&lt;/a&gt; write &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jelani9/status/1278607474921267200&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; the other day about the possible capitalization of the word &lt;i&gt;black&lt;/i&gt; when used to talk about people of African descent. &quot;Does anyone feel strongly about upper-casing the B in black? Iâ€™m generally opposed to this because it turns race, a nonexistent category, into a proper noun.&quot; Maybe we should use words everyone can say, and try to stick to words that have meaning, and preferrably &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; obvious meaning, so we all can understand wtf you're talking about. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>It isn't a contest</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in sixth grade there was a school-wide spelling bee. I had finished in the top group in my class, so I got to go to the bee for the whole grade. By luck I went first and only got 5 of 10 right. People actually laughed. I went out to the yard to play and wait. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One by one the others came out and each had lower scores than me. In the end I had the highest score of all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story for countries who pity the US. This isn't over yet. And it's bad luck to declare victory before it's over. And this isn't really a contest. We like to say we're all in it together, and you know what, we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A language worth learning</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is a lovely language once youâ€™ve spent a few years getting comfortable with its quirks. Not what Iâ€™d recommend as a starter language. Yet it is the language most people choose to learn as their first language. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the qualities I look for in the ideal starter language.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One way to do things not 20.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Boring, so the newbie can focus on their own app, not the language weirdnesses.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Frozen. They should be able to run their student projects 40 years from now. Not a place where language designers try out new ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No callbacks, synchronization handled in runtime.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Algol-like, so you can get support form millions of experienced developers.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;May think of more qualifications later...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/dontCryForMeArgentina.m4a&quot;&gt;A 25-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt; I did this morning. It was mostly about what's in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/02/134749.html?title=onGaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; post below. Expanded, and starting with an observation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html&quot;&gt;Ken Smith&lt;/a&gt;, English prof at Indiana University, that students deserve to be shown how to use &lt;i&gt;the power tools of our culture.&lt;/i&gt; Teachers should say that to them, out loud. I tried saying it loud and felt the power. Led to a story or two. The title of this podcast is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD_1Z8iUDho&quot;&gt;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. Wish I had thought to play that song during the podcast. Next time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Really interesting discussion going on globally on what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/873172499/the-debate-over-objectivity-in-journalism&quot;&gt;objectivity&lt;/a&gt; means in journalism, esp in re &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt;. I spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;many podcasts&lt;/a&gt; with Jay Rosen talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere&quot;&gt;his idea&lt;/a&gt; of the mythical &lt;i&gt;View from Nowhere.&lt;/i&gt; You must disclose who you are, and disclaim that your writing comes from who you are. This came up in another discussion yesterday about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt;.  &quot;A [person] has integrity if he or she is what he or she appears to be. That's why integrity commands us to disclose conflicts, so that what we say, and who we appear to be, are in sync. Change the appearance if necessary.&quot; It's material if the editors of a publication are predominantly of one race. Until this year, however, as far as I know, the subject had never been raised. Times are changing.</description>

			<description>Reporters can't get it through their heads that someone might want to write publicly to help steer the conversation, not for self-aggrandizement. I know what that's like, I've been a columnist at a big pub. I've had the name of a big university on my business card. This is different. I want to see us survive the virus. I want to survive it myself. Otherwise I don't have any great personal aspirations. I think I can help. That's it. I don't honestly see how, in this moment of crisis in the US, anyone could be worried about getting ahead. Our concern has to be for keeping our system going. It's falling apart, right now, before our eyes. Any idea should be considered, no matter where it comes from. But the gates are really high right now. The keepers are struggling to hold on, and that's exactly what's wrong with discourse.</description>
