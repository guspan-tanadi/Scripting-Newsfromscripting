			<description>They're &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mollyhensleyclancy/georgia-school-reopening-photo-paulding-county&quot;&gt;pouring gasoline&lt;/a&gt; on the raging virus fire in Georgia. They don't get something simple. The virus is everywhere. You may think for some reason it isn't in that empty school building, but as soon as you fill it with people, it's there. It's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange&quot;&gt;NYSE&lt;/a&gt; of virus transmission. It's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport&quot;&gt;Atlanta airport&lt;/a&gt; of virus transmission. The kids and adults are walking into the fire, doused in gasoline. What do they &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; will happen?</description>

			<description>I think I've finally run out of things to do with the new BingeWorthy. I have a lot of writing and communicating, but programming? Other than moving the prototype to a real server, not much.</description>

			<title>Money for news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1291061013228421120&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday, one more time practically begging news orgs to support what I call an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/12/1004.html&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/23/115824.html?title=anEzpassForNews&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;. Not much response, but a handful of people did give the usual response, the one The Atlantic and other pubs want to hear -- that they bought a subscription to show support for journalism. I don't think this helps journalism, it just gives them false hope that there is a future for viewing journalism as a cause rather than as a product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If journalism is to thrive, the paywalls have to go away. It's the wrong user experience. It forces a question at a time when it's virtually impossible that the user is going to buy your pitch. Much better to get the money incrementally, then when someone is spending too much per month, upsell them a subscription as a way of saving money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The TV world is about to discover this. All of a sudden there are a dozen different Netflix-alikes. There isn't room for that many, yet more are coming. They're going to have to find a way of doing an EZ-Pass.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to repeat all I've written here before. It's really very simple. If I use a freeway here in the eastern US, I don't have to stop to pay a toll. I just drive through what used to be a toll plaza, and an electronic device reads the chip behind my rear-view mirror, and deducts the money from my account, which it replenishes from credit card as-needed. Not that there was ever a whole lot of pain associated with this, but it's nice that the transaction is smoother now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;News needs that much more than freeways do. The world has changed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;it isn't the 80s&lt;/a&gt;, the last time it made sense to buy news via subscription, and even then you could buy a single issue without entering into a long-term relationship with the pub. It's all been unbundled, and like it or not news orgs are competing on a somewhat level playing field. The Atlantic is doing well, I observed, at making me want to read their articles. But not enough to get me to subscribe. As I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a134117&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; before, I don't even like subscribing to the pubs I subscribe to now, and I consider them essential, but I consider the deal they offer a ripoff, that some of that money should go to almost-equally deserving pubs. The Atlantic is good enough to serve as an example for why the paywall doesn't work for readers. And they were visionary enough and entrepreneurial enough to join up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. So in some part they buy into the paywall-less version of news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>More about opening schools</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;They aren't correctly analyzing the opening school situation on CNN. A couple of points.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We understand very little about the virus. Can't be sure it doesn't affect young kids. It might just manifest itself in different not obvious ways, and it might not manifest immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Opening schools is like opening a gas station in the middle of a wild fire. Adding more virus-infected people, regardless of their age, in an out of control virus fire is  as stupid as it gets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to think in terms of the big picture and not just short-term, and with humility. The president is an idiot, but that doesn't mean we have to be too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mussolini vs a second chance for America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn&quot;&gt;Jim Clyburn&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bbc-newshour&quot;&gt;BBC Newshour&lt;/a&gt; on WNYC this morning. He correctly said we're desperately trying to get rid of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/02/clyburn-trump-mussolini-390500&quot;&gt;Mussolini&lt;/a&gt; right now. That really is the only thing. Anything that takes us off the path to getting rid of Trump decreases the odds that it'll happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need the biggest landslide win this time. It needs to include every possible voter of either party. A black man decided that. And he was &lt;i&gt;right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You always have to think about what you're trying to accomplish in the big picture before going into the weeds. Do I really care, right now, whether X is the VP choice. Not if you want to live in a relatively free America, one that responds to the challenges we face, instead of trying to paper them over with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/full-axios-hbo-interview-donald-trump-cd5a67e1-6ba1-46c8-bb3d-8717ab9f3cc5.html&quot;&gt;lies and bluster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini&quot;&gt;Mussolini&lt;/a&gt; or a second chance for America. That's what's on the ballot in November. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Clubhouse first impressions</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joinclubhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; is a new social &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/&quot;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; that seems to be gaining traction. I just got an invite a couple of days ago from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hardaway&quot;&gt;Francine Hardaway&lt;/a&gt;. I had been aware of it before, but wasn't very interested, but I should have been.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are just some first-day newbie impressions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm @davew on Clubhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First, what it is.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's audio only. No text, no images, no video.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are users. You can follow them, they can follow you. As far as I can tell it's very close to Twitter's model.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Any user can start a room. Other people can join the room. There's a stage. At least one person is on stage, the person who started the room by default is that person. Other people can be added by the founder, by dragging their icon onto the stage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People on stage can speak without permission. People in the audience can raise their hand, and must be granted permission to speak. I imagine that if someone becomes abusive, or veers off-topic, they can be silenced by the moderator.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When you're a newbie you have a special icon so people can see that you're new. It's a little emoji party hat. I've been told people are nice to newbies, that's part of the developing culture.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The rooms have a &lt;i&gt;Leave Quietly&lt;/i&gt; button at the bottom. I like that. It suggests you don't have to give a big speech before you leave. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it's good at.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It may evolve into a celebrity performance platform as Instagram has.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a kind of podcast. I like it. I hope they support open feed formats, but I suspect this is a silo, not a publishing platform. Something to beware of. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was also bummed to realize I couldn't incorporate this into my apps. Again, VC-backed means this probably won't change. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I tuned into a chat about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cancel+culture&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;cancel culture&lt;/a&gt; at first. Does it exist or doesn't it. Heh. As a meta-thing, it clearly does exist. You're talking about it right now. I didn't say this of course, though I was tempted to. I was pretty sure if I did I would get grief. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I saw a comment by longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gartenberg&quot;&gt;Michael Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt;. He has a good speaking voice. I love radio btw. It's my second favorite medium. I wanted to chime in, to expand on what he said, but I also saw he wasn't the founder of the channel, so I opted not to. He was talking about how these platforms might involve if rich individuals started them as pet projects. Thinking of Benioff and Time, or Omidyar and the Intercept, Bezos and the Washington Post. Also the cautionary tale of Thiel and Gawker. He basically bought Gawker with a lawsuit, then destroyed it. I wanted to add it could be even worse, there are a fair number of super-rich individuals who could buy Twitter. Its stock is cheap. How that would rock our world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had a one-to-one chat with Gartenberg, and it quickly started to feel private, even though it was public. It was liking riding in a chair lift with a friend while skiing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I could see it being used for running commentary on a sports event. Hosting a roundtable discussion about a popular TV show, as they do on Salon and Slate. Anywhere a podcast might include more than one person. Election returns on November 3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also why not use it in place of Zoom. I don't need to see your face while you talk. :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Haddish&quot;&gt;Tiffany Haddish&lt;/a&gt; is already there. I followed her. There's a schedule of upcoming events. Think of it as a radio station or a venue like an arena or stadium. I'm sure that's what their business plan calls for. And also probably proprietary rights for all of it, i.e. no competition allowed unless you have good lawyers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Back in the 90s my friend Sylvia had a series of Cybersalons, open discussions for random Silicon Valley people. It was funny how every discussion very quickly became How Do Artists Get Paid? It was the only issue that ever got discussed. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;, a few years later, the question was How Do Bloggers Make Money? I'm guessing something similar will happen here. But what will the subject be. It'll have something to do with people getting paid, probably. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thread&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1291038682103926784&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where you can correct any mistakes I've made, or important insights you'd like to share. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screen shots&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Event calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A room I can join.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inside a big room.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I watched an NBA &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble&quot;&gt;bubble&lt;/a&gt; game this evening between the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trailblazers. I didn't realize how much I missed live sports. It's good but I think they should get rid of the fake things.  I’d like to hear what the sport is like with just the player sounds, no simulated fans.  The screens with fans supposedly reacting to the play is pointless. I remember that high school and college basketball had charm, because the fans weren't so much a part of the action. Please put the player names on their uniforms. And.. When Melo scores the announcer has to say  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo+Annnnnnnnthony&quot;&gt;Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo Annnnnnnnthony&lt;/a&gt;. Please. Also Melo must wear a white headband. How else can I find him on the court?</description>

And it's amazing how much the 2020 pandemic is a replay. The president at the time, Woodrow Wilson, did nothing about the outbreak. Cities were on their own. People said Oh it's just the flu. Then they got it and died.</description>

			<description>The founders obsessed on things the president could not do, but they didn't consider what we must &lt;i&gt;require&lt;/i&gt; the president to do. He must defend the country against attacks. Trump is exploiting that loophole. Not defending the country against the virus. It's running wild. And without help from scientists the people don't understand it. If it were a fire burning in their neighborhood everyone would understand that it must be put out. No time to waste. But people can't feel that. Evolution didn't teach us to fear a virus at a primal level. So here we are. We have these great communication tools. What's next?</description>

			<description>I like the way they talk about Trump on CNN. Everything he says is a lie and that's what they say. I think they should only run pictures of him that look &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/04/trumpVomiting.png&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/discorporate&quot;&gt;discorporate&lt;/a&gt; heads of Trump looking foolish and/or nauseated.</description>

			<description>John Naughton wrote a thought-provoking piece yesterday in his Memex 1.1 newsletter entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/sunday-2-august-2020&quot;&gt;Nostalgia isn't what it used to be&lt;/a&gt;. (Note to the Substack devs, there should be permalinks on sub-sections of the web versions of newsletters, so I can point directly to the bit I'm talking about. Might as well put them in the email versions too.) Naughton says there was a point in human evolution when we decided we were above nature, and that's when things started to go wrong. It's why we think we can return to some kind of normal once the pandemic is over. But every time we try, we hit a wall resulting in more suffering and death. I've observed something similar. Our troubles with the environment started some time in the last 100 years when, through technology, we were able to make our presence felt on the ecosystem to the point where human activity could melt the polar icecaps. So in a destructive sense, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; above nature, but it's not a good survival strategy. In fact, we live infinitesmally short lifespans on an insignificant speck of dust in space, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html#3&quot;&gt;delusions&lt;/a&gt; of grandeur, when the best we can achieve, which is pretty good, is friendship, love and to a small extent, self-awareness. We're going to get smart now, and learn to be the humble &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt; that we are. Or we're going to cease to exist. In other words, it's time for the human race to grow up.</description>

			<description>BTW, a note to Google's search engine. Sometimes I put phrases into my writing that I know don't exist anywhere else on the web, so I can search for them, and enjoy the feeling of being a validated innovator. Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/02.html#a160614&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; a fictional name, &quot;Hello HooHaw.&quot; When I searched for it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/03/pickyGoogle.png&quot;&gt;Google said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;It looks like there aren't any great matches for your search.&quot; What!?? The hell you say. There's a &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt; match, way more than great. Everyone's a critic. BTW, now there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Hello+HooHaw%22&quot;&gt;two instances&lt;/a&gt; of the phrase on the web. I wonder if Google will still complain.</description>

			<description>Ken Smith has been indulging me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/ki&quot;&gt;commenting&lt;/a&gt; on stuff, blog-style, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, even though LO2 is not (at this time) a proper blogging tool. Yesterday he commented on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/01.html#a143905&quot;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; for archiving content on Scripting News. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/02/kenSmithPost.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of Ken's post. I don't yet have a proper way to point to it. I know a lot about this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/10/futuresafeArchives.html&quot;&gt;Future-safe archives&lt;/a&gt;. An organization has to have a strong &lt;i&gt;and lasting&lt;/i&gt; commitment to creating a record, because there are so many ways to lose it. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;backup to GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is actually an offline archive. In case GitHub survives and the web does not. I try to keep the URLs working on scripting.com, if not other domains I've created. My focus is on scripting.com. Even so, I've broken a fair number of links over the years. a big source was in the switch to S3. A very rational thing to do, no regrets, but their server is case-sensitive, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSTAR&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; I had been using previously was not. It's too bad something like that was not mentioned in the founding documents of the web. I try to fix broken links when I find them. But keeping even one site unbroken is an impossible job. You do the best you can.</description>

			<description>I watched a little CNN yesterday. Starting to prefer it to MSNBC, esp Wolf Blitzer. But they say platitudes that are wrong. Example: &quot;There’s no-one-size-fits-all approach to the virus.&quot; Sounds nice but the opposite is true. The only way out is if we all do the same at the same time until,the infection dies. First thing CNN should do is review their dogma, offline, and get it right. And then publish the results.</description>

And then publish the results." created="Sun, 02 Aug 2020 15:24:52 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/02.html#a152452"/>

			<description>Forcing schools to open in the midst of an uncontrolled pandemic is genocide. The virus is still growing. You have to think bigger picture. &lt;i&gt;Opening schools is like pouring gasoline on a fire, when we want to be dousing it.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>I also listened to a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/fight-over-cop-misconduct-records-continues&quot;&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt; this morning. They said something that really irked me: The police is the only public institution that isn't properly overseen (I'm paraphrasing). But journalism is even less overseen. I think the op-ed page in the major papers should be run by non-journalists and should be all about the failings of journalism. They say it so many times in so many ways. Democracy dies in darkness. Journalism has always been dark. Never examined. Considered to be above reproach by mortals. And that's garbage. It's just resulted in an arrogance that's had enormous consequences.</description>

What may happen is they will try to open the schools in a few of the Republican states, and close them within a few days as the rate of infection goes even higher. Cause and effect. You do something stupid and a week later the infections go up, two weeks later the hospitalizations go up and two weeks after that, the death rate goes up.&quot; It goes on from there.</description>

			<description>Every neighborhood has the crazy family. On our street the crazy family were the HooHaws (made up name). The mother of the family was the Big Crazy, her name was Hello (again, made up name). One day a few years ago I arrived to visit my mom, and she was in the street talking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/search?q=%22Hello+HooHaw%22&quot;&gt;Hello HooHaw&lt;/a&gt;, and it hit me, hard. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; were the crazy family. In case the parallel isn't clear, the US is about as crazy as it gets on Planet Earth. But we were raised to believe it's the rest of the world that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/6967/why-off-his-rocker&quot;&gt;off its rocker&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>How bizarre that in 2020 the president is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/bytedance-microsoft-acquisition-trump-sign-off-f994322d-9bb9-40d5-bc66-c78ee3dcbd2a.html&quot;&gt;brokering&lt;/a&gt; a deal for Microsoft to buy TikTok? So many questions. What's his cut. Did Microsoft agree to limit criticism of Trump on the new TikTok. How does the US government control it vs China. How bizarre that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall&quot;&gt;Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt; appears to be going up in the US? Will loyalty to Trump be part of the terms of service for a US-owned TikTok? I can't imagine China would object.</description>

			<description>Here's an idea. To qualify for president you have to pass a basic test in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utm.edu/departments/math/courses/M210Fall18.pdf&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;. It's not enough to pass a test for dementia. Also, you can't pay someone else to take the test for you.</description>

			<description>Every month I archive the OPML source for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2020/07.opml&quot;&gt;previous month&lt;/a&gt;, including all the metadata, to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;public GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see how the data flows. There are lots of conventions in the form of attributes on OPML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;outline&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements. This is the data that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt; uses to render &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;the HTML&lt;/a&gt; you see on the web. At some point when the dust clears from my other projects, I'll hook up &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; outlines to Old School in some fashion. They're already pretty close, kind of the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Golden+Gate+Bridge/@37.8199328,-122.6183308,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808586deffffffc3:0xcded139783705509!8m2!3d37.8199286!4d-122.4782551&quot;&gt;San Francisco and Marin County&lt;/a&gt; were almost connected before a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge&quot;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; was added.</description>
