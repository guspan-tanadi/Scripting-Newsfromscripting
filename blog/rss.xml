Raining all the time. The rivers and ponds are full. So what comes next? Well if it stops raining, summer, which is usually the best time of year here, and pretty much anywhere. It's why I live here. But this summer. Well the only thing that could be worse imho is if we had this much precipitation in winter. Well, I know that isn't actually true. The heat wave in the west sounds pretty awful. Oh we really did it, the planet is on its way to being uninhabitable by humans? Whee here we go. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I'm more driven to write. Iâ€™m a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;natural born blogger&lt;/a&gt; or NBB. We write because thatâ€™s what we do. The first impulse is to write. First thing I want to do when I sit down to work is write and when Iâ€™m thinking about more things to do, Iâ€™m usually writing about it.</description>

They have an architecture for more instances, but now that we've gotten a look at what federation is like in practice with Mastodon and ActivityPub, I don't look forward to the same idea around Bluesky. Which is where the bind is, because that means that Bluesky, like Twitter and Facebook, would have to take on moderation and will get a lot of grief if they don't do it to people's liking. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3k2jrmmygel2w&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I don't think they or anyone else can afford to stand against abuse on the web, it's diseconomic. People don't pay for the service, and there's an infinite supply of abuse. You know how when they add a new lane to a freeway thinking it'll ease traffic but doesn't? imho it's the same kind of thing. I do think there's hope for small social nets with dozens or maybe hundreds of users, and let Facebook have the monster social nets, they more or less have found a way to make moderation pay. I've written about this idea a lot, filed under the phrase &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=fractional+horsepower+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;</description>

It was fairly painless, but it did break some pages. If you have an &lt;i&gt;img&lt;/i&gt; element in the HTML or use the &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; attribute in OPML, and the url of the image is on HTTP, the browser will refuse to load it, and at least on Chrome it'll look like it's still loading for a long time, possibly forever. For most of these, I'll never get around to fixing them, it just is what it is. So HTTPS despite the hype, no matter whether you convert or not, still breaks the web, and Google must know all about this and doesn't care. If a platform vendor really cared about the web as a platform, they'd look at the risk in reading an img over http and say wtf, let it go. They're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt;, they have you by the balls, you know it and they know it.</description>

			<description>This bit of arcania has also crept into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. As you may know &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is now on HTTPS, it has to be because it's managing identity for itself, and if a feed item has an image only accessible over HTTP, the browser won't load it. I guess all feed readers have this problem, and I guess images from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; have always been broken? But this isn't how I remember it. Hmmm. Maybe they're doing something special, like accessing the image through a proxy running outside of Chrome's control. Haha if so &lt;i&gt;holy shit.&lt;/i&gt; Either it's a security problem or it isn't. I really don't think images need to be protected, but what do I know. In any case, from this point on, my images will be HTTPS too.</description>

			<title>Twitter approaches textcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Someday tweets will allow you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/07/15/chatgpt.html&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; web page on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You will be able to give a tweet a title.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can already style text bold or italic. They kind of snuck that in there quietly? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see them support Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can edit your tweets for up to an hour. That's pretty good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is basically checking off the boxes on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if their competitors are noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also a nice RSS feed coming out of Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let me enclose an MP3 for a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>New FeedLand feature</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you're viewing a feed list, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, when a feed updates, instead of inserting it at the top and forcing everything down, it displays a button. Click the button to see the new stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/13/viewUpdatedFeedsButtonScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;View updated feeds button.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We already had a similar feature on timeline pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wish we had a group of tech industry veterans who could explain how to interpret moves like the ones the company that used to be known as Facebook is making wrt &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're running a standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.c2.com/?EmbraceAndExtend&quot;&gt;Embrace and Extend&lt;/a&gt; strategy of a giant company entering a market that's &quot;dominated&quot; by a small competitor that's hoping for the best. I put &lt;i&gt;dominated&lt;/i&gt; in quotes because it's obvious that the market defined by the startup is going to be huge. But it's better if the new area is dominated by a mega corp, that is for the established billionaires. For the rest of us, it sucks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It all depends on what users do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly with podcasting, we were able to confuse the bigco's enough for long enough that the users learned they were entitled to choice and they suspected any effort to lock them in. That, and some grace from Steve Jobs to not try to dominate podcasting when Apple had the chance to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not able this time to get the message out. I'm here, I am typing into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, but not enough people are hearing it. Don't believe Facebook has good intentions. If they did, they would hook the main Facebook product up to the open web, not the new one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time from some other names of the open web generation to step up and help. Facebook is going to run over the nascent federated social web the same way &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; ran over &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. That cost us a decade or more of open growth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we can put a roadblock in Facebook's way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aaai.org/working-together-on-our-future-with-ai/&quot;&gt;founders of AI&lt;/a&gt; spoke up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well the founders of the open web could have a word too.

			<description>Facebook hasn't done anything to support the open web. All they've done is put it in a press release and post an email to a mail list.

			<description>I was just filling out a form that asked for my social media addresses and noticed how I don't remember how to specify the addresses for Bluesky, Mastodon and LinkedIn. I had no trouble with Twitter and Threads, though I have a lot of trouble remembering the name of Threads. I think Bluesky is headed in the right direction, by letting people specify a domain name. A service that made this a bit easier for non-technical users could help here.</description>

The idea of social networks being conversational hasn't been true for a long time.

Congrats to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; for coining a term that has so much lasting value. Everything turns to shit. Everything is enshitified. Is it time yet to &lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt;shitify everything? Back in the day at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; we used to say &quot;We make shitty software, with bugs.&quot; It was true, and of course so does everyone else. We also said we will strive to make it less shitty. We didn't put that on t-shirts, but some grouches tagged the Wikipedia page for our products with that caveat. Warning Winer makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+shitty+software&quot;&gt;shitty software&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Twitter is so fucked. Every time I visit Twitter it's the same messages at the top of my timeline, from July 5. Is this how Twitter ends? Locked on July 5, 2023 forever. It was a good day but it wasn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; good.</description>

			<description>I'm going through my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper&quot;&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt; phase. Again. When I was a teen I loved the band. I always felt kind of ashamed of it. I used to go to their concerts to see what he'd do this time. I must have seen him guillotined a dozen times. He knew what fascinated teenage boys. Anyway the song rolling around in my head today is the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbS2Zrcl6g&quot;&gt;Dead Babies&lt;/a&gt;. It's a really awful song, I guess that's why I like it so much. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Posts without titles in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; now does a better job with posts without titles.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a screen shot of two posts in a timeline, neither of which have titles, followed by one that does have a title, so you can see the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/11/postsWithoutTItlesCollapsed.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Two posts without titles. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new thing is the bold text at the beginning of each untitled post, so you can more easily see the structure as you scroll through it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another new feature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's also a max height to a post but if you click on the body it expands to reveal the full text. Click again and it goes back to compact size. It took a bunch of iteration to get to this, it's better than what Facebook and Twitter do, where you have to carefully position the mouse to see the rest, and after expanding, the place where you have to clock to collapse it moves. In this scheme, stay right where you are and click again to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/11/twoPostsWithoutTitles.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;First post has been expanded, second not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Anyway, it's remarkable how much better the server is doing, so I did the same for the server running my newest apps, with the same result. I now monitor the CPU and disk usage graphs for both servers, and figured out that the servers were running out of memory and thrashing by swapping stuff to and from disk. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/10/performanceGraphs.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;see it&lt;/a&gt; in the 14-day graphs. The things that look like spikes are actually minutes worth of flatlining where basically nothing is coming in or out until the situation resolves. Now apparently that never comes close to happening.</description>

			<description>I live in the mountains west of the Hudson River, where we're getting hammered with rain this summer. We needed it, we were in a drought. I have a feeling that's over now. This last storm seems have been the tipping point for the ability of the mountains to absorb the water, now there's huge runoff, the creeks are full, there are roads that will wash out if there's much more rain. It's very easy to get depressed in this weather, but writing about it helps.</description>

			<description>I'll believe that Facebook's new social network is growing when I get the feeling &quot;it's happening over there.&quot; So far that hasn't happened once. To think that's it's somehow dominant is ludicrous. As a developer, I want a platform that has curious creative people ready to try out new ideas. That's a niche Twitter has now given up, probably forever, and I doubt if Facebook wants developers for Threads.</description>

			<title>It's all about app ecosystems</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://avc.com/2023/07/threads/&quot;&gt;Fred Wilson is excited&lt;/a&gt; about Threads, for the right reason, but I don't think it's going to play out the way he thinks. I replied &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/t/Cub6HNMu66A/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&quot;&gt;on Threads&lt;/a&gt;, hunting and pecking on my tiny iPhone keyboard (I have huge hands btw). I'll expand on it here... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He repeats the folklore that Twitter &quot;killed off&quot; its app ecosystem in 2010. Certainly not at a technical level, the problem with Twitter's developer situation was that they didn't do anything to help products get the attention of users, esp important when we were filling gaps in the user experience that users desperately wanted filled. If a corporate platform wants developers they have to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even open source platforms need &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; to spread the news of reliable and useful additions to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Users aren't on their own that adventurous. They like to use what everyone else is using, which makes the bootstrap hard. But the platform vendor can provide the magic that gets it going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, like Fred, I am excited. Because somewhere in this chaos (a good thing) there is at least the possibility of a developer ecosystem. That hasn't been true for a long time. I don't think that will happen in ActivityPub, for technical reasons. It needs a small amount of centralization to make the hurdle for developers surmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Twitter isn't going away. What we should hope for is they start adding stuff to Twitter that users really like. And that'll force Facebook to do it too. As a result technology moves forward. One-party systems stagnate as we've seen.</description>

			<description>Actually you can embed posts in HTML pages (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fruitsalad.lucky.wtf/embedfrombluesky.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), but that's about it. &lt;s&gt;You can't even link to individual posts or threads.

			<title>Must have browser interface</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Chip Bayers, my editor in the good old days at Wired, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chipbayers/status/1676794017244143617&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they shipped too soon. I've said the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing they reallllly need is a browser interface, so it can exist on the same plane as the other social nets. I can't paste links back and forth between their network and others. even at that primitive level of interop, it doesn't exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Twitter I'm able to write fluidly esp now that the character limit is just a speed bump. I've never felt in any way like writing on a phone was writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big picture is no one gets that these tools are writing environments. so they design them to have features writers can use.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Facebook is not attractive</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I started to write about how boring, sad, depressing and unnecessary Threads is. How pathetic Zuck is. How I visualize the process that led to this product as being a combination of the TV series Succession and Silicon Valley. Facebook is desperately trying to become anything but Facebook. I like Facebook as a community. I have friends there who I would never talk with if it weren't for Facebook. I hope they keep running it. But I wish the company behind it would stop demanding attention because they are so completely unattractive. And btw, I can't get into writing on an iPhone. I write at a desk, or maybe occasionally a tablet. Everything about this product pushes me away. Maybe that'll change, maybe the people who are trying to get ahead on Threads will think up some new use for social networks that will justify using it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Will Threads prevail? If so, then?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends think that Threads is enough, and once they fill in some missing features it will suck the life out of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They might be right. Hard to argue.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All I want is a playground with an open API and enough creative users to try out new ideas from developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the pace of innovation we had going in the 90s and 00s. The big platforms snuffed all that out, corralled it and kept it in some too-restrictive bounds. Did what BillG failed to, locked us in the trunk and cut off the air supply. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That some of these people were the most fervent advocates for open platforms says that maybe those beliefs ran pretty thin, and the opportunity to cash it out for billions made it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we'll just be hobbyists. I'm okay with that. Or maybe people are will to pay good money to sustain creative development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect that to be possible on Facebook's new network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
