			<description>JavaScript question. Why can't we have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; verb work in browser apps as it does in Node. It would take a URL as a param. It would be so much simpler if I could use exactly the same modules in both places, with no fuss, no new software to install.</description>

It's not just for editors, you can use OPML to pass outlines to apps that render outlines, for example, as a blog (that's Old School). There will be more of those.  BTW, of course the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; is an outline, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/compatibleApps.opml?format=opml&quot;&gt;OPML version&lt;/a&gt; is public, so you should be able to open it in any of the apps on the list.</description>

			<description>Ending Roe v Wade will end the United States. The world is built around reproductive freedom, led by the United States. A country that repeals such a fundamental right no longer is, imho, the United States. Where we go from there I don't know. But if we're going to have a civil war, reproductive freedom would be a good cause.</description>

			<description>Davos is happening now, the first one since Covid started. The message at this year's Davos seems to be &quot;You didn't understand the web and it made mega billions. So here's a new web, called &quot;Web3&quot; -- you don't understand it, of course (frankly neither do we) but this time you must invest so &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; make the billions!&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/19/who-are-davos-man-and-davos-woman.html&quot;&gt;They&lt;/a&gt; will love it.</description>

			<description>BTW, if &quot;Web3&quot; turns out to live up to its name, I will take all this back. I've been wrong before. But so far I've not gotten an idea of how this thing is a new version of the web, and I believe I fully understand what the web is. I'd love to see a one-page description of how you develop apps for this supposed successor to the web.</description>

			<description>I am a JavaScript programmer. I've learned to stack my code via indentation when it could all be done more simply the way you do it in most other languages. It's provable. I can never understand why developers who have worked on the language itself aren't as bothered by this as I am. I realized there might be one difference, something that's been a foundation for all my programming work -- before I was a programmer, I was a math major. In math, you're always looking for broader and simpler statements that you can derive from more narrower and more complicated truths. In a sense that's what math is. So perhaps the language designers of JavaScript didn't study math? This has been a vexing puzzle for me ever since I moved into JavaScript. Not how to simplify JS, that's clear -- rather why don't other people see it, or if they do why don't they fix it?</description>

			<description>&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/21/positioning.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm always telling people who think about products to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)&quot;&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt;. Unless you understand how the human mind works, how can you market something to humans? It's like becoming a driver, you have to learn what all the controls do. And how products fit into people's minds is one of the biggest controls, and you'd be surprised how not-different people's minds are when it comes to positioning. An example. An ad I saw on Facebook recently for &lt;a href=&quot;https://freshcleantees.com/&quot;&gt;T-shirts&lt;/a&gt; of all things. How many brands of T-shirts can you think of? Probably not too many, but you know there are a lot of them. None have any particular meaning. But what about a T-shirt that Looks Good On You? That's a position. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgl-LFrlPw&amp;t=228s&quot;&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; that no one, so far, is positioned on. Maybe the ladder doesn't exist? Positioning has lots of examples of those. But sometimes it does, and it's huge. Think of all the brands that defined new ladders. Like Starbucks. Tesla. Nike. Coca Cola. There was coffee before Starbucks and cars, shoes and cold drinks before these brands carved out new segments of these markets and because they were first in the prospects' minds, they own them, until they throw away their positioning, which many products do, foolishly, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_line_extension&quot;&gt;line extension&lt;/a&gt;. Heinz is a company that does not understand positioning and is as a result destroying their #1 brand. Think about Heinz. What does the name mean to you? Ketchup, right? Then, recently they decided there are lots of &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; ketchups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heinz.com/products/0000000117&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; at all of them! And they named them all Heinz. Oy. I bet when you add the sales of all the different Heinz ketchups, it's less than standard good old Heinz ketchup. Go to the grocery store, look for ketchup and try to find the Heinz ketchup you grew up with. Good luck!  Line extension is a bad idea. If you own the top spot on a ladder, don't do line extension. You'll lose out to someone who specializes in what you used to own. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=positioning&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;So much to say&lt;/a&gt; about this.</description>

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgl-LFrlPw&amp;t=228s&quot;&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; that no one, so far, is positioned on. Maybe the ladder doesn't exist? Positioning has lots of examples of those. But sometimes it does, and it's huge. Think of all the brands that defined new ladders. Like Starbucks. Tesla. Nike. Coca Cola. There was coffee before Starbucks and cars, shoes and cold drinks before these brands carved out new segments of these markets and because they were first in the prospects' minds, they own them, until they throw away their positioning, which many products do, foolishly, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_line_extension&quot;&gt;line extension&lt;/a&gt;. Heinz is a company that does not understand positioning and is as a result destroying their #1 brand. Think about Heinz. What does the name mean to you? Ketchup, right? Then, recently they decided there are lots of &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; ketchups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heinz.com/products/0000000117&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; at all of them! And they named them all Heinz. Oy. I bet when you add the sales of all the different Heinz ketchups, it's less than standard good old Heinz ketchup. Go to the grocery store, look for ketchup and try to find the Heinz ketchup you grew up with. Good luck!  Line extension is a bad idea. If you own the top spot on a ladder, don't do line extension. You'll lose out to someone who specializes in what you used to own. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=positioning&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;So much to say&lt;/a&gt; about this." created="Sat, 21 May 2022 14:47:57 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/21/positioning.png" imageLink="https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/05/21.html#a144757"/>

			<description>One my favorite things to tweet is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1527786609491464192&quot;&gt;there are No Nets fans&lt;/a&gt;, and wait for a Nets fan to show up and flame me. It never happens. I think even the Clippers must have some fans in NYC, or the Expos, but I can honestly say I've never met a Nets fan.</description>

			<description>One of the most important principles in programming is that you want to expose problems in code when you're working on it. The more time between when you did the work and when you find the problem, the more impossible it's going to be to implement a good fix. It's analogous to finding a flaw in the design of something buried under the foundation of a skyscraper, long after the whole building has been constructed.</description>

			<description>I'm seeing this principle today because I'm adapting an app I wrote in 2020 to a new environment. I'm getting to fix problems in this code that would have been very difficult to fix if I weren't doing a complete from-the-ground-up rebuild. And there are no users of this stuff, so no compatibility to preserve. It's one of the reasons that an app doesn't really get done right until you fully implement it for the third or fourth time.</description>

			<title>Is this why Musk got cold feet?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why is Musk trying to pull out of the Twitter deal?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it has much to do with how many bots are using Twitter, or whether Democrats are assholes, or even that Musk did or didn't show his dick to a stewardess. I think what really matters is what's happening to Tesla stock, and with it, Musk's wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Musk sent his acquisition offer to Twitter on &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/2167563/an-annotated-history-of-elon-musk-buying-twitter/&quot;&gt;April 13&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On that day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%24tsla&quot;&gt;Tesla stock&lt;/a&gt; was trading at $1022.37 per share.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Today Tesla is selling for $645. That's about a 37% drop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know for sure, but I'd guess that Musk and his partners are all borrowing to buy Twitter. They certainly don't want to sell stock to raise the money to buy Twitter because that would be a taxable event. And if you take out a loan with your stock as collateral, you don't have to sell the stock, so -- no taxes. It's how rich people buy things. Even not-so-rich people do it. A moderately wealthy person who could afford to pay cash for a house, probably would just take out a loan, to avoid paying taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the huge drop in Tesla stock, and whatever stocks Larry Ellison is borrowing against to raise the money for his part of the deal, means that the bankers who are lending against that stock as collateral will want more stock. No problem you say, they all have lots of stock. But maybe he's already used that stock as collateral on other loans? Who knows how much of a stretch this is for Musk. He might not have enough stock to do the deal now. But he signed the deal, so.. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%24tsla&quot;&gt;$TSLA&lt;/a&gt; before and after April 13.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk and his partners are squeezed in a hard-to-have-foreseen way. The deal has become more expensive and harder to do. And maybe the market &quot;correction&quot; isn't done yet. Maybe Tesla will be worth half what it was, or less?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you want to get an idea of what this is like, season one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)#Season_1_(2018)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; has the young Kendall Roy in a similar bind. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unless the market and $TSLA recover quickly this downturn is hitting Musk a lot harder than it would have if he had not done the Twitter deal. But he did, so he's kind of fucked, or so it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Repubs and world domination</title>

And there have always been people who wanted to be the first. And in no time in human history has it been more possible, and the resulting power been more awesome. And the people who want it, will soon have it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Probably some of them aren't actually trying to dominate the world, some probably just want to kill a lot of people. And that sure is happening. Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's the really scary part. When Hitler tried to achieve world domination in the 1940s, he controlled a very small country, and even though he managed to grow it significantly through war, he never got close to dominating the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think if he had come before FDR, there's a fair chance the US would've sided with Germany, not the allies. Why do I say that? Slavery. It was a very Nazi-like thing we did there. Hitler learned a lot from slavery in the US. America's philosophy with its big ideas was a lie. Our corrections have been big, but short-lived, the post Civil War reconstruction, the New Deal, and the period after WW II when the Repubs foolishly bet too much too early with Goldwater, yielding a huge Democratic majority and a president (Johnson) was knew how to use the power. But it quickly snapped back with Nixon's Silent Majority. And Reagan. And the Bushes. And Trump and who knows what comes next, but it's going in the wrong direction, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;World domination is definitely at stake in the fight between the Repubs and everyone else. Remember, this isn't a small country like Germany in the 30s, we're the military behemoth with the reserve currency for the world. The Repubs won't have to fight a world war to get further than any world dominator has ever gotten. They will have that from Day 1. No need to fight anyone. Putin and Xi will be at the inaugural. NATO will not be invited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read a lot of American history in the last two years when it dawned on me how big the lie was we were told in school. It seems in the last few years we've been starting to tell more truth to the kids, and the Repubs are putting a stop to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lots of destruction if we don't get in the way of the Republican Party's assumption of power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I wrote about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js&quot;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; that takes an OPML list of RSS feeds and validates them. Only feeds that can be read and are parseable are added to the OPML file it creates. It's what I use to clean up old lists before putting them in a database. I can see from where I'm going next that I won't be swinging back this way for a bit, so I thought it was better to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; to it now, in case people could use it. Important: It's a programmer's utility and meant to be example code. You have to be a JavaScript programmer to use it. If you have questions, post a comment in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/issues/1&quot;&gt;issue thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>The Bose speaker review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Speaker-Amazon-Alexa-Built/dp/B07Q337VV3?th=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/18/boseSpeaker.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've been buying smart battery-powered Bluetooth speakers almost since they first came out, starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3SNCGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Beats Pill&lt;/a&gt;, which I had mounted on the handlebars of the bike I rode in Manhattan. Lots of people asked what it was, and where could they get one. Since then I've bought speakers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;JBL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Tribit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFV59PY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Ultimate Ears&lt;/a&gt;, and others. None of them cost more than $100. My favorite so far is the Tribit, it's tiny, has a huge sound, and it's got a great feel in the hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the other day I figured out what I wanted for summer outdoor lounging -- a battery-powered speaker that had Alexa built in. So I did a little shopping, found there aren't many, and they're all really expensive. I asked for advice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1524533392901083136&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to blow some money, ordering a $400 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFKBQ3K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Bose speaker&lt;/a&gt;. The reviews were stunning. I had a hard time imagining how the sound could be that great, compared to how great the much cheaper models were, but I had to find out. They offered free returns. So all I was risking was a little time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the top line. It was a huge disappointment in every way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had to download their app just to turn it on, and then I had to create an account on their service. I also had to check off their agreement, which of course I didn't read. So right off the bat, before it even says anything to me, I hate it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it takes ten minutes to download the updated system software. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To use Alexa, I had to go through another signon process which required me to remember the password I used for their system, which very luckily I did (I didn't try, I never plan on using that service again). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay now finally, I say &quot;Alexa WNYC,&quot; our local NPR station. Nothing happens. Then the speaker upstairs starts playing WNYC. I yell ALEXA STOP upstairs. No good. So I go upstairs and tell it again to stop, and again it doesn't. So I pull the plug. Then I hear the Alexa in the bedroom is doing the same thing. I go in there and pull the plug. Go back downstairs. The Bose speaker is doing nothing. Okay I take a deep breath and try it again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Exactly the same thing happens. So I go upstairs again, pull the plugs on the speakers, this time, leave them unplugged, go back downstairs and try again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Nothing. I figure I'll try it again later.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm not done with the flaws of the product, but I want to pause here for a moment. I'm accustomed to setting up Alexas by plugging them in, waiting a few seconds while it boots up, then it looks around and somehow finds one of the other Alexas and asks if it's okay if it uses the data on it to configure this one. I always smile at this point, man that's good design, and I say YES of course, and in a few seconds I'm listening to NPR. The process involves no work beyond plugging it in and giving my consent. I imagine it needs to download updated system software, but wisely waits until late at night to do it. Why make the human wait while the robot does its housekeeping?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay the next day I figure enough with Alexa, let's see how this is as a speaker. So I press the Bluetooth button on top of the speaker, and I connect my iPhone in the normal way for Bluetooth. Then I play an old McCartney song. It sounds like any of the other speakers I have. I hit pause and start playing another song, and it never plays. I hit pause and play again, and it plays for a few seconds then freezes. I repeat the pause-play thing again and again, that's it -- it never plays another bit of music. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This is a piece of shit product. Maybe the Alexa problems are really Amazon problems, but if so, I can't believe they shipped the thing in this condition. But Bluetooth is mature technology. I've never had a problem with Bluetooth on any of the other speakers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's no way this product is worth $400. Even if it worked it wouldn't be worth any more than $100, and probably a lot less because the idea is this is supposed to be a portable product and it's much less portable than the $43 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Tribit&lt;/a&gt;, and honestly -- if it sounds better, I couldn't tell the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today I wrote a Node app that reads an OPML subscription list, loops over all the feeds and only passes on the ones that are reachable and parseable. Yes, I plan to share the code, because it's useful and also good example code for reading and writing lists, and reading feeds.</description>

			<title>Making Twitter quieter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A thread from Twitter converted to a post. Someday I'm going to have to write a script to do this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Twitter had a Steve Jobs type leader he'd come up with a brilliant idea, akin to noise-cancelling headphones (and call it that), and explain how satisfying it can be to tell the trolls to shut the fuck up. Ahhhh nice and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I used to live on noisy streets in Palo Alto and Berkeley. I moved to NYC, even worse (I lived in the West Village, then the East Village) until I moved uptown and then ahhh nice and quiet. Moved to the mountains, even better! There's something to be said for a little peace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how I made my twtr quiet. At the first sign of trollish behavior, I mute or block. Works great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The trollish behavior is basically anyone who wants to argue with you. People who say unfair things and you want to point out how unfair they are. If you find yourself protesting, the chances you're communicating with a troll approach 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To determine if the person conversing with you is a troll, look at your own feelings. If you feel they misunderstand you and want to correct them -- it's a troll. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've learned so much about trolls. Trolls aren't nearly as frustrating as newbies who refuse to turn them off and insist on setting them straight &lt;i&gt;for all to see. &lt;/i&gt;Ohhh, that's exactly what they want. It's like having a cat who brings home dead birds. I'm sure the cat meant well, but..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, in 2022, the entire Republican Party platform is trolling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whoever runs Twitter needs the sass of Steve Jobs with his incredible ability to make simple ideas simple. Noise-cancelling headphones for Twitter. Instead of focusing on trying to diminish the brightness of the sun, give everyone sunglasses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Repub is someone who likes to troll Libs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Lib is someone who thinks Repubs want to know why they're wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about the web is that people do tutorials with videos showing how they do things like install a new antenna on your roof, or put together an Adirondack chair. When people bad mouth the web, they forget about miracles like that. That said, there must be videos that demo how to shut down the trolls yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Interesting results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1525839800183431174&quot;&gt;yesterday's poll&lt;/a&gt; about when life begins. Clearly the poll got spammed by right-to-lifers, many hours after the poll went up, the proportion who said life begins at conception shot up from 10 percent to over 35. A poll like this of course only means what you personally take from it, it has no mathematical significance. It's as if I asked a group of people in a subway car what they think, but the car was only going to my neighborhood.</description>

			<description>I've been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/&quot;&gt;Hover.com&lt;/a&gt; for years, and have a lot of domains parked there, and I wish I could get the list of domains into my outliner easily. I don't need a full API, just a page that lists all my domains in an OPML file. Access it through the browser and save it locally. Read it into my outliner as a file. And then I can do whatever I want. It seems like an easy thing to implement. Not sure how many other people would use it right away, but I bet a bunch would use it once it was available. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, speaking of Hover, they took out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html&quot;&gt;killer feature&lt;/a&gt; I wrote up in 2019. I read their explanation (sorry can't find it now), it has to do with DNS tech of course, it's why the other guys don't do it either. But it really seemed to work and made my setup a little more flexible, which is something we really look for from DNS. Helps keep our sites working.</description>

I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=StarLink&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;StarLink&lt;/a&gt; now, but haven't mounted the antenna well enough to get good connections, so I can't turn off Spectrum, yet. ;-)</description>

			<description>Two Game 7s in the NBA playoffs today.  Uncle Davey will be watching TV.  The two games mean different things, to me at least. Either way, in the first game, one very deserving team will move forward and another very deserving team will go home. The other game will determine if future &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_players_in_the_Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame&quot;&gt;Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt; will get another shot at the championship, or if he's forever banished to being a great player who never got there. You get a sense this, at age 37, is his last shot. There's no shame in that, he has lots of company.</description>

			<description>If a baker may not be forced to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding on the basis of religious freedom, surely a woman canâ€™t be forced to give birth.</description>

If you go back far enough she was a blogger on Tumblr, so we feel pride, a local girl did good. And she adds a bit of open web, user-centric thought to everything. As a software developer, I see things the same way. I don't care how much money Zuck or Bezos or Musk have, like most journalists seem to, I care how empowered the users are, because that's how we will solve the problems of our world, by smart people who see things from important perspectives, who say what they see. Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3sBrFLS&quot;&gt;recent piece&lt;/a&gt; in the WP is about a group of startups who want the big silos to make it easier for their users to migrate to other platforms. This is a hard problem both economically and technically, and I'm not sure the startups are sincere, it could be they only want the publicity. There are no details &lt;a href=&quot;https://myfriendsmydata.org/&quot;&gt;on the website&lt;/a&gt;, and a project like this is all about the details. Also VC-backed startups are the last devs I expect to go this route and I don't imagine if one of them is successful that they're going to rush to share their user lists with the others. The only way something like this can work is if they share a membership system from the start. And if they do that, and want credibility, there should be some non-VC open source devs in their group. One more thing, why not just use Twitter's identity system. It's got a great API, scales really well, and other devs (such as me) are using it that way. Instead of building my own identity system, I just use theirs. I have no interest in controlling my users, so it's a no-brainer. Sure the day could come when Twitter shuts off the API, but I could also get hit by a car riding my bike on a country road, or any number of other calamities.</description>

Much later, in 2015, I ported the World Outline software from Frontier running as a server, to Node.js, but I left the site private, probably because I wasn't planning to build in this direction, I just wanted to get some sites that were running in Frontier to work in Node. This morning some of my work led me to this software, and I saw that it was private, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/worldOutline&quot;&gt;made it public&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the &lt;i&gt;wo&lt;/i&gt; is like the &lt;i&gt;www&lt;/i&gt; except with outlines instead of HTML. You can of course render the outlines as HTML, and that's what the WO software does. Given all the interest in outliners these days, it seemed like a good time to open this stuff up. However at this point I don't plan to run the server software here. If you get it running, all I ask is that you continue to support OPML. Interop is everything. Thanks.</description>

			<description>I was out driving the new Model Y with a fresh pizza on the passenger seat, rounded a corner and there was a fat turkey waddling across the road. Slammed the brakes. They work, but turkey keeps waddling as if nothing happened. Pizza mess on the floor of the new car. Where the Model 3 had the new car smell even six months after getting it, this car smells of pizza. Hey at least it was good pizza. Heh.</description>

They want to be famous for having an idea first, whether or not they did have it first. I don't think I do that. I like setting precedent in software. But even there, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Only%20steal%20from%20the%20best&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;Only steal from the best.&quot; My goal is to find ways to work with others so that the sum is greater than the parts. I think that's the challenge of our generation and all subsequent generations. We're not dealing with climate change, for example. We're losing our minds as a country in other ways, for example the decision the Supreme Court is contemplating. You know it's not going to work, it'll be as big a disaster as climate change, but we'll feel it right away. We can't connect enough so that the people who we've supposedly trusted for being wise to avoid jumping unnecessarily, with no possible gain, into an abyss that will certainly lead to war. It's that big a deal. At age 67, I don't have the same goals I had at 22. I'm not trying to set the world on fire, I'm trying nudge people into working with each other, even today's 22 year-olds. We should be giving out Nobel Prizes to people who find ways to work with others. That's the challenge for the human species, from now on, imho of course.</description>

McLuhan says to the professor: &quot;You know nothing of my work. How you ever got to teach to teach a course in anything is totally amazing.&quot; Allen looks at the camera: &quot;Boy if life were only like this.&quot; Well anyway, on Twitter, I am regularly pulled out from behind a poster to support someone who thinks &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is doing fine.
