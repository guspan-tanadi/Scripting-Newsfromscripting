It's a really sad story, but I don't think it has to be. There was a lot of collegiality in the early blogging community, and we shared our work. He mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; in passing, but it solved a big part of the puzzle that eventually became WordPress, Facebook and Twitter, and btw &lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. All the source information is in the archive of Scripting News, this blog. Manila was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;culmination&lt;/a&gt; of a couple of years of open experimentation I did into how you could simplify content management so ordinary people could do it. First we had to understand what the problem was (two models for the content, one the editing view and the other the published view, there needed to be one model), why content management was too complicated for writers, and then how to make it usable. And then there was a lot of code to write, UI to design and endless iteration. And it had an API. That was a big deal. It's probably why Twitter and WordPress have APIs, btw. All that (unless I missed something) is left out of Manton's story. I was hoping for the actual story about how this worked to be chronicled in his book. Not only because I want to be in the story myself, but also so that today's developers know how these kinds of things come to be. Most of the stories tell the wrong freaking story. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The Mets suck. As a lifelong Mets fan I know this. I love the Mets. Itâ€™s a family thing. Parents and grandparents loved the Brooklyn Dodgers so I love the Mets. But what bullshit that supposed Mets fans booed our starter as he left the field last night, and many left before the game was  over.  As usual  some &lt;s&gt;fucking&lt;/s&gt; Yankees fans got Mets hats and are pretending to be Mets  fans.</description>

			<description>What Facebook is doing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.meta.com/metaverse/impact/&quot;&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; is doomed to fail. When has a big established tech giant invented the next layer of the virtuality? If thereâ€™s any validity to Zuck's vision, the reality will be achieved by a startup, competing with other startups. Facebook which now foolishly  calls  itself  Meta!  (might  as  well  change  their  name  to  Bullshit!)  will,  if  theyâ€™re  lucky  get  to  buy  one  of  the  leading  startups,  will  eventually get  a  new  CEO who  will  write  off  the Meta!  foolishness,  and  Meta!  will  go  the  way  of  Topview,  Copland,  OpenDoc,  OS/2,  and  all  the  bullshit  Bill Gates  threw  at  the  open  web.</description>

			<description>The NYT has a new technology podcast, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/07/wheresTheFeed.png&quot;&gt;no indication&lt;/a&gt; on the site what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feed is.

			<title>Comparing FeedLand to River5</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1271711025&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the FeedLand thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the difference between FeedLand and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for asking. This is a good question, I should know how to answer it. So let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's much more than River5.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a browser-based UI for managing and sharing subscriptions. So the users are kind of members of a club. We can all see each others' subscription lists. We know what are the most popular feeds. When someone subscribes to a feed it appears in the subscription log, which is visible to everyone. There is no private information in FeedLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; easy to subscribe to a feed that's already in the database. Radically easy. Hard to imagine how it could be easier. That's very important.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can create a &quot;news product&quot; entirely in the web browser, no need to use an external tool to manage your feeds and categories. Again, as easy as it can be. I iterated over the design of this stuff obsessively.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It stores all the data in a relational database.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So far none of this stuff is in River5. Underneath all this, FeedLand does almost all of what River5 does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One thing River5 has over FeedLand is that it's shipping, you can use it now. FeedLand is still in development. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically where River5 is a simple feed reading system, this is groupware, collaborative, like Slack it's meant for workgroups. The end result is not entirely dissimilar to River5, but the chance to work with other people is new.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, who I know from early &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; days. One of our best developers, and a steady fellow, which was much appreciated. I know he's a sports fan too, living in Texas he follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs&quot;&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt;, which is of course a legendary team. I am, as you know, a Knicks fan. But I have to say, until the Mets are finished, and probably a few weeks after that, I'm focused only on baseball. I'm very modal with my sports. I'm either in or not. I can't love two teams at the same time. It's just who I am. Anyway, Manton has written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://book.micro.blog/&quot;&gt;book about microblogging&lt;/a&gt; and he runs a service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; which hosts blogs, running his software. I feel that his blog and my new reading software have brought us closer. And I look forward to reading his book.</description>

			<description>BTW, here's my &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=bloggers&quot;&gt;list of bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. But most of them aren't updating. I hope to add to this list, to find bloggers who are writing about interesting stuff with good &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/26/webenergy.html&quot;&gt;web energy&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>For all the ups and downs the Mets ended the season with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/06/standings.png&quot;&gt;exactly the same record&lt;/a&gt; as the Braves, 101 wins and 61 losses. The only reason the Mets are in the wild card and the Braves get to wait for the next round, is that they won one more game against the Mets this year than they lost. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7bgtu2O4E&quot;&gt;game of inches&lt;/a&gt; Al Pacino's character rants about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Life is made of inches.</description>

			<description>I added a new feature to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; today. There's now a white-on-orange XML icon in the upper right corner of each news product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1686843/194099839-d458927b-8b0b-46d8-af83-f27c00f81764.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. The icon links to the OPML subscription list for the feeds on the page. This came from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1268027417&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the thread, basically asking &quot;Where are the feeds.&quot; I love those kinds of questions, they help direct the development of a product. My perspective is so muddled, I've been living with this product for nine months already. I can't see what it looks like to someone seeing it for the first time.</description>

The reason -- they wanted to postpone Trump's reaction to the leak to the future, knowing that the lead time on books is much longer than news articles. This is impossible to confirm, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=maggie+haberman+leaves+out+scoops+from+reporting+for+book&quot;&gt;casts doubt&lt;/a&gt; on her &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt;. The safest thing for her to have done is to leave the non-reportable leaks out of the book, to avoid the appearance that she's withholding news so she can make more money with the book.</description>

			<description>Substack has a sadistic kind of paywall. You start reading a piece, get into it, enough to wonder where itâ€˜s going and boom, itâ€™s time to subscribe or get out of here. Leaves a humiliation thatâ€™s hard to describe. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-4151-why-goal-cascades-are-harmful&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that triggered the paywall, it's not doing it now -- I have no idea why. This is the second time I've seen this paywall. Anyway, I clicked on the link because I thought I might learn something, instead I have a pain in the gut. Trains you to never read anything on Substack again, and, like all other paywalls, it does not make me want to subscribe. If you have a comment, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1577618434220777473&quot;&gt;original tweet&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>My friend Anton Zuiker has been one of the early users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and his news product is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dukeriver.co/&quot;&gt;Duke River&lt;/a&gt;. He works in the Duke University medical school. He's been a long-time user of my software (much appreciated). When he visited me in NYC a few years ago we rode Citibikes in Manhattan, even right through the middle of Times Square. Anton doesn't flinch at adventure. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, the Mets were rained out yesterday and the Braves lost, so technically the Mets are not yet eliminated in the race for the NL East. But it takes just one Mets loss or Braves win to do the deed, though, so we're hanging on by the thinnest possible thread.</description>

			<title>FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well here we are, the project I've been working on all year is now ready to show itself, a little. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The name of the project is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. You'll be hearing a lot about that in the weeks and months to come. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a big effort, to take a fresh look at the world defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, twenty years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In its first twenty years, RSS has become an established part of the open web. It got blogging and podcasting off the ground. It changed the world. Now we get started on the second twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FeedLand defines two roles -- reader and developer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People who read the news as prepared by others.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The people who prepare the news.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people fall into the first category. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FeedLand focuses on the second category. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I want to show you is the result. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A new presentation of the news I read, attached to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;http://news.scripting.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This site has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/river/&quot;&gt;attached&lt;/a&gt; to Scripting News for years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the same site, except now it's managed by FeedLand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I saved a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/river/backup/&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/a&gt; of the river as it was before this change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/04/newsScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; looked like on opening day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How EZ-Pass for news would work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If there were a rational system for online news, imho, how would it work? I know news orgs don't think this way, but what if they did?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A news org would put its local news stories behind a paywall, accessible via subscription only. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Stories that are reprints of wire service stories could also be behind the paywall if they want, but I wonder what's the point. The same exact text is available from lots of other sources, often by local TV stations -- but they are thorougly saturated with horrific advertising. Want to do something original? Put these outside the paywall and get a reputation for being a &quot;good&quot; place to go for wire service stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The tricky stuff are the stories that people from outside your area would want to read. For example, I live near NYC, these would include stories from the Boston, Chicago or Los Angeles local news orgs. For these, I suggest they could be behind your paywall too, if you want, but you should also make them available through a respected distributor, maybe a service run by one of the largest news orgs or wire services. They would charge on a per-read basis, to people who had registered a credit card with the distributor. The revenue would be shared with the distributor of course. Not sure what the price would be, you could try out a variety of prices and see which prices maximize revenue. This would be found money. Most people who live near New York are not going to subscribe to the big Atlanta news org.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The final category are stories that are so important that you want to make sure everyone can read them without limit. At the height of the Covid pandemic some news orgs were putting their stories on the virus outside the paywall and they didn't count against your monthly limit. Of course this raises the question of why do you publish any stories that wouldn't be in this category? Isn't everything you publish vital? (Obviously not, but that's not something many news orgs would probably want to admit.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about this is that I recently discovered a New Jersey news org that does a good job of covering the Mets. They are a local team for New Jersey too. What a kick esp since the NYT which I do subscribe to has, for some reason, stopped covering the Mets. I wonder why. Anyway, to my chagrin that was short-lived. I guess they gave me a cookie and were counting the number of articles I was seeing, and now I can't read them any longer. There basically is no journalism I can read about the team, even though they are having an incredible year, and there's a lot to say about them and I am subscribed to one of the local news orgs. As a reader as far as I can tell I'm doing everything I'm supposed to, yet I can't read most of the stories I want to, and not just about the Mets, about &lt;i&gt;everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have found some bloggers that are filling the gap, a little. But we have a long way to go. We are already living in the age of news blackouts for a lot of what we're interested in, and when an important issue comes up, it's just another chance for news orgs outside our local area to remind us that we can't read their stories unless we subscribe, which is not possible, economically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, this blog has no paywall, it's free to read for everyone, and there are a number of things I write about that are as good as anything you'll read by a pro.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When they finally lost, I slammed my left hand on the arm of the chair in a reflexive move. The watch which was also on the hand started shrieking wanting confirmation that I had taken a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944&quot;&gt;hard fall&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably it was going to try to get me help if I did. I answered no. It asked if I fell at all. I thought for a second and said no. But I did have to think about it. The Mets have always been heartbreakers. As a fan since 1962, there have been lots of downs, but the ups are spectacular. We keep hoping for another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmjuuQQX3Z4&quot;&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llHnR0ZPy6E&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;. The day will come, that's the feeling. Will this be the year? Well, if it is, it's going to be a long slog with lots of heartbreak on the way. ðŸ˜¢</description>

It's huge but they're all there, all the episdes. How am I going to parse this? Then I remembered I have it in my database. So I wrote a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/02/query.png&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; to get me the &lt;i&gt;enclosureUrl&lt;/i&gt; of all items from that feed, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/500SongsEnclosureUrls.html&quot;&gt;it worked&lt;/a&gt;. I love it when this happens.</description>

			<title>New glue for GitHub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/santa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code&quot;&gt;glue code&lt;/a&gt; for ages. Basically, someone provides an API for a service. Could be the IBM PC with calls to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/dev/rom/ibm/5150/&quot;&gt;ROM BIOS&lt;/a&gt; to read files, or the Apple II hardware screen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.applelogic.org/files/AIIETECHREF2.pdf&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; (invented by the clever genius Steve Wozniak), or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_event&quot;&gt;Apple Events&lt;/a&gt; supported by various Mac apps in the 90s, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; interfaces for web apps, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+interfaces+of+GitHub+and+Slack&quot;&gt;REST interfaces&lt;/a&gt; of GitHub and Slack or thousands of other services. They give you an API, and then after you see what it can do, and if you want to use it in your app, you write some glue, so all your calls flow through code you control, so if you learn something about their API, you only have to support it in one place. It's especially important for the few services that reserve the right to break their developers. Apple used to do this all the time, I haven't programmed to an Apple API in a very long time. Maybe they stopped? It's a way of forcing your developers to redeclare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJbsXeRc_Fw&quot;&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; to the Great Platform every so often. I like the web where no one has the power to break me (although &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; might argue with that). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- today I have a new release of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;glue code for GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, the code I use to read and write files from and to GitHub. I use this to keep archives of stuff, because I think GitHub has a good chance of sticking around for a few decades, longer than the S3 storage I use for everything. That'll disappear the day someone stops paying the bills. But the GitHub stuff should stay, no bills to pay (though I do pay for a developer account, only seems fair because I use it a lot). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;archiving my blog&lt;/a&gt;. Starting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2017/05/16&quot;&gt;May 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;. And since then every post, every day and every month has been stored there in JSON and OPML. I've also managed to find and store OPML files for most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;stuff on my blog&lt;/a&gt; going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/DaveNet&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not much of a secret that I'm working on a product that reads feeds in RSS, Atom and RDF formats. It contains a feed reader, but it is more of a development tool for &lt;i&gt;news products.&lt;/i&gt; It stores info about feeds, items, subscriptions, users and likes and other stuff. I want that stuff to flow to GitHub right from the start. It'll be a slice of what we're doing online in 2022 and beyond. Maybe that'll be useful to some researcher in the future? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new thing in my GitHub glue is that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github/blob/master/davegithub.js&quot;&gt;manages&lt;/a&gt; a queue of writes, so you can just tell it to write something and then go on to the next thing. GitHub has a rule that you can only have one call extant at a time. This is a terrible for for an environment like JavaScript that doesn't let you do that easily. I got tired of managing that stuff in my application code so I added the queue to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;davegithub&lt;/a&gt; and that simplifies all future applications that have to write to GitHub. Absolutely nothing revolutionary in that -- it's just nice to be able to forget about that particular feature of GitHub, let the software manage it for me. And it's MIT licensed stuff so you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also released an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/uploadFolderToGitHub/blob/main/uploadfolder.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; that uploads a folder full of JSON files to a location on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So If you are a programmer and want to use GitHub to archive your stuff, or to create a connection to GitHub for other apps, I've made it simple for you. Enjoy! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand&quot;&gt;Stewart Brand&lt;/a&gt; would find this interesting, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Doc Quixote</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a longish phone talk with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; a couple of days ago. Then he &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/09/30/from-hollywood-park-racetrack-to-sofi-stadium/&quot;&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt;  about a series of photos he took over 17 years, on airplanes approaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport&quot;&gt;LAX&lt;/a&gt;, of a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Park_Racetrack&quot;&gt;horse track&lt;/a&gt; as it changed over the years, and eventually was torn down and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium&quot;&gt;football stadium&lt;/a&gt; was built in its place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've known Doc for a long time, and I've seen at least two sides of the man. On one side is &lt;b&gt;Doc Quixote&lt;/b&gt; who is ranting about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dsearls&quot;&gt;windmills&lt;/a&gt;. He's great with words so he comes up with memorable ways of expressing the ideas. And Doc is the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affable&quot;&gt;affable&lt;/a&gt; person I've ever known, so they love him as he rants at them. And the things Doc rants about &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; what we need to do &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; to start to be free. In other words he's right. But as we've grown old as friends I'm pretty certain that Doc will not live to see his ideas become reality. And nor will I, for my dream. I spent great time, energy and money, over many years to create the writing and programming environment I wanted to use and I wanted my peers to use, so we could &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt; to create species-saving communication tools, and just beauty -- nothing wrong with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, when I read the story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie&quot;&gt;David Bowie's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_David_Bowie&quot;&gt;last days&lt;/a&gt;, he did something amazing when he knew he had a short time to live. He stepped back and got out of the way. He understood this is no longer his world. I think we could all benefit from learning that earlier in life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you're young, you think expansively, and as you get old reality sinks in and your imagination contracts. The horizon gets closer and closer. We don't get to mold the world, we are not gods, no matter how good or generous, smart of ruthless you may be, we all start out young and if we're lucky we get old and then we're gone. Nothing you did in your life will exist after you're gone. I own this, as a 67-year-old man, as I decide what to do each day. I don't want to shake the world. &lt;i&gt;I want to have fun with my friends.&lt;/i&gt; That's it. And that's just right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I think about my friend Doc, and the things he accomplished by &lt;b&gt;Just Being Doc&lt;/b&gt;, doing the things he'd do anyway no matter the dragons he's slaying. He would take pictures of construction projects from airplanes over 17 years. He would know literally everything about broadcast radio. And he'd be very affable while doing all that. Those I think are the things that matter. It makes no sense to be a billionaire or an autocrat. Ideas will happen when it's their time, totally independent of what you do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of ideas along this line in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1576118495380529152&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote this morning all around DQ and JBD, and how the pattern is in my life-work too. I'll probably write more about that later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtdhWltSIg&quot;&gt;play this song&lt;/a&gt;, and go back to the top and read the story again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
