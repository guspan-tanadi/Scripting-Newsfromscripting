Once there's a default way to do something that's deeply ingrained, it doesn't get displaced quickly or easily. That's not taking anything away from Masto which is an amazing accomplishment. Both systems exist and will evolve to have different uses.</description>

			<title>The FeedLand platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the FeedLand platform has been ready to be released as open source for some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland&quot;&gt;https://github.com/scripting/feedland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I haven't been focused on that kind of stuff, so I didn't want to create an expectation that there would be a lot of support. That's still true, but the product deserves to be out there, so very quietly last week I made the feedland repo public. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/database/database.md&quot;&gt;SQL commands&lt;/a&gt; that create the FeedLand database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided today was the day to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/151114.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about it, because I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/31&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the database that I want to ask questions about from people with expertise in MySQL, and can't do that publicly without referring to bits that are in that repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Don't read -- spoilers!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was both impossible to watch at times, and in some ways the best most revealing most fun episode ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two sons are complete fucking idiots. And Shiv is her father's daughter and the son he never had. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The moral of this story is the feminist complaint, she was obviously pushed aside because of her vagina, in favor of the idiot penises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And like the previous episode which ended with Kendall smiling (over something stupid), this one ends with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/shivSmile.png&quot;&gt;Shiv smiling&lt;/a&gt; (over something clever and kind of evil). So I guess in the next one it's Roman, right? Five episodes to go. Two more siblings, plus Tom and Greg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who's smiling at the end of the last episode? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Washington Post did some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3AsTRnv&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; (free link, no paywall) to discover the sources behind &quot;AI like ChatGPT&quot; -- and they have a dialog you can use to find out how often certain sites are used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Documenting-the-English-Colossal-Clean-Crawled-Dodge-Sap/40c3327a6ddb0603b6892344509c7f428ab43d81?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template&quot;&gt;Google's C4 dataset&lt;/a&gt; (whatever that is). So of course I checked to see how much data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is included. The answer: 710K tokens, which is 0.0005% of all tokens. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/scriptingquotes.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Some comps: &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.com/&quot;&gt;daringfireball.com&lt;/a&gt; had 610K, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seths.blog/&quot;&gt;seths.blog&lt;/a&gt; had 750K and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kottke.org/&quot;&gt;kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; had 590K.</description>

We like our basketball players to have a reason to want to win, who don't feel they're doing anyone a favor by showing up to play the freaking game, and don't practice race-hate on Twitter.

If it's the most famous one what's the point of saying it is. Everyone would know that, right.</description>

It was the class that weeded out those who would get graduate degrees from those who would not. The class project was to write a compiler for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122103/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ohearn/Algol/intro.html&quot;&gt;Algol-like language&lt;/a&gt; that the professor desgined. He gave us a set of test apps that we had to compile and run correctly. I didn't get it. I thought code generation was like a magic box. Somehow the machine had a copy of every program you could write, and when it saw you were asking for that one, it would just spit out the code. Knowing what I know now, this was a ludicrous idea, but it's the best your mind can do when you just don't get it. Then there was the moment when I did get it. I started writing a code generator for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop&quot;&gt;while loop&lt;/a&gt;, and plugged it into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler&quot;&gt;compiler-compiler&lt;/a&gt;, and saw what it generated worked. From that point on, it was just writing code. Same thing with the web. I thought of big data centers, until I visited one of the most popular sites on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Underground_Music_Archive&quot;&gt;IUMA&lt;/a&gt;, and found it was just an old Sun terminal and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box_form_factor&quot;&gt;pizza box computer&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on the floor in a random dusty one-room office in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Cruz,+CA/@36.9758914,-122.04748,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808e441b7c36d549:0x52ca104b2ad7f985!8m2!3d36.9741171!4d-122.0307963!16zL20vMGwwbWs&quot;&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;.

Behind the magic is a bit of software, as magical (or not) as my compiler, or the pathetic Santa Cruz machine with the huge net presence. I'm sure there's something very mundane behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR64EF3OpA&quot;&gt;curtain&lt;/a&gt;, but for now I love the magic of it and I don't believe the explanations that say it's stupid.

			<description>Another ChatGPT use-case. There's an open source package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;medium-editor&lt;/a&gt; that I use to edit text in most of my products. I believe it's popular, but because of its name, it can be hard to use a search engine to find technical information about it. I wanted to make an instance of the editor the focus by default when its created. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/20/medium-editor-package-familiar.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT how to&lt;/a&gt; do it, and it gave me fantastic docs, because it could sort out what Google simply can't. Incredibly useful. It will, if it works, result in a product that &quot;feels good&quot; -- people probably won't even notice that it did anything unusual. This is what make software excellent. (Update: Still scratching my head over this.)</description>

			<description>This might be my favorite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSyNUAzPofI&quot;&gt;Stones song&lt;/a&gt; because the lead singer is Keith Richards, but he gets a bunch of help from Mick Jagger. It's like magic. Perfect music for 4/20. Always took candy from strangers. Don't want to end up like papa working for the boss every night and day. I need love to keep me happy.</description>

Last night's emails went out with the linkblog items coming from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;new feed&lt;/a&gt;, and if I hadn't said anything I bet most people wouldn't have noticed the markdown styling wasn't rendered on one of the items.

After reading the book many years ago, I had a teacher named Jeru, whose tapes I have put on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeru.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;, who said many wise things that made a huge difference in my understanding of myself. But he also said one thing that I think was too judgmental -- that most love relationships have the partners taking turns acting like children. We, the students, laughed, as if to say -- yes but we're smart enough to not do that. To which I, Dave, now 25 years older and hopefully a little wiser, say yeah okay, that's cool, but please -- that's bullshit. Because we're &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; acting like children, all of us, because that's what we are. 99 percent of our energy comes from the child, maybe 1 percent from the intellect, the adult. The fun of life comes from the child. At our core, where our joy lives, we're kids, human puppies. Our partner is our best friend, and we play together and make huge messes, but our parents (our intellects) are watching over us, and are ready to step up if there's danger. But as long as it's fun, let the kids play. Most relationships I've had have been love-starved. We're expected to live up to an impossible standard, something out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave it to Beaver&lt;/a&gt;. Ward and June, Wally and the Beaver. All I've ever wanted is someone to let me love them, who I could learn from, who would read my stuff and laugh at my jokes and tell me I'm a good boy. I really meant what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/04/014347.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; about getting from my human partner the same kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/04/014347.html&quot;&gt;love a dog gets&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so I tore up the pillows and pissed on the carpet. But you still love me right? Here let me get you the stick, now please throw it so I can be a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/23/161945.html&quot;&gt;good boy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; again.</description>

			<title>How to use the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/110225906594359425&quot;&gt;use the web&lt;/a&gt; to work with each other, you are using the web correctly. Almost no one does that. Instead people use the web to draw attention to themselves. The replies I get are mostly people trying to tag their names along with something someone else wrote to get more flow for them, more followers. It's a strategy. It's basically spam. It's not very social imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the replies may &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like they're addressed to you. Literally they are addressed to you. But they're not &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; you, they're for bots basically, or people behaving as bots. Mastodon is mostly like Twitter in this way. I have had some interactions that were legitimately about working together, but they're few and far between. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT desperately needs customization. I'd like to get my Amazon Music history connected to it, so I can ask it to create a workout playlist for me. I can describe what kind of music works for me, a strong fast beat, big bass drum and guitar. Something I can sing along to is good. And I like a certain set of bands from the 70s and 80s, so we might as well start with that. Now I'm going for a 40-minute walk. Program the music please and put it on my phone and off I go.</description>

And today I ask a different question, which Succession character do you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0fWUxqcyYWbE9XByTQwV5nV7Y6bGD4SQHU7uxJ7JG6hHNGnJmMD2MCJgqyGUnf2wUl&quot;&gt;like the best&lt;/a&gt;?</description>

I have a lot of old dear friends on Facebook who I'd never see online or in real life -- and this is such a huge blessing, given that I live in the remote Catskills, where some very nice &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; people live, and many of them are friends on Facebook too. There is no such thing as a purely good social network, whether it's owned by the mega silicon valley tech cartel, or if it's a distributed fediverse -- the networks for most people are defined by the users, not who provides the system. Yeah in a way that's naive and in another way it's humble and practical. We all are only going to be around for a few more years. Enjoying the people you like and love, imho, is a big part of what makes being alive worth it. So if it's a small sin to help Facebook dominate in a very very very small way, well sometimes I don't recycle either. And no one knows the big picture, so I'm going to go ahead and keep using Facebook, because I find love there, and that's a big deal.</description>

			<title>Little Feat and Irma Thomas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked Amazon Music to play some songs for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first they chose was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaQ3VGeQ8Uw&quot;&gt;Long Distance Love&lt;/a&gt; by Little Feat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a perfect song. Driving beat. Lowell George poetry. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;No matter what I do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even pray to heaven above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;All I ever get from her is Long Distance Love. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Raining_(Irma_Thomas_song)&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjDmpyWfBs&quot;&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irma_Thomas&quot;&gt;Irma Thomas&lt;/a&gt; who we used to see at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maple+Leaf+Bar/@29.9542913,-90.1416967,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8620a53fb836c8ed:0x1982e3718f7b6dcd!8m2!3d29.9489368!4d-90.1320837!16zL20vMDlsaDN0&quot;&gt;Maple Leaf&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans when I was a student there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard her?

As I see it, all that is happening right now. Twitter is still orders of magnitude more installed in the modern news system than Masto. But I am on Masto, it's among the first links in my browser's chrome. But we're all still figuring out what it's used for. Twitter, even though it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; greatly diminished from its former heights, is still the incumbent in the news world.

			<description>I seem to get confused by the name of the show, often calling it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression&quot;&gt;Suppression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_(disambiguation)&quot;&gt;Secession&lt;/a&gt; -- Obsession, Regression or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/17/model-suggests-similar-words.html&quot;&gt;whatever&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; was a breakthrough, it accumulated a library of solved problems that you could borrow from, but you'd have to figure out which pieces went with others, and that was often an long arduous process, when it worked, and it didn't always work. ChatGPT is the next level after Stack Exchange. Now you just ask the question and you get docs customized to the exact problem you have and it writes docs that are better quality than what programmers write on Stack Exchange (not in any way diminishing their contribution). So this is like moving from a calculator to a spreadsheet. It's simply a higher-level tool.</description>

It's got something for everyone. Heterosexual men get the example set by Melvin, played by Jack Nicholson, who despite his obvious insanity, is able to find love. Carol, played by Helen Hunt, gives up on not having a life, and accepts Melvin, even though he's so obviously completely out of his mind (as is she btw). For the mom, she gets to see her daughter have a life. The kid gets healthy and Simon gets a place to stay and friends who respect him for the loving generous person that he is (and also crazy). And we the audience get to relax and stop believing the lie that there is such a thing as human perfection. We learn to accept ourselves and others as having valid points of view, that may seem crazy, especially when combined with our own insanity, and realize that we can be kind and generous to each other, even if they aren't the perfect person we insist we're entitled to.  The title sums up everything. If you're happy, if you feel good, that's good enough, in fact it's as good as it gets. BTW, I like to write about this movie. I've done it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22as+good+as+it+gets%22&quot;&gt;bunch of times&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
