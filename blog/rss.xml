			<title>What is identity?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I use the term &lt;i&gt;identity&lt;/i&gt; in docs and when writing about technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An identity is a virtual person that belongs to you. You can have lots of them. For example I am &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;davewiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on Twitter, or &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/&quot;&gt;dave.winer.12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on Facebook, or &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on GitHub, which means I can create stuff under those names, in a way that (hopefully) only the real Dave Winer can edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's possible to use your identity from one system on others. When I say &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; I'm just saying that rather than invent a new name here, we're happy to use the name you're known by on Twitter. It's like using a passport from another country as your (different) country's passport.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; even if you don't use Twitter, you can quickly create an identity there, it takes about a minute to create an account, and then use that name &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Even if for some reason you don't want to create an identity on Twitter, if you have a Mac you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;desktop version&lt;/a&gt;. No identity required because your work is stored on your computer not mine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; write and maintain my own identity server. If I did that, that's basically all I would do. Think of all the fancy things Twitter does to support hundreds of millions of users. Think of what you expect of them. If somehow you get locked out of your account, you have to connect with a human somehow to get it back. They have it set up, skillfully, so you get a very small amount of human time, because otherwise the economics don't work. If I ran the identity system I use, I wouldn't be as efficient as they are and it's a thankless job, and I don't want it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's futuristic to use the same identity system as other developers. The more people use it, the better prepared we will be if there's a problem in the future with continuing to use Twitter. By using an external identity system I am inviting other developers to join me, so we can pool our efforts when we need to. Otherwise there's no hope that a common system could develop. It has been tried. But evolving this way is the only way imho that has a chance of working. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when I say &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; that means you log in to Twitter, they tell us what your name is, and then we know where to store your stuff so that only you can edit it. It really is a nice thing that Twitter does, and for now at least I can't imagine they have an ulterior motive, and if they ever do we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there. But we couldn't get there at all without using some kind of bridge here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have a comment or question &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/235&quot;&gt;post a note&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A Twitter hello world app</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/02.html#a223523&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; for a while about what would be the best way to illustrate the opportunity in factoring the Twitter API, so that developers wouldn't have to run a server to create browser-based apps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of maybe releasing the source for &lt;a href=&quot;http://thread.center/&quot;&gt;thread.center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://happyfriends.camp/&quot;&gt;happy.friends&lt;/a&gt;, or another of the many Twitter utilities I've written over the years. I still might do that, but I decided for now to go another way, by writing the simplest program possible, an app that just posts a tweet that says &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of the app. It's separated into two folders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/tree/main/server&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/tree/main/client&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitterhello.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;run it here&lt;/a&gt;. I am running an instance of the server on one of my machines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is how I envision Twitter's backend working for developers. Just include the functionality in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/tree/main/server&quot;&gt;Hello World server&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter's server. Why should every developer have to write the same code, and run a server? All I want to do is write and run something quickly to try an idea out. And if it becomes popular, I won't have the skill or resources to scale my server, when Twitter is already scaling their server, and my server is doing nothing but communicating with Twitter's. A perfect opportunity for factoring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obviously such a backend would have to do more than post a Hello World tweet. That's not hard to do -- I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davetwitter&quot;&gt;done it&lt;/a&gt; and am happy to share the code. I think that Twitter is an excellent platform for developers, and it would be much better if it got even simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/issues/2&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a long messy story, and by calling it 2.0 we said enough of the messy story. All we want is a feed syndication format that works, and that's exactly what RSS 2.0 is. It works. We got support from all the major news organizations, we already had the support of the NY Times. In the process of designing RSS 2.0, the BBC opened its feeds. And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09.html#When:10:25:22AM&quot;&gt;9/18/02&lt;/a&gt;, the spec was published. From there a small revolution happened, leading to the social media world we enjoy today.</description>

			<description>As you might imagine, in this excursion, there were &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of broken links. As always archive.org was the answer. But for UserLand-hosted sites, very often archive.org has a message about their crawler hitting our servers too hard. An awful lot of our stuff is lost. But I'm sure most of it is in Frontier databases, so ultimately is findable. I'm going to try to do just that with the important bits of the August-September work on RSS.</description>

And the building the restaurant is in doesn't have to keep working for 150 years. That's why making a new piece of software, while it has the elements of composition you'd find in a painting, has a lot more work to do. A painting inspires. Software does that too, but it has to work. Nothing new here really. Think about all the functionality in an actual building, and those are also works of art.</description>

The first part of the game was dominated by the team with championship experience, but the newcomers eventually sorted it all out, and proved that the experienced team would not coast to victory on their existing skills. They're going to have to develop some new ones to make it through this contest. The second game is Sunday night. I'm rooting for the newcomers, but not by a lot. I love both teams, they both have a lot to recommend them, and they are teams that were formed out of the draft, so there's continuity, and a victory in either case will have meaning to the the fans of both.</description>

			<description>When I bought my new house in the country I hired a painter to do over the inside of the house. I talked with him on the phone and arranged a meeting at the house. When I arrived he was already there. He was a black man. I had no idea. When we spoke on the phone I thought he was white. In the first few minutes of the conversation I told him this, because I was absolutely sure that I couldn't have hidden my surprise. It happened again, more recently, when my new Tesla was delivered. The man they sent was black, very nice, we had a polite conversation, but I felt awkward. One time, there was a group of white men working in my house, and I was sure one of them had said something antisemitic, and guessed he didn't know I was Jewish. I didn't say anything. And of course when I was a kid, I remember the antisemitic hatred of fellow school kids, who blamed Jews for the deaths of their uncles in the war. I was born ten years after the end of WW II, a war they felt wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Jews. I expect that's what they were told by the adults in their family, around the kitchen table. It's all those adults and their kitchen tables that perpetuate the caste system.</description>

			<source:outline text="When I bought my new house in the country I hired a painter to do over the inside of the house. I talked with him on the phone and arranged a meeting at the house. When I arrived he was already there. He was a black man. I had no idea. When we spoke on the phone I thought he was white. In the first few minutes of the conversation I told him this, because I was absolutely sure that I couldn't have hidden my surprise. It happened again, more recently, when my new Tesla was delivered. The man they sent was black, very nice, we had a polite conversation, but I felt awkward.

They had a conference call that I dialed into, and the conversation turned to my big wish for the Twitter API, that we organize the API so that from a browser-based app you can communicate directly with twitter.com, without having to run a server app as an intermediary. This has always been a big opportunity, but now there's communication. I've been developing apps using the Twitter API since 2006. There's lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/07/07/comparingApis.html&quot;&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; here, and their back-end is an incredible network resource. Lots to do here. Here's my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1532382742851244034&quot;&gt;followup thread&lt;/a&gt; posted earlier today.</description>

			<description>If I could transmit one idea to the masters of tech it would be that you're going to die, soon, no matter how much you money or power you have. That's why it's pointless to accumulate more wealth. Only a very few people care, and they'll all be dead soon too.</description>
