			<description>Twitter tanking would be far worse than Google pulling the plug on &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=google%20reader&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. The whole world is in a way built around Twitter, and it works pretty well.</description>

			<description>Someone needs your lungs or they'll die. You're taken to a hospital where your bodies are connected. You are now breathing for two people. If you disconnect that's &quot;abortion&quot; and it's illegal.</description>

			<description>As if to prove that billionaires can be putzes too, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/jeff-bezos-this-is-what-you-are-going-to-regret-at-80.html&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos says&lt;/a&gt; the same old boring shit about what you'll regret when you're 80. I mean how could he know. If he asked 80-year-olds there's a pretty good chance they lie to him, I expect. I wouldn't trust them. Here's what I think, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1545431247417139200&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what you'll regret at 80 -- that you aren't 20. Heh. And btw it's because sex is great at 20. So if you're 20 you should do a lot of that. At least it'll make you smile when you're 80 (I imagine).</description>

			<description>Every time I hear someone talk about podcasting in such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardberryuk/status/1545385842956550145&quot;&gt;mainstream way&lt;/a&gt; I feel a sense of accomplishment. Podcasting made a difference. It worked. The thing that really gives me pride is that it can serve as an example to young developers that their work can make a difference, and it isn't all about making huge piles of money, and you don't have to work for a big corporation, if you think creatively and seek out others with a similar perspective.</description>

It &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/07/twitterNotePresents.png&quot;&gt;presents&lt;/a&gt; as a link to an off-site story. When you click the link, it takes you to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/notes/1544501177814880256&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on twitter.com, where you can read the story, which is limited to 2500 words (a lot). It can include images and embedded tweets and links to offsite pages. The author uses some bold and italic styling. A story has a title. All this is good. Are there limits on what you can link to? Impossible to say. The link to the note also includes a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/notes&quot;&gt;howto page&lt;/a&gt; for Twitter Write, which presumably is the tool you use to write a Twitter Note. You can edit a note after posting it, unlike a tweet. They say they are still developing it. I highly recommend a different user interface on the Twitter timeline, that they present a note analogously to how they present an image, video, audio chat, etc -- that is, inline. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;mockup&lt;/a&gt; of how this would work in 2015. The way they present it now, i think most users will see the links to notes as they see all other links, not worth the trouble. By putting it inline, they start reading, and when they want more, they just click the more link. There's great prior art for this -- Facebook. It works there, it would work great on Twitter.</description>

			<description>BTW -- to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterDev&quot;&gt;TwitterDev&lt;/a&gt; -- is there an API for Notes? This is a crucial question. If yes, then devs will be able to hook great editorial tools to Twitter in ways no one has been able to do before. It will open so many doors not just for Twitter, but for the entire net.</description>

			<description>The other day I replied to a tweet by a famous  columnist and even though the trolls couldn't reply, a  number of them did QT it with the usual boring crap. Then I remembered I had turned Twitter's quality filter off. I turned it on and they went away. Poof. As if they never existed.</description>

			<title>Cars now rate their drivers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My Model Y thinks I'm a 94.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got a 94 from my car, presumably out of 100. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I lost points for &quot;unsafe following,&quot; something I abhor, but I guess I must &lt;i&gt;occasionally&lt;/i&gt; actually do, lesson learned, I'll try to do better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I contest the hit for &quot;hard braking.&quot; I know &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/05/14.html#a142227&quot;&gt;exactly when that I happened&lt;/a&gt;. I had driven to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia,_New_York&quot;&gt;Phoenicia&lt;/a&gt; to pick up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/brios-pizzeria-and-restaurant-phoenicia&quot;&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://brios.net/&quot;&gt;Brio's&lt;/a&gt; and on the drive home, I had to hit the brakes, hard -- to avoid killing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=wild+turkey+on+the+road&quot;&gt;wild turkey&lt;/a&gt; who was slowly making its way across the highway. The pizza went flying, along with a fair amount of sauce and cheese, soiling the carpet in front of the passenger seat on my almost new Model Y, which is scary for a new car, for fear it'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/30/152537.html?title=howToFightMiceInCars&quot;&gt;attract rodents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I digress. I hit the brakes to save the turkey. And now I learn because of that fukcing turkey, no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-fsd-beta-1-million-drivers/&quot;&gt;Full Self Driving beta&lt;/a&gt; for Uncle Davey. Oy.

			<description>I was out and about this morning running errands and everywhere I went I was the only one wearing a mask. I wanted to ask people if they thought Covid was over, but of course I didn't. I got a few stares which I interpreted to mean they felt judged by me. True. And I by them.</description>

			<title>Protest is pointless unless...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Another post that came straight from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1543959036571312128&quot;&gt;twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/04/democrats-fear-own-voters&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; a different way.  We as citizens have been protesting.  That's wrong. We must be demanding.  Look where protesting got us.  Our politicians, both parties, have forgotten they are responsible to us.  Or more appropriately, we have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like going to the doctor, and they say okay we have to switch strategies from preventing to mitigating.   In other words you now have the disease we've been trying to prevent.  In Ohio they have a law that makes abortion illegal, now. Not in the future. Today. July 4, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, we have the disease.   We waited too long.  We didn't listen to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I look at what's happening in Ukraine, the Russians destroying cities just for the hell of it.  How far are we from having that happen everywhere?  How far from having it happen here?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But wait, it's even worse than that.  They are preventing Ukraine's wheat from reaching the world. We will see the results of that soon.  So it's not just Ukraine that they're destroying.   Now come on connect the dots.  Trump is Russia. The Repubs are Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the nightmare. The police are Russia too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're funding our enemy right now. Arming them. Giving them everything they ask for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The nightmare is that an awful lot of our military thinks Trump was just right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we protest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Protest is pointless unless it leads to something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when all the rivers in NY were polluted. When every apartment building had a furnace where they burned all the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember walking to school in second grade, scrubbed clean by my mother, with soot falling in my hair and on my clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then we decided this was no way to live, and we cleaned up our act. We stopped dumping waste into the rivers and air.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point is when we decide to fix something we can.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I work fast. My outlines are snapshots of what I'm doing in projects on a day by day basis.  Others are about communicating with others (reviewers, testers).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up the ladder are blog posts. Those are indexed by my outline indexer, daytona. And of course google et al, which care less and less about my public writing, so fuck em.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally is the book I've never written which will be a concordance of all the blog writing, w the most intelligent and witty parts up front. If you come up with software for that, I'm a customer. And I don't say that sarcastically, I bet google could do it, if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I forgot to mention twitter which is for public communication of early drafts of stuff that will go on my blog after i've written it here 5 or 10 times. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I've given up on posting serious shit on FB. Friends I care about post snarky jokes on serious stuff, and that's not fun. FB is for fun only not thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The problem with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization&quot;&gt;Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; is that while the Constitution doesn’t specifically name abortion as a right, in order to implement a ban on abortion a state will have to violate all kinds of other rights that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; specifically mentioned in the US Constitution and probably the state constitution as well.</description>

We're at those one of those moments when things change radically and those are the best times to check in with some ideas of what needs changing, because &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can change things too when the world is falling apart if you keep your head from exploding. I tell you why and I even tell you what to change! 1. Shut down the Supreme Court. 2. Do away with the fillibuster, the Electoral College and the Senate. 3. Then reinstate the court with more justices and term limits of say 10 years. At that point we will actually have representative government and fewer stale old hacks on the court nursing their grievances and taking it out on us.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1542798905661956097&quot;&gt;Will we&lt;/a&gt; come to despise Christianity in the US? I ask this question because up to this last week I felt that Christianity was other people’s problem, not mine. But they’ve captured the Supreme Court, and they’re using it to force their religion on the rest of us. So it’s no longer something that I can be neutral about. It seems that eventually, maybe very soon, we will come to hate Christianity.</description>

			<title>Joe Biden's failure</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1521551422931845123&quot;&gt;Joe Biden said&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet on May 3, the day after the Dobbs decision leaked in advance of its release this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We will be ready when any ruling is issued.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had 58 days to stop the attack. To have a powow with the court, and ask if they really planned to issue such a decision and when they said yes, shut it down before they had the chance to make it official. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't react to an attack on Pearl Harbor. If you know it's coming, you stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look what happened instead. They got to announce that ruling and a half-dozen others, all that are head shots to American democracy. Now Biden, as president, is occupying an office with no power.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1543051727569657861&quot;&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt;, Clinton and now Biden have stood by and watched while the Repubs went deeper and deeper, cutting every artery of our system, and they still act as if this all is business as usual. Could they be that stupid or cowardly or are they just actors. My guess is that we're the ones who have been duped, and after all they are just actors and know exactly what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
