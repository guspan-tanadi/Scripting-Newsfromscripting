			<description>If the Knicks end up losing, the moment their fate was decided was when they gave Julius Randle the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/2021/05/26/julius-randle-son-surprises-him-most-improved-player-award&quot;&gt;Most Improved Player&lt;/a&gt; award. Just before the first game of the playoff series. Who decided that timing? Tempting fate. God'll always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpSw5tREOxQ&quot;&gt;get you for that&lt;/a&gt;. If I were advising Randle, I'd urge him to throw the award into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripsavvy.com/how-to-walk-across-the-williamsburg-bridge-nyc-4158670&quot;&gt;East River&lt;/a&gt; before Game 5.</description>

			<description>I listened to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/spike-lee-on-the-knicks-resurgence/id1050430296?i=1000523437231&quot;&gt;New Yorker interview with Spike Lee&lt;/a&gt; about this year's Knicks. There was a surprise, he didn't watch the NBA bubble last year. I didn't either. It was too sad. The NBA now, finally, is back. And having the Knicks do so well this year, and it being the immediate post-pandemic season, it's like both happened at the same time and one was the cause and the other was the effect, though it's impossible to say which is which. I would like to hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee&quot;&gt;Spike Lee&lt;/a&gt; ramble about the Knicks, for an hour or so, or really as long as he wants.</description>

			<title>My new profile picture</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I guess &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; is finishing up the edit of the interview we did a couple of weeks ago. He asked for a profile picture, I didn't have a good one, so I took this selfie yesterday. He wanted me to smile. This is something that usually I have trouble with in pictures, I get self-conscious, my smiles look phony -- because they are. I am not happy being photographed, I feel trapped.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Guy and I have been friends for a long time, and we were close in a very important time, around the launch of the Macintosh in 1984. If I didn't know Guy, I never would have gotten an early machine. The Mac was the perfect platform for our &quot;idea processor&quot; -- it attracted just the kind of people who would understand outliners. People who think, organize, analyze, do things. And Apple needed our software, Guy could see that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, the Mac was set to explode and we had had enough time to create a killer outliner for the Mac, and as they say, the rest is history. So I thought of how much I value our friendship as I was taking the picture, and the smile came naturally, all on its own. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My profile pic for Guy's podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Guy used to call me Beeeeg Stuffff. He has a very &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles&quot;&gt;LA&lt;/a&gt; way of speaking. I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/beeegStuff.m4a&quot;&gt;imitate&lt;/a&gt; him saying it. That's what actually put the smile on my face, the same smile is there right now. Instead of saying Cheese, I said Beeeeg Stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Many of the nicknames people have for me are about my bigness. For example, Mike Boich and Dave Jacobs call me El Grand√®. I like that one too, because has adds a Latin accent to my grandiosity.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/30/heyBeegStuff.m4a&quot;&gt;imitation of Guy&lt;/a&gt;, a slight variant on Beeg Stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How tech comes into existence</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's so important to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/coding-is-not-fun-it-s-technically-and-ethically-complex&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; the public perception of &quot;coding&quot; because it's needed if we're going to have good communication about issues in all the software and networking systems our world is built on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think about the pandemic doctors we got to know in the last year. Networking technology is just as complex and evolving as theirs is. And we haven't even sorted out who to go to to get the scoop. Consequently, there's so much awful journalism about tech. It has always been thus, in my entire 40-plus year career in tech. It isn't getting better, and the push to create millions of &quot;coders&quot; is going in the wrong direction. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't worked inside a company in a long time, but I imagine the problem is bad there too. And within my communities, many people don't understand why all the bugs don't disappear at once. Or why I made the software do something they don't like. Because they don't see a process. How can you blame them, even if they were here with me, all they would see is someone typing at a keyboard, going for walks, hanging out. How that turns into functionality, they don't even know that it does turn into functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember a lot of the gestalts when I was learning how to develop software initially. And I was a student of this stuff, getting an advanced degree. Most people have a much more casual relationship with tech. That's okay, but some people *have* to understand to be able to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A famous NYT columnist once said something I made just blinked into existence through the magic of the internet. This person makes a lot of money. His books sell in the millions. He interviews heads of states and CEOs, but there is no one he listens to who will tell him when he garbles the most basic idea of how tech comes into existence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want people to understand how it really works. Right now we're in a dangerous situation where few people have a good picture, and they aren't the people we listen to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1398639564466671626&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>That said, I like the two products that are trying to get together on this basis, and I like that they are interested in interop and willing to work for it, and compromise. That's really the most important thing. It's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/index.opml#1497798753000&quot;&gt;first item&lt;/a&gt; in my Rules for Standards-Makers faq. So if they proceed with Markdown as the basis for interop, I hope at least one of them doesn't stop there, and we can build on the capabilities of outliners and add-ons that already interop based on OPML. I think ultimately more will be possible with OPML, and I'm happy that they're working for interop.</description>

			<description>I had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; this morning. There was only twelve minutes of MRI'ing, but I swore to myself next time I'd rather die than do this again. It's weird. I know I'll forget that eventually, I did last time (it was worse than today's).  It was broken into 5 separate exposures of different lengths. I tried various ways to keep my mind occupied. First, I counted all the states, first going around the edge of the country then looping through the interior. The second time I did it again. Next time I tried counting my breaths, but eventually lost interest. All the time I'm having bouts of freaking out from claustrophobia. I thought &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; thoughts. All the while it felt like the MRI was pulling me in, even though the operator told me that was just an illusion. But, by the last segment I figured out what to do. I reviewed the code in the project I'm working on now. I realized I had a great map of it memorized, and walked through all the bits I could remember, like the states, just to see how much I could find up there in my brain. My brain is a tool for thought, I realized, and tried not to laugh. It kept me entertained. I'm passing this along as a lifehack for programmers, or other designers and developers.</description>

			<description>Up for discussion, using Markdown as an outline interchange format. First, my outliners will support it if it gains traction. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/roamhacker/a615a1b2e83d79853b3cc40c9e0f3494/raw/a3d8ea783a0073555dd19f0f543a0c8d0ce4cce5/Logseq%2520Markdown%2520exammple%2520for%2520DW.md&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. Comments follow. Markdown is good for what it was designed to do, to be a simple alternative to HTML. You could send someone an email in Markdown, and they wouldn't have a clue that it was also something a piece of software could turn into a decent web page. I like Markdown for appropriate uses. I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+facebook+markdown&quot;&gt;urging Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to support Markdown so that their posts could have simple styling and links. But is it useful as an interchange format for outlines? Outlines can have attributes attached at any node, and this is something that Markdown can't handle without being extended, and it's questionable whether Markdown can be updated. Further if you start adding technical stuff to Markdown, it stops fulfilling its mission to be human readable. But as I said, I'm not picky, if it becomes popular I'll support it. What do I like for outline interchange? OPML, of course. That's what it was designed for, and it works. I wouldn't mind if we used a JSONified OPML, it's easy to go back and forth between XML and JSON (they're really the same thing, actually). For more information see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; I put together for devs supporting OPML in their outline-processing software</description>

			<description>A bike safety idea. I noticed on my ride yesterday, a very nice day, in the week before Memorial Day, so lots of city folk are around, and they're out for a walk, in groups of 2 to 8 on the same roads I ride my bike on. They often occupy all the space, and move around a lot so it's impossible to know where I can safely go to get by them. I'm sure if I hit them they would get hurt, but unlike a car, I would get just as hurt. And I don't make much noise, so maybe they don't even hear me. I noticed that when a car approaches they get out of the way, presumably because 1. They can hear the car and 2. They know they'd get hurt and the car driver would just get a ticket, if that. I get a lot of thinking done while I ride, and I came up with a potential solution. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Micro-Bluetooth-Speaker-Waterproof/dp/B07VSPPQXC/ref=asc_df_B07VSPPQXC/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=416694489735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16093003404928166045&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-936549499154&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=94693386915&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=416694489735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16093003404928166045&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-936549499154&quot;&gt;great little speaker&lt;/a&gt; mounted on my handlebar. It's small but it produces a lot of sound. What if, as I was approaching a group of such people, I switched the sound to that of an accelerating car, headed straight for them. It would be fun to watch them scatter! It would be a valuable teaching experience and it would get them out of my way, quickly. I would get the same respect a car gets. I really like the idea. All I'd need to try it out is a recording of an approaching car to play on my iPhone.</description>

All I'd need to try it out is a recording of an approaching car to play on my iPhone." created="Wed, 26 May 2021 12:54:55 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/26/tribitSpeaker.png" imageLink="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Micro-Bluetooth-Speaker-Waterproof/dp/B07VSPPQXC/ref=asc_df_B07VSPPQXC/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=416694489735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16093003404928166045&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-936549499154&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=94693386915&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=416694489735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16093003404928166045&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-936549499154" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/05/26.html#a125455"/>

			<description>I went to a local supermarket today where most of the store personnel were not wearing masks. I asked about it, and was told because they had been vaccinated they didn't have to wear them. I kept my mask on. I would have liked to have not worn the mask, but I think we should have kept wearing masks, until the pandemic is squashed in most of the world. It isn't yet. I'd prefer to err on the side of caution, but I guess we've decided it's over and that's it. But what if it isn't over?</description>

			<title>Our leaders lack the will</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joetrippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi's&lt;/a&gt; podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wapos-greg-sargent-on-gops-demise-and-future/id1523896927?i=1000523008931&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. An interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/greg-sargent/&quot;&gt;Greg Sargent&lt;/a&gt; of the Washington Post, who I read and think is smart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trippi said what's obvious -- we're pretty fucked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He didn't say this part: At this moment we're not out of options. But they all require doing something that will provoke the ire of Trumpkins. So far the Democrats have not wanted to provoke them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is when Democrats throw their hands in the air and give up. It's what they do on cable news, it's what they do in editorial board meetings at the great news orgs (when they're not fussing over who's woke enough to remain).  It's what Democratic incumbents do. It's what instant pundits on Twitter do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What to do? I give up!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the common thread:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. We're &lt;i&gt;soooo&lt;/i&gt; fucked.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. What can we do? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;3. Throw hands in the air. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;4. Give up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Upsetting the Trumpians is inevitable and if done at the right time, probably survivable. It's better to provoke them now rather than later. Now we have a rule of law government. If you let things run their course, when it happens a Trump will run the government. Nothing you or I do or say will matter. If you make too much of a stink you'll go to jail, or worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a sad situation, where the people with a voice correctly parse the situation and then give up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maddow did the same thing last night. Here's the problem, she spends 20 minutes prepping us. Then: what do we do? She may have an idea, but she doesn't say. Totally useless. Get out of the way. Time to say the truth or resign. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The truth: The civil war is not just inevitable, it's here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>George Floyd, America and slavery</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts about George Floyd, America and slavery&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He was killed the way disobedient slaves were killed.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of course&lt;/i&gt; if he were white he would not have been killed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There have been other black people killed by police, recorded in video and shared on the web. Those were relatively instantaneous acts. George Floyd's murder was deliberate. It could have been stopped any time during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/29/us/george-floyd-timing-929-846/index.html&quot;&gt;nine minutes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's hard to imagine in words what might have been going on in the head of the murderer. What did he think was going to happen? In his mind what was his relationship with Floyd? Did he see him as human or property? Did he think there would be consequences?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a good American education, and read a fair amount of history as a child. I was fascinated with it, but until last year I had never read a first person account of slavery. Just facts. Dates. Politics. The war. Reconstruction. Jim Crow. Voting rights. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Our official American history treated our black ancestors the same way slavery did, as property. They didn't have a voice. Their story remains largely untold.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;America is  built on slavery the same way Windows is built on DOS. We never removed it from our operating system. The code is running every time America does something. It's part of our implementation. Some corrections have been put in place in an attempt to route around the most egregious wrongs of slavery, but those changes can be reverted and they are, right now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Being responsible is not the same thing as &quot;being the cause of.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I am a first-generation American, a child of people who fled Europe for their lives during WWII and found safe haven in the United States. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your ancestors could have been living their own injustices, as mine were, but you and I now live in the United States, where the crimes (not a strong enough word) against Native Americans and African Americans are deeply ingrained. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;By coming to America, we became part of a culture and political system that was built on slavery. We haven't yet shaken that off. The George Floyd murder is the most graphic evidence most of us have seen that slavery is very much still with us. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We are responsible, in the sense that it is up to us to respond.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, if you haven't listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html&quot;&gt;1619 project podcast&lt;/a&gt;, it's an easy way to quickly get a different perspective on America. There's a pretty good chance that you, like me, have not heard this story yet. Which is of course ridiculous. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think that everything we do to try to get out of the slavery system is doomed to fail until everyone understands the history. We have to teach it in the schools to people of all races. This is America, your country. Here are the problems you will have to deal with when you grow up, so you might as well learn about them now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My project for last week and this week was to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; running in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; so it can be a desktop app in addition to a web app. I just hit a milestone -- I can now create and open files, and it remembers what tabs were open and when you restart they automatically re-open. The idea, as always, is to create a layer below which there are differences between the app that runs over the net, ie your files are stored on a server in the cloud, and the one that runs on the desktop, where the files are on your local system. For my most important writing, I prefer to use the Electron version. So hopefully by the end of the week I will be able to switch from the Electron app I've been using for the last four years, to the new Drummer-based system, which is much cooler, more &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;-like.</description>

			<description>Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/05/22/nets-shake-off-rust-and-then-cruise-to-game-1-win-over-celtics/&quot;&gt;Nets game&lt;/a&gt; last night, I felt sad for the Celtics, which is a milestone because I generally hate the Celtics, but I hate the Nets so much more. They filled Barclay's with fans. Where did they come from? Every city has fair-weather-fans, New York is no exception. The Yankees fans who root for the Mets when they're in the World Series, for example. Mets fans root against the Yankees no matter what. We &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the Red Sox, because they torment the Yankees. These New Yorkers like that three carpetbaggers, KD, Kyrie and Harden decided they wanted to own an NBA team, and Brooklyn was available. This has nothing to do with New York, or even the Nets. It's just three players in the prime of their careers, all headed for the Hall of Fame, and all of them total fucking assholes. Which usually isn't a bad thing in NY, except that the Knicks are the team we actually love, and they're rising to the occasion. Their series with Atlanta, which starts tonight at the Garden, is probably going to turn out to be much better basketball than the coming rout by the top-seeded Nets of the low-seeded Celtics.</description>

			<description>Brad Silverberg, who I was just thinking about, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bradsilverberg/status/1396451375538651137&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on a subject I was getting ready to write about, in response to something &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1396445625911291904&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen tweeted&lt;/a&gt; earlier. The question is does any news about Matt Gaetz really matter? He's a nobody. Obviously he did a lot of awful things, and he should be expelled from Congress, for that, and for voting to overturn a legal election (the latter being more in line with the news I care about). Same with Marjorie Three Names (a term coined by Silverberg). That they are tolerated by Repubs is news, but not super important. What matters is why aren't we actively trying to head off the looming permanent hijacking of American democracy? Why are our news channels content in reporting the points on the curve instead of the curve itself. When the 2022 election comes and the Repubs take over the House, then, when it is too late, will they report on how the next presidential election is meaningless because the Republican House will never let the election stand, if the Republican candidate should lose. That Democrats will never win another election. Whose fault will it be when it's too late? We have an incredible chance right now to get ahead of the history that the Repubs are trying to write. Why are we giving up? Maybe the people who can't watch the news as we drive off the cliff, are right?</description>

			<title>Tools for thought</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tools+for+thought%22&quot;&gt;Tools for thought&lt;/a&gt;. That's what the new category, with outliners at the core, is called. I endorse the name. It's a good one. Our first product at &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Living Videotext%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt;, shipped in 1983, was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ThinkTank%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt;. Pour your your thinking into the outline structure, and then as time goes by reorganize the outline to reflect what's happened with these ideas. Right off the bat, that's a different use-case from the ones used by the TFT people. There are others.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our first ads had a big title: See what you think. We sold to people who understood &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; they think, were self-aware enough to have ideas about &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they think, and were interested in tools that could make their thinking more powerful, as a spreadsheet makes financial planners more powerful. Or a database makes running a business less expensive and more personal. We applied the power of a personal computer to the act of thinking. And it worked!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/personal-computers-software-first-idea-processor.html&quot;&gt;first review&lt;/a&gt; of ThinkTank -- ever. In the NYT, in 1983. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/02/18/uglyThinkTankAd.jpg&quot;&gt;back cover&lt;/a&gt; of the first commercial release in ThinkTank, the one that was reviewed in the NYT.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's weird for me, because I'm sure I come off as arrogant, a know-it-all, but the truth is that I've been far down the road these young people are just starting down. I believe I know how a lot of this turns out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the TFT thought leaders last night compared this stuff to the beginning of blogging, something I also know a lot about. If he knew the truth it would blow him away. The first blogging tools &lt;i&gt;were outliners,&lt;/i&gt; because that's what I use to write. And I still think that blogging and outlining are basically the same thing. I'm using my outliner right now to write this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway there's so much more to say. I'm glad to have the opportunity. And I want to be clear, I want to help the young folk. I want to make sure we don't lose all the progress that's already in the bank. I want the interfaces to be open, simple, steady, efficient and most important, compatible. Creating 18 different silos will waste decades of future development. It's still very early and the interfaces mostly don't exist, so it's not too late to make this more like the blogging world and less like Facebook (more likely a dozen Facebooks, btw).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The three basic components that make up the TFT world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Outliners, of course. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Databases which store the outlines, and maybe do discovery on what's stored there, and &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Renderers which view the outliner as an authoring tool, and produce a visualization of an outline or a section of an outline, as a bullet chart (presentation), tree chart or the display that the VCs love, the connected graph where you can zoom in on stuff and the blocks re-arrange. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there are other views of this world. Outlines are great structures for programming! Python started off in that direction, but stopped before they got to the good stuff imho. We went much futher with &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. We also used the outliner to manage the object database and user interface structures. You used the same outliner to browse through the data kept by the runtime kernel. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But, even that's just the beginning. Something I haven't seen explored in any of the TFT products is the idea of an outline as a file system. With the outlines being a permanent container for all kinds of work. File systems are of course outlines. Instead of the mediocre tools for managing file systems on the major OSes, why not have a great one! That was the idea behind ThinkTank and its successors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How do you know this is right? Pop up and look at the structures in your computer and on the net. They are all outlines. So if you're thinking of an outline as an inherently small thing, you're not seeing the full picture. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm aware that this could come off as arrogant. But what do you do when a group of brilliant young visionaries discover what you discovered when you were one of them, in the mid 1970s, and spent the rest of your career exploring and developing, while the rest of the computer world pretty much ignored you? First you celebrate! It's not a lost cause after all. Then you ask yourself as I am, how do you approach this. What I've decided so far is that I am going to continue to develop &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm going to push in every way for zero lock-in, user choice everywhere, and clean simple and extensible APIs for each of the components. And of course I will be writing all through this process, as long as I can, because that's the other thing I do -- blog. Not only do I create the software for this stuff, I create it for myself because this is how I think, it's why I knew to develop this stuff in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you want an idea of what it's like to use an outliner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;here's my latest&lt;/a&gt;. It's free to use. Hope you like. ;-) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If you're a developer of outliners, databases or renderers, or simply want to explore the data format of outlines, I recommend taking a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, which was designed specifically for interop between outline producers and consumers. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; for supporting OPML with examples, source code and advice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="But, even that's just the beginning. Something I haven't seen explored in any of the TFT products is the idea of an outline as a file system. With the outlines being a permanent container for all kinds of work. File systems are of course outlines. Instead of the mediocre tools for managing file systems on the major OSes, why not have a great one! That was the idea behind ThinkTank and its successors." created="Sun, 23 May 2021 14:01:39 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought#a140139"/>
				<source:outline text="How do you know this is right? Pop up and look at the structures in your computer and on the net. They are all outlines.

				<source:outline text="Again, I'm aware that this could come off as arrogant. But what do you do when a group of brilliant young visionaries discover what you discovered when you were one of them, in the mid 1970s, and spent the rest of your career exploring and developing, while the rest of the computer world pretty much ignored you? First you celebrate! It's not a lost cause after all. Then you ask yourself as I am, how do you approach this. What I've decided so far is that I am going to continue to develop &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm going to push in every way for zero lock-in, user choice everywhere, and clean simple and extensible APIs for each of the components. And of course I will be writing all through this process, as long as I can, because that's the other thing I do -- blog. Not only do I create the software for this stuff, I create it for myself because this is how I think, it's why I knew to develop this stuff in the first place." created="Sun, 23 May 2021 13:50:06 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought#a135006"/>

			<description>I test drove a Tesla &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/model3&quot;&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt; today. Very nice car. So powerful. And while it was hard for me to get in and out of the car, once I was in there was plenty of head room. I also surprised myself and let it drive for a bit. It was pretty scary. I'm a horrible passenger and back-seat driver. But it seems to work pretty well.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/209#issuecomment-846001467&quot;&gt;Now I have another question&lt;/a&gt;. In Chrome, when I make a change in some code, sometimes just reloading the page doesn't cause the changes to load. There is a way to force it to do so. 1. Open the JavaScript console. 2. In the browser toolbar, hold down the mouse button while clicking on the Reload icon. A menu pops up, offering you a chance to &quot;Hard reload&quot; the page. The single keystroke for this is Cmd-Shift-R (on the Mac at least). How do you do this in Electron? I've been trying to use a cache confuser to the &amp;lt;script&gt; element, but that doesn't always work. I need a reliable way to make sure new versions of code are loaded. It's pretty hard to debug if you can't quickly make changes.</description>

			<description>In all the years I've been online and been a developer of outliners, I have never participated in a discussion of the design of outliners, from a UX standpoint. This seems to be happening on Twitter now. I'm going to keep readers of the blog in the loop. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1395632868035121156&quot;&gt;Latest question&lt;/a&gt; -- what to do when the user presses the Return key. Here's how &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; does it. If the cursor headline has expanded subs, then the new headline is the new first sub. If the cursor head has no subs or they aren‚Äôt expanded, it is the next sibling. It doesn't matter which mode you're in, structure or text, the behavior is the same. The Return key is too important to have multiple meanings. It always creates a new headline. BTW, LO2 works the same way ThinkTank, MORE, Ready, Frontier, the OPML Editor all work(ed). Once we had these questions sorted out, we kept the functionality consistent. Some things have evolved over time, for example the wedges are relatively new, earlier outliners had two leaders, a plus, indicating that the headline has subs, and a minus, indicating it has no subs. But the wedges are more expressive. They tell you whether there is unexpanded material underneath (the wedge is black) or not (it's gray). So it's easy to scan to see where there might be hidden structure.</description>

			<description>BTW, I call it the Return key, but on my keyboard it says Enter. This is to distinguish it from the other Enter key, usually along the right edge of the keyboard, near the numeric keypad if the keyboard has one. That one we reserve for a different function, it's the keyboard method for switching between text and structure mode.</description>

			<description>The memory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22google+reader%22&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; may have faded so much that Google appears ready to try again. Even the headline of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/undead-again-google-brings-back-rss/amp/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch article&lt;/a&gt; is disturbing. Google did so much damage to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, the thought of them &quot;reviving&quot; it is analogous to Exxon reviving the site of some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfund&quot;&gt;huge oil spill&lt;/a&gt;, one that they didn't contribute to cleaning up. Even worse, browser vendors have no place trying to provide the user interface for RSS. Another toxic dump site. If Google wants to help RSS, great -- here's how. Do the subscribe button, that's a good thing. But the result should be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/15/feedReaderDevs&quot;&gt;dynamic OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt;, that the user can provide to any reader app they want. It's dynamic in that the contents can change, and the readers should periodically check to see if feeds have been added or removed. This way, if someday Google abandons RSS, again, everything can keep on ticking, more or less. Inviting users to rely on them shows that they have no sense of responsibility for the trust they betrayed in the past. Perhaps users can refuse to go on this ride? That might be too much to hope for. And TechCrunch, they're hopeless, have been for a long time.</description>
