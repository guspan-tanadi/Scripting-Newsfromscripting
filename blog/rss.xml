			<description>I'm spending a couple of days &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/7&quot;&gt;baking&lt;/a&gt; GitHub into &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; via scripting. We used to call this a &quot;scriptable app&quot; on the Mac, when apps were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker&quot;&gt;Filemaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress&quot;&gt;Quark Xpress&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)&quot;&gt;Finder&lt;/a&gt;, stuff like that. Then when &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; moved to the web, the apps were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&quot;&gt;MSIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHTTP&quot;&gt;MacHTTP&lt;/a&gt;, then Google and &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, then WordPress and Twitter. Along the way came new protocols -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. Drummer already has excellent scripting support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=twitter.addGroupToList&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I made this a priority to have one really good scriptable app when Drummer came out. Now I'm working on the second biggie. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a143815&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that GitHub could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS&quot;&gt;MS-DOS&lt;/a&gt;. What I meant is that it's basic low-cost storage for everyone with a GitHub account that's about as easy to work with as MS-DOS was. For early adopters, what we used to call power users. It's an amazing resource. And that made me think of MS-DOS because both are owned by Microsoft and storage is basically what MS-DOS did, and btw, MS-DOS is the one product they didn't use as a weapon when they were trying to usurp the web, so it has a nice taste to it, still. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/7&quot;&gt;started a thread&lt;/a&gt;, on GitHub of course, narrating what I've got working. Watch this space.</description>

			<description>I put about twenty &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty&quot;&gt;Tom Petty&lt;/a&gt; songs on my iPhone and have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmFxgEGKH0&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; on and off. The thing about Tom Petty is his songs are the kind that you sing in your head all the time days and days awake or in dreams. To have twenty Petty tunes co-resident means you're living the Tom Petty lifestyle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMyCa35_mOg&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt; for it to pass, but kind of hoping it doesn't. It's kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling&quot;&gt;Rickrolling&lt;/a&gt; but with really good music.</description>

			<description>I just heard that a longtime friend and fellow outliner Scott Love has died. Oy. I knew Scott when he was our chief product marketer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; back in the 80s. He was part of the team that shipped ThinkTank, Ready and MORE. When we sold to Symantec, Scott went to NeXT where he was on the rollout team for their product. His heart was in outliners. He went on to start Aquaminds, which he explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Love&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt; on Quora. Scott was a brilliant creative funny friendly and vulnerable human. He put his heart into everything he did. His boss, before he worked for me, Alfred Mandel, called him Nudgie. When I heard that I started using that name for him too, until I realized it might not be the nicest thing. Recently Scott and I reconnected on Twitter. In a private exchange he said he liked the name. I'm sorry his life was so short. His enthusiasm and big heart and super active mind will be missed.</description>

			<description>Scott and I had dinner many times, and often traveled together on business. We always joked about how we were going to take on the then-dominant tech company IBM. It was either Boca or Bucha, which was short for Bucharest, where we were surely headed if we failed to defeat the mighty IBM. We'd talk about catching the red-eye to Bucharest. I don't know why it was then (and still is now) so funny. Bucharest was a pretty awful place at the time, run by an even worse dictator than IBM -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Ceaușescu&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Slavery formed us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm reading two books at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Zookeepers-Wife-War-Story/dp/039333306X&quot;&gt;The Zookeeper's Wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin&quot;&gt;Uncle Tom's Cabin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One about the Holocaust, the other about slavery. The pairing has me thinking about the differences. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been the year for me of reading about slavery. It has really been an eye-opening experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One observation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; was unthinkably horrible, but it wasn't slavery, the oppressors were trying to anihilate us, not enslave us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was over in five years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism is permanent, but it is not slavery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/15/400-years-since-slavery-timeline&quot;&gt;lasted&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;400 years&lt;/a&gt;, and imho it isn't over yet. It had a chance to form the whole culture of not just the US as some of our European friends sometimes imply, all white people everywhere are indicted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other differences, but the thing most Americans don't get is that slavery is deeply rooted and it isn't over yet. And if we want it to be over, it's going to require a near-universal conscious decision to end it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Anton &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/105#issuecomment-962507805&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; why don't the outlines rendered through PagePark support the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml&quot;&gt;Instant Outlines&lt;/a&gt; feature that Drummer and Concord Reader support.  There was no good answer, so I made it work.

			<title>Debugging http.client</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/6#issuecomment-962586664&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.client&quot;&gt;http.client&lt;/a&gt; does headers, and at first I said no, but then when I dug in, I realized yes, it does, for non-proxied calls, and with a simple addiiton it should work with proxied calls as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made the change in the released web Drummer, so theoretically it should work now. I don't have something immediately available to test with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're expecting to do HTTP-related programming from Drummer, this is something you should pay attention and if possible participate in. This is an important verb, and it's important to get it right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>JavaScript in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/?tab=blog&quot;&gt;Gary Teter&lt;/a&gt;, whose name I recognize from the Frontier community, I think -- has been writing eloquently about JavaScript and Drummer. I'm learning a lot reading how the product reflects off his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I agree totally about the potential for JavaScript which is being wasted by the way the language is being driven. We should be trying to coalesce it, not drive it apart into a bunch of incompatible languages. Reminds me of something &lt;a href=&quot;https://rms2.tumblr.com/post/35571080444/andrew-singer&quot;&gt;Andrew Singer&lt;/a&gt; who started Think Technologies (a company that should be remembered btw) -- in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have another chance to coalesce JavaScript. Drummer's language, which Gary has a name for btw, one that I like, removes the one imho sin of JavaScript that keeps it from being a scripting language. And I'm trying to hone a broad verb set, and writing good docs for them, and just in general slowing down and getting it right, looking at prior art, and not deprecting things that matter (like &lt;i&gt;request&lt;/i&gt; in Node.js, what a terrible idea!). It's all been very mindless. But JavaScript's universality is as important as say RSS's. It should be focused and developed. Yes, I am that ambitious for the language in Drummer which may soon have a name. 😇&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Poets and plumbers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, when podcasting was new, we talked about &quot;Users and developers party together.&quot; There's some new nomenclature to go with that in The Drummer Era which we are now in. Poets and Plumbers. Users and developers. We're all smart, and love to learn, but in different areas and with different results. We multiply each others' work by learning how they think, what they care about, how they explain things. I've heard devs say that users just don't get how this works, only to realize later that their view is valid, and understanding it was key to creating tools they would love. That they would say &quot;this works like I think.&quot; When a user says that to you, believe me, it's the best feeling ever. An aside, my own father said that to me about ThinkTank. That was a big moment. So listening and trying to understand can produce fantastic results, and it goes both ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The other day &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&quot;&gt;Gruber&lt;/a&gt; read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1453349951665287168&quot;&gt;Infoworld review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1983/05/17/169857.html?pageNumber=51&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1455673711634300930&quot;&gt;wondered&lt;/a&gt; about the &quot;Pascal operating system&quot; they referred to. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pascal.hansotten.com/ucsd-p-system/&quot;&gt;UCSD P-system&lt;/a&gt;. Without it I would not have been able to build an app as rich as ThinkTank that ran on the Apple II. UCSD was an orders of magnitude more memory-efficient than BASIC or assembly language, very important for a machine with just 48K for application code. And the P-system had overlays. Which meant if something didn't have to be in memory all the time, it could be swapped in when needed. Most Apple IIs only had floppy drives in those days, so it was slow and a pain in the ass, but a lot faster than quitting the program, inserting another disk and launching another app just to edit the text of a headline. What I learned as a result of Gruber's inquiry is that the P-system was one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling&quot;&gt;James Gosling's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;inspirations&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I was on a drive yesterday on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike&quot;&gt;Masspike&lt;/a&gt; and stopped in at a truckstop and bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://subway.com/&quot;&gt;Subway&lt;/a&gt; sandwich, paid cash, went to the bathroom, noted that most of the truckers weren't wearing masks and continued my trip back to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;NY State Thruway&lt;/a&gt;. I used to eat Subways a lot when I was driving cross-country back in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;early days of podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, doing my road trip casts. Well here's the funny thing. I got an email today from Subway saying how they're running a special. And I saw an ad for Subway on Facebook. Hello. Did I get made even though I paid cash? Did they have a face recognition camera in the truckstop? Oy. Living in the future kind of sucks.</description>

			<description>Devs, you can have OPML in JSON. We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml?activeTab=readme&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt; that reads OPML files and returns JavaScript structures, among other things. From there, do whatever you want.</description>

			<description>Maybe the way out of our mess is the US is sports. I know there are plenty of Mets fans who love Trump. It's hard to believe. But we are from Queens and so is El Orange. Anyway -- if you love the Mets, I gotta say this -- you can't be totally bad.</description>

			<description>There was a lot of angst in my family when I was growing up. I guess a lot of families have it, but I think we had more than most because before my uncle and myself, we were the first in our family to be born in the US, everyone emigrated, running for their lives from the Nazis, and coming close to not making it. They were all survivors, and had traits of people with severe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, untreated because this was the 60s and 70s, before they even knew such a thing existed in any formal treatable way. Anyway, I must've had a heavy family dream last night because I woke up feeling upset, unsettled, unloved -- all the feelings I knew very well in childhood.</description>

			<title>I ❤️ HTTPS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A user said they were surprised that I encouraged people to use HTTPS with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; blogs, even though I &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;speak out&lt;/a&gt; against Google trying to force HTTPS on the open web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are very different things!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want people to use my software in every way that makes sense, and if you're generating web content, which Drummer most certainly &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;, HTTPS is one of the things people want to do. I support this. Let me say that slowly: I. Support. This.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, I use HTTPS myself. I am glad my bank uses it. And the health clinic I use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I object to is Google trying to take ownership of the web. I love that the web is the platform with no platform vendor. We're all guests here and that includes big companies like Google. And guests don't make the rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know some people run their lives such that they won't work with other people who don't see the world &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; as they do -- but I am not one of those people. Emphatically. I preach working together. It's my mission more than anything else. I am against walls that keep people out. Except with my private info, then I like them. See how that works?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A tools-for-thought challenge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After I've taken notes on what I'm thinking about, how to find:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The things I wrote about. (Where did I say that?)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Patterns in my writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads. I wrote about a topic many times, show them all to me in chronological order.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn't matter where I took all those notes.  Perhaps I used different note-taking apps on my phone, tablet or desktop. Or one year I tried a new note-taking app and then switched back. My ideas are mine, and it's up to me how to use them, and there should be no limits. This is how computers, networks and databases are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be tragic if an area with so much promise became another silo controlled by one or two big companies. It's still so early, we have a chance to make this community work better. Our tools for thought should not be controlled by anyone other than ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example, I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;archive of outlines&lt;/a&gt; going back to mid 2017, one every day, public. They are archived in a GitHub repo. I'd like to see that content in a tools-for-thought database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When we're there, I'll feel like we're really going somewhere..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Apparently the software is a Gatsby plugin. Gatsby is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gatsby-e828&quot;&gt;also&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, based in Berkeley, they have raised $46.8 million. I'm looking for an quick tutorial. I have literally never used it, so i would like to at least be able to talk about it, explain what it is and what this connection means. BTW, our goal is to connect everything with everything with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. Outlines in the middle. We rock! 😀</description>

			<description>The fact that I've never used Gatsby and I'm sure they've never used Drummer (do they use outliners?) says we have to create better connections in tech. I hope that Drummer will do that. Get us looking at each others' work and figuring out how to help our users make our products work better together. I've been motivated in this direction ever since I developed an integrated product in the 80s and the #1 feature request from users was I unbundle the components. They were right. We need interfaces, not behemoths.</description>

			<description>BTW, Scott posted his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/3&quot;&gt;notice&lt;/a&gt; on the Drummer RFC site. It's a place I started for non-support stuff. Perfect for this project. I've found over the years if you mix support and development the users are often intimidated. Each thread has it's place. In a user oriented tool with a deep scripting capability, you always have to be aware &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow&quot;&gt;there are both plumbers and poets in the same space&lt;/span&gt;. That's where the power is. You don't want to keep them separated, but you want to be careful everyone feels empowered to ask questions, get help.</description>

			<description>Working on a server today, I moved the software for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; server that's been running for a few years and remembered there is some nice stuff there. I designed it to answer the question -- what would a blogging system look like if it was created after Facebook and Twitter already existed. There are some good new ideas in both products, and they should influence blogging. I wrote Scripting News in 1999.io for a few years, but in 2017 I realized what I really wanted was what I had in 1997, leading to Old School and eventually Drummer. But 1999.io is still running. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/about/&quot;&gt;positioning document&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Mark my words -- outliners are destined to be in the middle of everything. That‘s why I’ve invested so much in &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, the open format designed for sharing outlines. It's the native file format of &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. We don't need to have another giant Facebook in the middle of everything controlling everyone. Much better if it's distributed. That's what's made possible by open formats.</description>

			<title>The monthly ritual</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first &quot;monthly ritual&quot; I've done since &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; shipped. So I'm going to write down what I did in more detail than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I do my blog writing in Electric Drummer, so all the files are on my local disk. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the finder, I make a copy of my blog.opml file. I move the copy into a special folder for archives. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I open the copy in E/D and delete the portion that's in November (the stuff I'm writing now). Once it's saved, I close the file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I open the GitHub archive for Scripting News in the GitHub desktop app for the Mac, and click the Sync button, to get all the new stuff in the last month on my local disk (the nightly archive of posts in JSON and OPML).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I copy the archive file for October into the local folder for Scripting News on GitHub into the correct location. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the GitHub app, I note the new file shows up in the list of changes. I set the Commit Message to a period (I don't have anything to say about this change) then I commit the change, and sync. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I visit the site on the web to be sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/10.opml&quot;&gt;October's OPML file&lt;/a&gt; is there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Back in E/D, I delete the October branch of my blog.opml file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I click the rebuild icon and pray. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And... it did not work! (Most of the month of October is missing. I figured since this was part of the overhaul there likely would be problems. I will finish this post after I do my debugging.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Back from debugging. The mistake was I wrote theDay.getDay instead of theDay.getDate. The first returns the day of the week (0-6) and the latter returns day of the month (1-31).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the monthly ritual is good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
