			<description>Twitter — ads that lead to the paywall of a publication are mean and stupid. They managed to convince us to buy their product, but they won't sell it to us. It's as if you go to the supermarket and want to buy some apples but they will only sell you a truckload of apples, not one or two.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/twitterdev/getting-to-the-canonical-url-for-a-tweet-85e&quot;&gt;Twitter tip from Andy Piper&lt;/a&gt;. If all you have is the ID of a tweet, how to get its url? If you look at a Twitter url, there's a screenname in there. So how do you find the name of the person who posted tweet whose id is 1574769537244958720. Turns out you don't have to. Make up a name like &lt;i&gt;mamamia, &lt;/i&gt;and form the url like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mamamia/status/1574769537244958720&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It'll find the tweet for you and redirect to the actual users screen name. Nice little hack.</description>

Feedly might be too much for a new feed user. And Substack comes with a lot of news sources already programmed in. If I were in charge of Feedly, I'd do a &quot;lite&quot; product that's free, does everything Substack's reader does, includes all the Substack feeds. And of course the upgrade to the full Feedly would be easy. Substack is going down the same path we went down with Radio UserLand in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/01/11.html&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. It does both reading and writing. That's a big deal.</description>

The testers reported that a button they use all the time all of a sudden doesn't work. Well, not exactly. If you position the mouse in just the right spot, it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; work. So what was special about that spot? An object near the button had an opacity of 0.7, and part of its rectangle extended over the button. In fact it extended over the part of the button that didn't work (ie most of it). That was weird. I tried disabling the opacity just for the hell of it, and now the button works as it used to. Does opacity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=does+opacity+have+side+effects+css&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; side-effects? I never would have imagined it would. But it appears to! I took out the opacity altogether and reported the problem fixed and the testers agree, but I have no idea what happened there. If you have an idea, please reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1573667541477691393&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Maybe Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify. I've become inquisitive about this again.

			<description>Despite what Tim Snyder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TimothyDSnyder/status/1572988432212963329&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the obscenity of what Russia is doing with &quot;referendums&quot; -- on NPR today they reported it straight. You can get them to say anything you want. Russia doesn't even control the territory they're claiming as part of Russia! BTW, I finished the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/21.html#a152255&quot;&gt;Ken Burns&lt;/a&gt; special on the Holocaust and the US. The Nazis did something similar with the press. If the US did something to help Jews, they'd run press releases saying &quot;See, the Jews really do run the world, just like we said!&quot; So the US didn't help Jews. And apparently that's not the whole story. There were Nazis in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breckinridge_Long#FDR_administration_and_World_War_II&quot;&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, at high levels. We also let Nazis emigrate to the US after the war, and turned away Jews -- because the Nazis were anti-Communist. I think we should consider giving back the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I don't like it when people I follow, who are smart and funny and make a contribution, RT their abusive replies. Puts me in a tough position, I can't tell them to stop and I don't want to unfollow them. Really the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; thing to do with people who sent abusive tweets is to downvote them (a new Twitter feature) and then block them. The &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; thing you want to do is promote them. That will just get you more abuse and it stinks up everyone else's timeline.</description>

I always have -- I'm not sure what to do, am I supposed to give them an accounting of my life, here's the good and the bad. If I do that do I have to make my story sound like their story, mostly very good but just a little bad to make it seem real.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm older it's disturbing for other reasons. Who cares whether it's good or bad, nothing is either good or bad, or everything is bad, and everything is good. It's hubris to be in the business of judging good or bad. The universe is billions of years old. Everything you think is good or bad actually is irrelevant. See that's the joke. What you think matters, only matters to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hope all is well&quot; is just a nicety, it doesn't require a response, it isn't competitive -- if you want to expand it -- it means life can be a drag I know but I am thinking good thoughts about you, so at least that is something you don't need to add to your worries. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hope all is well. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's a sitcom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump says that the FBI was really looking for Hillary's emails when they searched Mar A Lago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what they'd say on a sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The person who plays the ex-president, deep in dog-doo -- he'd say something like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This reaffirms my belief that the Trump voter can't tell the difference between a president and a person playing president in a sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure that the anti-Trump voter is all that different, btw -- we seem to like watching the comedy of it. Watch Chris Hayes when he talks about Trump. He's not grim, he's usually laughing, and so are his guests (not all of them, I've never seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ElieNYC&quot;&gt;@elieNYC&lt;/a&gt; laugh at this kind of stuff). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You'll completely recognize what was going on then, because it's exactly what's going on now.  As you watch it, you'll be amazed that Americans didn't get what the Nazis were doing. Amazing story.</description>

I should've had more faith. The Mets won.

I've been watching a lot of Mets baseball. The Mets are breaking a lot of records this year, including being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/hit-by-pitch&quot;&gt;hit by pitches&lt;/a&gt; more than any other team ever (almost). This taught me something important, along with watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-us-and-the-holocaust&quot;&gt;Ken Burns documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the Holocaust and the US (must-watch). I see Trump in Hitler now. Pretty revealing perspective. Now I wonder how my ancestors got here at all, given the antisemitism in the US then, which I can attest to (and provide proof of). You're wasting time watching MSNBC, much better off watching baseball and Ken Burns.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/20/itDoesntMatterWhy.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I've been watching a lot of Mets baseball. The Mets are breaking a lot of records this year, including being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/hit-by-pitch&quot;&gt;hit by pitches&lt;/a&gt; more than any other team ever (almost). This taught me something important, along with watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-us-and-the-holocaust&quot;&gt;Ken Burns documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the Holocaust and the US (must-watch). I see Trump in Hitler now. Pretty revealing perspective. Now I wonder how my ancestors got here at all, given the antisemitism in the US then, which I can attest to (and provide proof of). You're wasting time watching MSNBC, much better off watching baseball and Ken Burns." created="Tue, 20 Sep 2022 15:35:04 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2022/09/20/itDoesntMatterWhy.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="10581638" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/07/subtleArtOfNotGivingAFuck.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/09/20.html#a153504"/>

			<title>Factoring</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Making usable and efficient software is all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=factoring&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;factoring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/&quot;&gt;Ken Smith&lt;/a&gt; this morning, an English professor, not a technologist. He wanted to know what's factoring all about. What makes Frontier better than other programming environments. It's factoring. Same thing was true of blogging. Factoring. You keep reducing, eliminating steps, until it becomes clear how to eliminate the thing you've been trying to simplify. You simplify it so much it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A couple of case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Before blogging people used CMSes to manage web stuff. They were derived from print publishing software. You'd arrange something on the screen of a computer, until it was perfect, then hand it over to a printer who would put it on paper. That's how CMSes worked too. You'd edit in one place and deploy in another. The aha moment that made blogging real, the Holy Grail I was searching for was the realization that if there was just one place, you could dramatically simplify the editing process, so much that you wouldn't need a techie around to manage it.  It worked. The &lt;i&gt;aha&lt;/i&gt; was recorded in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, of course. If you put an Edit button on the published page, you didn't need another place to do your editing. All that was hidden beind the user interface. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the same way, before &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; (and after, unfortunately) if you needed to store data from a program, you'd write it to a file. When your software was restarted, it would read it from that file. The innovation of Frontier is that it managed all that for you, in the language runtime -- so you never need to write anything anywhere. As with the blogging example, instead of two addresses, a piece of data only had one. I often wonder why no one else has stumbled across this incredible time- and complexity-saver. Bake storage into the runtime. My thought/guess is that language designers don't build apps so they don't know that this would be desirable. If they did, it &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be built into other languages.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder, why I, as opposed to other developers am always striving to simplify, looking for a way to eliminate steps, and whole concepts. I think perhaps it's because I spent years in college studying mathematics, where that is the whole purpose. Looking for the unifying theory of everything. All science is like that, I wonder why this seems to have escaped software development. Every year we (as a profession) work to make things more complex. I think it's because most developers work for big companies who are rewarded by making things more complicated, not by pure programmers (like pure math) who focus on making software disappear. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Pioneering social behavior</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The frontier in new models for social networks are systems that work wonderfully with small numbers of users. The size of a PTA or bowling team. And to limit forms of expression so that it can't devolve.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For the last 50 years we've been building social networks that grow without limit, and give the users power to say anything. We keep repeating this, and being shocked when they devolve to the most crude form of human behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead let's pioneer of new forms of social behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully something better than devolution, more useful at solving the problems we have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And on top of that, they took a series from the great Dodgers, boosting the team confidence even more. Then they lost a series to the Marlins and now were swept by the Cubs, both sub-par teams this year. The Mets might still win, because the Braves, their main competitors in the NL East, are slumping too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is why people who really engage with sports laugh when the politicos on TV say they know how elections will go. Fuck you, you don't know shit a Mets fan might say. A Dodgers fan probably would be more polite but the sentiment would be basically the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm debugging memory usage of a database app in Node. As I do this high wire act, because to do these tests I have to change code and every time I do that, I run the risk of introducing a serious low level bug, I realize I'm using experience I got taking chemistry in my freshman year of college, many years ago. I've done this kind of work before, obviously -- I built a full featured commercial product for the Apple II when it had 48K of application memory. I swapped code in from disk which made the app kind of modal, and wrote in a high level language that generated dense pseudo code, much more memory efficient than machine code. People think that if you make software that regular people can use that you don't have to have deep technical skills. The opposite is true.</description>

			<description>From 2019: Trump is a TV show. If you want to get rid of 10 or more percent in his following, program a Trump TV show every night that isn't news, it's actors in a soap opera, playing the roles of people in Trump's white house. We hang out with him during oval office tantrums, and during pajama time in the morning with fox and friends, and watching tivo of rachel maddow at lunch time. If this gets too boring, have him masturbating. His fans just want to be at home with Trump. Give them what trump won't. Change the conversation from one about trump that he controls to one that is focused on his boredom, sloth, immaturity, depravity, bad hygiene (false teeth), criminal behavior and shitloads of lying. Introduce new characters, like his cardiologist.</description>
