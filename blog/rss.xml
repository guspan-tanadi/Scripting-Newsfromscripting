			<description>A free idea for my friend Matt Mullenweg -- lots of skins for WordPress. There's no reason you should need to write a new back end just for a new user experience. The two should be decoupled, with great opportunities for developers and designers working together.</description>

			<title>Product idea</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A product idea for a new AI bot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A confessional.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You tell it what pisses you off and it tells you what you can do to work around the problem instead of being stopped by it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For extra $ it will connect you with people with a similar grievance who want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;get it done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Grievances</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Take responsibility for your grievances.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think hard about what you can do to alleviate them, rather than making pointless demands of people who don't care what you think and aren't listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ask what you really want.

			<title>FeedLand update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new FeedLand feature -- you can now search titles of feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To start a search, choose &lt;i&gt;Search feeds&lt;/i&gt; from the first menu. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A dialog appears asking what you want to search for. Enter a string, and you're taken to a page with the search results. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few example searches you can try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=new%20york&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=new%20york&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=blog&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=nyt&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=nyt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=bbc&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=bbc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=feedland&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=feedland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=scott&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=scott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=ken&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=ken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=feed&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=dave&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=dave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=john&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=john&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=rss&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=rss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be signed on to use the command, however, if you're signed on, there are checkboxes so you can see which feeds you're subscribed to and you can see the categories you've assigned them to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's an entry box at the top of the search page that allows you to search for more terms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The results can be sorted by title, how recently they've updated, and the number of people subscribing to the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can get more details about the feed by clicking on its title, and view the five most recent items by clicking on the grey wedge to the left of the title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/153&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; for comments and questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/27/searchScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Screen shot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Que sera sera</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html#6&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, and we're there again, 26 years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To anyone who wants to lead -- show us software that's fun and empowering, get us interested and excited. Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted. We're at a crossroads now, do we go back to the mess of the past or do we learn to enjoy the que sera of it all, and stop seeing threats everywhere we look?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So much of the energy is about defeating and destroying, so little is about creating. People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans. They forget that no matter how rich and intimidating each leader of our industry is, or would-be leader, none of them predicted the world we live in now, and by extrapolation they are powerless to control the world we will live in in 1997 and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'll do my part: here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Advice for Elon Musk</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bit of advice to Elon Musk, assuming this isn't all an elaborate act. I've been through what you're going through on a smaller scale, but no less intense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually CEOs of companies or leaders of movements aren't very accessible online. Think of Steve Jobs for example. There was always a lot of distance between him and users. Think of a guy on a stage whose presence is 100 times life size on a projection screen. Not someone you could walk up to and throw a pie at. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But you want to be in the mix, you get something from it. I understand, I do too. But then you have to be prepared for the pies in the face. And instead of calling the pie thrower a jackass, which he is for sure, just turn around and leave. &quot;Gotta go.&quot; Poof you're out of there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can't try to engage with them, show them that you're smart and well-intentioned, it doesn't work. You have to be less accessible. You can't just be one of the gang, that's something you gave up when you became the icon that you are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want some prior art on how to do it, look at how Jack Dorsey does it. I think he's basically a quiet person, so it's easy for him. You are not, you're an extrovert. But being quiet works for Jack. You command a very large enterprise. Your actions will have far more impact than your words. Interacting with the world as if you can make everyone love you, honestly none of them love you, or ever will. They just want to touch you. And some of them want to hurt you. Better to speak through what you do. None of them will ever come to their senses and realize what you want them to realize, whatever that is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, you need to clean up your act a bit, it's insincere to complain about people endangering your life when you do it to others. You may be super-rich but you're just a person. I think in some sense that's what you're trying to say. But you have to live within some of the constraints the rest of us live with. Using your huge following to create real problems for real people, that's just going to come back to you with just as much force. Better to not use your power that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Instead, they moved a starter to the bench and started one of the young stars-in-waiting, and all of a sudden the Knicks are moving and grooving. Playing D that turns into O. Keeping their eye on the player &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the ball. Dishing and swishing. Posting and toasting. They're a joy to watch, esp since they kept the young dudes we love so much. It's an important life lesson, not just for sports (why I like sports so much). Sometimes greatness is almost there. And it looks like losing. And it takes one small change to make things click. And sometimes that change happens. This is why we love the Knicks. You can believe in them even when it makes no sense to.</description>

The difference is I can make software for you that plugs in beautifully on Mastodon, without limits, it's a &quot;platform with no platform vendor.&quot; I will never be able to make software for you that works in LinkedIn.

			<description>If you're shocked by how Musk processes stuff, carve out a little time over the holidays and watch the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(season_1)&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. I lived in there from 1979 to 2010, and I was surprised at how real the show was even though it's a comedy.</description>

			<description>Another good thing to stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt;, which is on Netflix through the end of the month. I love sports movies, and this is a first class baseball story, but it's also about math, and courage, and it's one of Brad Pitt's best &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt_filmography&quot;&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt;. I must've seen it five times before watching it the other day. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; is good too.</description>

The Apple II version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/18/erikSandbergdiments1983ThinktankReview.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; was constructed out of units. But it wasn't until today that I realized there is an equivalent to that in JavaScript. Not sure they even have a name, but if you create a function that's designed to be called via with the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; verb in a certain way, it behaves just like a unit, if you know that. I wish someone had pointed that out to me earlier, but I doubt there are very many serious UCSD Pascal devs using JavaScript in the same way. On the server of course we have packages which totally are units, that was clear from the start.</description>

			<description>The second thing I realized is that if I were teaching a second semester Comp Sci class I would first have the students write the app side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth&quot;&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt;, and struggle with all the weird concepts and awful docs that usually accompany OAuth installations, and then as a follow-up project, I'd have them write the other side of OAuth, the one that makes all the weird rules and has shitty docs. I'm doing that now for the first time, and wish I had done it a long time ago. I think it's actually easier to write your own OAuth server than it is to use someone else's. I'm making sure btw that the example code is pristine absolutely obvious, and you should be able to just plop the code down in your app without any fuss or muss. At least those are my goals. We'll see how it turns out. ;-)</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a150537&quot;&gt;WordPress supporting&lt;/a&gt; title-less feed items: I'm really happy to see them do this. We're in a moment where we might be able to straighten out this huge problem with the web, that limits how we can integrate systems that support short and long posts. We've been divided since Twitter gave up on their RSS feeds, a long time ago. Mastodon required some convincing to stick to no titles in their feeds, rather than give in. And WordPress stepping up to make this transition means we have more reasons for other feed displayers to do so. So this is totally a win for RSS, and I see that as a win for me because &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt;. I made that switch a long time ago. I make products too but interop comes first.</description>

			<description>I've been seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1604983112609325056&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; saying that the W3C is spinning out of MIT and it's not going well. Not sure how much we depend on the W3C. They appear to be controlled by the big companies, and they've rarely been interested in building on my work, instead reinventing it. So if the W3C goes away, well I don't know if I'll miss it.</description>

Like going to a diner in Ohio to find out what Trumpsters are up to as if that were measuring anything credible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am an extreme liberal, esp when it comes to the web. My creds are excellent. And I love my Model Y. I feel like its a privilege to drive it every time I get in the car. And I've owned some terrific cars in my life. There are some cars that are just great to drive. So great that their flaws are not relevant. That Elon Musk is tied to the product is unfortunate. But until I drive a car that's equal to the car I have, I'm not going to bend to the bullshit the press is putting out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also still use Twitter. I'm not going to let Musk chase me off. He'll have to suspend me if he wants me off. I would regret that. I've been on Twitter since 2006. Musk can do whatever he wants, Twitter is big enough for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I voted for Obama twice, Hillary and Biden. So fuck you if you think driving a Tesla is like being a MAGA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two things are completely disconnected, and the press is working overtime to try to connect them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see what you're doing and this is why I hate journalism.

			<title>Textcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is like podcasting but for text. A blog is a way to make text that can be cast. So is a microblog. Or a chat app. The idea is that they should all be able to accept and pass on text without losing elements they don't understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if I pass a titled item through a system that can't handle titles, no problem, but if when it transmits the text it must pass on the title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A short list of required features must be supported, in transit, including simple styling, links, optional titles, unlimited length, enclosures for podcasting, ability to edit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This won't happen overnight, but the apps that do this will be ones that are fair to users, and will build a broad set of varied apps that all work on the same data. No lock-in is possible with this approach. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've always had a hunch that dead people have special powers over the living. I think my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/26.html#a222145&quot;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; showed me that in the days after he died, there was a miracle he would have appreciated, and part of me doesn't believe it was a coincidence.</description>

			<description>One thing's for sure if your social network came from a big tech company or VC-backed startup, you’ll be locked in. It’s a fundamental law like Murphy or Moore.</description>

			<title>Mastodon and RSS, as precedents</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A series of tweets dashed off in the middle of the night on my iPad.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like the precedent Mastodon sets. A server product installed by users. A slow rise as opposed to an overnight success. A dominant competitor falls apart just enough to let a new entrant rise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also love the precedent RSS has set. Enduring a long PR campaign against it by tech giants, VCs and pundits, it persisted, having no employees or burn rate it just needs users to keep it going until both twitter and Google Reader are gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bet the naysayers didn’t see RSS surviving through all that, but they don’t study history. Basic formats like RSS once entrenched never go away. Somewhere under NYC the pipes laid in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stuyvesant&quot;&gt;Peter Stuyvesant's&lt;/a&gt; time are still carrying water to NYers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere deep inside every Chromebook there beats the heart of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12018/why-did-ibm-make-the-pc-bios-source-code-public&quot;&gt;IBM ROM BIOS&lt;/a&gt; clone still handling all the events from the keyboard.  And RSS is there now to provide Mastodon a solid path to informing people who don’t even use the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We pick up from where we left off when Twitter and Google Reader plopped their fat asses down on the feediverse. Hopefully we don’t let that happen again but I have my doubts as users flock to VC products just as dominant as those who are now vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can now write postmortems on twitter. We know where all the promise, dreaming, vision, puffy news pieces led — it always was a powerful weapon waiting to be used that way, we don’t know it’s limits, but we’re going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
