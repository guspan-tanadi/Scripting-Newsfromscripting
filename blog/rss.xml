			<description>Trump proposed to postpone the election. At first I was shocked. Then when I took a few deep breaths I realized, yes, of course, today's when the second quarter numbers for the economy came out. A bad quarter is when the economy only grows by 2 percent. This quarter the economy shrank by 33 percent. That's without precedent. We're in a depression now, unlike anything ever seen in the US. Even with all we know now about macroeconomics, there's no way out of this situation until we get the virus under control, and the government shows no interest in doing that. Trump is a distraction. The real story is the hole we're in.</description>

			<description>A sci-fi terror comedy. A virus infects the human race. Everyone gets it but children don’t get sick or die. Adults die very quickly. ~100%.  Adults must avoid children at all costs.  Hilarity ensues as the kids figure it out and start making demands.</description>

There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wxyz.com/news/national/coronavirus/herman-cain-receiving-oxygen-recovering-from-covid-19-in-hospital&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; just yesterday, via a staffer, saying he was okay, just staying in the hospital for a few days to strengthen his lungs. I thought it was probably not true. A man that age, hospitalized that long, a good outcome was not likely. He was a CEO, not the brightest, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxxjd76hLi8&quot;&gt;a salesman&lt;/a&gt;. It seems he must have gotten the virus at &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5865890/oklahoma-covid-19-trump-tulsa-rally/&quot;&gt;Trump's Tulsa rally&lt;/a&gt;. He's the first political personality to die, of his stature, that I know of, Republican or Democrat. We're probably still waiting for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hudson#Illness_and_death&quot;&gt;Rock Hudson&lt;/a&gt; of Covid. The one that wakes most people up to realize holy shit this can come for me too.</description>

			<description>I usually give products in-development codenames of cities or states. Like Iowa, Fargo, Concord. Sometimes it ends up being the product name. But recently I've been choosing weirder names. For example, one version of an app was Frankenstein. Why? Because that's how it felt. Next one was called Turd Villa. I have no idea how that came into my head, but it makes me laugh, so I keep it. I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/30/turdVillaInTitleBar.png&quot;&gt;seeing&lt;/a&gt; the name in the title bar of my browser. Turd Villa. I'm sure there is no place with that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22turd+villa%22&quot;&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;, anywhere in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=turdvilla&quot;&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2020/07/30/write-like-a-human/&quot;&gt;Om says&lt;/a&gt; to write as you think. I totally agree, but I'd add this: Then edit. When I speak I use extra words as I plot my way through the idea, uncertain of which way I'll go at any step. After writing a first version from the speech in my head, I tighten it, remove unnecessary detours, and flourish, the equivalent of spoken umms.</description>

			<description>Remove phrases like &quot;a lot of&quot; and words like &quot;very.&quot; They don't add anything. The writing is tighter without them. Unless somehow it's &lt;s&gt;very&lt;/s&gt; important to communicate the very-ness of some idea.</description>

			<description>I've recently added a bunch of people to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; subscription list. Plenty to catch up on, but nothing as important as this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. The tech industry is trying to take control of the open standards of the web. They're doing it slowly, with a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; for people and companies who don't comply. A perfect example of monopoly power used corruptly. Plenty of people noticed, but few want to cross Google. I don't care. I'll let them make my writing inaccessible, but I will never comply with their rules. The web is unique in that it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/04/coexistingWithPlatformVend.html&quot;&gt;no platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;. They're guests, as we all are. Guests don't make the rules. There are other issues. Facebook has knocked the legs from under the blogosphere. Every time I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; them to help, they've said no. So all progress has to flow through them and they never move. They don't support the most basic features of the web, linking, simple styles, titles, podcasting. The tech industry is as bad as it was when I started in the 70s. And of course it's much more powerful today.</description>

			<description>The thing that makes fiction interesting is if they take you to a world with characters who feel real who you connect to. And their world, which might be very different from yours, feels real too. The whole thing hangs together. It makes sense what they do, and say, and &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of it isn't exactly what you guessed. This is all a long-winded way to say is it gives &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief&quot;&gt;good suspension of disbelief&lt;/a&gt;. That's why a show like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; works so well. The people are mediocre and foolish. Their world is vastly different from the one we live in. The people are colorful and interesting, educated, but also frail, simple and kind of disgusting, and really stupid at times. But you keep coming back for more because you feel it.</description>

			<description>Sports teams are a lot like nursing homes for concentrating and distributing the virus. This restart of everything is ridiculous. We're damaging ourselves in obvious ways that we're in denial about. A pandemic is nothing to fool around with. We need to start over with a new lockdown, only this time do it right.</description>

			<description>I listened to the first episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://feeds.megaphone.fm/trippishow&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. I met Joe when he was running the Dean campaign in 2004. First campaign to make use of blogging, opened up politics to the people. He made an important point in the podcast, that politics is additive. Of course we want to have Republicans speak at this year's DNC in support of Joe Biden. This is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; of having Biden as the candidate. We need to re-form the political system in the US, the opposition are the people who don't follow the Constitution. Republicans who believe in the rule of law are our friends, our fellow Americans.</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FV_FGt-ryI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwbchicago.com/2020/07/cpd-video-shows-divvy-bike-crew-carjacking-82-year-old-man-in-streeterville.html&quot;&gt;Chicago car-jacking&lt;/a&gt; raises a couple of questions. 1. How did the bike riders rent the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.divvybikes.com/&quot;&gt;Divvy bikes&lt;/a&gt; without giving up their identities, or did they hijack the bikes too? 2. What if the victim had locked his doors, would they have been able to get in the car? Also he had the power to move, why didn't he? Would you have? What if it meant injuring or killing the car-jackers? How would the web have responded if he had done that? Would you have? If the roles were changed, would you feel differently? If the driver was black, and the hijackers cops, for example.</description>

			<description>I love reading local real estate ads and imagining who would live in such a place, who did live there, what kind of life I would live if I lived there. Here are two local properties. One has four cottages. You could start your own art colony for a mere &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11-Tannery-Brook-Rd-Woodstock-NY-12498/2084428274_zpid/&quot;&gt;$825K&lt;/a&gt;. This listing gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/19.html#a141211&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; all kinds of ideas. One cottage for dog lovers, one for beets, one for the Deadheads and one for a year-round &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22NakedJen+Film+Festival%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NakedJen Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Another listing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/48-Raycliffe-Dr-Woodstock-NY-12498/54151995_zpid/&quot;&gt;$650K&lt;/a&gt;, is land only, 6 acres, but it's pretty amazing land. It gives you an idea why artists like to relocate to the mountains on the west side of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley&quot;&gt;Hudson Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely a site to dream about.</description>

			<description>I'm having a debate with myself. Should we encourage or discourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/26/womanWithSwastikaMask.png&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; wearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/swastika&quot;&gt;swastika&lt;/a&gt; masks? On one hand, it's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProjectLincoln/status/1287388507519025152&quot;&gt;disgusting symbol&lt;/a&gt; of race hate. They tried to destroy my people, forced my family to emigrate to the US (not a bad thing btw). We fought WWII against the swastika people. We won. On the other hand, swastika masks probably do as a good job as any other mask, so if that's what they want to wear, maybe we should say okay that's fine, wear your swastika. We may think they're miscreants, desperate for attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the first order, but at least they're not spreading the virus. Maybe we should even &lt;i&gt;give&lt;/i&gt; them swastika masks??</description>

			<description>If the future is an uncontrolled virus, and/or a raging climate crisis, will there be isolated self-sufficient communities on mountain tops, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell&quot;&gt;Winterfell&lt;/a&gt;, that allow no ingress or egress? Will it be like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.battlestarwikiclone.org/wiki/Cylon_computer_virus&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;, with no networking to keep the electronic viruses out? What will be the ideal vacation? Will we envy people with large families, or no families?

			<title>OITNB season 6</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished season 6 of Orange is the New Black. It was good, even great at times, until the last couple of episodes when they apparently ran out of story. Then they did the thing so many shows do. They had each of the characters give long speeches about how they feel about things that you already know about. These are very good actors, and they do what they're told, so it's totally ridiculous. They make up for the ridiculousness by playing seriously dramatic music that makes no sense given the total mediocrity of the story and script. Then they copy techniques of famous movies and great TV series, overlaid on bullshit. I got to the point where I dragged the cursor to the right to fast forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The final episode does have one surprise in the last set of scenes that's worth stopping for and savoring. But otherwise why can't they just cut down a 13-show season to 11 so they can avoid the mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will watch the last season, just to get it off my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also the new version of BingeWorthy is coming along nicely. I solved the main problem, anyone can submit programs, without a need for approval. I came up with a away of avoiding spam.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Green screen baseball?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/25/alonsoAtBat.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso&quot;&gt;Pete Alonso&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom of the 8th in today's Mets game. Note the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/25/fakeFans.png&quot;&gt;fake fans&lt;/a&gt; behind the backstop. Cute, but why not make it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://infocusfilmschool.com/filming-green-screen-guide/&quot;&gt;green screen&lt;/a&gt; so they can play with video effects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unless the &quot;fans&quot; are there to help the pitcher feel comfortable?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Alonso at bat in today's game in Flushing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Friend monitor</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/serverMonitor&quot;&gt;Server Monitor&lt;/a&gt; that does something simple but important. It pings each of the apps I have running once a minute to see if they're still alive. If not, SM sends me an email. I bet everyone who writes server apps has this kind of utility. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like something like this for my friends. A ping goes out to each, if someone doesn't respond, I get an email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the age of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/25/trumpPlague.png&quot;&gt;The Trump Plague&lt;/a&gt;, I worry about my friends. I figure it's just a matter of time...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
