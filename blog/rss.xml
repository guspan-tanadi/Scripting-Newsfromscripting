Because the Marines &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; behind him. He is the commander in chief of the US military, in addition to all the other things he is.</description>

The computer system can be pretty &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/03/134450.html?title=whyNotDriveATesla&quot;&gt;fucked up&lt;/a&gt;, the same way Macs are because Tesla did more than make an EV. I also have a ICE, a relatively new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subaru&quot;&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; and as you say it's incredibly reliable too. That said, I never drive the Subaru. It's sitting there waiting for winter, my thought is that it might work better in the snow than the Tesla. But I literally never drive it because the Tesla is so much more fun to drive.&quot;</description>

Instead they'll groom their own superstars. There are so many good young prospects already playing for the Knicks. Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, RJ, Sims. This is team, the one they already have, is worth being patient for. And the current Knicks management, by hanging tough, remains a powerhouse for future deals and there will be more deals. Mitchell is a fine player, but far from the only one.</description>

As a Knicks fan who couldn't care less if KD thinks they're cool, I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/reports-kevin-durant-requests-trade-from-nets&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; how it turned out.</description>

			<description>The beginning of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2022/08.opml&quot;&gt;month ritual&lt;/a&gt; is done. I can't believe it's already September, on the other hand, it's freaking me out how cold it is this morning. I might have to put on a sweatshirt. It feels like summer just started. Maybe I need to move to Florida or Palm Springs. Oy. I love the mountains, but I dread the winter. Maybe it won't be so bad this year.</description>
