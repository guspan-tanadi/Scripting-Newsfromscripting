			<title>Repubs and world domination</title>

And there have always been people who wanted to be the first. And in no time in human history has it been more possible, and the resulting power been more awesome. And the people who want it, will soon have it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Probably some of them aren't actually trying to dominate the world, some probably just want to kill a lot of people. And that sure is happening. Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's the really scary part. When Hitler tried to achieve world domination in the 1940s, he controlled a very small country, and even though he managed to grow it significantly through war, he never got close to dominating the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think if he had come before FDR, there's a fair chance the US would've sided with Germany, not the allies. Why do I say that? Slavery. It was a very Nazi-like thing we did there. Hitler learned a lot from slavery in the US. America's philosophy with its big ideas was a lie. Our corrections have been big, but short-lived, the post Civil War reconstruction, the New Deal, and the period after WW II when the Repubs foolishly bet too much too early with Goldwater, yielding a huge Democratic majority and a president (Johnson) was knew how to use the power. But it quickly snapped back with Nixon's Silent Majority. And Reagan. And the Bushes. And Trump and who knows what comes next, but it's going in the wrong direction, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;World domination is definitely at stake in the fight between the Repubs and everyone else. Remember, this isn't a small country like Germany in the 30s, we're the military behemoth with the reserve currency for the world. The Repubs won't have to fight a world war to get further than any world dominator has ever gotten. They will have that from Day 1. No need to fight anyone. Putin and Xi will be at the inaugural. NATO will not be invited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read a lot of American history in the last two years when it dawned on me how big the lie was we were told in school. It seems in the last few years we've been starting to tell more truth to the kids, and the Repubs are putting a stop to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lots of destruction if we don't get in the way of the Republican Party's assumption of power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I wrote about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js&quot;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; that takes an OPML list of RSS feeds and validates them. Only feeds that can be read and are parseable are added to the OPML file it creates. It's what I use to clean up old lists before putting them in a database. I can see from where I'm going next that I won't be swinging back this way for a bit, so I thought it was better to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; to it now, in case people could use it. Important: It's a programmer's utility and meant to be example code. You have to be a JavaScript programmer to use it. If you have questions, post a comment in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/issues/1&quot;&gt;issue thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>The Bose speaker review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Speaker-Amazon-Alexa-Built/dp/B07Q337VV3?th=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/18/boseSpeaker.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've been buying smart battery-powered Bluetooth speakers almost since they first came out, starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3SNCGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Beats Pill&lt;/a&gt;, which I had mounted on the handlebars of the bike I rode in Manhattan. Lots of people asked what it was, and where could they get one. Since then I've bought speakers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;JBL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Tribit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFV59PY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Ultimate Ears&lt;/a&gt;, and others. None of them cost more than $100. My favorite so far is the Tribit, it's tiny, has a huge sound, and it's got a great feel in the hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the other day I figured out what I wanted for summer outdoor lounging -- a battery-powered speaker that had Alexa built in. So I did a little shopping, found there aren't many, and they're all really expensive. I asked for advice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1524533392901083136&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to blow some money, ordering a $400 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFKBQ3K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Bose speaker&lt;/a&gt;. The reviews were stunning. I had a hard time imagining how the sound could be that great, compared to how great the much cheaper models were, but I had to find out. They offered free returns. So all I was risking was a little time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the top line. It was a huge disappointment in every way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had to download their app just to turn it on, and then I had to create an account on their service. I also had to check off their agreement, which of course I didn't read. So right off the bat, before it even says anything to me, I hate it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it takes ten minutes to download the updated system software. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To use Alexa, I had to go through another signon process which required me to remember the password I used for their system, which very luckily I did (I didn't try, I never plan on using that service again). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay now finally, I say &quot;Alexa WNYC,&quot; our local NPR station. Nothing happens. Then the speaker upstairs starts playing WNYC. I yell ALEXA STOP upstairs. No good. So I go upstairs and tell it again to stop, and again it doesn't. So I pull the plug. Then I hear the Alexa in the bedroom is doing the same thing. I go in there and pull the plug. Go back downstairs. The Bose speaker is doing nothing. Okay I take a deep breath and try it again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Exactly the same thing happens. So I go upstairs again, pull the plugs on the speakers, this time, leave them unplugged, go back downstairs and try again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Nothing. I figure I'll try it again later.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm not done with the flaws of the product, but I want to pause here for a moment. I'm accustomed to setting up Alexas by plugging them in, waiting a few seconds while it boots up, then it looks around and somehow finds one of the other Alexas and asks if it's okay if it uses the data on it to configure this one. I always smile at this point, man that's good design, and I say YES of course, and in a few seconds I'm listening to NPR. The process involves no work beyond plugging it in and giving my consent. I imagine it needs to download updated system software, but wisely waits until late at night to do it. Why make the human wait while the robot does its housekeeping?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay the next day I figure enough with Alexa, let's see how this is as a speaker. So I press the Bluetooth button on top of the speaker, and I connect my iPhone in the normal way for Bluetooth. Then I play an old McCartney song. It sounds like any of the other speakers I have. I hit pause and start playing another song, and it never plays. I hit pause and play again, and it plays for a few seconds then freezes. I repeat the pause-play thing again and again, that's it -- it never plays another bit of music. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This is a piece of shit product. Maybe the Alexa problems are really Amazon problems, but if so, I can't believe they shipped the thing in this condition. But Bluetooth is mature technology. I've never had a problem with Bluetooth on any of the other speakers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's no way this product is worth $400. Even if it worked it wouldn't be worth any more than $100, and probably a lot less because the idea is this is supposed to be a portable product and it's much less portable than the $43 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Tribit&lt;/a&gt;, and honestly -- if it sounds better, I couldn't tell the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I repeat the pause-play thing again and again, that's it -- it never plays another bit of music." created="Wed, 18 May 2022 13:18:24 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18/130408.html?title=theBoseSpeakerReview#a131824"/>

				<source:outline text="Conclusion: This is a piece of shit product. Maybe the Alexa problems are really Amazon problems, but if so, I can't believe they shipped the thing in this condition.

			<description>Today I wrote a Node app that reads an OPML subscription list, loops over all the feeds and only passes on the ones that are reachable and parseable. Yes, I plan to share the code, because it's useful and also good example code for reading and writing lists, and reading feeds.</description>

			<title>Making Twitter quieter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A thread from Twitter converted to a post. Someday I'm going to have to write a script to do this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Twitter had a Steve Jobs type leader he'd come up with a brilliant idea, akin to noise-cancelling headphones (and call it that), and explain how satisfying it can be to tell the trolls to shut the fuck up. Ahhhh nice and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I used to live on noisy streets in Palo Alto and Berkeley. I moved to NYC, even worse (I lived in the West Village, then the East Village) until I moved uptown and then ahhh nice and quiet. Moved to the mountains, even better! There's something to be said for a little peace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how I made my twtr quiet. At the first sign of trollish behavior, I mute or block. Works great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The trollish behavior is basically anyone who wants to argue with you. People who say unfair things and you want to point out how unfair they are. If you find yourself protesting, the chances you're communicating with a troll approach 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To determine if the person conversing with you is a troll, look at your own feelings. If you feel they misunderstand you and want to correct them -- it's a troll. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've learned so much about trolls. Trolls aren't nearly as frustrating as newbies who refuse to turn them off and insist on setting them straight &lt;i&gt;for all to see. &lt;/i&gt;Ohhh, that's exactly what they want. It's like having a cat who brings home dead birds. I'm sure the cat meant well, but..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, in 2022, the entire Republican Party platform is trolling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whoever runs Twitter needs the sass of Steve Jobs with his incredible ability to make simple ideas simple. Noise-cancelling headphones for Twitter. Instead of focusing on trying to diminish the brightness of the sun, give everyone sunglasses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Repub is someone who likes to troll Libs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Lib is someone who thinks Repubs want to know why they're wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about the web is that people do tutorials with videos showing how they do things like install a new antenna on your roof, or put together an Adirondack chair. When people bad mouth the web, they forget about miracles like that. That said, there must be videos that demo how to shut down the trolls yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Interesting results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1525839800183431174&quot;&gt;yesterday's poll&lt;/a&gt; about when life begins. Clearly the poll got spammed by right-to-lifers, many hours after the poll went up, the proportion who said life begins at conception shot up from 10 percent to over 35. A poll like this of course only means what you personally take from it, it has no mathematical significance. It's as if I asked a group of people in a subway car what they think, but the car was only going to my neighborhood.</description>

			<description>I've been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/&quot;&gt;Hover.com&lt;/a&gt; for years, and have a lot of domains parked there, and I wish I could get the list of domains into my outliner easily. I don't need a full API, just a page that lists all my domains in an OPML file. Access it through the browser and save it locally. Read it into my outliner as a file. And then I can do whatever I want. It seems like an easy thing to implement. Not sure how many other people would use it right away, but I bet a bunch would use it once it was available. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, speaking of Hover, they took out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html&quot;&gt;killer feature&lt;/a&gt; I wrote up in 2019. I read their explanation (sorry can't find it now), it has to do with DNS tech of course, it's why the other guys don't do it either. But it really seemed to work and made my setup a little more flexible, which is something we really look for from DNS. Helps keep our sites working.</description>

			<description>Two Game 7s in the NBA playoffs today.  Uncle Davey will be watching TV.  The two games mean different things, to me at least. Either way, in the first game, one very deserving team will move forward and another very deserving team will go home. The other game will determine if future &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_players_in_the_Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame&quot;&gt;Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt; will get another shot at the championship, or if he's forever banished to being a great player who never got there. You get a sense this, at age 37, is his last shot. There's no shame in that, he has lots of company.</description>

If you go back far enough she was a blogger on Tumblr, so we feel pride, a local girl did good. And she adds a bit of open web, user-centric thought to everything. As a software developer, I see things the same way.

There are no details &lt;a href=&quot;https://myfriendsmydata.org/&quot;&gt;on the website&lt;/a&gt;, and a project like this is all about the details. Also VC-backed startups are the last devs I expect to go this route and I don't imagine if one of them is successful that they're going to rush to share their user lists with the others. The only way something like this can work is if they share a membership system from the start. And if they do that, and want credibility, there should be some non-VC open source devs in their group. One more thing, why not just use Twitter's identity system. It's got a great API, scales really well, and other devs (such as me) are using it that way. Instead of building my own identity system, I just use theirs. I have no interest in controlling my users, so it's a no-brainer. Sure the day could come when Twitter shuts off the API, but I could also get hit by a car riding my bike on a country road, or any number of other calamities.</description>

Much later, in 2015, I ported the World Outline software from Frontier running as a server, to Node.js, but I left the site private, probably because I wasn't planning to build in this direction, I just wanted to get some sites that were running in Frontier to work in Node. This morning some of my work led me to this software, and I saw that it was private, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/worldOutline&quot;&gt;made it public&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the &lt;i&gt;wo&lt;/i&gt; is like the &lt;i&gt;www&lt;/i&gt; except with outlines instead of HTML. You can of course render the outlines as HTML, and that's what the WO software does. Given all the interest in outliners these days, it seemed like a good time to open this stuff up. However at this point I don't plan to run the server software here. If you get it running, all I ask is that you continue to support OPML. Interop is everything. Thanks.</description>

			<description>I was out driving the new Model Y with a fresh pizza on the passenger seat, rounded a corner and there was a fat turkey waddling across the road. Slammed the brakes. They work, but turkey keeps waddling as if nothing happened. Pizza mess on the floor of the new car. Where the Model 3 had the new car smell even six months after getting it, this car smells of pizza. Hey at least it was good pizza. Heh.</description>

But even there, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Only%20steal%20from%20the%20best&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;Only steal from the best.&quot; My goal is to find ways to work with others so that the sum is greater than the parts. I think that's the challenge of our generation and all subsequent generations. We're not dealing with climate change, for example. We're losing our minds as a country in other ways, for example the decision the Supreme Court is contemplating. You know it's not going to work, it'll be as big a disaster as climate change, but we'll feel it right away. We can't connect enough so that the people who we've supposedly trusted for being wise to avoid jumping unnecessarily, with no possible gain, into an abyss that will certainly lead to war. It's that big a deal. At age 67, I don't have the same goals I had at 22. I'm not trying to set the world on fire, I'm trying nudge people into working with each other, even today's 22 year-olds. We should be giving out Nobel Prizes to people who find ways to work with others. That's the challenge for the human species, from now on, imho of course.</description>

			<title>OPML package update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -- there's a new &lt;i&gt;expandIncludes&lt;/i&gt; function in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage#v0424----51122-by-dw&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt; for JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you know I'm working on a refresh of all the stuff I have related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, and part of that is the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; for subscription lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription list&lt;/a&gt; is an outline containing nodes of type &lt;i&gt;rss&lt;/i&gt; that have an &lt;i&gt;xmlUrl&lt;/i&gt; attribute that points to a feed. Even though the type is rss, it can be used to point to feeds in any format, including Atom and RDF. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The lists can contain anything else you like, feeds, docs, and they can include other subscription lists. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Example: You could maintain a list of people you follow and plug that into your reader's subscription list, and also offer it to friends, where they could include it in their list. And because you're using pointers, when your list updates, your friends are automatically updated. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To include a list in another, just insert a node of type &lt;i&gt;include, &lt;/i&gt;with a &lt;i&gt;url&lt;/i&gt; attribute that points to another OPML file which should include nodes of type &lt;i&gt;rss&lt;/i&gt; and possibly other &lt;i&gt;include&lt;/i&gt; nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They work like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_directive#C/C++&quot;&gt;includes in C&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the name came from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the new thing is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt; now has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/opmlpackage.js#L322&quot;&gt;expandIncludes&lt;/a&gt; function that can be given an outline, in a JavaScript object, and it returns an outline with all the include nodes expanded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had code that does this for decades in various environments. It's trivial in a language like C, Python, or Frontier -- any rational language that takes care of I/O under the hood, but it's a difficult problem in a language like JavaScript where you have to manage your own synchronization. This code first appeared in 2014 as part of PagePark, then moved to the daveopml package, and finally, today into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;opml package&lt;/a&gt;. This is where it belongs, where everyone else can easily get to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new version, 0.4.24 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;in NPM&lt;/a&gt;. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage#v0424----51122-by-dw&quot;&gt;release note&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/tree/main/examples/includes&quot;&gt;example code&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/examples/includes/includes.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments post an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This should also be useful in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Tools%20For%20Thought&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I haven't seen him in a few years, and at this time in our respective lives people's appearances can change dramatically. He looked good but old, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=colonel+sanders&quot;&gt;Colonel Sanders&lt;/a&gt;. I think he got a stylist and I'm guessing the Colonel Sanders look is deliberate? I'm sure he'll tell me. Anyway &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/11/nerd.png&quot;&gt;the nerd&lt;/a&gt; is going on and on, and if that really is Doc, I can't imagine he knows what he's talking about, and why the hell should he. The guy was talking very fast about problems that I thought would have been solved long ago. This is 2022 after all. I guess that's just nature of computer stuff, we're always re-inventing things. I do it too.</description>

			<title>None of us learned the real history of the United States in school</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've spent most of the last 1.5 years reading about slavery in the US, mostly from the perspective of descendants of slaves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not done yet. I think I could spend the rest of my life reading only about this, and with every book learn something important about my country that I never knew before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm now reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-South-Won-Civil-War/dp/0190900903&quot;&gt;HCR's book&lt;/a&gt; about slavery, it's from a very different perspective, that of a current-day (white) historian.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find this piece fits in nicely with the others I've read. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the missing history book, the one we didn't read in school. None of us did, of no American generation. As far as I know, the truth about America has never been taught in an American school, to American kids.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Never. And that means you got the wrong story as I did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And please don't assume you know what the story is. You can't and you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An OPML-related project</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren't into &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; you can skip this post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have yet to organize all the bits going into my next project, the one I've been working on all year (so far). It doesn't even have a codename yet, which is unusual for me, I usually come up with them at the beginning. It will eventually have one. Anyway at this time I don't have a good place on GitHub to put the bits, the data and scripts, so I'll hang them off this post on my blog until a better place shows up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a really good example of an OPML subscription list for the RSS-related project. The canonical example is the collection of feeds for the NY Times. They have them all assembled on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/rss&quot;&gt;single page&lt;/a&gt;. I did a view source, and saw that it's good HTML. I selected the part of the HTML with the feed list, and opened it in an HTML source editor, and cleaned it up until it validated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/frontierScriptSource.opml&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to read the file into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/scratchpad.nytstruct.fttb&quot;&gt;object database structure&lt;/a&gt;, and then wrote a script to create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/flatlist.opml&quot;&gt;flat OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt; with the data. I opened the outline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/nytFeeds.opml&quot;&gt;organized it&lt;/a&gt; the way they have it organized on their site. I then opened the outline in my feed reader app and copied a few of the feeds from the NYT list, pasted them into the list for the test app, and it worked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we also have a current, complete and well-organized &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/nytFeedsOpmlList/nytFeeds.opml&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of the NYT feeds. It should prove useful in the work to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's a basic bug in the American myth of self-reliance, the bug is this -- it's a lie. Humanity is like an ant colony. Our lives follow a rigid template that's &lt;s&gt;hard&lt;/s&gt; impossible to break out of. Unless you're a hermit, you pay taxes, get the same medicine as everyone else, celebrate the same holidays (even non-Christians in the US observe Christmas in some fashion). You are only unique in your mind, but even there, where you are free to be different, there's a lot of conformity. We rely on each other, there is no such thing as a pioneer on the open range, fending for himself. Richardson doesn't say any of those things, at least not in the beginning of the book, instead she describes the American myth. And as I'm reading it, I recognize it as the argument between the people and the oligarchs that's still raging. We think of it as North vs South but that's all part of the puppetry. We're being manipulated into blaming each other for nothing, distracting us from what we could be if we didn't pander to the oligarchs. Really looking forward to this read.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalists and pundits have been doubting that Twitter/Musk can double their revenue with subscriptions.

I'm trading my Model 3 for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y&quot;&gt;Model Y&lt;/a&gt; this week. The Y's were hard to get when I decided it was time to get a Tesla. The way values have been going, I'm paying very little to make this switch for cars of comparable value. The mileage on the 3 is low.

			<title>I fear for Ukraine...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I fear for Ukraine. What happens when we decide it's over even when the war is still raging, as we have done with Covid, not caring how many people's lives will be ruined, or ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I expect it'll be the same with Roe v Wade, until we really get woke and see the big picture. We need societal mechanisms to stay focused on what matters, and not lose focus in meaningful ways, until the problem is solved or the threat is over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of other things fall into that bucket btw: climate change, regulating guns in the US, black lives matter, LGBTQ rights. We only focus briefly, leaving us vulnerable to dishonest power-hungry people who are more patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Social networks can help, but only ones that are carefully crafted to stay focused on the goal they are assigned to. Twitter and Facebook et al were invented and bootstrapped in chaos. I understand this process as well as anyone. There are other ways to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I posted this as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1523320792536449024&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I know no one there will latch onto it, because it's not the kind of thing Twitter-the-network pays any attention to. Which is the point. The only way to get something like that going is to go first, the same way podcasting and RSS and blogging before it got started. Do it until it seems obvious, and then there's a FOMO, and let the people with the loudest voices pretend they were there at the beginning. All those things have to happen. So we're a long way from being able to work together, but until we start, we'll still be mired, and the people who think and act long-term will keep running everything.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22eve+winer%22&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; was born in 1932 and died in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She did a lot of good in her life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She got a PhD at age 50 after raising two kids. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was active in political causes, from school integration, to getting buses to stop running their engines while parked at the Main Street bus depot, to planting trees in the neighborhood we grew up in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She spoke English like a native even though she was born in Prague.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She was my mother and I loved her and I still to this day want her love. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She did the best she could. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mom with cat, knitting&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
