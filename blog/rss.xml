			<description>What got me scrambling this morning was that the generator had run out of propane and the temperature outside was 10 degrees F. That's a pipe-freezing temperature. And the forecast for tonight was 16 (not that I knew this, I wasn't in the loop on the most basic information such as the weather forecast). Power's back on, pipes are safe, for now.</description>

			<description>I've had the power and internet out for 1.5 days. We had an ice storm, I know they're common but this is my first one. What happens I guess is that slush falls from the sky. It's warmer up there than it is on the ground. Some of it lands on the limbs of trees where it sticks momentarily. The air is so cold that it freezes. Then it happens again and again, until the limbs and branches, even the smallest ones, are encased in a tube of ice, and it's heavy. It weighs the branch down so it sags, they all sag, and some branches fall off, and a few trees just fall over (not many because earlier wind storms probably already blew those trees over). The branches that fall might be on top of power or internet lines, and some of them are over big power hardware. And when that goes out, whole towns go out. Like the area where I live. No power for 1.5 days. So I have gone out once each day at about 9AM and drove down to Woodstock where there is cell service (we have none where I live) and try to find out what's going on, read my email, etc. Then I go back home and read, and think. I can't write software because It isn't set up that way.</description>

Apparently she said the Holocaust was white people killing white people, it wasn't racial. And she was suspended for saying this, after she apologized. I'm not sure what she apologized for, whose feelings were hurt? And if they were, they could deal with it, it's not anything like a big deal. It's also true! Most Jews are white people, at least the ones I know. There are African Jews, and they are pretty black. And probably some people who look Asian who are Jews. But by and large, she was correct. And if she wasn't whose is going to stand up and tell me Whoopi isn't mone of the most thoughtful  celebs we have! She's an actual human being. I once had a long talk wtih her at a tech conference. I was a smoker then and so was she, and she came out and joined the smokers and we did what smokers do when they go outside to smoke -- we talk wtih each other about all kinds of stuff. She's a nice person. And if she's wrong (or more accurately you think she's wrong) then discuss it. Let's figure this out. But we have to stop punishing people for saying things that are obviously true that someone can get all pissy about. Now I wish I had an actual net connection so I could publish this. BTW, IU have a generator. This is only the second time it's been in use, and this is a very long period. I keep thinking it's going to run out of propane any minute. But for now, all my systems are going fine.</description>

			<description>Power and internet have been down all day. I haven't spent this much time offline in a long time. Took a drive into town first thing in the morning to be sure the power company and Spectrum were aware of the outages, checked in with some friends, and headed back up the hill. On the way down there were lots of trees blocking the road and in one place there was a down power line across the road, had to backtrack and go another way. Of course I had to put the project I was working on down for the whole day. I had a good day's work planned, and there are still a bunch of things to figure out. But my work system requires a net connection. One of the things I've been thinking about today is if there's a way around that. Update: It's hopeless. It would be a lot of work to get something running all-local, and to try to set that up without internet access would mean it would all have to work without being tested as I go. Not worth it. My internet is going to come back soon enough.</description>

			<description>Three Beatles songs I'm rediscovering in a whole new way: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8&quot;&gt;Strawberry Fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naoknj1ebqI&quot;&gt;Lucy In The Sky&lt;/a&gt;. I'm probably going to re-do my sound system just to hear these songs fully. And who knows what's next. This excursion into the Beatles is one of the best things I've ever done. It's had an impact on how I write my software, believe it or not. Sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun. If the sun don't come you get a tan from standing in the English rain.</description>

			<title>Apple's boastful robot, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/02/202512.html?title=applesBoastfulRobot&quot;&gt;boastful robot&lt;/a&gt; piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/03/email1.png&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; from Apple saying they were sending me a new iPhone to replace the one I never got. I wasn't sure how I should feel about this, because &quot;replace&quot; is the wrong adverb, and subsequent emails implied that I was somehow responsible for returning to them the phone I never got.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/03/email2.png&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; that said there was a problem processing my payment. Except I had already paid for the $1300 phone in full. Since I bought it at the end last month, I had even paid the credit card bill. And I used my Apple card, so Apple has the money. And the best part of the email, which I assume was written by a human being, is they said when I visit the page on their site the information they're looking for should be obvious and it's probably not really a big thing, but what the thing is? well that remained a mystery. In case you don't believe me, I've attached a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/03/email2.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the email.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I still don't have the phone. According to their website they are still &quot;processing&quot; the replacement. It has not shipped yet, however it is expected to be delivered today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something is right in Cupertino. This was the company that you could buy a new computer with a credit card at an Apple store and walk out with the new machine in a minute. You didn't even have to go to the cash register, the sales person had a device they could scan the card with, and another Apple person would bring the computer out, hand it to you, and off you go. I used to marvel at this. They pioneered the use of computer technology to smooth out the buying experience, but now my local electric utility company has this down better, even my local bank. Oh how the mighty have fallen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remain an Apple shareholder. I hope they can fix this. It really needs to be redone from top to bottom. If they can't handle a $1300 sale for a phone and get it delivered without incident in seven days then they should shut down everything until they can do it. Start over. Fire everyone. It's just not worth continuing if this is how you're going to do business. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Apple had tried to charge &quot;my&quot; credit card $1 and it was declined. I don't understand why they were doing that, they had already charged me $1300 plus tax, but they did. Turns out it wasn't my credit card, somehow my card number was replaced with someone else's. In all saga of incompetence and bad design, turns out their database doesn't work. Or it was hacked? For a computer company that operates a huge cloud for its customers, this is shocking. So here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/03/status.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the current status of my purchase. Can you tell when they think the computer will arrive, I sure can't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Is there a nice open source JavaScript clone of Wordle? By nice I mean: 1. It covers all the functionality of the original. 2. The code is clearly written, not obfuscated, easy to build on. No amazing JS tricks, just straight boring code. I'd like to add a simple back-end, to automatically save your history, publish an RSS feed. Easily integratable into a community. Back-end is open source Node app. I'll just operate a server a few Wordler friends. A labor of love like the original app.</description>

			<title>Apple's boastful robot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you call 1-800-MYAPPLE, an intelligent robot answers the phone, introduces itself as as such and kept sending me to tech support when I had a customer service problem, and said so clearly in short phrases. I am trained at talking to Alexa, Siri and my Tesla, I know how to give them commands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then, on my way back to tech support, it asked me to identify myself, but didn't say what info it wanted. It paused and in a stern voice said I had not answered the question in enough time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then it connected me to customer service to talk to a human.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which btw was exactly what I was hoping for when I called the number in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For a super high tech company this was embarrassing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To their credit, the human I spoke with was apologetic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do they test their software at Apple? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also tried using their text chat service, it was worse. It repeatedly told me to use the self-help system. Why offer a chat service if you're just going to tell me to use the self-help system? (Interestingly the self-help system gave me information I did not have.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A $1300 purchase, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Wordle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry that the NYT bought Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Part of its appeal was that it was a nice web app that had no scaling issues, written by a person who was happy not to be a billionaire, and everyone was loving it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that it's attached to the NYT, there's an element of hate there too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe it would show the world that ordinary people who love their GF and want to make something nice for her and decides to share it with the world and retains his human-ness -- that software can be fun and doesn't have to be the usual hot mess of greed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW this is true, software &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; made by people, not icons, and I don't blame Mr Wordle for taking the money. I just hope he stays a nice person and doesn't get caught up in being more than a human being.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;Your human-size life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A tweet worth framing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle/status/1488576702817079297&quot;&gt;quite a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle&quot;&gt;Brewster Kahle&lt;/a&gt;, the archiver of the open web, about podcasting. He quotes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/30.html#a130520&quot;&gt;post of mine&lt;/a&gt; from April of last year. Basically when you sign an exclusive deal, good for you, but it's not a podcast anymore. To say it is is false advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't get tweets like this every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
