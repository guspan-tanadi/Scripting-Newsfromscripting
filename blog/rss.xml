			<description>We may be at the point in the unraveling of America when our favorite diners shut down. For me it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/food/odessa-restaurant-late-night-east-village-oasis-close&quot;&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7263911,-73.9833187,3a,75y,301.34h,92.34t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjZYPzLkIfakUz6jzf8gGnw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjZYPzLkIfakUz6jzf8gGnw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D36.482285%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Avenue A&lt;/a&gt;, across from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tompkins-square-park&quot;&gt;Tompkins Square Park&lt;/a&gt;, in the East Village. I used to meet my &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/momorderingfromodessa&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and grandfather there in the 80s.

The links to the old generation are disappearing, no surprise because the generation itself is gone. Not surprising that a place like Odessa can't survive just on takeout, when there are so many other great choices in the Village.</description>

			<description>This is why you take pictures of your food. A picture of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/odessadinner&quot;&gt;dinner at Odessa&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know what all of it is. The sausage is probably a kielbasa. And the dumplings are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi&quot;&gt;pierogi&lt;/a&gt;, and come with fillings like sauerkraut, mushrooms, potatos and various meats. The pancake on top doesn't look familiar. I think that might be stuffed cabbage on the right at 2 o'clock. There's some kind of soup at the upper right.</description>

			<title>Re-open schools? Not yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sraDVyksYMs&quot;&gt;great scene&lt;/a&gt; in the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq70brIQP40&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; where the lead character interviews for a job in a local bank. She's had a hard life, no job history or rÃ©sumÃ©. The bank officer explains: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When the beach party is over you don't get to say, you know what, I think now I'd like to have what everyone else has worked their entire life for. It doesn't work that way.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the speech the virus is giving to the Republican governors of Texas, Florida, Arizona and all the other states that are collapsing under the weight of the virus after re-opening before they did the hard work of getting the virus under control. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The predictable thing happened. The pandemic exploded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The analogy to the main character of Monster is pretty close to perfect. The governors may have been  naÃ¯ve, as she was, but life doesn't care about that. You have to pay the price before you get the prize.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Charlize Theron in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(2003_film)&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First there's no question &lt;i&gt;the schools will not open in the fall. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should stop discussing it. It's out of the question. What may happen is they will try to open the schools in a few of the Republican states, and close them within a few days as the rate of infection goes even higher. Cause and effect. You do something stupid and a week later the infections go up, two weeks later the hospitalizations go up and two weeks after that, the death rate goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this dimension the virus is totally predictable. Opening the schools in a month, with such a high density of infections, is suicidal on both the individual and societal level. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;New Covid cases per million. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the plan we would be executing now if we had competent management. I'm not inventing this, it's the protocol they used in China, Vietnam, Singapore, New York, basically everywhere, to defeat the virus. This was a known method back in March. I first heard about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nationwide lockdown until the rate of new cases is flat and near the baseline.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile stand up national testing and contact tracing. Open source the data so the public can help analyze it. Also useful for teaching the kids, at home, what's going on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Create a network of places to isolate newly infected Americans. Hotels, convention centers, college dorms, schools.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Once all that has happened we can open the schools.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Florida&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How bad is it out there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeahDaisyD/status/1282314539460112389&quot;&gt;Leah in the Florida panhandle writes&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Any state whose residents keep coming to Florida on vacation will keep getting a taste of it. Weâ€™re having our busiest tourist season &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; this summer. No masks. No social distancing. A fresh batch comes every Saturday to stay a week. Hereâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publix.com/locations/153-watercolor-crossings&quot;&gt;Publix Watercolor&lt;/a&gt;, always packed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Publix in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Rosa+Beach,+FL+32459/@30.3960316,-87.3494376,8z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8893e19100c879b1:0xaadc3fb91d731d0b!8m2!3d30.3960324!4d-86.2288322&quot;&gt;Santa Rosa Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Until you go through the pain, then the hard work of containing the virus, it's suicidal to re-open the schools. Even if the government tells us we have to commit suicide, the people won't do it. We will learn. The disaster will explode, but we will learn.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile teach the kids at home that they're living the consequences of having a poorly educated electorate. Help them study the math and science of viral infections. And study the history, as it's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On NPR this morning a question that has a simple answer, but no one can seem to find it. How did the flower children of the 60s become the Boomers of the 90s and 00s? Not a good question, because that isn't what happened. Hippies were a very small part of the Boomer generation. George W. Bush is a Boomer, but not a hippie, then or now. And sure, some hippies didn't drop out, but then a bunch of them did. My uncle, for example. He really did live the dream of the hippies. As I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me&quot;&gt;Lies&lt;/a&gt; book, I come to appreciate that there are people applying the scientific method to history, and not accepting the simple and wrong stories of heroes and villains, weak and strong, the savages and the civilized. BTW, some of the hippies became programmers. That's a whole other thread to pick up. That's why the freedoms of the net and the web &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;persist&lt;/a&gt; to this day. A fair number of people believe in them, still, and follow the grain, instead of trying to build forts.</description>

			<description>One more thing, my disappointment with the EFF, as I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/10/225547.html?title=anEffToWatchTheEff&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, is that they started off with the hippie ideal, the three founders were immersed in it, but as the EFF grew, they let billionaire monopolists set the agenda. I wanted them to tell the story of podcasting as it was created, by following the grain of the web, not by throwing huge money and installed base at the idea. Sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction&quot;&gt;soft power&lt;/a&gt; is the way to get something done. They wouldn't even listen, that's how little respect they have for the individual. Why should they, the most I can contribute is a few thousand, Google can contribute millions. Imagine what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69w_CXFR7tE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8&quot;&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; would say. The EFF is a prime example, imho, of flower children losing their way.</description>

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript, day 3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First thanks to Allen Wirfs-Brock for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution process for JavaScript. I wanted to let his ideas settle in for a couple of days before responding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the rule of &quot;don't break existing code.&quot; We had the same rule in the RSS world. It was very controversial with some. They wanted to break it. That's what the big debate was about. On one side, mine, trying to maintain continuity, because I and others were developing and deploying software to users that built on RSS. We couldn't afford to change things just for the sake of change. And we had a lot at stake in preserving simplicity, because that kept the barrier to entry low. The more different ways there were to do something, the harder it would be to enter the market, and the leaders could become complacent. We've all seen how markets stagnate when the leaders are protected. I didn't want to see that happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We had the same rule in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; world . We called it Rule 1, and it was simply this: Don't Break Users. As a joke Rule #1a was: Don't Break Dave. That was meant to tell the team this was personal. If my code was broken, I would probably raise my voice. The rule came about because the guy who was working on the core code would routinely break the upper-level code. To him, the core was never finished, and all the work we were doing at upper levels was just to test his stuff. So he didn't really feel it. I think that's true of many other developers. They don't get that the people who build on their tech are skilled in ways they can't comprehend (and of course vice versa). That's the power of layering tech. It becomes virtually impossible without the No Breakage rule. And you can see it in the market. Good ideas from previous generations are nowhere to be found in today's systems. Because someone wiped the slate clean without any idea how much had been built on it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW there's a great story about this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&quot;&gt;Soul of a New Machine&lt;/a&gt;. They were shocked when they saw real people using their product. They had never imagined it, and it felt wrong to them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have another rule -- &quot;One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot; This is a variant of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/927/&quot;&gt;XKCD cartoon&lt;/a&gt;, and of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle&quot;&gt;Postel's robustness principle&lt;/a&gt;. Postel says be conservative in what you send. I say one way is better than two. Applied to JavaScript, adding the arrow syntax was a mistake. It didn't add any new expressive power to the language, and it meant anyone who needs to read code (i.e. everyone who develops) now has to understand two ways of doing the same thing. Even worse, newbies now have to learn two ways, and they have to learn when to use which way, and all the explaining avoids the truth -- it really doesn't make a difference. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;One way is better than two&quot; is another instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;. Stop trying to make it better. Because that just makes it worse. Good postulates are true from every angle. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another story I like to tell is when we were working on the names for things in &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; the rule was we had to come up with the worst name for each element. So if you thought you had a better name, everyone would laugh. Heh, we don't want that. It's in the groundrules. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, I also always use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript#a150908&quot;&gt;first form&lt;/a&gt; for defining functions, although when I was new to JS, I sometimes used the second form. But the vast majority of my codebase uses form 1. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the pointer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt;. It's on my list of things to explore. Right now I have my JS profile committed to memory. But I should formalize it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Postel says be conservative in what you send. I say one way is better than two. Applied to JavaScript, adding the arrow syntax was a mistake. It didn't add any new expressive power to the language, and it meant anyone who needs to read code (i.e. everyone who develops) now has to understand two ways of doing the same thing. Even worse, newbies now have to learn two ways, and they have to learn when to use which way, and all the explaining avoids the truth -- it really doesn't make a difference." created="Sat, 11 Jul 2020 15:27:50 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3#a152750"/>

			<description>There's a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955&quot;&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt; in programming -- we must change our software so as not to, internally, invisibly to users, use terms like black or white, master or slave, etc. I'm editing some code now that has the concept of enabled and disabled. Can you imagine if we have to purge this from our tech vocabulary? The economics of such changes are mind-boggling. And the breakage. What if we used such a term in one of our standards? A frozen one? An ancient one? What then?</description>

			<description>The problem with journalism exposed in the age of Trump is they don't do anything. You say oh they're not supposed to. Voice from nowhere, etc. But they rarely carry stories of people who do things. Mostly Trump. Occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt; or but just for a while. That's it. Why does it matter now? Because we've been needing to do things since November 2016. We figure it out when it's too late. It's a repeating pattern. Maybe we need national activism more than we need journalism? We need something different or else we're hosed.</description>

			<title>An EFF to watch the EFF?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The EFF started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&quot;&gt;30 years ago today&lt;/a&gt;, with the right idea, defending speech on the then-nascent net. I gave them $5000 at startup, but ultimately they sold us out to the big tech companies. Now we need a new EFF to reign in the original EFF.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I blogged about my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff&quot;&gt;break with the EFF&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. Subsequently I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366&quot;&gt;objected&lt;/a&gt; to how they defended podcasting from a patent troll, and ultimately the effort to give &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;control of the web to Google&lt;/a&gt;, that was the absolute last straw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are no longer defending electronic freedom, they are protecting the rich monopolists.

I wasn't expecting that for some reason. I was prepared to be inspired but it never happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I then subscribed to Hulu so I could watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockmire&quot;&gt;Brockmire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is very good and very not-Disney. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Azaria&quot;&gt;Hank Azaria&lt;/a&gt;, the voice for so many great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_cast_members&quot;&gt;Simpsons characters&lt;/a&gt;, plays a washed up baseball play-by-play announcer who ends up in a washed up Pennsylvania town, announcing for a team called The Frackers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's LOL funny.

If you create a public repository with the same name as your account, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/scripting/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;readme.md&lt;/a&gt; file in that repo is displayed on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting&quot;&gt;GitHub home page&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it's Markdown. Might be interesting to integrate some of the status-editing features I'm working on into this. It supports basic web stuff, as you would expect from a techies site like GitHub. Okay this might be fun. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸŽˆ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Last night at the beginning of Maddow they had a tour of the Covid ward at a Houston hospital similar to the ones they did in NYC hospitals a couple of months ago. First we watched a woman die. She was infected at the funeral she held for her husband who also died of Covid. Then they interviewed a patient who explained she was being careful, yet caught the virus anyway. This is how it works when the density of infection goes up, you encounter more virus as you move around, and with more density the chance of you getting infected goes up. That's what they're dealing with in Houston. It was excellent, but they were all Democrats. It would be helpful if they interviewed a banker type, in trouble, in a ward, worrying about the horrible death looming in front of him. Let them see a Republican dealing with an unavoidable awful reality. Might scare them into wearing masks and thereby decrease the density of the virus and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Senators, go to Jacksonville!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-national-convention-rnc-coronavirus-gop-senators-jacksonville/&quot;&gt;Republican senators&lt;/a&gt; are apparently &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to Trump's convention in Jacksonville. Why not? Scared of the virus? Trump says it won't get you. Or does he?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also hope their children and grandchildren will be going back to school in the fall. Kids don't get sick they say, and if they do they don't die, and if they die they were going to die anyway. This is the position of the Trump government. If it's good for Republicans then it's good for their representatives, right??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/decision-2020/trump-to-hold-outdoor-rally-in-portsmouth-nh-this-week/2154220/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday in New Hampshire. &lt;i&gt;They should  go! Don't miss it. &lt;/i&gt;No masks, social distancing, lots of ways to get sick. Very sick. Hey if it's good for Americans, why not the senators? And of course their families. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about striving for simplicity in using JavaScript, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs&quot;&gt;Allen Wirfs-Brock&lt;/a&gt;, who has been involved in JavaScript language design for many years, and was editor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/&quot;&gt;ES6 spec&lt;/a&gt;, responded thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Because of JavaScriptâ€™s &quot;donâ€™t break existing code&quot; policy, often the only way to fix an existing problematic features is to leave it alone and add a better alternative. This inevitably leads to profiles that include the better features and leaves out the deprecated ones.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You probably donâ€™t use &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt; , but most commercial JS devs seem to. There are probably thousands of configuration profiles for it that enforce various style guides and and subset preferences. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardjs.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Standard Style&lt;/a&gt; is popular but controversial both because of its self-assumed name and because of the positions it takes on semicolon usage and other conventions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Regarding choice of function forms, my preference is to use the &lt;code&gt;function hello () {}&lt;/code&gt; form in most situations where I wanted to define a named function, both global and local.  Iâ€™d generally reserve arrow functions for cases where Iâ€™m passing an anonymous function as an argument or otherwise using it as a first class value.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Iâ€™d probably only use &lt;code&gt;const hello= () =&gt; {};&lt;/code&gt; in situations where I need to name a function that needs to reference the this binding of its surrounding environment.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; works in a place where people must wear a mask, so she gives out a lot of masks every day. She's going to make custom masks that have a message. That's the first part of this story. Second part, we both started a campaign called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt;, where we promote stories and ideas that save people's lives in this age where lives have all of a sudden become cheap, something our government is promoting (the cheapness, not the saving). So Jen has designed a mask that has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt; message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;#blacklivesmatter&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?</description>

			<description>Yesterday, I was at a store, did my shopping, but when I took the mask off in the car one of the straps broke. I went back to the store and asked if they had an extra. They gave me one, with a smile. No reason that mask shouldn't have had a message on it.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1280388653433356290&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that showed what the author thought was a cool feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1280388653433356290/photo/1&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript. Labels are 1/2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto&quot;&gt;goto&lt;/a&gt; statements, which we know are &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; to readability and maintainability. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure when I try to grok someone's code that uses this feature, it'll be hard to figure out how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been developing software for a long time. The functionality for users is always at the top of my mind. Getting software rock solid and ideally not requiring any maintenence, that's what I'm aiming for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; thinking about how I can use some new cool feature in the language. I want my code to be as boring and predictable as possible. To look exactly like what it does. Sometimes I get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm using software that I wrote 30 years ago right now, as I write this. That's pretty good for standing the test of time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm thinking the right thing to do for JavaScript is to define a profile, a subset of the language, which if you stick to it, will enhance maintainability and readability, and therefore is more likely to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example, right now I can think of three syntaxes for defining a function. The profile would allow one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function hello () {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;const hello = function () {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;const hello = () =&gt; {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see all example code stick to the profile. Of course once there was one such profile, there would be N. But at least simplifying the language would be up for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would I call my profile? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimplejavascript.com/&quot;&gt;Really Simple JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

How the story of Columbus is told, how it's designed to serve a purpose, all from the perspective of Europeans. You might think, of course it is, this is the US, but a lot of the people who are taught that history are not descended primarily from Europeans. So it isn't their history.</description>

			<description>Last night on MSNBC they just now started talking about how Puerto Rico was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine&quot;&gt;canary in the coalmine&lt;/a&gt;. That should have been topic #1 as it was happening. Moderator, ask your pundit, geez if he'll leave Puerto Rico to die, do you think he'll care whether we live or die? And then wonder what if we get hit by a calamity that isn't local, that affects the whole world. Why do they leave the tough questions on the table until it's too late. The point of the canary is to pay attention when the canary dies. When you're about to die, it's too late. It's so repetitious, they say the same things over and over, for weeks and months. Yet all the important questions, the obvious ones, go unasked.</description>

			<description>Every election there's a new contributor that makes the process more tolerable for die-hards like me. Previously it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/a&gt;, then there was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Every so often you see an article that says men are responsible for all the problems of the world. I don't comment on them very often, I've learned that's a good way to get the online equivalent of a kick in the balls. People can believe what they want, but every man had a mother, I'm fond of saying, and if men are fucked up as a gender, well you made us the way we are, ladies, so there's that. And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/07/republicans-women-senators-348435&quot;&gt;there's this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>
