It took me the longest time to find this song which was buzzing around my head this morning, but I couldn't find the lyrics. What I was ultimately looking for was this line: &quot;What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz.&quot; I was asking for &lt;i&gt;beautiful world&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;beautiful girl. &lt;/i&gt;A few minutes later another bit of a lyric became clear and it turned out to be the title of the song. I brought it to Bard, it got it right off. A few seconds later Alexa was playing it for me. So ChatGPT is also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, which was a breakthrough because all of a sudden we could program our own music. It'd amaze today's young people to know there was a time when we had to depend on radio stations to get around to the song we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jonesing&quot;&gt;jonesing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jonesing&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;. We'd sit there with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck&quot;&gt;cassette recorder&lt;/a&gt; waiting for the song to come around so we could get a copy of it. Then think of what a huge revelation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; was. All of a sudden the floodgates of music opened up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia&quot;&gt;Jerry Garcia&lt;/a&gt; didn't make it to that moment, he would've loved it, I'm sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&quot;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was alive, not sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bollier.org/blog/goodbye-pete-seeger&quot;&gt;how he felt&lt;/a&gt; about it. But anyone who really loved music imho, had to have been overjoyed. People were talking about music in airports and supermarkets. You had to be there. Napster was like years of Christmas every day for music lovers everywhere. Of course the music industry didn't agree.</description>

I'm still pretty confused about what it is, the same way I was confused about the web in 1994 when I first got Mosaic and was reading various early websites. I can use it, but how do I create for it? I have a huge dataset of my own, most of 28+ years of my writing here on Scripting News starting in 1994. Anyway, the first thing I did was ask if I can add my own data to their massive dataset (their term) and it said yes. I asked how, and it sounds really easy, totally within my ability to do, and almost certainly within your ability too. I took screen shots of the relevant parts of the discussion and added it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254#issuecomment-1484102808&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I started on this topic. I will try this out and report back.</description>

			<description>Here's the thing about Twitter. Since they started showing the number of impressions on every tweet, you can see how meaningless the number of followers is. You could have 66.7K followers, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1639404110725402626&quot;&gt;your tweet&lt;/a&gt; might still only get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/25/tweetscreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;764 views&lt;/a&gt;. Once, a long time ago, Twitter was a flow machine. Now it's like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2022/11/29/drying-california-lake-to-get-250m-in-us-drought-funding&quot;&gt;dry lakebed&lt;/a&gt;. A void. It looks like Twitter used to look, but looks aren't everything.</description>

			<description>On the dark side, AI is going to be a great tool for 1984-type governments, because with a single script you could rewrite history everywhere. Write people out, and other people in. Kind of like Wikipedia of course, nothing new actually. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I'd like to have that content loaded into ChatGPT so it can be part of the knowledge base. I am a JavaScript programmer.

What if I have no prompts, what's the result? They say be careful of the cost, what is the cost based on. I feel lost like I did when I first saw what the web could do, I wanted to know -- how do I set up a node on the next. The answers I got from those in the know made no sense to me, until they did.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A small change --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Before the recent transition, when you chose &lt;i&gt;My News Product&lt;/i&gt; from the menu, it would open your news product on my.feedland.org.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After the transition, it opens the same page on newsproduct.scripting.com. This was an oversight, and imho incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now it reverts back to my.feedland.org, which is imho a much more appropriate name.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My new product is at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.feedland.org/davewiner&quot;&gt;my.feedland.org/davewiner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/newsProducts.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for news products. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Looking for Chat/AI expertise</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know if you read this blog, I've been intrigued and enthusiastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chatgpt&quot;&gt;about ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; as many people have, and specifically am anxious to load up one of these with the content of my blog so I can see what can be learned from the aggregation of what I've written. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have over 25 years of archive, all in &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, a flavor of XML. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course OPML can be converted into any other reasonable XML or JSON-based format. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's all by one author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.com/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;, covering roughly the same topics for all those years, including pointers to source sites.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For reference, here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; where my archive is stored.

We don't want to become experts in this technology. But we are willing to do the work to get our data in a compatible format.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to discuss, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I still use Twitter</title>

I don't see any fascist messages, or antisemitism, or race hate, for some reason -- that everyone else seems to see. I still have longtime friends who I only see here. It still has that annoying character limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also use Mastodon, and it's more interesting all the time, esp when it comes to technical discussions. One thing I don't like about Mastodon culture is it seems to assume Twitter is over, and only terrible people use it. This feels a lot like the political divide in the US and elsewhere. I don't find this is a political thing for me. Maybe I'm too old to give a shit. That's probably it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who say Musk is stupid don't understand how this works. No one who has reached his position in the world is even remotely stupid. Same thing with presidents, or people who reach the pinnacle of accomplishment in anything. There's more to it than you can see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk may have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/22/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;screwed with&lt;/a&gt; Tesla's products, but he had the good sense not to screw with the driving experience, which still is like nothing else I've ever loved in a car, and I've had some good cars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has screwed with Twitter, I guess, but so far it's still Twitter after all is said and done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A cool feature for FeedLand users. When you &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; an item, it's automatically added to two RSS feeds -- one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;your likes&lt;/a&gt;, and one for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/all.xml&quot;&gt;likes of all users&lt;/a&gt; on your FeedLand.It's basically a single-gesture linkblog. There's a lot of that in FeedLand, where things have been factored to a point where they couldn't possibly be simpler. Of course since they're standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, you could follow them from any feed reader.</description>

Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nesson&quot;&gt;Charlie Nesson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain&quot;&gt;Jon Zittrain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt; for giving me the chance.

			<description>I remember when I got a key to the building. I didn't ask for it, and I certainly didn't expect it.  My first thought was hmmm i wonder what i can do with &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt;  That's where the regular Thursday evening meetup came from.</description>

			<description>The first thing I did when I started at Berkman, twenty years ago, was to get a blogging server up and running. It was 2003, so I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, a product we made at UserLand. It was the first weblog server at any university, in the world. Early days. A few years after I left they converted to WordPress. A solid move both times because by then UserLand had shut down and the default blogging server was the software made by my friend Matt.</description>

			<title>Don't conflate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you should never do in reporting a bug is conflate two events that might not have anything to do with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to work to figure out that you're doing this. Esp when a lot of unnecessary info is mixed in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because theories like this from people who aren't familiar with how the code works behind the scenes (no reason you should be) almost never get this right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to boil it down to the minimal number of steps-to-reproduce. Those are facts that are incontrovertible. That one problem caused another? Probably not. In general. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;docs page&lt;/a&gt; to answer this question. Looks pretty good to me! No bullshit in the page either.</description>

			<description>Another important feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?userfeedsnews=true&quot;&gt;every user has their own feed&lt;/a&gt;, which you can edit in FeedLand, of course. To write a post, click in the edit box at the top of the page, type some text, click the Post button. It should show up in the list of user-feed posts, below. If you want to edit one of your posts, click on the text, make &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/18/editingAPost.png&quot;&gt;the changes&lt;/a&gt;, click the Update button. Of course there's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Ffeedland%2Fuserfeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for each user, which you can subscribe to in FeedLand or any other RSS-compatible application (there are many, as I'm sure you know).</description>

			<description>It's important for users to have their own feed in the same way it was good to be able to develop software for the Mac on a Mac. Most users will never make a software product, and maybe most FeedLand users won't write publicly, but you want to make it was easy as possible for people to contribute to the ecosystem they use. It's a philosophy of the active not-just-eyeballs users. It's a basic democratic idea.</description>

			<description>It will be possible to create better teachers out of ChatGPT tech. What led me to that is that it certainly could help people write better bug reports. It would have far more patience than a busy developer, whose job is to fix bugs, not decypher a user's (justifiably) imprecise understanding of how software works. But a chatbot could help, patiently asking the user questions. Then, of course, over time -- the user would learn how to do it themselves, and get this -- they would also learn how software works. There might be some great programmers out there who don't know they are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>My blog is being taken over by ChatGPT. It sometimes can replace four apps I used previously: Google, GitHub, Twitter, Wikipedia.</description>

			<description>I was wondering how I could create something that behaved like an app on the Mac desktop from a page in Chrome. I want to use web Drummer to write docs about something I'm working on in Electric Drummer. It helps to have each in its own window for something like that, rather than switching back and forth between tabs. I was going to post a braintrust query but realized I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/chrome-page-to-app.html&quot;&gt;use ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and get the answer right away. It seems to have worked.</description>
