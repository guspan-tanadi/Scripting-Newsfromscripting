			<description>I asked my personal chatbot what I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/coralReefs.png&quot;&gt;about coral reefs&lt;/a&gt;. An example that puts no writers out of business, since they weren't writing about this topic.</description>

			<description>I just asked my chatbot about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_newspaper_strike_of_1994&quot;&gt;San Francisco newspaper strike in 1994&lt;/a&gt;, which was a seminal event for blogging, believe it or not -- and there's probably more stuff in my archive about that event than in the rest of the web. So I'm going to link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22san+francisco+newspaper+strike%22+1994&quot;&gt;Google search result&lt;/a&gt; instead. Let's see how that works! It's a reminder that for some things, Google is still considerably better than my chatbot.</description>

			<description>I've been asking my chatbot what I think of various tech companies, people and products. For example, here's what I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/whatDaveSaidAboutGeneralMagic.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;about General Magic&lt;/a&gt;, a Silicon Valley company that led in early PDA products. The team was made up of past and future tech superstars. Note that I just added to what I say about the company, so it'll be interesting to ask this question again in a few days. We haven't got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmarkdown?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;Markdown version&lt;/a&gt; of my RSS feed flowing through the database yet.</description>

			<description>BTW, it seems Markdown has become the default way to feed new data into chatbots. We're converting my OPML files to Markdown. As always -- Markdown is &quot;Just Enough HTML.&quot;</description>

			<description>Noted that my blog has been taken over by my chatbot which desperately needs a name. I wonder how the chatbot will absorb references to itself. And of course then come the third level references, which is what this post is. Oh the humanity!</description>

			<description>Then I asked if there was a connection between &quot;Just Enough HTML&quot; and Markdown, and omg it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/connectionbetweenjustenoughhtmlandmarkdown.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;got the answer&lt;/a&gt; totally right!

			<description>My new (today!) chatbot, programmed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/scriptingNewsSource/scriptingInMarkdown.zip&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog, going back 28+ years, is up and I've been playing with it, and am as impressed as I hoped I would. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/28/whoInventedRss.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, I asked who invented RSS? Can you imagine how much I’ve written about RSS in 20+ years? The first part is boilerplate, could have come from any site, but the second part was a very concise, thorough and interesting synopsis of years of &lt;i&gt;my writing&lt;/i&gt; about feeds. The chatbot did very good work.</description>

			<description>One great thing about the new chatbot for my blog is that it gives me a greater incentive to post here, vs social media. Of course we must be just days away from a Mastodon instance that you pay to join that adds every tweet to its dataset. A place of record. Maybe they should even charge per tweet.</description>

			<description>In the next election the Dems must make the Repubs defend the idea of school kids being murdered without any help from the government.

I feel like a teen with his first car when I drive it. It's so smooth and powerful, grabs the curves on mountain roads so effortlessly. Elon Musk -- feh. What a schmuck.

			<title>Started on Scripting chatbot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelhop.io/&quot;&gt;pixelhop&lt;/a&gt;, in the UK on this. Started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/255&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For this project, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/scriptingNewsSource/scriptingInMarkdown.zip&quot;&gt;one big archive&lt;/a&gt; with all the stuff I have from 1994 to 2023. All converted to Markdown, organized by year, with a separate folder for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt;, which is how it all started in 1994.

It was the hub for the early blogosphere. I think researchers in general will find it's a strong use-case if not reference source. I was very conscious of this as the years went by, and tried to make it an archive not just for my work but for what was going on around it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Spoilers follow. Last night was the first episode of the last season. At the end, two characters who are married came to the conclusion they'll divorce. A sad moment, beautifully acted. The scene ends with them lying on a bed together, clothed, far apart, but holding hands. I thought, if you're going to do it, this is the way. Let there be at least a little love in the last moment.</description>

			<description>It would be nice if someone developed a Mastodon gateway for apps. A system that played the role that twitter.com played for the Twitter API (only it would be really easy to be better, btw). Otherwise does every developer really have to do one of their own? That's gotta be factorable. Just because Twitter is languishing, it doesn't mean that a new system that does what Twitter did, without any of the Muskness or history, couldn't come in and fill the space occupied by Twitter. Don't assume people don't want. I bet a lot do. Learned this from our experience with RSS. You have to accept facts, not be wishful about these things. Be prepared.</description>

We'd sit there with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck&quot;&gt;cassette recorder&lt;/a&gt; waiting for the song to come around so we could get a copy of it. Then think of what a huge revelation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; was. All of a sudden the floodgates of music opened up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia&quot;&gt;Jerry Garcia&lt;/a&gt; didn't make it to that moment, he would've loved it, I'm sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&quot;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was alive, not sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bollier.org/blog/goodbye-pete-seeger&quot;&gt;how he felt&lt;/a&gt; about it. But anyone who really loved music imho, had to have been overjoyed. People were talking about music in airports and supermarkets. You had to be there. Napster was like years of Christmas every day for music lovers everywhere. Of course the music industry didn't agree.</description>

I'm still pretty confused about what it is, the same way I was confused about the web in 1994 when I first got Mosaic and was reading various early websites. I can use it, but how do I create for it? I have a huge dataset of my own, most of 28+ years of my writing here on Scripting News starting in 1994. Anyway, the first thing I did was ask if I can add my own data to their massive dataset (their term) and it said yes. I asked how, and it sounds really easy, totally within my ability to do, and almost certainly within your ability too. I took screen shots of the relevant parts of the discussion and added it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254#issuecomment-1484102808&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I started on this topic.

			<description>Here's the thing about Twitter. Since they started showing the number of impressions on every tweet, you can see how meaningless the number of followers is. You could have 66.7K followers, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1639404110725402626&quot;&gt;your tweet&lt;/a&gt; might still only get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/25/tweetscreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;764 views&lt;/a&gt;. Once, a long time ago, Twitter was a flow machine. Now it's like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2022/11/29/drying-california-lake-to-get-250m-in-us-drought-funding&quot;&gt;dry lakebed&lt;/a&gt;. A void. It looks like Twitter used to look, but looks aren't everything.</description>

			<description>On the dark side, AI is going to be a great tool for 1984-type governments, because with a single script you could rewrite history everywhere. Write people out, and other people in.

			<title>I still use Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/05/30/elephant.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I still use Twitter because it's still basically the same system it always has been, at least from my point of view. I don't see any fascist messages, or antisemitism, or race hate, for some reason -- that everyone else seems to see. I still have longtime friends who I only see here. It still has that annoying character limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also use Mastodon, and it's more interesting all the time, esp when it comes to technical discussions. One thing I don't like about Mastodon culture is it seems to assume Twitter is over, and only terrible people use it. This feels a lot like the political divide in the US and elsewhere. I don't find this is a political thing for me. Maybe I'm too old to give a shit. That's probably it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who say Musk is stupid don't understand how this works. No one who has reached his position in the world is even remotely stupid. Same thing with presidents, or people who reach the pinnacle of accomplishment in anything. There's more to it than you can see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk may have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/22/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;screwed with&lt;/a&gt; Tesla's products, but he had the good sense not to screw with the driving experience, which still is like nothing else I've ever loved in a car, and I've had some good cars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has screwed with Twitter, I guess, but so far it's still Twitter after all is said and done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

So the messages wouldn't be mixed up with everything in a chat app or an email client. If the point of the conversation is to start a record, make it easy to go back through the chain of thought. And that a thread might last decades, even a whole lifetime. It's time to start thinking about long-lived special-purpose communication apps. We have the experience now, and the perspective.</description>
