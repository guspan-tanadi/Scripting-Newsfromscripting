			<description>If we &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;, the damage to the US economy will be permanent. It won't just be a recession, because we eventually get out of recessions. Poverty will explode. This time the US really will become a third world country. And it won't just cause chaos in the US, it'll be world wide. The media should start explaining what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; is, how the US dollar is basically the only one, and what advantages it gives us (they're huge). Increasing the debt limit costs us nothing, not even money because we can print the currency we repay our debt with. All the Repub hype about economics is, like everything else they say, a lie. The US isn't a family on a budget, it's the foundation on which the world economy runs. Look at it this way, if your family could repay its debt by writing numbers on a piece of paper, would you worry about how much you owe? That a simple version of the reality for the US and our dollar.</description>

			<description>Facebook is so powerful because &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;Obama shut down his campaign&lt;/a&gt; after winning in 2008. The tech industry organized the people around its values, which they were very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/people-at-obamas-tech-dinner-2011-2&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; about. The Dems could've done it. Any news org could have. I begged them to do it, publicly and privately. Everyone who's complaining now, news people and politicians, punted, had no idea what FB did was possible, didn't listen when they were told. If they wanted their values represented, they should have done it themselves. That's how this works.</description>

			<description>How about if we put together say $5 million offer to give to Sinema and Manchin if they vote for the big reconciliation package? If the bigco’s can bribe them, why not the people? It’ll end their careers of course, but at least they’ll have some money to soften the blow.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This image is stark. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure it was Photoshopped, so don't take it literally. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it reminds that there was an earlier attack on the World Trade Center, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing&quot;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;, where the attackers tried to take down one of the buildings and failed. In the second attempt, both towers came down. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this happened with the US Capitol, it would shatter America.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXtwURDAIm4&quot;&gt;Apple's Celebrating Steve Jobs video&lt;/a&gt;. Ten years since Steve Jobs died. Watching this video takes me back many years, to when we were young and full of hope and right in the middle of the whole thing. I had the same realization he had, that you can make the world conform to your ideas rather than the other way around. It may feel like things stay constant, but they're always changing. And the people who made the rules were no smarter or better than I am. I still hope to be able to pull a few more rabbits out of my hat.</description>

			<title>Facebook is us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rant! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The bullshit about Facebook keeps coming. It's not a fucking autocracy, it's a carrier. You could say everything you say about FB about a city like NY. All the companies selling cigarettes were once hq'd in NY. The mayor of NY must be a cancer criminal, right? Such idiots. The journalists have no sense of perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;what Facebook is&lt;/a&gt;. It's hundreds the size of a city like NY. So much happens there. It's created mostly by the people who use it. It's what remains of all the great ideas of networking in the 90s and 00s. A ton of good stuff happens in FB, and a bunch of nasty shit, because -- because &lt;i&gt;Facebook is us&lt;/i&gt; -- it's human. Get a fucking grip pundits. You're making asses of yourselves. I tried watching CNN last night. All these people fighting for their own continued existence and to hide the depravity of journalism are desperate to blame FB for fear someone might blame them. I was expecting to see McNamee (longtime friend) on TV last night, thankfully maybe he's gotten a bit of perspective himself, and realizes it isn't &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; about Zuckerberg. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How to radically restructure &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Separate the users and the content from everything else.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now figure out what that means and we have a plan. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>So if Facebook is evil, why isn’t Apple evil too, because there couldn’t have been a Facebook without the iPhone. The answer is neither is evil. They're both big companies, no better or worse than companies in other industries.</description>

			<description>I had this thought when I was driving into San Francisco in 1979 -- I bet I know a bunch of people here, but I have no way to find them. At some point between then and now, that vision was achieved. Add that to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of things Facebook is other than Mark Z.

			<description>The tech industry was and is so much about self-promotion, selfishness, that there's no way for people who know the history, how we got here, to explain in that context, what Facebook is, beyond all the things the press says about them, and the distilled evil they represent. They are a product of tech, and there was some good in the foundations we built for them to use. And that good is in their product, whether or not they know it, or anyone believes it. It's still there. And if you use it, you must know that. We have the ability to share deep ideas here, not just screaming &quot;look at me&quot; -- maybe this is the time for tech to grow up, before the generation that built the foundation for FB is gone.</description>

			<title>Steve Jobs as Frank Lloyd Wright</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This piece was originally &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/06/myThoughtsOnSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on October 6, 2011, the day after &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/span&gt; died, ten years ago tomorrow. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, my little software &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; was lucky to be invited to work on Apple's new computer in development, the Macintosh. Back then Apple wasn't as secretive as it is today. Everyone knew something was coming. We knew what it was called, but no one was saying what it was.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gladly signed the agreement, and to this day I remember my first glimpse of the Mac. I arrived at a building on &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10460+Bandley+Drive,+cupertino,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.328093,-122.033772&amp;spn=0.034364,0.027509&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=10460+Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;vpsrc=6&quot;&gt;Bandley Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Cupertino some time in August 1983, and was met by Mike Boich and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/span&gt; from the Mac team. As we walked to the conference room, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a beige plastic box that was small and upright. And personal. How it said that to me, in just a glimpse, I have no idea. Is that a computer? Another thought popped into my head: It said &quot;I'm new.&quot; And that was something because back in those days everything was new. And it was personal, for me. All this from a fraction of a second look.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before that I had been an Apple II developer for a number of years, and was a devotee of Apple's products, though I also loved IBM's PC. There was a sense that we were all creating a new world, we all loved our work -- and Jobs and the people he nurtured at Apple, were leaders. I was on stage during the rollout of the Mac at Flint Center on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/01/dayintech_0124&quot;&gt;January 24, 1984&lt;/a&gt;. We shipped our product later that year and went on to have one of the first hits for the Mac. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I want to tell a different story. Not a personal one, because I did not have a personal relationship with Steve Jobs. However, I built products that made it to market through his platforms. And in doing so, my vision was shaped by his. And later, with podcasting and RSS, I got to influence the direction of his products.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish Jobs had been a blogger, had written about his design process, so I could quote something. But he was the opposite of a blogger. Jobs was a mass communicator. No one in my generation has mastered the art as Jobs did. Today, with the outpouring of feeling on the net, are people mourning the man, or the phenomena he could unleash, just by saying &quot;One more thing.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And he was a designer, even though people seem to be overlooking that in their remembrances, calling him more of a visionary. He got down in there and made small but very important design decisions about his products. Ones that had wide impact, for better, or worse. And often they weren't things his products did, rather things his products didn't do that defined them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Mac was full of them. No cursor keys, so you had to use the mouse to navigate. I doubt if money was the reason, though leaving out the cursor keys probably saved a bit, and allowed the other keys to be bigger. It also meant Apple had to design its own keyboard, because they all had cursor keys. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No hard drive. No expansion slots. No fan. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A standardized user interface. This was very controversial with software developers such as myself. We felt what we did was user interface design. What would we do if the UI was already designed. New ideas sometimes don't get accepted right away by everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there were the almost-great ideas, like having networking built into every Mac starting with the Mac Plus. At the time networking wasn't even an option on IBM PCs. The networking, while a bold and great idea, didn't have the impact it should have had because the programming APIs were impossibly difficult. Had they been easy the Mac would have been the web, and we could have saved 20 years of incremental upgrades to turn the web into what the Mac was in 1984. #&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And at times Steve forgot where his ideas came from, or seemed to. He tormented Bill Gates, probably in jest, that he was stealing his ideas from Apple, when they both stole from Xerox. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had some personal interactions with Jobs, but they weren't very special. I doubt if he knew who I was. He called me once, out of the blue -- to rant about the stupidity of people at Apple. This was in 1997 just after coming back. Even today, after all these years, I have a hard time saying I agreed with him, and I didn't say so in the conversation, I just stayed silent. He doesn't suffer fools quietly, that's for sure. Ooops, he didn't. Hard to think of him in the past tense. Why did he call me then? I have no clue. #&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the first rush of memorials, people are comparing Jobs to Henry Ford (industrialist), Thomas Edison (inventor) or Walt Disney (media). But there's also a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright&quot;&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt; in there. All these men had imperfections, and greatness. But Wright's were, imho, more Jobsian than the others.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He's so wonderfully prickly and famous for bursting into any house he built un-announced - just come in with a troop of people and show them the house, rearrange the furniture. He would even sneak into the houses to rearrange the furniture when the owners were away,&quot; T.C. Boyle wrote of Wright, but it also describes how early Mac developers felt after demoing their products for Steve. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To both Jobs and Wright the people who used their products were not as important as the computer or the building. More than the thing itself, what mattered to Wright, and I think what mattered to Jobs is the integrity of his vision. In a way it was a shame that the vision had to be instantiated.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jobs has also been compared to Leonardo Da Vinci, but I think that's something for historians to say, a couple of hundred years from now. Honestly, even comparing him to Ford or Edison is a bit over the top, because their achievements are understood with a hundred years of perspective. We are all contemporaries of Jobs, so our judgment isn't historical. He had a lot of impact on our lives, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a historical impact.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course that's what made their ideas so great and influential. Among the many Jobs quotes worth remembering, and quoting -- Artists ship. I agree. And when you ship, along with the vision, comes reality. And then you learn and ship again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There might still be Jobs shipments to come. We don't know what's in Apple's pipeline. But his thinking and vision, his person, will influence others and drive them to greatness, for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Radical ideas for political pubs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1444705859582533635&quot;&gt;Idea&lt;/a&gt;. For a few weeks, assign a reporter to read the Twitter comments for all the stories, but don't announce anything. Look for people who write intelligent comments with new ideas that people in your circle never come up with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are out there, might take some effort to find them. Recruit new ideas. We need you to do that. Be a contrarian. In journalism the assumption is that comments are disgusting. Take an opposite view for a short period of time, and see objectively if there aren't some diamonds out there in the middle of all the crap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another radical idea for political pubs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear blogs are back? They call them newsletters now. They all have RSS feeds, of course. How about gathering a list of all the newsletters people on your staff read, publish the list, and run a river of all their letters, when they come out. A way of revealing your sources in a new dimension. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Build relationships with the smartest of them. Become known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connoisseur&quot;&gt;connoisseurs&lt;/a&gt; of political thought. How could that hurt your pub? Pay special attention to ones that criticize your specific publication. Always listen to your most passionate users, that's how you improve over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I read about how Biden's popularity is dropping, I wonder if there's any reality to this. If it were really a troubling sign that means in the next election, Americans will do what Germans did in 1932, we'll vote into power a fascist party, and open the US to concentration camps and mass exterminations of our own citizens. You may think this is wild, but before Covid the idea of 700K Americans dying of a disease that was largely preventable, because of disinformation from the government itself, that would have seemed like a paranoid delusion. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/&quot;&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to preserve that perspective. If the US actually does vote Repubs into power, we deserve what we get.</description>

Best line so far: &quot;A sad white person is still a white person.&quot; Try changing that to black and see if it gets through the censors. Also a reporter that gives up his sources shouldn't be a reporter.</description>

			<description>Here's the big problem with Ted Lasso season 2. You have to like at least one character in a sitcom like Ted Lasso. That was the charm of season one, the star, the person the show is named after, was very likeable, and so were almost all of the others. Nice people, you cheer for them. This season you have to brace yourself because at any moment the formerly likeable Ted Lasso is going to do something supremely assholelike. I'm not joking. Come on. Anyway it's just like Apple to switch the user interface radically without any warning, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs&quot;&gt;ask Gruber&lt;/a&gt; about where they moved the freaking &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-tabs-for-webpages-sfri11576/mac&quot;&gt;tabs&lt;/a&gt; in the new version of Safari. It's conceivable that a character could reveal a very well hidden dark side and pull it off, but it's not very common and they totally don't pull it off.</description>

The monthly ritual is done, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/09.opml&quot;&gt;OPML for September&lt;/a&gt; is uploaded to the GitHub repo, where interested &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; geeks can use it to experiment with interop. There's over &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;four years&lt;/a&gt; worth of archives there to play with. Also &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; testers can see techniques that work in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/span&gt; blogs that they may not have seen.</description>

			<description>Facebook tells me today is &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakesav.in/&quot;&gt;Jake Savin's&lt;/a&gt; birthday. He's a young man, I don't know exactly how young. Jake worked at &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/span&gt; on Manila. Oct 1 was also my dear departed &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;uncle's birthday&lt;/a&gt;, it would have been his 76th. I miss him every day. He would have loved the web, especially Wikipedia. Ken was always looking stuff up in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please&quot;&gt;Information Please Almanac&lt;/a&gt;. Ken's mind would no doubt be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outspanned/status/1437301987884871682&quot;&gt;blown&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis is legal in much of the US, at least the parts of the US you'd want to visit. He grew the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikileaf.com/thestash/what-is-sinsemilla/&quot;&gt;sinsimilla&lt;/a&gt; back in the 70s and 80s. I was trying to explain to a friend what that was, to no avail because all weed is seedless these days. Ken had an efficient way of killing off the male plants. He'd cover and uncover his seedlings with a blanket to simulate spring. The tiny baby plants would flower, and thus reveal their gender. Only the female plants produce the resin that humans like so much. 😀</description>
