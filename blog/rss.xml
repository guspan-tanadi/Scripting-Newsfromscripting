			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/06.html#a153119&quot;&gt;asked Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt; where we go to talk about ideas for making our products work together in interesting new ways. Where do we go to congregate? I just watched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/19.html#a160614&quot;&gt;fantastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Laurel-Canyon-Season-1/dp/B0882JGTTV&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Laurel Canyon in Hollywood in the 60s and 70s, near &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Strip&quot;&gt;Sunset Strip&lt;/a&gt;, which had lots of bars, for all kinds of music and the musicians who made the music. Lots of famous names. People who created a generation of pop music, with lots of collaboration. This is a necessary component for tech. When I first arrived in Silicon Valley in 1979, I kept looking for the pulse of the place. Where do people meet up. And within hours I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almanacnews.com/square/2007/05/09/what-are-your-memories-of-kens-house-of-pancakes-in-menlo-park&quot;&gt;Ken's House of Pancakes&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/888+El+Camino+Real,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4524062,-122.1802984,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fa4b21d83e8ef:0xd20e5a3bace86209!8m2!3d37.4525122!4d-122.1802369!16s%2Fg%2F11b8v7w2wj&quot;&gt;El Camino&lt;/a&gt; in Menlo Park &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almanacnews.com/morgue/1999/1999_03_17.kens.html&quot;&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; a good place. There was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/siam-garden-menlo-park&quot;&gt;Siam Garden&lt;/a&gt; also in Menlo Park. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chefchu.com/&quot;&gt;Chef Chu's&lt;/a&gt; in Los Altos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpineinnpv.com/&quot;&gt;Rossotti's&lt;/a&gt; in Portola Valley and of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck%27s_of_Woodside&quot;&gt;Buck's&lt;/a&gt; if you like VC. For a few years, my yard in Woodside was a frequent party place. I am amazed by all the people who came to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=bloggercon&quot;&gt;BloggerCons&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so now we're on the web, we've been here for 30 freaking years. Where do you go if you have an idea you want to share ideas with other developers, who may not develop for the same platform, or work for a large company. This is missing. At one point the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg000001.html&quot;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt; on this blog served that purpose, but it was taken over by trolls, of course. But nowadays we have less crazy ideas about &quot;free speech&quot; and know how to ruthlessly dispose of trolls. I'd like to figure this out.</description>

I hope in a few years all these discussions about what's the optimal number of characters for a post will be seen as farce, like the scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)&quot;&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt; where the Emperor says Mozart's opera has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMWy3EpEo_o&amp;t=29s&quot;&gt;too many notes&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think it's up to Emperors or software developers to have opinions on what's the right number of characters in my writing. What if in turn, as a writer, I said your code couldn't have more 500 characters per file. What's the likelihood that this edict would make any sense? Hopefully that puts it in perspective. There's a simple solution available to everyone, a &lt;i&gt;More&lt;/i&gt; link at some arbitrary breakpoint, that does enough to encourage short posts if that's what you're after. And it also makes sense to writers.</description>

			<description>I keep finding legit tasks for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. For example, I have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlCloud/blob/main/desktop/iobridge.js&quot;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; that hooks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt; up to websockets. If a file is modified, a message goes to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlCloud/tree/main/server&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn forwards the message to N listeners. Chokidar is a very nice utility with lots of configuration options, but sparse docs. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to improve latency, ie the time it takes for a change to a file to be noticed and acted on. The docs provide some vague clues, but when I asked ChatGPT if I could adjust the latency, it gave me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/27/reducelatencychokidar.png&quot;&gt;clear yes&lt;/a&gt;, and showed me how to do it. Also suggested there might be lesser-known toolkits that would be better for this kind of application.</description>

It appeared as if I wasn't able to get it to build. Problem solved. My written build instructions were missing a step. I couldn't move on until I solved this problem. Electric Drummer is essential software to my daily work. I do all my for-work writing here. That's a very basic thing, and something I might take on, starting from scratch with an online world that assumes the writers are &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; able to write in their favorite apps. If an online system can't accomodate this, we don't write for them.</description>

			<description>Anyway -- now that Electric Drummer is building, there are lots of things to fix now that the lower-level code that it uses has been fixed to accomodate HTTPS. When they say supporting HTTPS is a breeze, only if you don't already have a codebase. Those GoogleHoles are &lt;i&gt;sooo&lt;/i&gt; sneaky. Just like Russian propagandists. It's okay this is the relatively easy stuff. Of course fixing these problems will break other things. Sigh.</description>

He plays a football star named Joe Pendleton who is accidentally killed but when he gets to heaven they realize the error and send him back to earth in the body of Leo Farnsworth, a rich capitalist who is among other things is screwing a town where Julie Christie's family lives and she has come to protest. But Joe is a sweetheart hippie type, and a really a nice guy but he's in the body of an asshole. They fall in love anyway, but then the angel (played by James Mason) says Joe has to give up the body of the asshole, it's his turn to die for real, but he can have the body of another football player, so he tells Julie to watch out for a stranger who has a twinkle in his eye, and she has no idea wtf he's talking about. But then Farnsworth dies, and she's somehow at the big football game and meets the quarterback (who is really Joe but doesn't realize it) and they go off for coffee and you can tell they're going to fall in love and all is good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of course is you fall in love with the soul of a person, not their outward appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But not the way I expected it to go. I kept banging my head on the Electric Drummer codebase, and I couldn't get it to build. Of course I have a process for that, but it had been months since I did one, and somewhere in there something stopped working, silently. I gave up in frustration after a few hours of slogging, getting nowhere, and on my way out, cleaning up after my failed adventure, I realized I could do it without changing E/D at all. It's a long story, no space for it here -- but I wanted to close the loop. I am now able to edit my &lt;a onclick=&quot;alert ('Instant Outline')&quot;&gt;I/O&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a onclick=&quot;alert ('Electric Drummer')&quot;&gt;E/D&lt;/a&gt; and I'm a &lt;a onclick=&quot;alert ('Happy Camper')&quot;&gt;H/C&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I've been thinking about how memos work in highly structured organizations. When you're cc'd on a memo as CEO you like to see up front if there are no action items for you below, that this is just an FYI thing. When I was a CEO, a long time ago, I never had the time to read every sentence in every memo I was cc'd on, nor would it be appropriate. Everyone had to learn to be clear about the presence of action items before starting their narrative. Just putting an FYI at the top with a short list of people who have to act. Most memos, I found were totally informational, ie contained no action items for anyone.</description>

Why not. But you should choose a modest name for your effort. By calling it Podcasting 2.0 you're basically forcing anyone else who wants to do something here to call theirs 3.0 or 4.0. Just come up with a random name, like &lt;i&gt;The Oslo Project.&lt;/i&gt; How did I come up with that name? I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; to do it : &quot;Please give me 10 random names of European cities with less than 4 syllables in their names.&quot; Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/randomCityNames.png&quot;&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; it came up with.

Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/colornames.png&quot;&gt;color&lt;/a&gt; names. Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/23/yiddishwords.png&quot;&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt; words. And then please, look at what the other guys are doing and instead of implementing something slightly different with a different name, just do it their way. The only goal here should be upgrading the user experience and interop, so there's no freaking lockin. Keep the bullshit to a minimum. &quot;Available where you get your podcasts.&quot;</description>

			<description>I'm still trying to figure out how to retrofit Instant Outlining in &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; without having to implement support for the new email-based identity system. It's especially hard to do that for an Electron app, it took a huge effort to get Twitter identity in there. E/D stores files locally, and combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/publicfolder&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt;, means it doesn't need any help storing stuff where it's public accessible. The hard part, I'm finding, is to figure out where I need to stop it from overwriting one of the head-level attributes. I wrote all this code, but it's so freaking complicated. Having cleared that up, I'm now ready to take another approach. I'll let you know how it goes.</description>

			<title>It's only me</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/16.html#a160316&quot;&gt;searching&lt;/a&gt; for this quote from John Lennon, and found it &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecoleopterawithana.tumblr.com/post/182351610145/one-of-my-great-memories-of-john-is-from-when-we&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt; Paul McCartney: “It’s only me.”  Here's the full quote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of my great memories of John is from when we were having some argument. I was disagreeing and we were calling each other names. We let it settle for a second and then he lowered his glasses and he said: “It’s only me.” And then he put his glasses back on again. To me, that was John. Those were the moments when I actually saw him without the facade, the armour, which I loved as well, like anyone else. It was a beautiful suit of armour. But it was wonderful when he let the visor down and you’d just see the John Lennon that he was frightened to reveal to the world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you’ve lost your way in a long friendship, hopefully there’s an &lt;i&gt;only me&lt;/i&gt; place you can get back to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Things had to move around, of course, because of HTTPS. And the addresses of the blogs have changed too. Sorry, but we did a big migration there, you can see the role identity plays in online work. We were depending on a private company that became &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk+on+the+twitter+api&quot;&gt;wobbly&lt;/a&gt;, so that's what caused the breakage. The foundations we build on on the 2023 web basically suck. Sorry I wish it weren't so.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/179&quot;&gt;Drummer blogging is now restored&lt;/a&gt; on the new system. Things had to move around, of course, because of HTTPS. And the addresses of the blogs have changed too. Sorry, but we did a big migration there, you can see the role identity plays in online work. We were depending on a private company that became &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk+on+the+twitter+api&quot;&gt;wobbly&lt;/a&gt;, so that's what caused the breakage. The foundations we build on on the 2023 web basically suck.

			<description>I never ask personal friends to subscribe to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. I also never look to see who's subscribed. Not a guarantee I never will, but in practice, I don't want to know who's tuned in and who isn't. I don't ask personal friends to subscribe because they might choose not to, and that's not something I want to try to parse. Everyone's free to do as they want, and to not know what the choice was, unless the other party wants to make it known. Complicated? Yes, and still evolving.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/18/bigLittleLies.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I went through my midlife crisis in the 90s. Till then, my life was directed toward success. Something I wanted ever since I was a small child. I wanted to do something great and creative. Maybe invent something. I wanted my life to have meaning. I wanted to make a difference. And I wanted to be recognized for my accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I arrived in the 90s with most of the boxes checked. Then I waited for the feeling of satisfaction. I waited for everyone whose approval I yearned for to approve of me. Nothing. Emptyness. All the approval felt conditional, hollow, not based on any understanding of who I am. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, did I approve of myself? No, not in any way. I was living a lie. Trying to design myself to fit into everyone else's idea of a worthwhile man. I wasn't listening to myself. I was letting other people define me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still had another hill to climb, to learn how to listen to the internal chatter always going on inside me. All the voices, who were they and what did they want? Which were the powerful ones, and which were just nagging critics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started writing publicly frequently, and then every day. I took risks, and told stories that didn't used to make it to journalism. I was offered a writing job at Wired. And I developed software to support this new activity, and in the process created something new, and this time wasn't aimed at fame and fortune, checking the boxes. It was simply something I wanted to have. Not saying the software I did before was just for checking boxes, that was never the case. Just that this was the first software I made that had nothing to do with checking the boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did was start therapy in 1994. Eight years on the couch. Talking about myself. Being heard by someone whose job it was to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first big discovery came a couple of years in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated with something a relative did. I said &quot;I know what he's doing right now.&quot; I was sure of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The therapist asked: &quot;How do you know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That stopped me. I said: &quot;I don't know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I asked: &quot;Why didn't you ask that before?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Therapist: &quot;I've been asking all along, this is the first time you responded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big lesson was, as you dream your way through life, before you make a decision, check with your senses to see if the perception was right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Always ask yourself how you know what the other person is doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from 1997 that goes into much more detail on this idea. &quot;I know this sounds geekish, but it pays to use the scientific method in relationships with other people.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The archive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been writing on web 28+ years and all of it is archived in machine-readable form, no scraping needed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m fascinated by the idea of a ChatGPT type app digesting all my writing so I can ask &quot;myself&quot; various questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some writers are scared of having their archive turned into the learning material for an AI chatter, but not me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to be a guinea pig.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you need a license I will provide.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let me know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The idea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The bot would appear to be me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So you'd say -- how old are you?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it would answer -- 67.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What do you think of microsoft?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And then it would come up with the answer i would come up with.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, I've now been through switching two HTTP apps to HTTPS, and what they say about it being easy to retrofit is just marketing, ie nah, it's no more true than Node is single-threaded. In some cases, for a simple static website, it can be totally automatic. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;. It's a miracle, if you think HTTPS is a requirement. But if you're talking about an app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, it's a pretty large undertaking, with cascading problems, and fraught with opportunities for breakage that could be hard to find (I'll let you know in a year or two, knock wood). Using HTTPS means you have to use it in everything the app comes in contact with. Google and EFF as bright as they are haven't anticipated every way of building software on the net. This was a lesson I had learned before. We thought converting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/personal-computers-software-first-idea-processor.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; from the IBM PC and Apple II to the Mac would be easy. Ultimately we had to write a new product from scratch. The assumptions were different. But in that case &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; made the choice, not Google and the EFF.</description>

In a perfect world I'd be able to plug one in. But we are very far from that. We were closer in the late 80s and early 90s. That was my goal then, to turn the apps of a GUI into toolkits for people who wrote scripts to connect them to create their own applications. Why should I have to write a whole word processor to have a new feature that no one else knows they need. If I could hook my emailer up to my outliner, I would get better use of the drafts I wrote. The ultimate goal is to do all my writing in my favorite writing app, and send &lt;i&gt;pointers&lt;/i&gt; to the writing to the other apps, emailers, chat apps, CMSes, there would be only one original, and if I made a change to the original the updates would flow to all the places I sent pointers. Again we were much closer to this 30 years ago than we are now. But I think we have a chance to start fresh now with these goals. That's when you want to do this kind of integration for interop, at the beginning, before there are any apps. It's very hard to retrofit later, I can't say I've ever seen it work.</description>

			<description>There's this great scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt;. McCartney and Lennon are disagreeing, it's getting personal, or heavy in some way. Lennon looks at McCartney, big pause, and says &quot;It's just me.&quot; The founders of the Beatles. The biggest rock stars. The whole franchise. On the other hand, they were nobodies together. Now everyone thinks we're so important, but come on, it's just me. Funny thing is, when you're a nobody you're desperate to be somebody. And when you're the biggest somebody there is, you yearn to be a nobody again.  Nothing ironic about it, it's almost mathematical. BTW, if you find this clip on YouTube, I'd love to include it with this post.</description>

It has been a really &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/10/023900.html&quot;&gt;stressful&lt;/a&gt; couple of weeks, while working with developers on getting FeedLand open source release out, I had to also rip up Drummer and put in a new identity system. All the code was written but it still was an ugly transition, one you hope to never have to do. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/178&quot;&gt;Report problems here&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to give us steps to reproduce. If we don't understand what the problem it'll be hard to fix it.</description>

I know you don’t come from the US so you might not know that here Blacks and Jews are equal, in theory. We’re all fighting for that to be recognized. Legally we have the same rights and deserve the same respect. That’s why your behavior was both bewildering and unacceptable, and why you feel you were chased out of NYC, which is an especially tolerant part of he US because it is a cultural melting pot. We all have to get along, and accept and even celebrate our differences. Your view of the world just doesn’t fit in here. Maybe they’ll like you better in Dallas, but I’d be surprised if they do.</description>

			<description>Drummer users, we're almost ready to switch over to the new Drummer. If you want your files moved to the new server, you have to register your Twitter address and email address a new utility app. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/177&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; carefully. It takes less than a minute. All you need is access to the Twitter account you used for Drummer and to know what email address you want to use for your Drummer identity.</description>

			<description>What if friends treated their friends as nicely as they treat dogs. When you sensed they needed a little support, you'd look them in the eye and say &quot;Who's the good girl?&quot; Rub behind the ears and when they sit give them a treat. Inside of us, everyone, including you, is a little pup who just wants to know they're in the right place doing the right thing.</description>

The revulsion was gone. These were two New York teams, roughly comparable, and there weren't any carpetbaggers or Nazis on the floor, at least none that I knew of. The weird feeling was pride. This is NY basketball. I like it. Both teams have a good foundation to build on, and lots of first round draft picks in the bank, so there's hope for more talent. But don't import people who already have their championship rings who expect us to root for them. We want a unique experience, suitable for our great city. I'm still a Knicks fan, but I could see myself rooting for the Nets. BTW, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/heat/miami-news/nba-top-performers-of-the-day-feb-13-jalen-brunson-has-big-game-to-lead-knicks-past-nets&quot;&gt;Knicks won in a blowout&lt;/a&gt;, that also contributed to the good vibe. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If I were giving advice to NBA team owners, don't sign players who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving&quot;&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt;. No one wants to see a team win just because they bought famous players with no hunger, and no link to the hometown. I love where the Knicks and Nets are now. I think NY is the best basketball city in the NBA.</description>
