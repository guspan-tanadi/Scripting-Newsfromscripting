			<description>A cool feature for FeedLand users. When you &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; an item, it's automatically added to two RSS feeds -- one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;your likes&lt;/a&gt;, and one for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/all.xml&quot;&gt;likes of all users&lt;/a&gt; on your FeedLand.It's basically a single-gesture linkblog. There's a lot of that in FeedLand, where things have been factored to a point where they couldn't possibly be simpler. Of course since they're standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, you could follow them from any feed reader.</description>

The friends I made there still benefit me to this day, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference.</description>

			<description>So it's been twenty years since I started at Berkman. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nesson&quot;&gt;Charlie Nesson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain&quot;&gt;Jon Zittrain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt; for giving me the chance. Met so many who became lifelong friends, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference.</description>

			<description>I remember when I got a key to the building. I didn't ask for it, and I certainly didn't expect it.  My first thought was hmmm i wonder what i can do with &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt;  That's where the regular Thursday evening meetup came from.</description>

			<description>The first thing I did when I started at Berkman, twenty years ago, was to get a blogging server up and running. It was 2003, so I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, a product we made at UserLand. It was the first weblog server at any university, in the world. Early days. A few years after I left they converted to WordPress. A solid move both times because by then UserLand had shut down and the default blogging server was the software made by my friend Matt.</description>

			<title>Don't conflate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you should never do in reporting a bug is conflate two events that might not have anything to do with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to work to figure out that you're doing this. Esp when a lot of unnecessary info is mixed in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because theories like this from people who aren't familiar with how the code works behind the scenes (no reason you should be) almost never get this right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to boil it down to the minimal number of steps-to-reproduce. Those are facts that are incontrovertible. That one problem caused another? Probably not. In general. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, if you're being asked to log in every time you go to the site, you're probably opening it via a bookmark that goes to the old URL.

But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;docs page&lt;/a&gt; to answer this question. Looks pretty good to me! No bullshit in the page either.</description>

It's a philosophy of the active not-just-eyeballs users. It's a basic democratic idea.</description>

			<description>It will be possible to create better teachers out of ChatGPT tech. What led me to that is that it certainly could help people write better bug reports. It would have far more patience than a busy developer, whose job is to fix bugs, not decypher a user's (justifiably) imprecise understanding of how software works. But a chatbot could help, patiently asking the user questions. Then, of course, over time -- the user would learn how to do it themselves, and get this -- they would also learn how software works. There might be some great programmers out there who don't know they are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I was wondering how I could create something that behaved like an app on the Mac desktop from a page in Chrome. I want to use web Drummer to write docs about something I'm working on in Electric Drummer. It helps to have each in its own window for something like that, rather than switching back and forth between tabs. I was going to post a braintrust query but realized I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/chrome-page-to-app.html&quot;&gt;use ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and get the answer right away.

			<title>Register RSS piece</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was the tenth anniversary of Google shutting down their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/google-reader-shutdown.html&quot;&gt;Reader&lt;/a&gt; product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Register had some questions, which I answered via a voicemail, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/15/interviewAnswersForRegister.m4a&quot;&gt;included here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turned into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/14/requiem_for_google_reader/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, which I offered some corrections:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;UserLand Software&lt;/a&gt; no longer exists, I left in 2002, and we shut it down a few years later. I'm just a person now, not part of any company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS 1.0 was not a fork, not sure how you'd characterize it, but it was definitely not a fork. It was a whole new syntax, had no compatibility with RSS 0.91.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS 2.0, which appears to have been left out, was finished in September 2002, and was supported by the New York Times, and thus was supported by the whole news industry and became the standard. Though some disagree, it was backward-compatible with RSS 0.91 and 0.92.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Atom was a new format, again -- not a fork. It gained some popularity and is still in use.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I wasn't stupid, I understood this was propaganda, but I loved the way they did it -- as a genre. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/13/autographFromSixthGrade.png&quot;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt; in one of my best friends' autograph book when we graduated sixth grade and went on to junior high.</description>

			<description>Another glitch -- the other day I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/11.html#a150413&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; FeedLand users who had not already registered an email address to do so now. It's basically impossible for me to test this, because I don't have any accounts to use to test this since the connection with Twitter has been pretty glitchy lately. It turns out it's too late to do this transition, so we'll go ahead with the switch to email identity for feedland.org. When it switches over, you'll have to log into feedland.org using your email address, which should work for people who pre-registered. I know it's complicated, I hate it -- it's the worst use of both of our time, we get no new features for all this bullshit. But Twitter is no longer reliable in this role, so we had to do it. I'll keep you all posted here on progress, and appreciate your patience. I think it'll all be pretty smooth after this change.</description>

Probably due to the switch to Daylight Savings Time, the wrong version of Scripting News went out at midnight. This feels familiar, but there's nothing in my notes about how to work around this. I will have a look at the code during the day today and see if I can figure out what went wrong. I was able to get the correct email to go out at 6AM EDT today by editing the stats.json file for the app to indicate that the email for the day hadn't yet gone out, and it immediately started sending out the correct email.</description>

			<description>On the other hand, we should have an &lt;i&gt;open source Twitter replacement&lt;/i&gt; that's fucking easy to install and runs itself. Node.js. Runs on desktop in Electron for local users. It could be much easier than Mastodon. A fractional-horsepower tweeter. If anyone wants to work on that, let me know, I'd like to be part of such a thing (mostly as a user and app developer).</description>

			<description>Okay now I have to tell you about my latest experience with ChatGPT. The subject is CSS. It's possible to do all kinds of crazy logic on DOM elements, given all the different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt; they have. But how to combine them to do what you want to do? You can stare at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; for hours, and do trial-and-error, but if you're like me, you gave up before you even started. But with ChatGPT, you can formulate the question according to what you want to do, and it creates a docs page that probably never existed before, that shows you, with examples, how to do what you want. I just did that. Amazing. It digs you out of corners. Nothing like this has ever existed.</description>
