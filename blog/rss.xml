			<title>Today may be historic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a very unique day, a first-ever -- Twitter is not exactly the world's town square, as some say. It's a world network, of people mostly, the API hasn't really been used very well. Everybody speaks on Twitter, and today everyone has something to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? A core part of this network is being fired. They all have the ability to communicate with everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reverberations may be felt like nothing before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a sense of this because being one of the first to host a blogging community I learned how strange it is when the people using your software are all able to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When one of our services went down, and we had trouble getting it back on the air, the eruption made the national press. This was in 2004. Twitter is orders of magnitude larger, but it's the same basic idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people all have a podium. Some of their ideas will get through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In 2022, the ability to move simple documents around the net is limited to PDF and Word, both of which are designed for printing not online. What's stopping this? Agreement on what a document is. Twitter says it's titleless and limited to 280 chars. RSS readers say they must have titles (the readers are wrong, btw, nothing wrong with posts without titles). Blogging software, on which Twitter is based, arrived at a simple definition, and that's what I propose Twitter support because it has the simplest and yet most powerful distribution system, and basically everyone who writes is already hooked up to it. This inability of the best network to move documents around reasonably instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1588189183277166594&quot;&gt;as GIFs&lt;/a&gt;, is ridiculous in 2022. It's as if you had to carry a tank of gasoline in your electric vehicle just because they couldn't figure out how to design a car without a gas tank. Total bullshit. This is a feature they could charge for and it would be worth it. It would not be punishment for users for freeloading (as Musk seems to be positioning it). We should start out in our new relationship with a better understanding of what they do and what we do. We write. They provide distribution for writers. Let's make that work really well. No reason you can't make a good living doing that.</description>

			<description>One thing that's great about Musk's takeover of Twitter is that all of a sudden everything is in motion. I've wanted Twitter to allow it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1523656621833875457&quot;&gt;to peer&lt;/a&gt; with simple blogging systems. At least someone is listening to these ideas now. I noticed yesterday that Substack is now openly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SubstackInc/status/1587854840939663366&quot;&gt;competing&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter, again a good thing -- we need more choice, and the non-moving Twitter has been a serious obstacle to progress.</description>

			<description>I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1587794609828159488&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter today documenting how Chrome was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/mangledrssscreen.jpeg?nodialog&quot;&gt;mangling&lt;/a&gt; RSS feeds, had been for many years. I didn't know this was Google's plug-in. As far as I knew this was the way Chrome shipped. It's possible I installed it myself, it would have had to be a long time ago. But I just right-clicked on the XML icon in the browser's chrome and chose to uninstall it, and I viewed an RSS feed and it came out &quot;literal&quot; -- here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/rssInChrome.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. All that wasted time. I didn't need to write the xmlviewer app. Oy. I wonder what else I am missing.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; has been great for me because I don't have to beg Google Reader (or its successors) to support a feature in RSS I want to try out. I just do it. And I can support it in my blog or any of my content-generating tools. This is how you bootstrap new standards.</description>

Previously I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;xmlviewer&lt;/a&gt; app. Mostly because browsers mangle XML text. For some reason they don't mind displaying &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; literally. (This may account for why some developers don't like XML.  Anyway, there's a lot more information about the feed on the FeedLand page, and it's also set up so that if you are logged in, you can subscribe with one click. And of course I don't mind if you do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
