			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt; is pretty stable. I'm using it in all my JavaScript browser and Node projects. It would be great if people would &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues/10&quot;&gt;port it to other environments&lt;/a&gt;. Make it easy to do a great job of supporting the format used &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; outliner &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; and RSS subscription lists.</description>

			<description>Inside your head is a thing called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious&quot;&gt;subconscious&lt;/a&gt; that's primitive, has little understanding of the world. It mainly sees you, and projects all its memories on you. It's looking out through your eyes the same way you view the cosmos. WIth awe but little actual understanding.</description>

			<description>I had a doctor who retired recently who always referred to me as a friend. I never doubted her sincerity, and it was a really good thing to do because it reminded me at a conscious &lt;i&gt;and subconscious&lt;/i&gt; level that there was trust between us. It's a given. If you can't trust your doctor, you need to get a new doctor. So I've started to do that in my own mind as I narrate projects to myself. Okay that's done &lt;i&gt;my friend. &lt;/i&gt;Let's figure out what's next friend. &lt;i&gt;My friend&lt;/i&gt; this is a hard problem. I just add the punctuation to remind myself that I trust myself, I'm doing something I'm good at, and know it. It really does manage the mood of my subconscious, it's reassuring. I got this, really means &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; got this.</description>

			<description>A friend who was an early blogger sent me a link to a story about how blogging came about and no mention was made of how blogging actually came about. He thought I should give them hell. It's the way it goes. All we are is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2w6Oxx0kQ&quot;&gt;dust in the wind&lt;/a&gt;. The journey is the reward. Live in the moment. It is what it is. Yadda yadda.</description>

			<title>The Knicks are the un-Nets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People think so linearly about the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few players out there with the potential of Donovan Mitchell to lead a team to dynasty. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of what the Knicks have to offer a potential trader. The Knicks bench is filled with potential like few others are. We've got a stockpile of draft picks. And the Knicks and the Garden and the talent are starting to get interesting to players. Like the way they want to go to Duke or Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks are the un-Nets. The Knicks are building, not trying to buy a post-season powerhouse.  Look where that approach got the Nets. What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://netswire.usatoday.com/2022/09/03/shaquille-oneal-agrees-that-nets-star-kevin-durants-career-is-a-failure/&quot;&gt;mess&lt;/a&gt;! ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So sit tight, this is not the end of the dream of what those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/knicks/roster&quot;&gt;kids on the bench&lt;/a&gt; could become. They can become lots of things, not just Donovan Mitchell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Countdown with Keith Olbermann</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You should be listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-countdown-with-keith-olbe-99705496/&quot;&gt;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt;. He's saying the things I've been thinking about the news, how the business really works, from the inside, the things they will never say on CNN or MSNBC. Plus he's incredibly funny. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the things he won't say about I Heart Radio, the company that owns his podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Clear+Channel&quot;&gt;Clear Channel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/clear-channel-communications-inc-history/&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; dominant force in broadcast radio and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=clear+channel+billboards&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZ39eBjyVCa1XTI5iai3tHDrUwBNQ:1662226537560&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiitrqylPn5AhUbGFkFHdqKDZUQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=1000&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;outdoor advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They would probably love to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, but they aren't so all their podcasts available &quot;where ever you get your podcasts,&quot; my favorite phrase that I will never get tired of hearing. (I own that, I made sure podcasts would be that way.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I Heart Radio hopes to stop saying that at some point. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how much they pay Olbermann or if it depends on whether they can lock it down?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All that said, listen while it's not behind a paywall, it's wonderful Golden Age of Podcasting stuff. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

The computer system can be pretty &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/03/134450.html?title=whyNotDriveATesla&quot;&gt;fucked up&lt;/a&gt;, the same way Macs are because Tesla did more than make an EV. I also have a ICE, a relatively new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subaru&quot;&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; and as you say it's incredibly reliable too. That said, I never drive the Subaru. It's sitting there waiting for winter, my thought is that it might work better in the snow than the Tesla. But I literally never drive it because the Tesla is so much more fun to drive.&quot;</description>

Instead they'll groom their own superstars. There are so many good young prospects already playing for the Knicks. Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, RJ, Sims. This is team, the one they already have, is worth being patient for. And the current Knicks management, by hanging tough, remains a powerhouse for future deals and there will be more deals. Mitchell is a fine player, but far from the only one.</description>

			<description>The beginning of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2022/08.opml&quot;&gt;month ritual&lt;/a&gt; is done. I can't believe it's already September, on the other hand, it's freaking me out how cold it is this morning. I might have to put on a sweatshirt. It feels like summer just started. Maybe I need to move to Florida or Palm Springs. Oy. I love the mountains, but I dread the winter. Maybe it won't be so bad this year.</description>
