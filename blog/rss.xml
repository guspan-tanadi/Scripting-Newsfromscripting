			<description>Reporters forget past atrocities, so they can re-discover them, so it's (as far as they're concerned) news -- again. This makes their job approachable. Anything beyond this would require them to adapt, risk, improvise, grow. In software, ideas from users can be confusing, but also incredibly valuable. Users have nothing invested in the way you do things. They just know what they want. Knowing what users want is valuable, but news doesn't incorporate that, because they never listen to users, they only listen to each other, and often not even that.</description>

			<description>It's true that in 2016 Trump said he wouldn't honor the vote if he lost, but there is a big difference between then and now. Now he's the president, and he lives in the White House and is commander in chief of the armed forces. There's a lot of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Time Trump can really fuck things up for us, beyond how fucked up they already are. Everyone thinks Trump is going to lose but refuse to leave. I think he has another plan. When I was playing a board game with my little brother when we were kids, if he didn't like how it was going, well you know what little brothers do. That's Trump. A snotty ass little brother if there ever was one. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I have a huge collection of MP3s and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a&quot;&gt;new Android phone&lt;/a&gt;. Is there a music-playing Android app that can access files in Google Drive? I've been using that to transfer photos and movies from the phone to other devices and onto the web. I could easily do the same with music if I could play the MP3s from GD.</description>

			<title>BingeWorthy profile pages</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal with profile pages.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You have &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has signed on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; has one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They list all the shows you've rated, from best to worst. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Profile pages are designed to share. When someone asks for a list of good things to binge, instead of thinking of a few off the top of the head, share a link to your profile page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can edit your name, the image URL, description so if you're not happy with the initial versions (which we got from your Twitter profile), you can change them in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/25/settingsDialogLocation.png&quot;&gt;Settings dialog&lt;/a&gt; in BingeWorthy. All this is echoed in your Facebook and Twitter metadata, so it'll show up when you paste a link into those services, and many others that read this form of metadata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If your screenname is bullmancuso, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is your profile page. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, please post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/188&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot of the top part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Trump plus the virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading this piece, carefully, word for word and beling relieved that there was a way to fight the virus. It's a summary of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; McNeil did on March 12. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html&quot;&gt;March 22&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Terrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's one of those things that I'll remember forever. Before listening, I had no idea how we fight this. After listening, I understood how it works. And that it had worked, in China and South Korea and other places. It would have amazed me then that here it is 6 months later and only a few states have done it remotely this way. Our efforts in the Northeast are primitive in comparison, but they worked. A lot of people were made very sick, and a lot of people died, but we got the virus under control. But it's raging out of control elsewhere in the country. You know when the Dems say the election is about health, they're talking about the ACA, but that's wrong. There's a pandemic raging through our country and it's growing again. We have to connect with this. And we won't have any hope, any hope at all, if Trump remains president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini&quot;&gt;September 7&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If you accept the premise that [Trump is] hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and I do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's time to be scared. In the moment when you still have power. Later it will be too late. Trump plus the virus -- that's what we're up against. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We need a new doc like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration&quot;&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, totally non-partisan, that we can declare our loyalty to. In today's language. We re-commit to re-form our government, so it can't be abused as Trump has. An oath to our reboot.</description>

			<description>Biden's campaign had a slogan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/&quot;&gt;Build Back Better&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't stick. Campaigns need slogans. For example, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ThinkTank%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; we had See What You Think. Of course Trump has many. MAGA. Mexico will pay for it. Fine people, on both sides. We'll have to see. Just a few. It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY&quot;&gt;Yes We Can&lt;/a&gt;. That's pretty good, hard to refute and doesn't really commit to anything in particular. I liked &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1840981_1840998_1840901,00.html&quot;&gt;FDR's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvk_uLnv4uo&quot;&gt;Happy Days Are Here Again&lt;/a&gt;. That campaign happened long before I was born, but in a sense, I remember it. The same way I guess today's kids remember the Beatles.</description>

			<description>Why does the browserâ€™s Back button not work in Facebook? When you hit the Back button you're taken to a random place. You have to remember to look for a link to the previous comment, or the post, and usually you forget. No other website works like this. And once you erroneously hit the Back button the Forward button doesn't work either. The place you were at is lost. This is pretty bad for software that's ten years old, and the bug persists even in the new version, suggesting it's a deep flaw in the design, or worse, it's intentional.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1308794854332403713&quot;&gt;I asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: If you decide to leave &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; can you take your subscriber list with you, or do they own that? And the answer is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465992-How-do-I-export-my-email-or-subscriber-list-&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/a&gt;, you can export your subscriber list as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/a&gt; file. So I wonder why people would stay with Substack after they get a certain amount of income. They get 10% for doing something that doesn't cost very much. If they're making say $1000 a year off your mail list, why not take distribution in-house? That's a straight question. I want to understand how the business works. Thanks.</description>

			<title>McConnell's weird bet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that McConnell is betting on a few things that seem contrary to the worst that we believe about where we're headed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He thinks there's a good chance Repubs will be out of power in January. Either he'll be out of the majority in the Senate or Trump won't be president. Otherwise why rush to get the next judge approved? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He thinks the Supreme Court continues to matter after the election. If we're going totally authoritarian, the court doesn't matter, they're puppets. They'll do what they're told to do or off to the concentration camps with them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's the Occam's view of this that maybe makes more sense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell&quot;&gt;McConnell&lt;/a&gt; is 78, an old man, and he's got maybe one more term in him, maybe not even that. He's playing a game for the sake of the game, the same way a compulsive crossword puzzler has to finish the Sunday NYT puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He set out to do one thing in his life, turn the court Republican. It may not matter at that point, in any real sense, but he wants to win the game, a game that as soon as a few months from now people will have forgotten was ever played. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: As observed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/22/010105.html?title=ourMomentOfPower&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, he's driving turnout, for Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I wrote this in 2014</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Posted on Facebook on this day in 2014.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From the last episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/show/roosevelts/&quot;&gt;The Roosevelts&lt;/a&gt;, a friend explains that when Eleanor Roosevelt was touring, when she'd meet someone who wanted to tell her how she had helped them, she didn't show interest, she just rushed on to the next thing. Why? She didn't have time for that. She's busy doing stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel the same way when people say they respect me for work I did ten or twenty years ago. I only care about that to the extent that it means it might be a little easier for me to do the next thing I want to do. Ironically, it works exactly the opposite way. The more people feel your accomplishments are in the past, the &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; they let you do now. (My philosophy is to do it anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same thing happened to her uncle, President Theodore Roosevelt. He left office at 50, desperately wanted to stay involved, but couldn't find a way to do it. This is the guy who built the Panama Canal. When the US finally got into WWI, he tried to enlist, but President Wilson wouldn't let him. Instead he sent his four sons off to fight in the war, while he stayed home. To him this must have been torture. He died at 60, I assume because there was nothing for him to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ER said the same thing, as long as there were still things to do, as long as her life had a purpose, she wanted to keep living. As soon as their stopped being a purpose, she wanted to die, and she did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My stuff is coming together in ways I only dreamed about in the past. I have no time to think about what happened in the past, except in ways it makes me wiser about things I do now and in the future, and if it makes people more open to the idea that I might be doing something of significance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Why? She didn't have time for that. She's busy doing stuff." created="Wed, 23 Sep 2020 13:15:32 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/23/131519.html?title=iWroteThisIn2014#a131532"/>
				<source:outline text="I feel the same way when people say they respect me for work I did ten or twenty years ago. I only care about that to the extent that it means it might be a little easier for me to do the next thing I want to do. Ironically, it works exactly the opposite way. The more people feel your accomplishments are in the past, the &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; they let you do now. (My philosophy is to do it anyway.)" created="Wed, 23 Sep 2020 13:16:37 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/23/131519.html?title=iWroteThisIn2014#a131637"/>
				<source:outline text="The same thing happened to her uncle, President Theodore Roosevelt. He left office at 50, desperately wanted to stay involved, but couldn't find a way to do it. This is the guy who built the Panama Canal. When the US finally got into WWI, he tried to enlist, but President Wilson wouldn't let him. Instead he sent his four sons off to fight in the war, while he stayed home. To him this must have been torture. He died at 60, I assume because there was nothing for him to do." permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/23/131519.html?title=iWroteThisIn2014#aNaNNaNNaN"/>

				<source:outline text="My stuff is coming together in ways I only dreamed about in the past.

			<description>My internet was down today. Oy! I was just warming up, had written a piece about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/22/123759.html?title=weNeedOccamsNews&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/22.html#a125519&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; about the wonderful word naÃ¯vetÃ©, when boom -- I'm offline. I made two trips into town to try to connect, but eventually gave up,went for an excellent bike ride on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ashokanrailtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Ashokan Rail Trail&lt;/a&gt;, a local wonder. I learned that I should have a few printed books around, or at least one downloaded to my Kindle, and some videos that are downloaded on my iPad. Luckily I had a few episodes of Brockmire and they were lovely. The whole thing is so LOL good. Really you do LOL. Rare thing. I tried watching a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt; season 3, but it's garbage. Bad writing. The first season was so great because it was written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Waller-Bridge&quot;&gt;Phoebe Waller-Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The acting and the sets, they carry through all the seasons, but sheez, no one tells stories like PWB. So instead I planned out my next few projects, something totally worth doing, instead of wrapping up an abbreviated version of the big one I had been attempting. Tomorrow is another day, knock wood, praise Muphy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL#:~:text=IANAL%20is%20a%20Usenet%20and,particular%20addressee%20of%20their%20remarks.&quot;&gt;IANAL&lt;/a&gt;, my mother loves me, and all other disclaimers.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://themarkup.org/&quot;&gt;The Markup&lt;/a&gt; has a new service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://themarkup.org/blacklight/&quot;&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; which rates websites based on how much spying they do on their readers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://themarkup.org/blacklight/?url=scripting.com&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; does well, but they complain about one thing: the site interacts with &quot;an ad-tech company&quot; -- AWS. They've discovered that I load content from Amazon S3, which is true. That's where I store the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images that make up the site. I'm a paying customer and if they do any spying with the log info, that would be imho unethical. This is a problem with services like Blacklight. They make assumptions that things are nefarious when they're innocent, and if they become popular they constrain the web. This goes against the most powerful thing about the web, it's the platform with no &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22platform vendor%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I love the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/na%C3%AFvet%C3%A9&quot;&gt;naÃ¯vetÃ©&lt;/a&gt; because I'm an old time computer user. I started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card&quot;&gt;punch cards&lt;/a&gt;, then graduated to all upper case terminals with 40 character displays and thought they were incredible, until I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazeltine_1500&quot;&gt;Hazeltine terminal&lt;/a&gt; that had upper &lt;i&gt;and lower&lt;/i&gt; case characters and 80 columns. I was in heaven. But now you can include words with all that fancy punctuation, and wow isn't that amazing. And naÃ¯vetÃ© is such a great word, you actually get two of them in one freaking word. It's only been 80 years but look at all the progress.</description>

			<title>We need Occam's News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Wake me up when we get &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Occam's News%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;, because there's a lot of really weird reporting going on these days that makes me wish someone would just cut the bull and report what's really happening, not what they feel they can prove. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yes, Covid is tranmitted via air. This is considered controversial? Why then were nursing homes such great incubators for Covid? Meat packing plants? Schools? And why are supermarkets not? Answer: When you pack a building full of people who stay there for hours they get sick. Because the virus lingers and accumulates. The load is what matters. As more sickness spends more time in an enclosed space the chance you'll get sick goes up. I don't care what it says on the CDC website. You shouldn't either. Obviously Trump is fucking with it. Or so says Occam.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then you hear reporters ask, full of naÃ¯vetÃ©, why does the CDC keep changing their guidance. They don't you idiot! That's what I want to scream at the reporter. Although of course the reporter knows what's going on. Some Trump apointee got their sweaty hands on the password for the home page of the CDC website and they edit it. The CDC knows, just like we know, that the virus is transmitted as described above. Trump knows too. But he wants his supporters to not know. Shhh. Otherwise they might wear masks. Can't have that. Only Democratic sissies wear masks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are many other things like this, maybe I'll add to the list. In the meantime &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Occam's News%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt; says you should report what's obvious, not what can be proven. Later, if it turns out you were wrong, apologize and correct your reporting. Politicians take advantage of the fact that reporters will only say things they know for sure, and then they'll add &lt;i&gt;alleged&lt;/i&gt; just to be sure, because the worst thing they can think of is being caught saying something that's wrong. Instead &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; they say is wrong, because it's watered down and stupid. We know that Barr and Trump are sick fucks. Stop pretending they aren't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, it's been encouraging to see CNN break out of the non-Occam school lately. They don't pretend that there's some controversy over whether or not you should wear a mask. They say the president is an asshole when he makes people come to his concerts without wearing masks. So good for them. But they ought to just go all the way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And by the way, when Maddow laments that we have to get the info on our own, does it ever occur to anyone at MSNBC that they are a fucking communications machine. They could put up a page that would say what the CDC would say if they weren't corrupted by Trump. Why sit on the sidelines and complain. Solve the fucking problem Rachel. Come on! (This is what I yelled at the TV last night, which is why you need to have a blog like I do, so you can do this too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/30/152537.html?title=howToFightMiceInCars&quot;&gt;Mouse Wars&lt;/a&gt;. I've inundated the car with peppermint and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bounce-Fabric-Softener-Sheets-Outdoor/dp/B003FULBQ4&quot;&gt;Bounce sheets&lt;/a&gt;. Parking it outside, not in the carport. I think the mice like the carport even without a car. I also bought a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C5DECBBE-4F56-4C36-B933-E62144578691?tag=meastus-20&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-5v7BRAmEiwAJ3DpuOsz49iXrSiSpBb72lentx8D88xp2hcCYLD-BK_KD06oQO_kDldVdBoCn5UQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; cameras for the house. I figured that I should put one of the cameras at ground level next to the car, and see if any mice show up in the dark of night. So far one rodent, not particularly interested in the car. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3t5AfNKyk&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. I love using spying hardware in the War Against Mice.</description>

			<description>People who think they can predict the near-future, look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1307722350775930888&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, and imagine it was a year ago, looking a year into the future. Explain why the Hudson Yards Mall in NYC is a ghost town. You'd never in a million years guess the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;true reason&lt;/a&gt;. It's so frustrating when smart people quote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablum&quot;&gt;pablum&lt;/a&gt; they hear on the cable news shows. Those are bedtime stories. The world is far more dangerous and far less predictable. Go back and watch the shows from a year ago to see how well they did.</description>

BTW, politically, RBG dying is the best thing that happened to Collins.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincolnproject.us/&quot;&gt;Lincoln Project&lt;/a&gt; is in a bind. As Repubs, they want to own the Court for the indefinite future, and here's their chance. Now the work they're doing to elect Biden is against their own interests. It's time for them to decide whether they really think we're going authoritarian, i.e. if the Supreme Court still matters if DJT wins. This may be nothing more than an election issue, only of symbolic value, if Trump has no intention of listening to the Court in the future, assuming he &lt;s&gt;wins&lt;/s&gt; stays in power. The Lincolns seemed damned either way.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/187&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I am running the OPML Editor, which is a distribution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, on a Mac running MacOS 10.13.6. Works fine. I'm afraid to update this computer, because I don't know what Apple is going to do to it. I use Frontier to write my JavaScript code, and also to keep around as an archive for about 20 years of work, that's still unmatched elsewhere. I don't want to lose my ability to run Frontier. Anyway I had a thought. Why not run Frontier inside VMWare, using 10.13.6, and then I could run it on any Mac. I think this would work and I could stop worrying about Apple breaking my work environment.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It just hit me that a lot of things are piling up on us. Like overdue bills we received the final notices years ago, we didn't pay up and now they've all come due at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Authoritarianism. When the Senate didn't remove Trump after impeachment that was the end of the American system of checks and balances. Local government is broke.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Pandemic. We dismantled the government units we set up to deal with it. We taught the world how to deal with this crisis, but we ourselves lost our way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Climate. Fires in California and Australia, hurricanes worse every year. The crisis will get worse in the future, but it's here now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Economy. Small business and individuals are in deep trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Education and health care. How can they survive pandemic?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Trump is in power after the election, then you can add another.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Looting of US complete. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of these mainly apply to the US, although the country is so central to the world economy and culture, it's hard to imagine the lines don't get crossed elsewhere, eventually. We're being dragged down the same hole as Russia and China, for example. How can Germany, France, etc avoid it. The UK is in the toilet with us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
