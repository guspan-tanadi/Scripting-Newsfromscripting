			<description>When species go extinct, other species they keep in check will grow, possibly explode. If it were bats, for example, that might mean more Covid-19 type viruses. Human-killing viruses come from bats because they have more powerful immune systems. It's all balanced.</description>

			<description>On the west coast, every town has a few hot tub rental places. You pay a fee, about $10 or $20 an hour, and you get a private room with a hot tub. Soak for an hour. Come out a new person. Here's the list for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=hot+tub+rental&amp;find_loc=Berkeley%2C+CA&quot;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. In Palo Alto there's the grand &lt;a href=&quot;https://watercourseway.com/tub-rooms/&quot;&gt;Watercourse Way&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want the best, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esalen.org/page/esalen-hot-springs&quot;&gt;Esalen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://harbin.org/&quot;&gt;Harbin&lt;/a&gt;. Of course you might want to wait until the fires are over. Nothing like this exists in the east. In all of New York City, the closest you could get was a communal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/nyregion/after-124-years-the-russian-and-turkish-baths-are-still-a-hot-spot.html&quot;&gt;Russian bath&lt;/a&gt;, that's like 100 years old. And no it's not the same thing. Once they legalize cannabis in NYC, they're going to need to open up some hot tub places for people to mellow out in.</description>

			<description>Speaking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, in Madison. He's been working on a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; for Node to go with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;XML-RPC for JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; package I wrote. We talked about lots of stuff, esp philosophy of maintaining networks of software. We both agree &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation&quot;&gt;deprecation&lt;/a&gt; is a bad idea. I didnâ€™t know that there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=2020+riots+in+Madison%2C+WI&quot;&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; in Madison. We talked about Kenosha in that context. We need better news folks, too much repetition and they're leaving out important information. Riots in Madison? That is for sure news for this lifetime &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Badger&quot;&gt;Badger&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>A NYT reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1305244745917063169&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about early/mid 00's bloggers. There was a lot of response. I thought this was weird, a throwback to the thirst for recognition in the early blogosphere. The names offered were some of the famous ones, and I felt the same frustration I felt back in the day when the style sections of pubs like the NYT &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; those bloggers famous, and ignored the ones who weren't as young, but had deep experience in something other than blogging. The story always was here come the bloggers, look at how weird and stupid, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;Microserfs&lt;/a&gt; way, they are. If they looked a little deeper and more optimistically, they'd discover that their sources were going direct, and now they can do a different less superficial kind of journalism. That would have been powerful, instead we got the fearful story. Over and over. Blogging is and always will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources go direct%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;sources go direct&lt;/a&gt; to me. I want to know what you know. And thanks for sharing. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I want to see one major publication's editorial page or opinion writer say how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; betrayed us, and how reporters must not do that. If you have information that can save lives, err on the side of disclosure. I was hoping that Ben Smith would do it in his weekly column, instead he went after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/business/media/the-intercept-source-reality-winner.html&quot;&gt;The Intercept&lt;/a&gt;. Reporters do that, go after safe targets, believing perhaps they'll never work with someone from The Intercept, or need a quote from the owner. As far as I know not one op-ed writer has said what Woodward did was bad.</description>

			<description>BTW, I've written about The Intercept several times, including this important &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/12/04/theSnowdenLeaksAndTheBillionaire&quot;&gt;follow-up&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, that's actually still outstanding as far as I know.

			<title>Chrome playing video halts screen saver</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago my Mac stopped going to sleep when I left. Not only will this burn out the monitor, it's a security problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried rebooting. No help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tried quitting all my apps. Then the screen saver would start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now to figure out which app was the culprit. I figured it was Dropbox, my first guess for anything going wrong. Sorry. But it wasn't Dropbox. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was Chrome. If it thinks you're watching a video, it will keep the Mac from going to sleep. I had a window from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agora.io/en/&quot;&gt;Agora&lt;/a&gt; open, because I was interested in it and planned to go back to learn more. Well it has a video on the home page. It didn't even register with me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I closed that window, waited a minute, with Chrome running, and the screen saver kicked in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A reminder if you have this problem in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The number of dead, for purposes of the election, should be the projected number as of Election Day. And a question should be part of the discussion. Do you want to be one of the dead ones?</description>

			<description>I had a heated discussion yesterday with a dear friend who I greatly respect, about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; thesis. Here's the question I asked, at the core of my case, and I'd ask it to Jay Rosen too, and to you dear reader, if you think what Woodward did was understandable and/or excusable. Why do you care about winning the election? What are you trying to prevent? Think about it. If you're listening and not arguing, you'll get it.</description>

			<description>I had to write a piece about this before I realized that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best/worst example. Had it been a random reporter at the NYT, I think people would have looked at it differently. The Times brought us many terrible things like WMDs in Iraq and Hillary's Emails. Holding on to such an important bit of information about the president, and the snake oil he was selling about the disease, would be less excusable perhaps if it were a reporter no one heard of, instead of the most famous reporter in the world, possibly the most famous reporter ever. Who feels qualified to criticize The Great Woodward, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter&quot;&gt;St Peter&lt;/a&gt; of the Church of the Savvy.</description>

			<description>Someone on the NYT op-ed page has to call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; out. But journalism always covers up the sins of journalism. Please let me know if you see journalism &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing this, I'll give them an award. It never happens. If only Rachel, Chris, Al, Joy, Wolf, Erin, Jake, Brian or Anderson looked at the Woodward case, and broadcast a message loud and clear, &lt;b&gt;if any other reporter does this, we're going to crucify them.&lt;/b&gt; They do it regularly for Facebook. Someone has to do it for them. We pay too high a price for their inability to admit the most costly errors. They've all set a terrible precedent by remaining silent.</description>

			<title>Firmware file not compatible</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I update my iPhone using iTunes I get this error message.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The iPhone could not be updated because the firmware file is not compatible. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No one seems to know what that means when you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22firmware+file+is+not+compatible%22&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for it on Google, and none of the advice works and it's happened a number of times, and every time I have to re-discover the workaround. This time I'm writing a blog post so when I search for it, I'll have the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't update the phone with iTunes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can update it over wifi, it doesn't need iTunes to do the update.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open the Settings app, scroll down to General, open it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on Software Update. Follow the instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Works every damn time!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's basically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs&quot;&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/a&gt; method of updating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I gather lots of other people were out for the first time too. But, maskless people were hugging all over the place. Hard to fathom. People my age, high risk people.</description>

			<description>When I was a kid, still in elementary school, my parents bought a new car. A Pontiac Catalina, perhaps. One year I was given the job of rotating the tires, something you do to even-out the wear. I had to look deep into the trunk, and I could see way in the back, a cutout in the panel under the rear window that had a speaker, and a pair of wires disconnected from the speaker. At the time a rear speaker was a high-value luxury feature, esp for kids who sat in the back seat. I hooked the wires up and asked my father to come out and turn the car and the radio on. The speaker worked. My parents, buying the car, had not opted to pay for the rear speaker, but I guessed that it was cheaper for the manufacturer to put the speaker in every car, and only hook it up if you paid for it. Never forgot that, it still influences my software design to this day.</description>

			<description>In JavaScript you can initialize an array with [] or &lt;i&gt;new Array ().&lt;/i&gt; I generally use the latter, because it's easier on my old eyes. It's hard to see the difference between {} and [], however it's very easy to see the difference between new Object () and new Array (). I consider ease for the programmer to be very very very important. I hardly ever use the word &lt;i&gt;very, &lt;/i&gt;btw. :-)</description>

			<title>I wrote this last year</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I posted this a year ago on Facebook. It was a good idea then, but it hasn't aged well. I guess Trump curdled, or the divisiveness is now locked-in. At this point I don't care about saving Trump acolytes. They're going to have to figure it out on their own. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump is a TV show. If you want to get rid of 10 or more percent in his following, program a Trump TV show every night that isn't news, it's actors in a soap opera, playing the roles of people in Trump's White House. We hang out with him during Oval Office tantrums, and during pajama time in the morning with Fox and Friends, and watching TiVo of Rachel Maddow at lunch time. If this gets too boring, or for premium access, have him masturbating. His fans just want to be at home with Trump. Give them what Trump won't. Change the conversation from one about Trump that he controls to one that is focused on his boredom, sloth, immaturity, depravity, bad hygiene (false teeth), criminal behavior and shitloads of lying. Introduce new characters, like his cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="&lt;i&gt;I posted this a year ago on Facebook. It was a good idea then, but it hasn't aged well. I guess Trump curdled, or the divisiveness is now locked-in. At this point I don't care about saving Trump acolytes. They're going to have to figure it out on their own. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Sat, 12 Sep 2020 22:53:15 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/12/225308.html?title=iWroteThisLastYear#a225315"/>
				<source:outline text="Trump is a TV show. If you want to get rid of 10 or more percent in his following, program a Trump TV show every night that isn't news, it's actors in a soap opera, playing the roles of people in Trump's White House. We hang out with him during Oval Office tantrums, and during pajama time in the morning with Fox and Friends, and watching TiVo of Rachel Maddow at lunch time. If this gets too boring, or for premium access, have him masturbating. His fans just want to be at home with Trump. Give them what Trump won't. Change the conversation from one about Trump that he controls to one that is focused on his boredom, sloth, immaturity, depravity, bad hygiene (false teeth), criminal behavior and shitloads of lying. Introduce new characters, like his cardiologist." created="Sat, 12 Sep 2020 15:20:56 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/02/29/repubs.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/12/225308.html?title=iWroteThisLastYear#a152056"/>

			<description>If I were president of the United States given infinite power for just an hour, I'd establish by decree a new holiday, &lt;i&gt;National Everyone Love Each Other Day.&lt;/i&gt; On that day it would be illegal to talk about polls, or bases, or divisiveness. People matter. That's it. The patron saint of National Everyone Love Each Other Day would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rodney_King&quot;&gt;Rodney King&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Woodward betrayed us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're still debating whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Woodward%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; should have said anything when he had the president on the record about the real threat of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Last night &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1304189572562268161&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt; weighed in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I am unconvinced by the criticisms of Woodward, and by the claim that he could have saved lives but chose not to. I also think we are failing to credit him for putting the fullest story he felt he could tell before voters during election season, when it would count the most.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hear this from other people, so my response is well-rehearsed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It would have made a difference. Hearing the president say in his own words, in a tone of respect the public never hears from him, was eye opening. In February or March it would have been transformative. No doubt it would have saved many lives. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We've learned a lot about the ethics of medical trials lately. If they're testing a drug and discover it saves lives without harmful side-effects, they're obligated to stop the test and give everyone the drug. No more control group. No more placebos.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Similarly, a programmer who waited months to report a security flaw would have a lot of explaining to do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Yates#Acting_Attorney_General&quot;&gt;attorney general&lt;/a&gt; who is aware that an officer of the government is compromised by a foreign adversary is obliged to report it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Woodward's excuse that he didn't know if it was true is lame on lame. It was true that the president said it. And it was clearly a contradiction of what he was saying publicly both in substance and tone. That's enough to get it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/28/errOnTheSideOfDisclosure.html&quot;&gt;on the record&lt;/a&gt;, and let the public decide how it wants to proceed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If youâ€™re writing a book, hoping for a blockbuster, and accidentally uncover information that can save lives you are imho similarly obligated. The book isnâ€™t more important than the lives the information can save. I remain unconvinced myself that there is any justification for holding on to the information.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is about our humanity. The people who died had families, people who were devastated by their death. They had painful deaths. And for crying out loud -- they died! What higher cost is there. The deaths continue. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In March we weren't yet polarized on this subject. Hearing the president's &lt;i&gt;respectful&lt;/i&gt; voice could have kept it from being political, for at least some people, and thus saved some of their lives. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What higher calling is there for a journalist, even for the legendary Woodward, who every journalist cites as the example they hope to live up to, than saving lives. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The president for some reason wanted to impress Woodward. That was some rare good luck for the American people, at the beginning of a very dark year, and a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Church of the Savvy%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Church of the Savvy&lt;/a&gt;, maybe the &lt;i&gt;High Priest of Savvy, &lt;/i&gt;decided we couldn't benefit from it. I don't think there's any question he did something wrong. I think he's as wrong as Trump himself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Finally, water under the bridge you might say. But I want to know what other vital information reporters are sitting on, for whatever reason, and who has to pay with their life for their vanity. By giving Woodward, the role model, a pass, you excuse more Savvy reporting. And then who knows whose family will be hurt. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In medicine, if they're testing a drug and discover for sure it saves lives without harmful side-effects, they're obligated to stop the test and give everyone the drug. No more control group. No more placebos. It's ethical. Sometimes the information you uncover makes a difference, and holding onto it has an unacceptable cost. Same in journalism.

			<description>In June, I was interviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson&quot;&gt;Walter Isaacson&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/26.html#a193208&quot;&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pacific-content/trailblazers-with-walter-isaacson&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about podcasting. They only used a few bits from the recording to tell their story. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/04/isaacsonAudio.m4a&quot;&gt;full recording&lt;/a&gt; of my side of the interview. About 40 minutes. You can't hear the interviewer's questions, but it's not too difficult to figure it out. As always I'm very long-winded. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/04/isaacsonAudio.m4a&quot;&gt;full recording&lt;/a&gt; of my side of the interview. About 40 minutes. You can't hear the interviewer's questions, but it's not too difficult to figure it out.

			<description>BTW, when they say a billionaire like Jeff Bezos made $60 billion in 2020, that's paper profit. The gains will be lost when the market crashes, as it is sure to do. It's not like having the money in a savings account. We're in a big market bubble now, maybe the biggest ever.</description>

			<description>If you think only in terms of public opinion, youâ€™re in a trance. Youâ€™re not a pundit on CNN. How do you know if you do it? Here's an extreme example. I say geez it would have been so easy for the reporter to save a few thouand American's lives. And you say, but I don't think his base would care. So perverse, even depraved. Yet I had that exact exchange repeatedly on Twitter last night. Think about how dehumanized you've become. These are people. Their families and friends were devastated by their deaths. They suffered terribly before they died. And they died! Geez Louise. Where is your humanity. And btw, no one, and I mean &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; people give a shit about your punditry. You should factor that in as well.</description>

			<title>Nick Arnett, California fire fighter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've known &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickarnett.net/&quot;&gt;Nick Arnett&lt;/a&gt; since he was a tech industry analyst in the 80s when I was the CEO of a software company. Since then, he has re-invented himself many times, always in public service. These days he's a California fire-fighter, working on the front lines. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/arnett.nick/posts/10158685257688197&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the following on Facebook. I'm reposting it here with permission. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Iâ€™m starting to hear conspiracy theories about the fires. Although I understand the appeal to the part of our brains that longs to believe someone has control, they are still quite disturbing. Today, I heard that people believe this is all intentional, intended to destroy rural America. I canâ€™t help but think this puts us far closer to civil unrest or war than Iâ€™d ever have imagined possible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Equally scary is how entrenched the beliefs are, even though we know that the rumors are conspiracy theories promoted and encouraged by enemies who wish to bring about our downfall. They are succeeding, again far more than I would ever have imagined possible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Iâ€™m not sure there are big solutions. I am certain of the truth and power of my favorite words from Mother Theresa: Do small things with great love. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Voting is a small thing for each of us. Do it based on what you love, rather than what you oppose.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A cynic might ask, and our country is full of cynicism,  what difference would it have made if Woodward had disclosed what Trump said in March, in March. Well, it might have saved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99oE_Yw4YA&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;this woman's father's life&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life.&quot; We've got to start caring about each other.</description>
