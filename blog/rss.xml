			<description>People &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1514078580602454020&quot;&gt;seem&lt;/a&gt; to want movement in FeedLand. It's been &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/rssChangeNotes#2091802Dw&quot;&gt;almost 20&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; since the last time RSS was refreshed. I've mostly stayed away because the community was pretty flamey. But so much time has passed, we could use some new developer tools, and namespaces based on how feed publishing has evolved over the 20 years.</description>

			<description>The other day I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/10.html#a235429&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I'd use Instagram a lot more if I could post from my desktop or iPad.

			<title>Sources Go Direct, explained</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sources Go Direct is a concept I've been promoting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources+go+direct%22&quot;&gt;long time&lt;/a&gt;, without a simple one-page explanation of what it means. Here's my attempt to solve that problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The term focuses on the flow of news. Before the web news flowed from sources to reporters to readers. Some readers were sources of course. And sometimes reporters were sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/07/fdBox.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+disintermediated&quot;&gt;disintermediated&lt;/a&gt; news reporting as it did to other things. It's a fancy word that means that people went around the intermediaries. So travel agents which used to be a big thing, were replaced with Expedia and Kayak. We got information about real estate from Zillow. And the sources of reporters got blogs, and then Twitter accounts, and started going directly to the users of news. Of course there still are travel agents, and when I bought a house recently I used an agent to help me, but I did a lot of researching myself on Zillow. And there are still reporters, of course, and they use the tools that sources use, that's how they get the information they pass on to their readers. We're much better informed these days about lots of things. Some info we get through intermediaries and some we get directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the late 90s and into the 00s, we needed the term Sources Go Direct to focus our reporter friends on the role bloggers were playing. They jumped to the conclusion that we were trying to be reporters. Most of us were not. We had expertise we wanted to share that wasn't getting out through journalism. So we took matters into our own hands as soon as the technology gave us the means to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was making Mac software in 1994 and reporters were saying there was no new Mac software. I wanted  to correct that misunderstanding, so I started what eventually came to be called a blog, and then podcasting. All to get around a clogged bottleneck of news flow about something that was important to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/dave.rss.png&quot;&gt;using .rss&lt;/a&gt; because RSS is due for a bounce-back. It's got a strong foundation, and it has a simpler mission than the crypto folk -- simply, to get news to the people.</description>

			<title>StarLink setup</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/dish.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink&quot;&gt;StarLink&lt;/a&gt; is an internet service, like Comcast or Spectrum, except it uses a dish to communicate with orbiting satellites which from there connect to the net. As a user, once it's set up, you're just using wifi. I ordered it as a backup for my land-based net connection from Spectrum, which sometimes goes out where I live in the mountains in upstate NY. StarLink is made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacex.com/&quot;&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, which like Tesla, is a company run by Elon Musk. Anyway, I read how simple it was to set up, so I opened the box and put it together myself and it worked. These are my notes from the setup.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a guy who normally does installations on my house, but I couldn't wait so I set up StarLink myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's incredible how it unboxes. No instructions, none are needed.  Here's what you get:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dish: Three parts, a dish, a stand and a pipe that connects the dish to the stand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A wifi router with jacks for power and a cable that connects to the dish.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A 100 foot cable to connect the dish to the router. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I did, what happened&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put the dish outside, plug in the router, connect the dish to the router and turn everything on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I didn't get a video, but the dish moves itself around to find the clearest view of the satellite. It's out of a scifi movie. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But the app on the iPhone still says Booting.. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I imagine it's getting an over-the-air update?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where we're at...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can connect to the wifi from all my devices, they just don't connect to the internet yet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Update: now instead of booting it says searching.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Will keep you posted. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/gatheringdata.png&quot;&gt;Gathering data&lt;/a&gt; on obstructions.

			<title>What if writers had choice</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for one or two service providers who are ready to offer users a choice of writing tools. To not force them to use &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; writing tools, their storage, and at best, offer a way to back up their writing. As a writer I want to use the tools I like best, and perhaps send them out through more than one channel. I don't want to be locked in, and forced to transcribe my writing for every possible service I might use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see someone like Substack or Medium, for example, who says &quot;Write your stuff in your favorite writing tool, export it in Markdown, and give us the link.

Like walking into a store. Or just driving their car. The camera is looking at the driver, then focuses on what's happening outside, to get your mind to consider that. It's at this point that you know that something momentous and bad is about to happen. In some movies it's a car crash. Or the star gets shot. Or someone runs in front of the car. There are some movies where the director doesn't prepare you for The Bad Thing, and if it's done well it can be very disturbing (if you've seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=The%20Departed&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;The Departed&lt;/a&gt; you know what I mean). Anyway, today I was walking in the springtime garden outside my house, with all the debris from fallen trees and branches. It was a rough winter. And I become conscious in a way that happens sometimes. It's uncomfortable because you connect to your animal-ness in a way that's a lot more real than usual. I always get nervous that something momentous and bad is about to happen. The feeling of consciousness in the moment and the movie-maker's technique are the same thing, and it's why you have the feeling of dread watching the movie, and in real life. Only in the movie the bad thing always happens and in real life (so far) it never does.</description>

			<description>BTW, I have experienced momentous and bad things, and have never had this kind of super conscious awareness preview. My 18-year-old uncle driving his car at 60 mph on city streets in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmhurst,_Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, going through a stop sign. A car coming the other way smashes into ours. No seatbelts. Our car spins around, my head crashes into the window, breaks it. I get out of the car and run around a few times and then pass out. Broken collarbone. I don't remember any of this, I didn't experience it, consciously. I was told this is what happened and what I did. There was no fear, presumably because fear wouldn't have helped me survive?</description>

			<description>In the 90s when I was studying massage, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeru.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;teachers&lt;/a&gt; wanted us to be in this hyper-conscious mode always, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I think. I rarely attain that. Most of the time I'm in my movie. Maybe that's why the awareness of my personal presence in a scene in my movie is so alarming.</description>

			<description>I found the archive of all the DaveNet stories going back from 1994 to 2004 in OPML, the format that the Daytona database uses, including the titles and publication dates. I'm going to spend a little time gettomg it in shape, and then upload the database and all the OPML text to the GitHub repo. A bit of restoration work. I love this, there's a lot of good stuff here. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/davenetInOpml/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for this project.</description>

			<description>I had a small package delivered today via Fedex containing a SIM that I was going to use in my phone. But the package was opened, and there was nothing inside. This seems to be happening a lot these days. Hackers get jobs at Fedex or UPS and grab stuff as it's in transit. PS: Fedex &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/09/fedexApologizesForAnyInconvenience.png&quot;&gt;apologizes&lt;/a&gt; for any inconvenience when they should be apologizing for completely failing at the job they were hired to do.</description>

			<description>I've been working my way through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;, in Season 3 now. It's funny the first season was given so-so reviews, but the critics were agog with Season 3. I think it's the other way around. The last season is a real drag. Repetitive, silly, not sexy at all. Where the first season had me laughing out loud with my chin permanently dropped at all the innovation that worked.</description>

It's a blogging system I wrote in 2015 and 2016, after learning Facebook, and liking a lot of the features in it, and thought they should make their way back into the blogging world. That was the idea. It's a full-featured blogging system, written in JavaScript with a Node.js backend, intending to be a revisit to the ideas in Manila, which came out in 1999, hence the name of 1999.io. But -- I decided to stop building on it in 2017, because I wanted to use something else. The thing about 1999.io, is it made a compromise with Google Reader and the RSS readers that followed it. All posts had titles. And they were meant to be multi-paragraph things, and it had no provision for short titleless posts. I was trying to surrender to the mass decision that blogs had a certain form, but it wasn't my form. That led me to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, which was a return to the blogging system I used before Manila, based on the editor being an outliner. That meant leaving 1999.io behind. But it's still there. And someone out there is using it for something. I don't have any plans to work on it or use it, but does still appear to work. Here's a Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for 1999.io on this site, in case you're interested in exploring.</description>

			<title>Dreamweaver is on an evolutionary path we left behind</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; and lead developer of WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1511382286641508352&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; something interesting on Twitter on April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing how much development, how many startups, and how much funding is going into rebuilding Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver as a web app. (Gutenberg included.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about evolution and how we never go back, only forward. The great example is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Mentallicaa/videos/191445391404751/&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the evolution of the human eye. The eye originated when our ancestors lived underwater. They don't work well in the air, but it's done. We can't get a better eye. Evolution has finished the eye. Look at all our eyes, every animal on earth has watery eyes. You don't notice it until you look for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this same idea applies to the evolution of software. The theory says FrontPage and Dreamweaver will never fit well into the writing and publishing environment of 2022 and beyond. The evolutionary fork that took us off that course was when Apple made the decision in the late 80s to make networking virtually impossible to write software for. It was such a tease, because Macs all had builtin networking hardware, and the wires were easy to set up and inexpensive. They wanted all Macs to be connected. But for some reason the APIs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inscrutable&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I banged my head against those APIs for years. I gave up when I saw how easy HTTP was to develop for. If Apple had the same insight for software that they had for hardware, if they factored their APIs so that networking could easily be added to any application, as it is on the web, we'd be evolving off a base with a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/ImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf&quot;&gt;well-documented GDI&lt;/a&gt; and a well-defined graphic user interface, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that made sure all software worked the same, as opposed to the user interface chaos of the web. The two worlds are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antithetical&quot;&gt;antithetical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, simple networking was more important than a simple and consistent graphic interface. It's why &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; took off, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; did not (in the UserLand universe). And why Dreamweaver and Frontpage have faded out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;plain text&lt;/a&gt; rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge imho is to swing back to writers, not people who need a lot of stylistic control of text. The people who valued WYSIWYG were the first owners of laser printers. In a world where most people are using smart phones, there isn't that much you can do with wizzy tools that shows up for the reader. Today's writers need the UI to get out of their way, and make it easy to create more complex and useful structures for notes. I think this is the way forward. And we should of course keep improving and simplifying the underlying network protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Boca or Bucha</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's so funny -- not really -- that Scott Love is gone, and one of our many slogans was this: Boca or Bucha, which meant that we'd either succeed in overthrowing IBM in the personal computer industry, headquartered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Raton,_Florida&quot;&gt;Boca Raton&lt;/a&gt;, or we'd be on the red-eye to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest&quot;&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; to begin our exile. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest&quot;&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;? It was where my &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=leon%20winer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; was born, and at the time, in the mid-80s, was known to be a hellish place, run by a totalitarian dictator, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Ceaușescu&lt;/a&gt;, a monster.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And why would we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kayak.com/flights/SJC-BUH/2022-05-07/2022-05-14?sort=bestflight_a&quot;&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eye_flight&quot;&gt;red-eye&lt;/a&gt;? We were taking a lot of them to go to pointless meetings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1975%E2%80%931992:_Information_revolution,_rise_of_software_and_PC_industries&quot;&gt;IBMers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/IBM+Boca+Raton/@26.4024866,-80.1167947,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7cb5808417a4b1a8?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2m9ekkoL3AhWDjIkEHTbDDD8Q_BJ6BAhPEAU&quot;&gt;Boca Raton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scott%20love&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; died in an accident late &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a205642&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Ceaușescu was overthrown and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_execution_of_Nicolae_and_Elena_Ceau%C8%99escu&quot;&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, a couple of years after Scott and I parted ways. IBM sold their PC business a few years later, they didn't need our help to be driven out. And now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/61025328&quot;&gt;Bucha&lt;/a&gt; has become famous as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bucha,+Kyiv+Oblast,+Ukraine,+08292/@50.54608,30.1845498,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x472b31bdf94125bb:0x51c08a27332520fa!8m2!3d50.553333!4d30.213517&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; of a great atrocity in the Russian-Ukrainian war. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we can write the epitaph of something that started as a joke between two young friends fighting for the cause of software that helps you think and now has become anything but funny. I have no idea what this means, or if it means anything at all. But I wish Scott were here to share this story with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, you know how it is when you start to come to terms with the death of a friend, and you think, right now Scott is going to send me an email saying it was all a big joke. He architected quite a few of those at Living Videotext back in the day. But it's not going to happen, is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's exactly the same outline either way. If people prefer to use JSON to XML for outlines, this is how to do it. I've written a lot of JavaScript code that assumes exactly this structure.</description>

He isn't very clear on what he's talking about when he says they're working on something related to the open web. If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueskyweb.org/&quot;&gt;BlueSky website&lt;/a&gt;, it's also pretty vague except that it'll be using XMPP and ActiveSomethingOrOther which is yet another (sigh) &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; not-invented-here project inspired by Google as far as I can tell. I was not invited to their meetings. People have to stop doing that btw, defining projects about who and what they will not work with. I don't care if you're Jesus Christ, you still have to deal with the momentum of the installed base. People who thought they could make a feed reader and ignore RSS soon found out that people basically ignored &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; until they got on board. You don't get to fight over petty bullshit like the wire format. If you do, that says you're doing something other than building products for the open web. I think Jack is creative, and has courage, but that's a mistake he shouldn't be making at this stage of his career. I honestly and humbly think Jack could benefit from reading my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. It's based on a lot of real-world experience, both successes and failures at establishing new standards for the open web.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-discloses-92-stake-twitter-2022-04-04/&quot;&gt;Elon Musk bought 9.2% of Twitter's stock&lt;/a&gt;. Very interesting move. It appears he's now the largest shareholder. I like the idea of Twitter being managed like SpaceX or Tesla, speaking as a user of their products. I bought some Twitter stock a few years ago, and have held it. I think the smart move for Twitter is to remove limits, allow editing of tweets, support basic HTML features link linking, titles, style and some features from &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; such as enclosures (ie podcasting). And then federate, so they can peer with other instances, much as WordPress offers their product as open source. I already have built a lot of functionality for peering with Twitter in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It could be moved into any product. Then we could have a twitterverse with lots of experimentation. Hopefully a Musk-led Twitter wouldn't be closed off to competition.</description>

			<description>If Twitter and Facebook had been federated from the start, like the web or email, or the internet itself, the companies wouldn't be in any way responsible for what's posted on the network. They would just be one node and would be unable to cut anyone off.</description>

			<title>WordPress is huge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if another blogging system could develop in competition with WordPress, using the same model they use. An open source base, with a commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or will &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware&quot;&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; allow only one huge open source blogging system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another related thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did you know Twitter is a feed reader?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is except it's private, doesn't use RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You could build a feed reader, based on RSS that had Twitter's user experience. It can be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why haven't RSS-based feed readers evolved to work like Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I imagine the new Sports will do a bunch of things the original couldn't, they've had fourteen years to work on it.</description>
