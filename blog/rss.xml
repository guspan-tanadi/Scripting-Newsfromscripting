			<description>Multiple-party real estate deals must be a thing. I have a house and want a new house. I want to do the switch in one transaction, rather than risk owning two houses. This is analogous to the arrangement they have in sports. Team A only wants to trade player X if they can also trade out player Y. Similarly, homeowner Judy only wants to buy this house if she can sell her house in the same deal.</description>

			<title>WWDC</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to go to Apple's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference&quot;&gt;WWDC&lt;/a&gt; in the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always thought at least half the time should have devs on stage and Apple people in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had a lot of wrong ideas about developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course they didn't like hearing this! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One time I was invited to speak at the WWDC. My little company was leading an important new technology. Unfortunately, some people in Apple were uneasy about a dev working in this area (system scripting) so they put another dev up before me and he used up most of my time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We did give out free UserLand &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pinknoiz/status/1579579404413734914&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/10/frontierTShirt.png&quot;&gt;t-shirts&lt;/a&gt; to everyone who was there. So at least people had heard of us. And the Apple people who were scared of our product got their way. Also unfortunately. Everyone lost, but mostly me. Sad sad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Think big</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton&lt;/a&gt; asked why I thought his book was sad. I did a lot of writing in response, but in the end I deleted it all and replaced it with a single sentence, really just a phrase. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;it's just sad that people always think so small.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example. Subscribing is a mess in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; world, but at the start there was a plan for it not to be a mess. It required cooperation among the various writing and reading tools. The small thinking approach was that since you're going to dominate, writing tools should just put an icon on their pages that subscribes in your reader. But when no one dominates, the blogs get overwhelmed with these icons, then four years later someone invents Twitter which makes subscription a breeze. A few years later you wonder where all the blogs went. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people blame the big silos for the lack of movement in blogging they should step back and figure out why they left the door open for them to dominate? We had years to create a barrier of user expectation of choice, as was done in podcasting...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To whit, every time someone says &quot;Listen to &lt;i&gt;FreshAir&lt;/i&gt; where you get your podcasts,&quot; I feel a huge sense of pride. It worked there. Victory! Subscribing is still a mess, it doesn't have to be, but the open approach of podcasting got so entrenched that the users demand choice, expect it -- and that barrier was too high for Spotify and Amazon to climb over. We got a little help there from Apple btw -- of all the big vendors they probably could have owned podcasting, but they never made that move and that's something to be grateful for when you see all the great podcasts out there and more coming online all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another bad example, in the news industry, where I and others, consumers of news, are constantly railing about the ridiculous economic model. If I want to read an article in the Atlantic I have to subscribe. And the Detroit News, Denver Post and the Boston Globe. And the New Yorker and New York and on and on. At some point you have to stop subscribing, and then you'll miss the article that you need/want to read. Everyone but three pubs, the NYT, WSJ and WP would benefit from a pay-as-you-go plan, but they won't do it. Isn't it funny how close it is in pattern to the problem in blogging that created Twitter? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all have choices. We can work together or we can go it alone. When we work together we have a chance. When you go it alone, the chance of success is miniscule. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Google Reader is to blame for another huge mess in RSS land. They said posts must have titles, even though RSS specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/10/optionalTitle.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;allows posts&lt;/a&gt; without titles. That basically cut off Twitter from the world defined by RSS because Google Reader became synonymous with RSS, they controlled it, and &lt;i&gt;tweets don't have titles. &lt;/i&gt;Did you ever see how Google Reader rendered a tweet back when Twitter had feeds? They were right to shut that down, but don't blame them, blame Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This kind of disrespect is very popular among techies. They want to say they invented something, which is a lie -- but if they never tell anyone about the things that came before, they kind of hope to get away with it. It's one of the worst things about tech, and why progress takes so long, why we're still &quot;solving&quot; problems that were solved when I was in school, and that was a long time ago. It's not just big companies that do this, sometimes one-person companies do it. Shaking my head. It would work so much better if we built on each others' work.</description>

Young people, men especially, want to be the hero and ignore that winning requires that people work together, and that the real joy of being human comes not from being the great conqueror (as young men imagine), but having 12 people in a huddle fighting for something worth fighting for, together -- as a team.

It's a really sad story, but I don't think it has to be. There was a lot of collegiality in the early blogging community, and we shared our work. He mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; in passing, but it solved a big part of the puzzle that eventually became WordPress, Facebook and Twitter, and btw &lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. All the source information is in the archive of Scripting News, this blog. Manila was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;culmination&lt;/a&gt; of a couple of years of open experimentation I did into how you could simplify content management so ordinary people could do it. First we had to understand what the problem was (two models for the content, one the editing view and the other the published view, there needed to be one model), why content management was too complicated for writers, and then how to make it usable. And then there was a lot of code to write, UI to design and endless iteration. And it had an API. That was a big deal. It's probably why Twitter and WordPress have APIs, btw. All that (unless I missed something) is left out of Manton's story. I was hoping for the actual story about how this worked to be chronicled in his book. Not only because I want to be in the story myself, but also so that today's developers know how these kinds of things come to be. Most of the stories tell the wrong freaking story. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The Mets suck. As a lifelong Mets fan I know this. I love the Mets. It’s a family thing. Parents and grandparents loved the Brooklyn Dodgers so I love the Mets. But what bullshit that supposed Mets fans booed our starter as he left the field last night, and many left before the game was  over.  As usual  some &lt;s&gt;fucking&lt;/s&gt; Yankees fans got Mets hats and are pretending to be Mets  fans.</description>

			<description>What Facebook is doing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.meta.com/metaverse/impact/&quot;&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; is doomed to fail. When has a big established tech giant invented the next layer of the virtuality? If there’s any validity to Zuck's vision, the reality will be achieved by a startup, competing with other startups. Facebook which now foolishly  calls  itself  Meta!  (might  as  well  change  their  name  to  Bullshit!)  will,  if  they’re  lucky  get  to  buy  one  of  the  leading  startups,  will  eventually get  a  new  CEO who  will  write  off  the Meta!  foolishness,  and  Meta!  will  go  the  way  of  Topview,  Copland,  OpenDoc,  OS/2,  and  all  the  bullshit  Bill Gates  threw  at  the  open  web.</description>

			<title>Comparing FeedLand to River5</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1271711025&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the FeedLand thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the difference between FeedLand and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for asking. This is a good question, I should know how to answer it. So let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's much more than River5.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a browser-based UI for managing and sharing subscriptions. So the users are kind of members of a club. We can all see each others' subscription lists. We know what are the most popular feeds. When someone subscribes to a feed it appears in the subscription log, which is visible to everyone. There is no private information in FeedLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; easy to subscribe to a feed that's already in the database. Radically easy. Hard to imagine how it could be easier. That's very important.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can create a &quot;news product&quot; entirely in the web browser, no need to use an external tool to manage your feeds and categories. Again, as easy as it can be. I iterated over the design of this stuff obsessively.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It stores all the data in a relational database.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So far none of this stuff is in River5. Underneath all this, FeedLand does almost all of what River5 does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One thing River5 has over FeedLand is that it's shipping, you can use it now. FeedLand is still in development. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically where River5 is a simple feed reading system, this is groupware, collaborative, like Slack it's meant for workgroups. The end result is not entirely dissimilar to River5, but the chance to work with other people is new.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I know he's a sports fan too, living in Texas he follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs&quot;&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt;, which is of course a legendary team. I am, as you know, a Knicks fan. But I have to say, until the Mets are finished, and probably a few weeks after that, I'm focused only on baseball. I'm very modal with my sports. I'm either in or not. I can't love two teams at the same time. It's just who I am. Anyway, Manton has written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://book.micro.blog/&quot;&gt;book about microblogging&lt;/a&gt; and he runs a service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; which hosts blogs, running his software. I feel that his blog and my new reading software have brought us closer. And I look forward to reading his book.</description>

			<description>For all the ups and downs the Mets ended the season with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/06/standings.png&quot;&gt;exactly the same record&lt;/a&gt; as the Braves, 101 wins and 61 losses. The only reason the Mets are in the wild card and the Braves get to wait for the next round, is that they won one more game against the Mets this year than they lost. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7bgtu2O4E&quot;&gt;game of inches&lt;/a&gt; Al Pacino's character rants about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Life is made of inches.</description>

			<description>I added a new feature to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; today. There's now a white-on-orange XML icon in the upper right corner of each news product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1686843/194099839-d458927b-8b0b-46d8-af83-f27c00f81764.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. The icon links to the OPML subscription list for the feeds on the page. This came from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1268027417&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the thread, basically asking &quot;Where are the feeds.&quot; I love those kinds of questions, they help direct the development of a product. My perspective is so muddled, I've been living with this product for nine months already. I can't see what it looks like to someone seeing it for the first time.</description>

			<description>Substack has a sadistic kind of paywall. You start reading a piece, get into it, enough to wonder where it‘s going and boom, it’s time to subscribe or get out of here. Leaves a humiliation that’s hard to describe. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-4151-why-goal-cascades-are-harmful&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that triggered the paywall, it's not doing it now -- I have no idea why. This is the second time I've seen this paywall. Anyway, I clicked on the link because I thought I might learn something, instead I have a pain in the gut. Trains you to never read anything on Substack again, and, like all other paywalls, it does not make me want to subscribe. If you have a comment, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1577618434220777473&quot;&gt;original tweet&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Well here we are, the project I've been working on all year is now ready to show itself, a little. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The name of the project is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>How EZ-Pass for news would work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If there were a rational system for online news, imho, how would it work? I know news orgs don't think this way, but what if they did?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A news org would put its local news stories behind a paywall, accessible via subscription only. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Stories that are reprints of wire service stories could also be behind the paywall if they want, but I wonder what's the point. The same exact text is available from lots of other sources, often by local TV stations -- but they are thorougly saturated with horrific advertising. Want to do something original? Put these outside the paywall and get a reputation for being a &quot;good&quot; place to go for wire service stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The tricky stuff are the stories that people from outside your area would want to read. For example, I live near NYC, these would include stories from the Boston, Chicago or Los Angeles local news orgs. For these, I suggest they could be behind your paywall too, if you want, but you should also make them available through a respected distributor, maybe a service run by one of the largest news orgs or wire services. They would charge on a per-read basis, to people who had registered a credit card with the distributor. The revenue would be shared with the distributor of course. Not sure what the price would be, you could try out a variety of prices and see which prices maximize revenue. This would be found money. Most people who live near New York are not going to subscribe to the big Atlanta news org.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The final category are stories that are so important that you want to make sure everyone can read them without limit. At the height of the Covid pandemic some news orgs were putting their stories on the virus outside the paywall and they didn't count against your monthly limit. Of course this raises the question of why do you publish any stories that wouldn't be in this category? Isn't everything you publish vital? (Obviously not, but that's not something many news orgs would probably want to admit.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What got me thinking about this is that I recently discovered a New Jersey news org that does a good job of covering the Mets. They are a local team for New Jersey too. What a kick esp since the NYT which I do subscribe to has, for some reason, stopped covering the Mets. I wonder why. Anyway, to my chagrin that was short-lived. I guess they gave me a cookie and were counting the number of articles I was seeing, and now I can't read them any longer. There basically is no journalism I can read about the team, even though they are having an incredible year, and there's a lot to say about them and I am subscribed to one of the local news orgs. As a reader as far as I can tell I'm doing everything I'm supposed to, yet I can't read most of the stories I want to, and not just about the Mets, about &lt;i&gt;everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have found some bloggers that are filling the gap, a little. But we have a long way to go. We are already living in the age of news blackouts for a lot of what we're interested in, and when an important issue comes up, it's just another chance for news orgs outside our local area to remind us that we can't read their stories unless we subscribe, which is not possible, economically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, this blog has no paywall, it's free to read for everyone, and there are a number of things I write about that are as good as anything you'll read by a pro.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

When they finally lost, I slammed my left hand on the arm of the chair in a reflexive move. The watch which was also on the hand started shrieking wanting confirmation that I had taken a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944&quot;&gt;hard fall&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably it was going to try to get me help if I did. I answered no. It asked if I fell at all. I thought for a second and said no. But I did have to think about it. The Mets have always been heartbreakers. As a fan since 1962, there have been lots of downs, but the ups are spectacular. We keep hoping for another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmjuuQQX3Z4&quot;&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llHnR0ZPy6E&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;. The day will come, that's the feeling. Will this be the year? Well, if it is, it's going to be a long slog with lots of heartbreak on the way. 😢</description>

			<description>Having listened to and loved the most recent episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;500 Songs&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtles&quot;&gt;the Turtles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQDsM3Wvh8&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeAtre3Bxg8&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZEURntrQOg&quot;&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt;, my friend said now you have to start with the first. I looked all over the web and I couldn't find a list. So I looked into their &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/feed/podcast/&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. It's huge but they're all there, all the episdes. How am I going to parse this? Then I remembered I have it in my database. So I wrote a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/02/query.png&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; to get me the &lt;i&gt;enclosureUrl&lt;/i&gt; of all items from that feed, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/500SongsEnclosureUrls.html&quot;&gt;it worked&lt;/a&gt;. I love it when this happens.</description>

			<title>New glue for GitHub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/santa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code&quot;&gt;glue code&lt;/a&gt; for ages. Basically, someone provides an API for a service. Could be the IBM PC with calls to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/dev/rom/ibm/5150/&quot;&gt;ROM BIOS&lt;/a&gt; to read files, or the Apple II hardware screen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.applelogic.org/files/AIIETECHREF2.pdf&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; (invented by the clever genius Steve Wozniak), or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_event&quot;&gt;Apple Events&lt;/a&gt; supported by various Mac apps in the 90s, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; interfaces for web apps, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+interfaces+of+GitHub+and+Slack&quot;&gt;REST interfaces&lt;/a&gt; of GitHub and Slack or thousands of other services. They give you an API, and then after you see what it can do, and if you want to use it in your app, you write some glue, so all your calls flow through code you control, so if you learn something about their API, you only have to support it in one place. It's especially important for the few services that reserve the right to break their developers. Apple used to do this all the time, I haven't programmed to an Apple API in a very long time. Maybe they stopped? It's a way of forcing your developers to redeclare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJbsXeRc_Fw&quot;&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; to the Great Platform every so often. I like the web where no one has the power to break me (although &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; might argue with that). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- today I have a new release of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;glue code for GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, the code I use to read and write files from and to GitHub. I use this to keep archives of stuff, because I think GitHub has a good chance of sticking around for a few decades, longer than the S3 storage I use for everything. That'll disappear the day someone stops paying the bills. But the GitHub stuff should stay, no bills to pay (though I do pay for a developer account, only seems fair because I use it a lot). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;archiving my blog&lt;/a&gt;. Starting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2017/05/16&quot;&gt;May 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;. And since then every post, every day and every month has been stored there in JSON and OPML. I've also managed to find and store OPML files for most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;stuff on my blog&lt;/a&gt; going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/DaveNet&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not much of a secret that I'm working on a product that reads feeds in RSS, Atom and RDF formats. It contains a feed reader, but it is more of a development tool for &lt;i&gt;news products.&lt;/i&gt; It stores info about feeds, items, subscriptions, users and likes and other stuff. I want that stuff to flow to GitHub right from the start. It'll be a slice of what we're doing online in 2022 and beyond. Maybe that'll be useful to some researcher in the future? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new thing in my GitHub glue is that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github/blob/master/davegithub.js&quot;&gt;manages&lt;/a&gt; a queue of writes, so you can just tell it to write something and then go on to the next thing. GitHub has a rule that you can only have one call extant at a time. This is a terrible for for an environment like JavaScript that doesn't let you do that easily. I got tired of managing that stuff in my application code so I added the queue to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;davegithub&lt;/a&gt; and that simplifies all future applications that have to write to GitHub. Absolutely nothing revolutionary in that -- it's just nice to be able to forget about that particular feature of GitHub, let the software manage it for me. And it's MIT licensed stuff so you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also released an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/uploadFolderToGitHub/blob/main/uploadfolder.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; that uploads a folder full of JSON files to a location on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So If you are a programmer and want to use GitHub to archive your stuff, or to create a connection to GitHub for other apps, I've made it simple for you. Enjoy! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand&quot;&gt;Stewart Brand&lt;/a&gt; would find this interesting, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Once when I was a little kid, my mom driving, her mother, my grandmother, in the front passenger seat, my brother and I in the back seat when all of a sudden we noticed that Nana was wiggling her ears. Whoa. She's doing that for us! Incited, we carried on as kids do. Laughing and rolling around. Yes that's what to do. Nothing is all that serious, say the kiddies.</description>
