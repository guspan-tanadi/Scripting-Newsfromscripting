			<description>Putin must not have known how much power he had. Ukraine is small potatoes. He was the czar of one half of the political system of the US. It was a real possibility his party would control the whole government again in 2024. A lot of times people don't know how successful they've been.</description>

			<description>The point of yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/23/135414.html?title=aPhilosophicalQuestion&quot;&gt;philosophical question&lt;/a&gt; was this. The Constitution says the government may not search you unless there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20probable%20cause,or%20was%20committing%20a%20crime.&quot;&gt;probable cause&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn't mean that people you invite to enter your house should be allowed to go through your private stuff. It may not be illegal, but we still recognize it as wrong. In the same way, you have &quot;free speech&quot; in America, even when it isn't the government restricting your speech, when it's your employer, school, family or friends. No law prohibits them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1357/&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;, but being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans of all persuasions, wrong, un-American.</description>

			<title>Are African-Americans fungible?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First let me say up front that, of course, African-Americans are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fungible. It's a stupid question, but I didn't raise it -- the Supreme Court process did, over many decades of the comings and goings of black justices and also women.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So -- are racism and genderism part of the Supreme Court process? Yes they are and I can prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall&quot;&gt;Thurgood Marshall&lt;/a&gt; retired, the Repubs replaced him with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=who+replaced+thurgood+marshall&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the &quot;African-American&quot; seat's significance was supposedly preserved. Marshall was the Supreme Court's first African-American justice. Thomas is the second.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;African-Americans are fungible, they seemed to say. Of course Marshall and Thomas, even though both were black, were almost exact opposites in philosophy and rage-suppression. The former was very liberal, a highly respected scholar, and the latter is fascist and resentful, and the depths of his depravity are only now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086535100/wife-of-justice-thomas-rebuts-claims-of-conflict-of-interest&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; died, she was replaced with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett&quot;&gt;ACB&lt;/a&gt;. Yes both are women, and thus women are considered fungible as well, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, at least by some people, in some sense. Politically, ACB is the opposite of RBG, probably is committed to reversing all of RBG's accomplishments. Yet the number of women on the court remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is in the hospital while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson&quot;&gt;Ketanji Brown Jackson&lt;/a&gt; hearings are going on, which gets you to consider that the number of AA's on the court would be preserved if KBJ was ratified and the unspeakable happens to CT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I actually love the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=fungible&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;fungible&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, always have, so I was somewhat delighted that the latest tech scam are NFTs where the F stands for fungible. This means I get to think of this word more often and that generally makes me happy for some odd reason. I hope the scamminess of NFTs doesn't end up spoiling that, or maybe I'm wrong and NFTs are the basis for a new capitalism? I have been wrong before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A philosophical question</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Constitution says the government can't conduct unreasonable searches, without a warrent or probable cause. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone you have invited into your house goes through your private stuff. Reads your diary, your financial records, calendar, contacts list. Looks in your medicine cabinet, your collection of drugs, legal and illegal, sex toys. Etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Should you be prevented from writing a tweet or a blog post about how it felt to be violated that way? Would it be fair to rebut the post by talking about the Constitution? Can you imagine someone actually doing that? (I can't, it would seem pretty cruel.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, with the question posed this way, it's ridiculous to think someone would be condemned for expressing their thoughts and feelings about being so violated. Note that I didn't say their rights were violated, in any legal sense. But their rights were violated in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might not be illegal for someone you invite into your house to violate your privacy, but legality isn't the only thing we're permitted to write about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If people producing blogging software want to give this another shot, they should be ready to retool, a bit. Not very much. Maybe not at all (if you've been considerate in your feeds). And not breaking anything. This is absolute. I will not break anyone either with feeds I produce (I write a popular blog and make blogging software.) Which is a bit tricky because there are important features in my feeds that most readers don't support thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. This is how everything got broken. I want to go back to before this all became such a mess, and slowly and carefully pull through something beautifully simple and easy to work with.

I think that law, whatever it is that makes this possible or necessary, needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's as fundamental as the First Amendment.

The Second Amendment’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-slave-owners-dictated-the-language-of-the-2nd-amendment&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; was to enable slavers in Virginia to put down a slave rebellion without depending on the federal government. It wasn't put in the Constitution so people could protect themselves against robbers, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and if appropriate there could be laws that allow it specifically. But it isn't really a Constitutional right.</description>

			<title>A Wordle hack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/20/wordleResult.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; is an addictive word game that became popular and then was bought by the NY Times. It's free to play, as far as I know (I have a NYT subscription so if it weren't free it's possible I might not know). The diagram to the right is a standard, produced by the game. It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's the hack...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you know the second and third letters, as above, and have eliminated a fair number of consonants, and are sure the first letter is a consonant…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Type one of the eligable consonants and the next two letters into a web browser and check out the auto completes. Repeat. That's how I figured out the answer to today's puzzle after I got to the situation in the third line. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty consistently getting the answer in four steps. In the first two steps I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just gathering data. By the third, I constrain my guess by the information I've gathered so far, assuming I've got one or two hits.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case I got two green squares on the first one. I thought for sure I'd get the answer in three instead of four, but I hadn't eliminated enough consonants to be able to puzzle it out. I was surprised by how hard it was after step three, mostly because (I think) this was a weird word, letter-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT editorial is a good sign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of time to write this morning but I wanted to get this out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, my goal for the web has always been that I want the bright minds to be on the web, sharing important stuff that comes from what they do. These people would be considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; in journalism, not reporters. I've been working on this since I first started using the web as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;writing platform&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that keeps bright minds from fully expressing their ideas on the web is the sense that it's a savage place, where people cut you down, make your life miserable, possibly lose you your standing, even your job. So they don't take the step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This idea comes from journalism. From organizations like the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They paint us all with the same brush. They talk about us as monsters. All the same. They don't listen. Only their ideas get out. Reporters are easily fooled, we've learned, with great cost for all of us. Journalism says Facebook sucks, a lot, and that scares some of my neighbors from using Facebook, and keeps us from making connections that would make things work better on a local level. We need more of that. Journalism has stood in the way of good uses of the web. Maybe they don't know they've been doing it, but they have been doing it just the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when a big influential organization like the NYT says, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;its official voice&lt;/a&gt;, that this is a problem, and presumably we should do something about it, I see that as huge progress. We have an ally in organizing our knowlege and passion, the good stuff of human intelect, with their support, instead with their derision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I am so sad when I see people who already have mastered the tools predictably try to put the NYT down for noticing this problem which &lt;i&gt;all of them know about, &lt;/i&gt;I'm sure of it. So who has the old idea and who has the new one? Who's wired and who's tired?  In my mind, the NYT has made a breakthrough. I love it. Build on it. Bring that philosophy into the NYT itself. Look for the good on the web, not just the mean stuff. Set the example. I think the light will come on for others, not all of them, some are too dug in, but progress can be made here, I feel it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Save me the lecture about the First Amendment. I go way back with the fight against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;CDA&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. You use the First Amendment as a hammer, the same way the gun lobby uses the Second Amendment. I see you as exactly like them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I used one of my montly gifts as a NYT subscriber to provide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;link to the editorial&lt;/a&gt;.

Much like the update I did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; last year. Really simple sample code. It was time to pull together the code I use to parse feeds these days in JavaScript apps and publish it as open source. It builds on Dan MacTough's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; package, so it inherits its support of different feed formats: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, Atom and RDF. The result is what developers want in 2022. A simple JavaScript object containing the information in a feed and nothing more. One system call to parse it. Works like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse&quot;&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a simple feed reader could be built. Or any other feed-consuming software. I felt it was time to try to bring this together, enough time has passed, don't you think? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>My two cents: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1504807644963479562&quot;&gt;The NYT Editorial Board is correct&lt;/a&gt;. We all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/220318/p17#a220318p17&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt; what we say to avoid all kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsuris&quot;&gt;tsuris&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it's cops at your house in SWAT gear, guns drawn, responding to a call there's been a murder. Or a knock on the door from a stranger, saying they just wanted to know if this is where you live. It could be a small thing, or it could drive you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape&quot;&gt;out of business&lt;/a&gt;. The key point is people hold back what they think because they don't want the drama or danger that would come from expressing the idea. The rebuttals are stale. Heard them for decades. It doesn't change the fact that there's important ideas not being exchanged. And we need the best minds, with the freshest ideas to deal with the issues of the day.  And btw this kind of suppression is just as effective as what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/florida-senate-approves-dont-say-gay-bill-00015120&quot;&gt;Repubs are doing&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, for example. Think about that, and look in the mirror. You aren't that different from them.</description>

			<description>On Tuesday, just after doing a workout on my Peloton bike, I saw a question on Facebook, pure clickbait, that asked you to take the color of your underwear and the last thing you ate, put them together to form the name of your 80s rock band. I never go for these things, but I did this time. I was wearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M6TWDLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;biking shorts&lt;/a&gt;, the kind with padding so you don't get a sore butt. So I wasn't actually wearing underwear. I had sushi for lunch. The combination: human sushi. It was too good not to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/370691617969252/posts/465664631805283?comment_id=490879942617085&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Already 96 likes.

			<title>How to get the public writing system we want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw comments from two noted journalism thinkers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/jeff.jarvis/posts/10158648424506905&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/1504459556939776004&quot;&gt;Mathew Ingram&lt;/a&gt; saying more or less the same thing. It's amazing to me, because it's the flipside of what I've been wanting to do for years -- develop software for writers and thinkers without trapping them into a tech industry business model. Today the software is inexpensive to make and operate. That isn't the problem, we know how to make the software, the problem is attracting a critical mass of users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a way to do it. The challenge is not making the software, it's getting the users have to show up. What will convince them to use a system that lets them write for free, gives them a permanent archive of their writing so they don't get locked in and lets them use whatever writing tools they like? I can't convince them on my own. I'm not famous enough, trusted enough, or whatever. When I do it, it doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I think would work is to get the support of foundations. Then, with the resources, hire professional testers to be sure that as we add features, the software keeps working. Use some of the money to hire a real PR firm to pitch the idea to pubs, tell writers we want to make the tools they want, without the gotchas. But wait to pitch until there's something they can actually sign on to and use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was at Berkman, a very long time ago, we tried to get support from the tech industry, AOL, Microsoft, Apple, Google -- but they wanted to do this stuff themselves. Now I'd suggest asking the Knight Foundation, Newmark, MacArthur, not sure who else. This is far from my area of expertise. And it's not the money we need so much, but the endorsement. Grants would say: We looked at the idea and the people involved, and thought it was worth creating the service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The users are the key. They have to trust it. Just going out straight, as a pitch -- well I've tried it. The problem is they expect software they use to come from VC-backed companies or huge multinationals. The foundations invest in projects at news orgs that are more proof-of-concept than actual systems people can use. This project would be different, its goal would be to get a public system up and running, cloneable, free to use, with features competitive with Medium and Substack. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Summary: Foundations acting as VCs, to get specific production software built to enable reliable and open systems to flourish, where the VCs always have gotchas, these projects would be guaranteed not to have them. The only ROI is the system itself, developed and up and running and freely clonable. No business model, guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Also why I wanted to be at Harvard in 2003. And how lucky it was that Chris was there too. I ramble a lot, if you listen to me, you know that.

Also why I wanted to be at Harvard in 2003. And how lucky it was that Chris was there too. I ramble a lot, if you listen to me, you know that. But I do eventually get to the point. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Wed, 16 Mar 2022 13:28:16 GMT" type="outline" enclosure="http://scripting.com/2022/03/16/whyIWentToHarvard.m4a" enclosureType="audio/mpeg" enclosureLength="12192270" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/16.html#a132816"/>

			<description>I can’t imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2022/3/16/22980192/lebron-james-knee-soreness-injury-swelling-video-medical-explainer-lakers-video&quot;&gt;Lebron&lt;/a&gt; has any fans left after he’s dumped so many teams. It’s not just that he wins championships, it’s that he leaves behind wrecks. Fans don’t want to win as much as we want to love. I’m glad he never chose the Knicks. I can’t imagine another team accepting LeBron unless he swears he will leave the team in better condition than he found it. That would be something worth giving a try. Go to Orlando, for example, and don’t bring any stars with you, just work. And do it for a dollar a year. Then there will be at least some goodwill for you going forward.</description>

			<description>BTW the first feed was mine. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;. This is why we needed blogging before anything else. It was the way new tech innovation could be announced when journalism was ignoring it.</description>

I took the feed of a well known tech publication and just displayed the &lt;i&gt;description&lt;/i&gt; element of an &lt;i&gt;item&lt;/i&gt; from its feed in my browser. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/16/unwantedbullshitinyourfeed.png&quot;&gt;what showed up&lt;/a&gt; in the JavaScript console. How embarrassing for the publisher. That's what I mean about being picky about which feeds I'm willing to allow into my lovely theoretical RSS garden. If you're going to hack at the browser like that, you're not invited. Please no business models in my app. You want the people who read your feed to pay? Ask them for some money.</description>
