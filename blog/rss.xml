			<description>The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;Instant Outlines&lt;/a&gt; toolkit. Over the last few days I've been tweeting and blogging like a fool about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines#simple-use-case&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; importing and exporting outlines from one app to another isn't enough. We can do much better. In the background I was working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;new toolkit&lt;/a&gt; for developers who want to be part of a network of outline producer and consumer apps based on OPML and web sockets. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/demo/code.js&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of course, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/instantoutlinesrepo/demo/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; to prove it works. All my outliners support the feature as well, it's the basis for sharing outlines. This is my vision for an open ecosystem based on outlining. It's a big part of what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;dreamt&lt;/a&gt; of when I started UserLand in 1988.</description>

			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/in-treatment&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; watching In Treatment, but season 3 is mostly cringe-worthy. The writing is awful, and the various plots are ridiculous, though Debra Winger is pretty great. It's a very simple concept, they must've gotten bored with it (?) and tried to turn it into some kind of mysterious love affair between patient and doctor and then doctor-as-patient. Also too many patients have miraculous turn-arounds, and it's not clear why. They seem to be charmed by Paul, but we know Paul ain't charming! Oy. I'm slogging through season 3 knowing there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/in-treatment-review-hbo-season-4-uzo-aduba.html&quot;&gt;new season&lt;/a&gt; already in progress, with a new shrink played by a familiar actor, and I want to watch it so I don't want to skip anything.</description>

			<description>Proof by induction. If a statement is true for 0, and if it being true for n implies it's true for n+1, then it's proven for all positive integers. When we let Dubya off for his sins, and when we didn't restructure the banking industry after the crash in 2008, we set the stage for it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/no-consequences-for-trump-garland-biden.html&quot;&gt;happen again&lt;/a&gt;, only worse. And Trump isn't done with us yet. He's the weird case of a former president who hasn't relinquished power. He hasn't learned how to use it yet, but he'll get more effective in his new role.</description>

			<description>This is important. In the conversations I've had recently with users and devs in the nascent Tools For Thought community, people talk in terms of importing and exporting outlines, but this emphatically is not good enough in 2021. We need a live connection. So when you hook your outline up to a rendering server,  the connection persists. When you make a change, the worker app on the server has the changes and is ready to re-render, without you doing anything. I can't manually import a file every time there's a change. Web sockets are built into all browsers, it's simple and standardized tech. Let's use it.  There's at least one public storage system, GitHub, that supports real time notification. Again, let's use it. Instead of going back to the beginning each time a new generation comes along, let's start with the work and knowhow of previous generations. I'm here to help.</description>

			<description>Long ago, when RSS was starting to boom, I was often surprised when a new product came out and I didn't hear about it until it was announced publicly. The one I remember best was FeedBurner. You'd think that they would want my endorsement, and to give them a chance to answer technical questions before the press started asking them. Maybe they had a developer story? Or maybe I could have helped with a design decision? At that time Scripting News was pretty well-read in the developer community. It always felt like they must have been hiding something, but if they were I never found it. Yes FeedBurner centralized a technology that was good because it was decentralized, but I don't think my saying that would have hurt them. What was even more strange is I had friends at the company, people from the blogging world and from other RSS devs.</description>

			<title>Is JSON better than XML? No.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been all around this one. I can and often do save both XML and JSON versions of RSS and OPML. Truth is almost no one uses the JSON versions. The reason is simple. If you already have support for the XML version, what's gained by adding support for JSON? And everyone has to support the XML version, because HTML, RSS and OPML are all out there &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; in the XML format, for all practical purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, to the supposed advantages of JSON over XML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JSON is supposedly more readable than XML, but if you look at what people actually put on the wire, it's not true. There are no rules about whitespace, tabs, newlines, spaces in either format. Developers save files without including whitespace, thinking this makes their apps more efficient, when any gain has to be miniscule, esp with compression. It's bad engineering not to try to make your data files readable, imho, but it's also the default practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JSON is supposed to be easier to process, but that also is not true. First you have to support the XML versions because that's what's out there. So even if it were monumentally more difficult, you can't avoid supporting XML formatted data in your code. Adding a second version makes your code more complex not simpler. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If your development runtime doesn't have a package to serialize and deserialize XML as easily as JSON.parse and JSON.stringify, then do a good deed for your fellow developers, write it and release it as open source. That's a simpler and more ecologically sound way of alleviating any angst about XML. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The old famous programming adage applies -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:If_it_ain%27t_broke,_don%27t_fix_it&quot;&gt;if it ain't broke don't fix it&lt;/a&gt;. XML works. It doesn't matter to users if you use XML or JSON. If you want to make the world a friendlier place, use indentation and newlines in your data. Either XML or JSON can be readable if you put in a little effort. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fighting autocracy with marketing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Joe Trippi's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1523896927?i=1000525032434&quot;&gt;latest podcast&lt;/a&gt; focused me on realistic next steps fighting Republican autocracy. Here are my comments in a bulleted list. I wrote this quickly, so think of it as a memo, not a manifesto. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Joe, glad you're hooked up with the Lincoln Project people. They were doing well marketing against insurrection until the 2020 election.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The task they set themselves up to do is done. They were trying to convince Repubs it was ok to vote for a Democrat. That was great for the 2020 election but it's a small part of the campaign that should be running now.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They (or someone) must be ready to position the next huge insurrection event, with online advertising, in real time as it's happening, and in the immediate aftermath. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If such an operation were in existence on Jan 6, we wouldn't have had to wait for the DOJ to tell us what happened (they never have). Now, no amount of marketing will change that the events of Jan 6 are fuzzy and uncertain in our minds, even though in fact they aren't. No one focused our minds on the criminality of the president. We've never gotten an account of what the president was doing during the insurrection, yet the new administration must have that information? Why are we not running ads demanding that the information be released. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So we remain confused, no one has taken charge of communicating about that event. That's how the human mind works. It's why when Barr lied about the Mueller Report his spin stuck, even though later we knew he was lying. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The question the new Lincoln Project should always be raising: &quot;Why is this traitor still in Congress? Repeat that theme over and over. Point the finger at the traitors, make them pay a political price for their insurrection. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When one of them does something really insidious, demand that they be removed from Congress right now. Put the question into the reports in NYT, WP, CNN, MSNBC, et al.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jan 6 was not the last act of insurrection. Any day now there will be another. We must be ready to communicate about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If such a marketing channel existed, ordinary people like me will be able to do something instead of sitting around worrying and thinking no one will hear me so why bother. Our contribution will be in dollars to run ads, and feet marching in protest. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Marketers are in a position to do a lot of good. I think Lincoln Project should change their name and add Dems and independents to the project. It can't just be former Republicans at this point. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;From now on campaigns &lt;i&gt;never shut down.&lt;/i&gt; Tattoo that on your forehead. It's a mistake we're still making and it must stop. The need to communicate about events is persistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Blogging from an outliner</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to blog from an outliner, I suggest the first step is to get the outline data to flow out of your editing tool in OPML, and then write your publishing software to build the blog from the OPML. That way you won't be locked into your editor or publishing software.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of approaches to both writing and publishing. You won't get the benefit if you don't have a strong basis for interop.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Silos have a long history of being bad for progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For most of the last 26 years I've been writing my blog in an outliner. I'm glad that other people are interested in this now. Let's build a new community around this idea. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rest is in a Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1403721933628350474&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a two-monitor Mac. Sometimes when I move my mouse in the Dock at the bottom of my main monitor, it moves to the bottom of the other monitor. All of a sudden I have to stop, launch the  Preferences app, open the Dock panel, click the Right button then the Bottom button, and now the Dock is back where it belongs. It seems the problem could be easily solved by putting a Lock icon on the Dock tab, as they have on other panels. I can't imagine why they thought a mouse gesture should do something so radical as move the Dock.</description>

			<description>I'm putting together a new hub for Instant Outline notifications using GitHub as the intermediary. Today is a docs-writing day. The code is working, knock wood, praise Murphy, etc. Doing some searches I found an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/editorOpmlOrg/instantOutlineTool.html&quot;&gt;Instant Outline tool&lt;/a&gt; I did in 2009, using FriendFeed in roughly the same manner I'm using Twitter and GitHub this time. Let's hope this time it gains traction. I've been waiting for people to play with on this stuff, this is one of those things you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; do on your own.</description>

			<description>I've found that credit card companies are very tuned into security. If you call them up with a security issue, within a minute they have put a freeze on the account, and send you a new card. I generally get the new card the next day. And by &quot;a minute&quot; I mean a minute after the phone rings, not after navingating voicemail hell, getting upsold and hung up on, and being reminded your call is important to us, and did you know that you can get all the information you need on the web? Please hold and an operator will be with you soon. We apologize for the inconvenience.</description>

			<description>Programming note. I've decided that, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; and other outliners, the special icon for tweets is annoying. Especially when it's just an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/10/tweetsWithIcons.png&quot;&gt;outline of tweets&lt;/a&gt;. They will still have the &quot;tweet&quot; type attribute, but they will display with the default wedge.</description>

			<description>Just did my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-hosting&quot;&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt; session. I have a suggestion. When you start a space, ask the user if they want to set a time limit. Then display the time limit for everyone to see. Maybe even have a clock counting down. And when it's over, just shut it off. I'd do more of them I think.</description>

			<title>GitHub notifications via WebSockets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new project I started. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An app that stores files on GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Other apps can be notified when any of these files changes, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&quot;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is accomplished by a very thin publicly accessible server app that gets &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks&quot;&gt;WebHook&lt;/a&gt; calls from GitHub, accepts subscriptions from browser apps and mobile apps, really any kind of app, over WS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that it relies on GitHub. It performs well, and it'll probably be around for a while. And it's free to use, all you have to do is set up an account. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Other apps are using it as backend-storage for web apps. I am interested in trying that out too.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The files themselves contain the ws:// address of the server app as metadata, so all you need is the address of the data to hook up to the correct server that does notifications over WS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a schematic of the relationship between the apps. I apologize for my handwriting which used to be much better. I hardly write by hand anymore these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Schematic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This, btw is exactly the infrastructure neeed by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bhc3.com/2009/01/16/before-there-was-twitter-there-was-dave-winers-instant-outliner/&quot;&gt;Instant Outliner&lt;/a&gt; via OPML. The apps that generate the OPML could be outliners, or really any app that wants to deal in outline-structured data. But the protocol is general enough so it could be used for any data file type. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In a few days, once the app has been running for a while, and I have a good demo put together, I'll publish a pointer to a compatible OPML file, and provide example code running in a browser for requesting notification via Web Sockets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today's journalism is not a wartime journalism. Even though we've been at war in west Asia for 20 years, and in a civil war 30. Journalism has been living in the 80s, I guess. The assumption being that elections and laws have meaning. In war, elections don't matter. You can't win a war in court.</description>

			<description>I tried to listen to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/max-boot-on-future-democracy-joe-manchin-gops-threat/id1523896927?i=1000524616180&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; today, an interview with another political insider, Max Boot, member of a political thinktank and columnist for the Washington Post. It's the same discussion you can hear on every cable news show or political podcast. Basic question -- what can we do to stop the Repubs from taking over the government and destroying everything. They run through all the options and come to the conclusion that there actually is nothing to be done. I got through the first ten minutes, on a 1/2 hour drive to town, so I paused his show, got out my iPhone and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/08/dearJoe.m4a&quot;&gt;recorded my response&lt;/a&gt;. I don't like picking on Joe, he's a nice person. The thing that makes him different from say Chris Hayes is that he might listen. There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; something that can be done. But it means leaving business as usual behind. You can't win a war with an enemy that is 1/2 of your government. So listen to my 12-minute answer to Joe.</description>

			<description>When your “worth” rises, that’s not income. You don’t pay income tax until you sell the asset whose worth increased. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax&quot;&gt;Journalism&lt;/a&gt; almost never explains this. That’s why if your net worth rises by say $1 billion, you might not pay any income tax.</description>

			<description>An example. I inherited &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_retirement_account&quot;&gt;IRAs&lt;/a&gt; from my parents. You can put income into an IRA to defer taxes until you retire, when presumably you will have less income and therefore will pay less tax. My parents' IRAs outlived them, so I'm holding them, the taxes still deferred. They will be one of the last things I sell to pay the rent and buy groceries. It might be that their IRAs will outlive me too! I also am holding stock that has appreciated. Nothing like Bezos or Musk, but I don't want to sell the stock until I have to because I don't want to pay taxes on the appreciation, and I think/hope the stock will hold its value. In other words, everyone tries to keep taxes to a minimum, not just the super rich. The government knows this, and uses that desire to create incentives. In the case of IRAs, they want people to save for retirement.</description>

			<description>I bet our European allies say privately to Biden, we won't begin to trust the US again until you put Trump behind bars. I would if I were them. Hey I would if I were me! Trump's insurrection is ongoing. What would you expect, we're not putting up any resistance. And right now, theoretically at least, the resistance occupies the White House. I don't know if Biden understands why he was elected.</description>

I was in love with a beautiful young woman. I was a beautiful young man. I had so many friends. We all went swimming. I had a key to the computer lab at the university. I would go swimming every day. Sometimes in the lap pool out by the Ag School. Other times at a flooded rock quarry outside town. We went to the farmer's market on Sundays up by the Capitol. Fish fry on Friday night at Crandall's. This was life at its best. I had everything. I'm not doing too bad these days, and I have the memory of swimming in love, health and creativity when I was young. Nothing better than that.</description>

			<title>Trump is a bastard</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm so tired of people trying to figure out if Trump is crazy or what. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what we know about him.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He's a bastard.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He would go out of his way to hurt anyone, no exceptions. Even his family.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does he know he lost? Sure, and   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He knows everyone knows, including his fans.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump likes that he can get all his fans to say what they know are lies, and force the people he hates to keep saying that Trump is lying and then revel that they're too chickenshit to do anything about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is the school yard bully from Queens, a person I've met many times growing up, who has no shame and his only love is causing deep pain for others.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing he didn't find a way to nuke the planet while he was president. I'm sure he would have loved it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Is JSON easier to read than XML?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe: JSON is easier to read than XML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JSON is generally arranged as an outline, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JSON generally has more whitespace, better arranged, &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;XML is more dense, and&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Lists are easier to read vertically than horizontally.&quot;,                                    &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However there are no rules about how either JSON or XML are arranged, where the whitespace goes, how indentation works, or even if there is any whitespace or indentation, so it's possible to create totally unreadable data in either format.                                &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Electric Drummer screen shot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A progress report on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Drummer is mainly a web app, but it is also a desktop app for the Mac known as Electric Drummer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is coming along nicely. I've been using ED for a couple of weeks now, and find it's way better than any other outliner I've used for web writing. It should be, it's the newest, and has lots of promising features. But it's really nice when the software you've been dreaming about, and working hard to create, is suddenly usable for what you designed it for. Electric Drummer is there now. Yippee!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/06/edScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my workspace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't hate the Nets for any reason other than they are (I hope) the last instance of a superteam, a concept pioneered by LeBron James, whose career as a superteam founder is now over, btw, as of this week. Basketball is a sport. I know it's also a business, but I don't give my heart to businesses. Sorry.</description>
