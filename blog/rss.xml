			<description>I've been trying to figure out what to call these things. For now, I've settled on personal chatbot, like a &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; computer.</description>

			<description>My personal chatbot is a good writer, composition-wise. I asked it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/30/food.png&quot;&gt;what kind of food I like&lt;/a&gt;, and it answered with a story about me and my longtime bud Dave Jacobs and how we both like Chinese food. It's been a long time since I've taken a writing class, but I think that would get a good grade. Find a way to tell a story, rather than just reciting facts. Make it about people, and people will read it.</description>

			<description>I wonder if my personal chatbot should have a name. I asked the bot if it had a preference. I quote the bot: &quot;As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or emotions, so I don't require a name. However, if you'd like to refer to me in a specific way, you can choose any name that you prefer.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Reasonable.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

If so, it's justified. There are orders of magnitude too many programmers. The tech industry doesn't factor, they do the opposite, reimplement things that work well, or throw out things that work well in favor of things that don't work at all. I think the bots are now going to help us do the factoring we humans wouldn't do on our own. All the layoffs in tech foretell this. The truth is stranger than fiction.</description>

			<description>The reason it's nice to have old people around is that we don't care about the future in a personal way, so we might just tell you the truth. We also tend to be smartasses. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I think &quot;personal chatbot&quot; may be a fanciful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anachronistic&quot;&gt;anachronistic&lt;/a&gt; name, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2003/07/31/chrisLydonsWeblogForTheEar.html&quot;&gt;weblog for the ears&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately became podcasting.</description>

			<title>What is Frontier?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: This was written by my personal chatbot, obviously based on things I have written. It's pretty good, even though some of its facts are wrong, and includes some ideas I never came up with but make sense. I've never put it together this concisely though, so it points to another use for chatbots, distilling a lot of data into a few paragraphs, which you can then edit to make come out like you want it to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Frontier is a software environment developed by UserLand Software in the late 1990s (Note: development actually started in 1988). It was designed to be a high-level scripting environment that combined an outliner-based editor, an object database, and an integrated scripting language. Frontier was used to build a variety of web-based applications and services, including content management systems, blogging platforms, and syndication tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At its core, Frontier is an outliner-based environment that allows users to create and manipulate hierarchical outlines of information. These outlines can be used to store and organize data, as well as to create scripts and macros that automate tasks within the environment. Frontier also includes an object database that allows developers to store and retrieve data in a structured way, as well as an integrated scripting language that can be used to create custom applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Frontier was a pioneering platform in the early days of the web, and it played a key role in the development of many of the technologies that we take for granted today, including RSS syndication and web-based content management systems. While Frontier is no longer actively developed, its legacy lives on in many of the tools and technologies that we use today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just asked my chatbot about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_newspaper_strike_of_1994&quot;&gt;San Francisco newspaper strike in 1994&lt;/a&gt;, which was a seminal event for blogging, believe it or not -- and there's probably more stuff in my archive about that event than in the rest of the web. So I'm going to link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22san+francisco+newspaper+strike%22+1994&quot;&gt;Google search result&lt;/a&gt; instead. Let's see how that works! It's a reminder that for some things, Google is still considerably better than my chatbot.</description>

So I'm going to link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22san+francisco+newspaper+strike%22+1994&quot;&gt;Google search result&lt;/a&gt; instead.

			<description>I've been asking my chatbot what I think of various tech companies, people and products. For example, here's what I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/whatDaveSaidAboutGeneralMagic.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;about General Magic&lt;/a&gt;, a Silicon Valley company that led in early PDA products. The team was made up of past and future tech superstars. Note that I just added to what I say about the company, so it'll be interesting to ask this question again in a few days. We haven't got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmarkdown?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;Markdown version&lt;/a&gt; of my RSS feed flowing through the database yet.</description>

			<description>BTW, it seems Markdown has become the default way to feed new data into chatbots. We're converting my OPML files to Markdown. As always -- Markdown is &quot;Just Enough HTML.&quot;</description>

			<description>Noted that my blog has been taken over by my chatbot which desperately needs a name. I wonder how the chatbot will absorb references to itself. And of course then come the third level references, which is what this post is. Oh the humanity!</description>

			<description>Then I asked if there was a connection between &quot;Just Enough HTML&quot; and Markdown, and omg it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/29/connectionbetweenjustenoughhtmlandmarkdown.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;got the answer&lt;/a&gt; totally right!

			<description>My new (today!) chatbot, programmed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/scriptingNewsSource/scriptingInMarkdown.zip&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog, going back 28+ years, is up and I've been playing with it, and am as impressed as I hoped I would. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/28/whoInventedRss.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, I asked who invented RSS? Can you imagine how much Iâ€™ve written about RSS in 20+ years? The first part is boilerplate, could have come from any site, but the second part was a very concise, thorough and interesting synopsis of years of &lt;i&gt;my writing&lt;/i&gt; about feeds. The chatbot did very good work.</description>

			<description>One great thing about the new chatbot for my blog is that it gives me a greater incentive to post here, vs social media. Of course we must be just days away from a Mastodon instance that you pay to join that adds every tweet to its dataset. A place of record. Maybe they should even charge per tweet.</description>

			<description>In the next election the Dems must make the Repubs defend the idea of school kids being murdered without any help from the government. If they can't manage that, we need to find new political leaders. And when the Repubs bullshit, the Dems have to say they're bullshitting.</description>

I feel like a teen with his first car when I drive it. It's so smooth and powerful, grabs the curves on mountain roads so effortlessly. Elon Musk -- feh. What a schmuck.

			<title>Started on Scripting chatbot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelhop.io/&quot;&gt;pixelhop&lt;/a&gt;, in the UK on this. Started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/255&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For this project, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/scriptingNewsSource/scriptingInMarkdown.zip&quot;&gt;one big archive&lt;/a&gt; with all the stuff I have from 1994 to 2023. All converted to Markdown, organized by year, with a separate folder for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt;, which is how it all started in 1994. We should just import all of it. And that will be the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As we make progress I'll report it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/255&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- I was sure Scripting News would make a good test case for this stuff, because the archive goes back so far and includes lots of stuff from other blogs, esp at the beginning. It was the hub for the early blogosphere. I think researchers in general will find it's a strong use-case if not reference source. I was very conscious of this as the years went by, and tried to make it an archive not just for my work but for what was going on around it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The scene ends with them lying on a bed together, clothed, far apart, but holding hands. I thought, if you're going to do it, this is the way.

Let there be at least a little love in the last moment." created="Mon, 27 Mar 2023 20:49:04 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/27/successionPoster.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/03/27.html#a204904"/>

			<description>It would be nice if someone developed a Mastodon gateway for apps. A system that played the role that twitter.com played for the Twitter API (only it would be really easy to be better, btw). Otherwise does every developer really have to do one of their own? That's gotta be factorable. Just because Twitter is languishing, it doesn't mean that a new system that does what Twitter did, without any of the Muskness or history, couldn't come in and fill the space occupied by Twitter. Don't assume people don't want. I bet a lot do. Learned this from our experience with RSS. You have to accept facts, not be wishful about these things. Be prepared.</description>

			<description>Ken Smith tried an experiment.

So ChatGPT is also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, which was a breakthrough because all of a sudden we could program our own music.

We'd sit there with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck&quot;&gt;cassette recorder&lt;/a&gt; waiting for the song to come around so we could get a copy of it. Then think of what a huge revelation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; was. All of a sudden the floodgates of music opened up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia&quot;&gt;Jerry Garcia&lt;/a&gt; didn't make it to that moment, he would've loved it, I'm sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&quot;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was alive, not sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bollier.org/blog/goodbye-pete-seeger&quot;&gt;how he felt&lt;/a&gt; about it. But anyone who really loved music imho, had to have been overjoyed. People were talking about music in airports and supermarkets. You had to be there. Napster was like years of Christmas every day for music lovers everywhere. Of course the music industry didn't agree.</description>

I'm still pretty confused about what it is, the same way I was confused about the web in 1994 when I first got Mosaic and was reading various early websites. I can use it, but how do I create for it? I have a huge dataset of my own, most of 28+ years of my writing here on Scripting News starting in 1994. Anyway, the first thing I did was ask if I can add my own data to their massive dataset (their term) and it said yes. I asked how, and it sounds really easy, totally within my ability to do, and almost certainly within your ability too. I took screen shots of the relevant parts of the discussion and added it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254#issuecomment-1484102808&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I started on this topic. I will try this out and report back.</description>

			<description>Here's the thing about Twitter. Since they started showing the number of impressions on every tweet, you can see how meaningless the number of followers is. You could have 66.7K followers, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1639404110725402626&quot;&gt;your tweet&lt;/a&gt; might still only get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/25/tweetscreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;764 views&lt;/a&gt;. Once, a long time ago, Twitter was a flow machine. Now it's like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2022/11/29/drying-california-lake-to-get-250m-in-us-drought-funding&quot;&gt;dry lakebed&lt;/a&gt;. A void.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A small change --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Before the recent transition, when you chose &lt;i&gt;My News Product&lt;/i&gt; from the menu, it would open your news product on my.feedland.org.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After the transition, it opens the same page on newsproduct.scripting.com. This was an oversight, and imho incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now it reverts back to my.feedland.org, which is imho a much more appropriate name.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My new product is at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.feedland.org/davewiner&quot;&gt;my.feedland.org/davewiner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/newsProducts.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for news products. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
