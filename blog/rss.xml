			<description>I use a Mac. I keep the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/macbook-air/the-dock-apd4b7fb731f/mac&quot;&gt;desktop Dock&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the main screen. I want to be sure the dock doesn't magically get moved to the second screen. It happens every few days, if I click in the dock in a certain way. Is there some way to lock the dock in place, at the bottom of the main screen? It doesn't seem there should be any mouse click that gets the dock to move such a great physical and conceptual distance.</description>

			<description>More &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/17/dialogsFromHell.png&quot;&gt;bad human factors&lt;/a&gt; from Apple. I've had this problem where it complains about disks being ejected that I never ejected. I deal with it, but today there seems to be an infinite number of these dialogs. I've been clicking on the Close button in these dialogs for ten minutes, and it's impossible to know how many there are. It feels like thousands. I've tried pressing modifier keys while clicking, to no avail.</description>

			<description>One more. I got a new pair of AirPods, couldn't live without them. I couldn't for the life of me read the very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/17/instructions.png&quot;&gt;simple instructions&lt;/a&gt;. Letters are a light gray on a white background and tiny. Why? They have so much space. Why not use a big font and black letters? Did they user-test this at all? Are their designers sadists? Questions questions.</description>

We'd develop a whole language around various intonations and combinations of oy. Give it a try.

			<description>I thought &quot;cutting the wire&quot; would save me money, but it actually costs a lot more for the same programming. I am currently spending $65 for both YouTube TV and Fubo, and $12 for Hulu, and no HBO, though I really want it. If you add it up, it's about $150 a month. So I called Spectrum to see if I could get that without the set top box, and if so, how much would it cost. Turns out it's about $40 on top of my internet service, with all the local sports, weather, news, CNN, MSNBC and HBO. I'm going to cancel the others, I'm sure I'll miss something, but one thing I won't miss is having to remember where to go for each of the shows I'm interested in. And of course I still have Netflix and Amazon. So I'm back to where I was before I naively threw all my cards in the air. Back to Roku and Spectrum. I guess I learned a lot. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It's ridiculous at this time to say that Clubhouse will be a raging success. But people like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/&quot;&gt;verdicts&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>BTW, I forgive Wired for doing that.

			<title>Facebook and journalism, yet again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the disconnect with journalism and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not journalism. And that's not an insult to Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not journalism the way the telephone is not journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook says you can publish on our site. Go right ahead. That's the opposite of journalism which says, you want to publish on our site, get in line, and conform to our values, look like us, and then 1 out 10000 will get in. It's even tougher than Harvard or Princeton. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So journalism keeps trying to fit Facebook into their model. Facebook says this can't work. Journalism calls them names. That's where we are right now in this great fight between the people and journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The real force here is not Facebook the company or their servers, which are impressive and very valuable -- it's the people who use Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back in the late 80s I started a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://userland.com/&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt;. My second company. I knew that was going to be the name when I was running my first, Living Videotext. It was named after the tech. By the time I was ready for the second, I came to believe that every company is about the users, not the tech, hence UserLand. 33 years later, I feel the same way, only more so.</description>

			<title>McNeil, the Jeremy Lin of the NYT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hoped that when Ben Smith &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/business/media/new-york-times-donald-mcneil.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/210214/p5#a210214p5&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the Donald McNeil firing at the NYT, he'd look at the media angle, not the internal chaos at the NYT. I guess maybe in a sense that is media? It's an old story, honestly I think only journalism insiders care. I don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;McNeil was like &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Jeremy Lin%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 and the NYT was the Knicks. Right person at the right place at the right time. And (oddly) the NYT did the same thing with McNeil that the Knicks did with Lin. Weird how that works. Someone should write a book. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What mattered with Lin and what matters with McNeil is that the users love them. You should check that out. I could go into great detail, but honestly that's not my job. I'm a user and actually a longtime fan of both the Knicks and the NYT. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ask the NYT reporter who covers the Knicks now. They're doing great. They have a bunch of Jeremy Lins now. Somehow they figured out their business. The NYT imho is drifting further and further away from it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The combo of McNeil and the Daily podcast was gold. Why did they break up the team? Ben, that would be a story worthy of you. Again imho. A fan. Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/14/theTrumpWeKnewIsGone.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: It's the day after the death of the thing we called Donald Trump. In this podcast I explain how magical things happen in the days after someone you're close to dies. It feels that way with Trump. We got one last look at him, not in person, because the person is gone, the Trump who watched TV and tweeted all day from the White House. Gone, not forgotten, becoming a distant memory. What little is left is finishing up old business, and then will depart for good. It's a 20 minute series of stories. Hope you enjoy!</description>

			<description>I just released a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute&quot;&gt;everyMinute&lt;/a&gt; script. It's now incorporated into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly emailer&lt;/a&gt;. So the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330&quot;&gt;drift I wrote about earlier&lt;/a&gt; should now be gone. Fingers crossed. Knock wood. I am not a lawyer. Praise Murphy.

			<description>Jason Calacanis &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1361016929993908227&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the Knicks are good at basketball again. They really are. They have two full teams now. I love the way they did it, not like the Nets, Clippers, Lakers. They didn't buy a team of rental players. It's a home grown team. There are a half dozen Jeremy Lins on this team. So much fun to watch.</description>

			<description>I think Apple could make a diff in cars. The other day I was on a longish drive and wanted to listen to the NPR coverage of the Senate hearings. I went in and out of range of various NPR stations. Something the car could have handled for me. A data processing function.</description>

			<description>Listening to pundits yesterday, it was remarkable they forgot how scared we were on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/07.html&quot;&gt;January 7&lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t the end of the insurrection. Something had to be done and impeachment was the only option.

			<description>There is a silver lining to Trump's acquittal. He can now go back to his new occupation of Former Pain In The Ass. Let the bill collectors and district attorneys have him. And Hawley, Cruz and Cotton can go back to their Hitler lessons. Maybe a new reality show that every week gives you a glimpse of the miserable life of a would-be despot, who failed.</description>

			<title>I'm not too depressed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Net-net I'm not too depressed about the Senate acquittal because I remember how the impeachment happened. It was the only instant response possible. (Except as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/remove-trump-tonight/617576/&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; pointed out at the time, the Senate could have met and voted him out of office the same day, that would have been awesome. Wish they had the guts to do it.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The inauguration was two weeks away. The concern was what would happen next. People say McConnell refused to have the trial before Trump left, but actually that was somewhat rational. They needed to clean up the Capitol, it was trashed, covered in blood and human excrement, and secure it. It sure looked like there would be more attacks at the time. Also don't forget that then-VP Pence refused to consider the 25th Amendment. He gets his share of the credit, if you want to blame McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We know how it turned out now, but we did not know then. And of course a conviction wouldn't have had much practical value. I think it's better if Trump fades into obscurity. Let minor government officials harass him now. He'll protest. &quot;But but I'm the great Trump!&quot; No, you're now a defendant in criminal and civil trials. Then, no you are a bankrupt resident of a federal or state prison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's give him something to really complain about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I guess most people think we go back to business as usual with Congress doing more or less what it did at some point in the past. If so, I think you've got blinders on.</description>

			<title>Afternoon impeachment notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We have bigger fish to fry with the pandemic, and it's not just good enough to defeat it, people have to feel the government defeating it. Maybe we don't have a Congress anymore. Maybe it's Biden and a fig leaf for a Congress. Clearly they can't deal with the problem of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For right now, treat Congress as a museum. This is a shell of what it used to be. You have to use your imagination to see that there once was a co-equal branch of government here. Now they're a PR appendage for the executive branch. They give the MSNBC and CNN journos something to fuss over. Keeps them busy when they aren't reporting on President Biden's latest heroic battle against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the Repubs win Congress in 2022, who cares. It’s a powerless former coequal branch of government. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;President Biden will do as he pleases. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up, as with the filibuster there will soon be a virtual insurrection. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fantasy presidency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then Biden renames Air Force One The Rocinante.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden and his wily clever sidekick -- Fauci Man! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden and Fauci and Super Veep roam the country, fighting the MAGAs and The Virus, making America safe for whatever comes next. Have to figure that part out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't believe in the death penalty for people, no matter how enraged I am at what they did. But I do believe in the death penalty for political parties. If the Repubs don't vote to convict, a small gesture of respect for the Constitution, we must condemn the party to death.</description>

			<description>I asked my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/12/164054.html?title=myImmunity&quot;&gt;biomedtech friend&lt;/a&gt; to review my immunity &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/12/164054.html?title=myImmunity&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You’re good to go anywhere a week after the second shot, don’t worry about it! Even if you’re that 5% yes you almost certainly have some immune training that will keep you out of the hospital. Now is the time to enjoy your life and not worry, at some point a nastier variant could evade the vax but not yet man so go enjoy the spring and summer!&quot;</description>

			<description>I tried watching Trump's impeachment defense, but the instant I tuned in I heard the lie. I immediately turned it off. This is the moment of truth when the Republican Party, or most of it, legally, openly and on the record becomes &lt;i&gt;the party of sedition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Recall that I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/10.html#a163710&quot;&gt;gave up&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=asc_df_B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=366402654398&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=5599194572670142815&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-852536612290&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=74513439285&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=366402654398&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=5599194572670142815&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvtargid=pla-852536612290&quot;&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt; and Skullcandy earbuds. They both sounded horribly tinny, like an old style AM radio. Actually I didn't give up, it turns out. While watching impeachment hearings, I searched for reports on the Jabra earpods and the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=jabra+elite+75t+tinny&quot;&gt;tinny&lt;/a&gt;, and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Jabra/comments/hf1z9k/should_the_jabra_elite_75t_sound_very_tinny/&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. Basically they said do a bunch of voodoo, put them back in their case, take them out, do it again, change the silicon fits, do it all again, say a prayer, and sooner or later they will sound like you thought they should based on the glowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Wirecutter. It worked! Unreal. This is another example of the way we used to fix broken Apple II's, just take them for a drive in the car, and they start working again. Anyway, good enough. And in the interim I ordered a new pair of Apple Airpod Pros, because I got hooked, and had headset-envy every time I saw someone on TV wearing them. As I've said many times, I collect headsets the same way some &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagesix.com/2021/02/03/kanye-west-moves-500-pairs-of-shoes-out-of-home-shared-with-kim-kardashian/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; collect shoes.</description>

			<description>BTW, Google search is getting worse all the time. I know I've told the story of how we used to fix Apple II's by driving around (they always seemed to work when we got to the repair shop), and I've also said many times that I collect headphones the way some people collect shoes, but Google can no longer find either. I've been using Google search since 1998. I hate Google for the way &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html#a170258&quot;&gt;they treated RSS&lt;/a&gt;, and the way they are doing the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;to the web&lt;/a&gt;, but I've been using their search engine for 23 years, and it's a hard habit to break, but one way to break it is to break search, which they seem to be doing. They should shrug this off at their own peril. Imagine Coke taking the fizz out of their cola. Same basic idea imho.</description>

Same basic idea imho." created="Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:00:51 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/02/12.html#a160051"/>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems likely say 8 Repubs are going to vote to convict.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That means 58 out of 100, a solid bipartisan majority.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty damning imho for the 42 who voted to acquit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet that puts pressure on *some* of the 42 to either be sick the day of the vote, or vote to convict.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My immunity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Next week I'm getting the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had mild side-effects with the first shot, which I got on January 20, also Inauguration Day. I expect it to be worse this time, but I'm excited and a little disoriented by the new reality. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A couple of weeks later, say by March 3, according to the science, I will be at 95% immunity. This means the probability of me getting infected, everything else constant, is only 5% of what it was before January 20.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A bit of info I don't have -- if I were to get infected would it be less likely to be severe or deadly?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course I'm going to continue to be masked. I ordered some new Docker brand masks for the event. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What should I risk after immunity? Go to the movies? Drive down to the city, just to get some bagels perhaps or ride a CitiBike in Central Park? These would seem very exotic now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's been 1.5 years since I've been to a city larger than Kingston, NY. I'm actually quite happy about that. I like life in the mountains.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suggestion to movie theater owners. Offer 1/2 price to anyone who is fully vaccinated. Or Olive Garden, or Applebee's.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And yes this is yet another boomer privilege. It's fair to hate me but only for this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Fresca Blackberry Citrus%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Fresca Blackberry Citrus&lt;/a&gt; sparkling soda water. I tried it because I like regular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/945757610/#comment72157601091354345&quot;&gt;Fresca&lt;/a&gt;. My first taste was yuck this is like water with just a little hint of flavor. So I kept drinking my Diet Dr Pepper, my current go-to carbonated beverage. But then I ran out of chilled DDP, so I went with the backup, and the second time, wow, it was a super refreshing, bubbly instant thirst quench. I know this sounds like a commercial, but that's really where I'm at now. I'd pick Fresca Blackberry Citrus over &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; at this point. Have to get some more. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I've been watching the impeachment trial on and off. It's excellent. They thought of everything. Just asked a big question -- what if Trump had succeeded. He came close. What if they had killed a few senators, the VP, the Speaker. What would have happened next? Clearly this whole thing was planned, probably around the time Barr left. Did he see how it was shaping up and decided to get out then. Are the only ones who stood with Trump up to the coup, Hawley and Cruz? Were they surprised when the mob got into the Capitol? So many questions. A lot of them are off-topic for the impeachment, but historians are going to want to know how this came together.</description>

			<title>It's about power, not feelings</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have never watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-mandalorian-star-gina-carano-fired-amid-social-media-controversy&quot;&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt;, never wanted to. I saw the big comeback Star Wars movie a few years ago and was bored. All the comic book movies are boring. So I have no idea who the actress is who got cancelled, I don't know what she said. But the reaction to her being fired is huge and obnoxious, as usual. So I know it's wrong. Whatever she said, the response is not appropriate to the offense. It's like one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm&quot;&gt;cytokine storms&lt;/a&gt; that kills you when you get Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, she's been fired, you won, you can shut up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's supposedly all about your feelings. But that's bullshit, right? It's really about power. You like being part of a mob. It's primal. It's probably the same rush the people who invaded the Capitol got. You didn't get sad and depressed, you were excited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Trumpers say they don't give a fuck about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/11/trumpersAreObnoxious.png&quot;&gt;your feelings&lt;/a&gt;. That gets them hot, and I bet it gets you hot too. The conflict is what you love, right? Here's your chance to have power over someone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/06/154705.html?title=nyTimesFiresDonaldMcneil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. i've read everything i can get my hands on about his cancelling by the NY Times. There isn't much out there. They say 150 staffers at the NYT wrote a letter where they say that he said a word that makes them feel bad and because of that McNeil must go. And he is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Balance that against the huge good that keeping him at the NYT does for people who want to be informed about the pandemic. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; of Anthony Fauci on the Daily podast was amazing. i don't doubt that he saved people's lives in the last year in the podcasts he did and the reports he wrote in the Times. i don't know if he saved my life, but it's possible. I was thirsty to know what was going on, and he has been learning about this his entire career. And he knows how to explain things. Really powerful stuff, right up there with Fauci. He was cancelled. no transparency, no consideration of anyone outside their elite bubble at the NYT. They're royalty so their feelings rule. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So we replace one Trump with another. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please just stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
