			<description>I’d like a political leader who says what I’m thinking, a kind of Occam’s Razor president. For the white supremacists, that’s what Trump is, and he’s good at it, and that’s why they’re winning.</description>

			<description>Since people are moving out of cities, it would be so cool if they moved to swing states. In case we manage to get rid of Trump and restore the rule of law, it would be helpful to better-distribute blue state voters to places their votes are needed. Even better, move to low population red states, like Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, the Dakotas.</description>

I shuffled phone numbers around and am disconnected from my old account on my iPhone, which is still my &quot;main&quot; mobile device. Apparently Signal can sync with a desktop computer but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Can+I+use+signal+on+two+phones&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; with another phone? Did I say oy?

			<description>BTW, I got $0 in trade for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/09.html#a211924&quot;&gt;iPhone XS/Max&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/09.html#a211924&quot;&gt;cracked display&lt;/a&gt;. Oh well. It was a reallllly expensive phone, around $1500 if I recall correctly. The new iPhone SE is even nicer and was only $350. And I also love the Pixel 4a. I can't decide which is nicer. But what is great is both Apple and Google are now making inexpensive phones with formerly high-end features. If you're using an old phone, even one that's only two years old as I was, it's worth looking at the new Google and Apple offerings.</description>

			<description>BTW, the Pixel 4a has a headphone jack. At one time that was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/10/28/appleMakingRoomForPixelAndSurface.html&quot;&gt;big deal&lt;/a&gt; for me, but not no mo. It feels weird. I wonder if I'll find a use for it. Basically Bluetooth works reliably now. At one time, not too long ago, it did not.</description>

			<description>NakedJen asked how's the camera on the iPhone SE. She's thinking about getting one so she can use Clubhouse. I haven't even tried the SE's camera, I've been so focused on the Pixel 4a's. I will do some picture taking with it.</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/19/172840.html?title=mouseInvasion&quot;&gt;mouse infestation&lt;/a&gt; in my car. I had the car fumigated, but sadly, the stench is as bad as ever. I'm going to find out what I can get for the car in trade, and move on. A &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; expensive lesson. On the other hand, I asked my fellow Woodstockers how they deal with mice and cars, and I have learned so much. I'm going to make a list of all the ways people keep the mouse damage to a minimum, and I'm going to practice it. I was very lax, liberal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire&quot;&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/a&gt; even with the local mouse community. No more. I am on the warpath. It's them or me! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I’ve praised Andrew Sullivan in the past, so I have to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/the-trap-the-democrats-walked-right&quot;&gt;his latest&lt;/a&gt; is just propaganda, garbage, filled with lies. I guess this is what he’s like unchained from NY Mag. I didn’t read his stuff before he moved to NYM. He’s like a Fox commenter. Vile. And because he's smart, he must know what he's doing. My friends said I was wrong about him when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/10/commentsOnSullivansPiece.html&quot;&gt;praised him&lt;/a&gt;, writing from his &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/andrew-sullivan-president-trump-and-the-end-of-the-republic.html&quot;&gt;NYM pulpit&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>One more thing. Perhaps the Democrats should campaign on fear, just a bit. Think about what a second term for Trump might bring, specifically. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1299622748130598913&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about that, a short one.  &quot;Trump wins second term, masks are now illegal. The virus is declared dead. We are forced to go to indoor centers, until we all get the virus, so the economy can reopen fully.&quot; I'm sure Trump unchained would try to bring his version of Hitler to the US, with serious advantages. Hitler didn't have nukes, America's wealth or an ally like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&quot;&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;. He can and I'm sure will do a lot of damage. I think people should be confronted with that very specific vision, in all states, red and blue.</description>

			<description>At least pause for a moment before replying and ask yourself why this person is saying Black Lives Matter. Of course they know and agree that all lives matter. But that isn't what they're saying. They're saying that Black Lives Matter not because they're more important than white lives or cop lives, which seems to be how you're interpreting it, but because a lot of black people are being killed and the justice system does not seem to care.</description>

			<description>There have been a seemingly endless series of graphic stories, many of them on video, of white police killing black people, and getting off. I suspect this has been going on all along, but now with the wide use of smartphones, we're actually seeing it, visually, as we couldn't have seen it before. Now it's not their word against a cop's. The video provides testimony that is impossible to refute.</description>

			<description>If you were black, and you saw this happening, you might be inspired to do more than say something like Black Lives Matter. Your rage and fear might overwhelm you. So the first thing I would say to a black person who said Black Lives Matter is thank you for containing the rage you must feel, that I would feel if I were in your shoes, that I feel in a small way on your behalf, at the cruelty and callousness of our system and culture. Then I'd ask if there was anything I could do to help.</description>

			<description>NakedJen is now on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. To Jen, some people are on all the time. I'm not one of them, at least not yet. But I want to hang out with you, so if you want to chat with me, send me a ping. Best way is to start a room, and click + and invite me. I'll get notification on my phone. I may not show up. That's the protocol. Love that you're there!</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pacific-content/trailblazers-with-walter-isaacson&quot;&gt;Trailblazers podcast&lt;/a&gt; about podcasting. The segment with my interview starts around minute 11. I also get the last word. It came out perfectly, couldn't have asked for a better review of my role in podcasting. I only wish my Mom were around to hear this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/25/flatDiscussionGroups.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; on flat discussion groups on the net. Mail lists, Facebook groups, GitHub threads, Clubhouse chatrooms. People in these flat structures always behave the same way over time. After 40 years of being part of online groups, I see there are no new tricks in the human species, these things always evolve the same way. That's what this podcast is about. Might be a chapter in a book someday.</description>

			<description>Over the years I've resisted characterizing the Trump voter because I was pretty sure it was more than racism, because we're all racist. It takes a special kind of racism to act on it the way they do. I think it's best described as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy&quot;&gt;white supremacy&lt;/a&gt;. All kinds of things freak them out but the one that they can't live with is equality for &quot;others.&quot; Strips their gears. Not negotiable. They'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mluckovichajc/status/1298027757990010881/photo/1&quot;&gt;tear the country down&lt;/a&gt; before they let that happen. As long as all they have to do is vote. They're not very strong, and as soon as hard times really hits them they'll crumble. They've lived sheltered lives for generations, feel entitled.</description>
