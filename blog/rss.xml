			<description>Journalism has fallen back into covering the horse race, and don't see giving respect to the Repubs as being the same as respecting Putin, but it is. They are the same thing.</description>

			<description>A kind of obvious question. Why isn't there a realtime connection between Facebook and Netflix or HBO or Apple TV or whatever. So that when I'm browsing movies I can see which of my friends loved it. I'm sure they must've had talks about this. it's so obvious. Or why didn't Facebook buy one of them? Wouldn't it be more of a sure thing than (drumroll please) The Metaverse. For that matter why isn't there a similar connection between Amazon and Facebook?</description>

			<title>Defund Fox News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Cutting off the public funding of Fox News is as important to the security of the United States as providing arms to Ukraine in its fight to survive the Russian attack, or sanctioning Russia to cut off the money they need to continue the war. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People seem to forget or overlook that the United States is very much under attack by Russia, since they dominate one of our two political parties. The source of that dominance is Fox News. If there is a World War III, Fox will have played a major role in making it happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the US, many of the cable systems were given monopolies by local government. For example if you live in Berkeley, CA, your only choice is Comcast. In NYC, it's Spectrum (formerly Time-Warner Cable). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Fox News is always included in the basic minimal package. That means we're all paying for it, even if you believe as I do that they are deliberately trying to overthrow our government and turn it over to Putin, for some reason I seriously do not understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don't want to pay for Fox News&lt;/b&gt;, yet I'm paying just the same. Some portion of my monthly bill is paid to them, even though I think they are the enemy of the United States, and funding them I am undermining the future of my country. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The system must change. We must be given a choice of stations that are included in our package. I would probably choose to subscribe to MSNBC and CNN, though there are times when I think I would unsub them too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we can afford more competition in this area. But I am sure we can't afford to keep subsidizing Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A question for devs. When connecting a web client to a server, do you do polling, long polling or websockets for real time updates? Do you know what Twitter does? Facebook? Any other popular &quot;live&quot; web app.</description>

			<description>I did a bunch of driving today and thought of a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/communities#create-admin&quot;&gt;Twitter communities&lt;/a&gt; I should make. Unfortunately at this point you have to apply to do it. I guess I must've applied at one point. I'd like to start a community to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Defund+Fox+News%22&quot;&gt;Defund Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. Basically it'll be a mail list. I'd only mail to it when there's an action you can participate in to help unbundle cable systems so you and I don't have to give money to Fox News which is now hosting an openly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lara-logan-theory-of-evolution-anti-semitism-1328721/&quot;&gt;anti-semitic news star&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Today's Tesla drive</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I took a drive upstate this morning, on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;NYS Thruway&lt;/a&gt; and on country roads.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/21/tesla.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I drove as much as possible with the car self-driving such as it is. It's a lot of fun to see what it can and can't handle. There was one place where the Thruway narrowed to one lane, and it freaked out because it couldn't tell if it was driving off the road or what. So I took over. It's like having a teenage driver helping out, and you just have to be ready to take the wheel to get it through difficult situations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once when a truck was exiting the highway in the same lane I was in, as it switched to the lane to the right, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tesla&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; slowed from about 50 or so to 25, very quickly. I couldn't figure out what it thought it saw. Just guessing that the software, confused, decided better to be safe. I love it for trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt;, but it really wasn't necessary. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the way back, after I told it where I was going, it first looked for charging stations, apparently found none that were on the way. Then after a pause of a second or two, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/29/stayUnder75.png&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt; appeared. Basically if you stay under 75 you have enough battery to get home without detouring to get a charge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It correctly merged onto the Thruway all on its own. A long curved on-ramp, its max MPH as I instructed it was 70, but it slowed to 30 to handle the curve on the ramp. The speed limit was 25 btw. As as passenger, basically, I was glad it slowed down a little. More time to appreciate how well it was doing. I tend to be a nervous passenger, much prefer to be the driver. That's changing now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also at one point I was being followed by another Tesla. I imagined they were doing the same thing I was doing. Appreciating the teenage intelligence of the machine. Eventually they passed me. I wondered why.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One other thing -- instead of listening to my own music I let Amazon Music choose it for me. Very nice. I don't know how they know I like the bands they gave me to listen to. But they guessed very well.  Their best choice was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTPndsG_KA4&quot;&gt;Dead song&lt;/a&gt; I hadn't heard in a long time but had special meaning to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got the car in November, it's almost April now, and I'm actually starting to use the car as more than a thrilling ride, beginning to appreciate its finer points. It does take that long to get the feel, and yet it seems I've only begun. This is fundamentally different driving than what I learned when I was 17.  Of course my 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945&quot;&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; is too, but this is another level beyond that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Under Putin's thumb</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're still under Putin's thumb. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the uneasy feeling that somehow the public discussion is missing the big picture. There's something that should be factored into every story but is being ignored. We're under Putin's thumb. Ukraine might be a mistake, or a distraction. But it's still true that the odds favor the Repubs, Putin's party, taking over everything by 2024. I can't imagine Putin thinking that the prize is Ukraine. The prize is the US Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin's army in the US is Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only mystery is what the deal is, who's paying whom. Murdoch and Putin, they're in charge. We're also under Murdoch's thumb.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until we fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>King Will Smith</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched King Richard over the weekend, so it's fresh in my mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a scene where Smith and his daughters are on a tennis court in Compton, all of his daughters, not just Venus and Serena. There are a bunch of asshole teenage boys nearby who are hassling one of his daughters who's trying to study. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After they're done practicing, Smith confronts the boys. They beat him up. He does nothing to respond, he just takes it (like Chris Rock last night).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later in the movie he's bullied by an agent and his response is to fart out loud at him (which I like, it's aggressive but nonviolent). The agent definitely had it coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later, the character tells Venus a story about him getting beat up as a kid, and his father was nearby and did nothing to help him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The speech Smith gave in accepting his award could have been the speech the character in the movie would have made. About protecting people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's odd how closely the events last night track the ones in the movie, but opposite. What the character did is hard. The character did it right. The actor was confused, life is not a movie, and he got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Spoiler alert. I was pretty sure I had the answer to today's Wordle puzzle, so I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdSa5kJb-yw&quot;&gt;screen recording&lt;/a&gt; of the reveal, to capture the animation, so I could experience it over and over. Now you can too. But of course if you haven't solved today's puzzle -- this is a spoiler.</description>

			<title>The Putinites in America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So much disappointment in what Biden said about Putin. As I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1508069853193773057&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, I don't care. Putin has to go, whether or not Biden said it out loud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/29/uncleSamRoulette.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;But there's a much more dangerous despot-in-waiting here in the good old US of A.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He tried to overthrow the government and came incredibly close to doing it. I remember while it was going on, wondering if the entire US Congress was being executed while we were watching the riot. If the attackers had been somewhat better organized, that's exactly what would have been going on. And how would our country ever recover from that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The coup didn't work, but that was only luck. The organizers are still free, and they're getting ready for Coup II and this one is going to work. They're using our own laws to pre-rig the outcome of the next national election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So to President Biden, who was refreshingly honest and open about Putin (and I don't think it was a gaffe, btw) what are we going to do about the Putinites in America?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The only punishment for Trump was he lost his TWTR.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: No one scanned them for weapons as they entered the Capitol. That the Capitol was completely undefended can't have been an accident. I wasn't born yesterday and neither were you. If that had happened in another country would have believed there wasn't help on the inside?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I remember Watergate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember Watergate and the Gerald Ford pardon of Richard Nixon. Because right now that's the prior art. That's the event we're paying for now, and it seems as if we're about to repeat the mistake Ford made. While all the attention is focused on Putin and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember Watergate. And I remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon&quot;&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt;, and remember that some people were very angry about it but I wasn't -- I was relieved. Finally we could stop obsessing over Nixon. He was obviously guilty right from the outset. Yet it took what seemed an incredibly long time to get from the initial reports of the break-in to his waving goodbye from the White House lawn as he left for the last time. That was the way I wanted to remember Nixon. Humiliated, brought down, going &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0&quot;&gt;off to exile&lt;/a&gt; to spend the rest of his days wondering what if he hadn't cheated. Because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3iF4Rpe&quot;&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of Watergate is the same issue as the heart of Trump, only what Trump did was a million times worse. We excused Nixon. I guess Trump, who is also old enough to remember it (he's ten years older than me) wasn't too concerned about paying a price if his attempted coup didn't work. Now they're getting ready to do it again, they're doing it in the open, and it looks like a perfect plan. If it works, we've already had the last real national election in the US. From now-on they will all be Putinesqe parodies of fair elections. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0&quot;&gt;Nixon's farewell&lt;/a&gt;, 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine how the rest of the world sees the January 6 attack on the US Capitol?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: It scares the shit out of them. Because the main product the US sells is safety. Our financial system is where the world stores their money for safe keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What scares them even more? We haven't done anything about it. Trump and all the people who organized the coup are free. No prospect of any punishment. The can do it again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're smart you're looking for the next safe place to put your savings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to know this -- why isn't journalism running constant articles, reports and panels on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When will Trump be charged?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We failed to learn the lesson from Nixon it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of the networks should give time to Dan Rather to look at the story from that angle. Every night at an assigned time. Rather reported Watergate. No doubt he remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: One thing that seems evident after the Putin attack on Ukraine. The only people outside the US who want the Repubs to win are other despots whose people would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu#Death&quot;&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; them if they could. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be cool if we had a channel that could speak directly to the Russian people to tell them that many of us in the US are of Russian descent, we celebrate the culture, but we can't have you guys invading sovereign countries, and that's our main problem with Russia.</description>

			<description>When we got to the bottom of why people hated us for hosting their blogs for free it was this. They thought that if they did a blog, people would listen to them. They thought we were promising that. We weren't, we had no illusions about that.</description>

			<description>The idea that software is a process was the big idea in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html&quot;&gt;We Make Shitty Software&lt;/a&gt; in September 1995.   Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/25/shittyQuote.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the relevant portion. I got a lot of shit from devs who said they don't make shitty software, but in fact, they do. All devs do. Those that don't know they do don't know to set up a process that accounts for the shittiness of their software. A corollary -- some of the shittiest software is made by devs who think their software &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; shitty.</description>

			<description>The point of yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/23/135414.html?title=aPhilosophicalQuestion&quot;&gt;philosophical question&lt;/a&gt; was this. The Constitution says the government may not search you unless there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20probable%20cause,or%20was%20committing%20a%20crime.&quot;&gt;probable cause&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn't mean that people you invite to enter your house should be allowed to go through your private stuff. It may not be illegal, but we still recognize it as wrong. In the same way, you have &quot;free speech&quot; in America, even when it isn't the government restricting your speech, when it's your employer, school, family or friends. No law prohibits them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1357/&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;, but being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans of all persuasions, wrong, un-American.</description>

			<title>Are African-Americans fungible?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First let me say up front that, of course, African-Americans are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fungible. It's a stupid question, but I didn't raise it -- the Supreme Court process did, over many decades of the comings and goings of black justices and also women.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So -- are racism and genderism part of the Supreme Court process? Yes they are and I can prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall&quot;&gt;Thurgood Marshall&lt;/a&gt; retired, the Repubs replaced him with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=who+replaced+thurgood+marshall&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the &quot;African-American&quot; seat's significance was supposedly preserved. Marshall was the Supreme Court's first African-American justice. Thomas is the second.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;African-Americans are fungible, they seemed to say. Of course Marshall and Thomas, even though both were black, were almost exact opposites in philosophy and rage-suppression. The former was very liberal, a highly respected scholar, and the latter is fascist and resentful, and the depths of his depravity are only now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086535100/wife-of-justice-thomas-rebuts-claims-of-conflict-of-interest&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; died, she was replaced with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett&quot;&gt;ACB&lt;/a&gt;. Yes both are women, and thus women are considered fungible as well, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, at least by some people, in some sense. Politically, ACB is the opposite of RBG, probably is committed to reversing all of RBG's accomplishments. Yet the number of women on the court remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is in the hospital while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson&quot;&gt;Ketanji Brown Jackson&lt;/a&gt; hearings are going on, which gets you to consider that the number of AA's on the court would be preserved if KBJ was ratified and the unspeakable happens to CT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I actually love the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=fungible&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;fungible&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, always have, so I was somewhat delighted that the latest tech scam are NFTs where the F stands for fungible. This means I get to think of this word more often and that generally makes me happy for some odd reason. I hope the scamminess of NFTs doesn't end up spoiling that, or maybe I'm wrong and NFTs are the basis for a new capitalism? I have been wrong before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
