			<description>Please don't come out with something called Podcasting 2.0 or The Podcasting Authority or Podcasting As Designed By God. Come up with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/07/tech-codenames-in-past.html&quot;&gt;neutral code name&lt;/a&gt;, and explain why what you're doing will benefit podcasting.

			<description>Heard someone say you can't leave your PhD to your children, but you can leave them your farm. I take exception. Both my parents had a PhDs, and this gave me examples for the value of knowledge and intellect, and how to figure things out. I didn't inherit their degrees, but I did get their intellectual power.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/05/immanuel-quickley-carries-knicks-over-celtics-in-double-ot/&quot;&gt;Last night's Knicks game&lt;/a&gt; was wonderful. As the Nets gave up on their buy-a-championship nightmare, the slow-growth Knicks approach has been going great. I'm sure the Knicks would've signed KD or Kyrie if they had offered, but so thankful they diss'd the Knicks instead. Idiots. Now the normal order has been restored. Hopefully the Knicks continue to add pieces slowly and let home-grown stars like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;IQ&lt;/a&gt; continue to grow. It's intoxicating to watch him get the chance to excel as in last night's game, and completely exceed all reasonable expectations. The whole team is fantastic. Our loyalty to the team has paid off.</description>

			<description>I have a new way of syncing up my outline with the public web, and it's quite a bit slower than the previous method. Which means sometimes I rebuild my home page before all the changes are uploaded, leading to some hilarious mistaken posts. Have to tighten this up.</description>

			<description>It's time to see what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; is up to these days. I've had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; there for many years. Of course it has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.tumblr.com/rss&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. Previous posts are in March 2014 and then May 2011. The feed looks pretty straightforward. Looks like every post must have a title? I don't remember it being so noisy?</description>

They wanted me to put this text in a blog post so they could quote it. There was no request, no &quot;please,&quot; just here's the job. I didn't do it, and got a flamey email from the guy which surprisingly included a threat to never quote me again. What shocked me then and still shocks me today was how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma&quot;&gt;pro forma&lt;/a&gt; it seemed. The kind of thing they do for each other all the time in the news business? As far as I recall, I never wrote about it, and certainly never mentioned the name of the reporter. All that's interesting about it to me is that it appeared to be standard practice.</description>

			<description>BTW, I wish ChatGPT would statically render their results pages, so I don't have to do screen shots just to quote them. Make it easier for us to promote our discoveries. It's so ridiculous that in 2023 we're still using screen shots as the way to hook networks together.</description>

			<title>Dirty Shirt</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been to Jamaica a couple of times and I swear I've heard people use the term &quot;dirty shirt&quot; as a verb. My uncle Ken who lived in Negril for years, used the term too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What it means. When someone &lt;i&gt;dirty shirts&lt;/i&gt; you, it's as if they did something that left a stain on your shirt, something obvious and not nice that everyone can see.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Example: When my cousin sell me bad ganja he &lt;i&gt;dirty shirt&lt;/i&gt; me man.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But when I searched for the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzWNBsqdLDa4woVMkIinhiwcSHSpNg:1677792242754&amp;q=%22dirty+shirt%22+%22jamaican%22+slang&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiegYuVl779AhVhMVkFHcFaDOoQ5t4CegQIMxAB&amp;biw=1551&amp;bih=1097&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;on Google&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/rastafariah.png&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, they offered weird and wrong ideas for what the term means. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I checked in with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Dave+Jacobs&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; about this, he has the same understanding of what the term means, but he couldn't find our definition anywhere on the web either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least now the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/02/googleScreen.png&quot;&gt;correct&lt;/a&gt; definition will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dirty+shirt%22+jamaican+slang&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; up &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.com/2023/03/02/211954.html?title=dirtyShirt&quot;&gt;here on my blog&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find I'm starting to write like ChatGPT.

			<description>Tonight's Knicks game was pure delight. Haven't enjoyed basketball this much since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+linsanity&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;. I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; have left, everything is back to normal. Dallas and Phoenix can have them. Good riddance.</description>

Haven't enjoyed basketball this much since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+linsanity&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;. I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; have left, everything is back to normal. Dallas and Phoenix can have them. Good riddance." created="Thu, 02 Mar 2023 03:34:49 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/03/01.html#a033449"/>

			<description>I continue to take a break after much michegas converting to email identity and HTTPS. I've got Electric Drummer more or less working, and I think I'm going to stop short of getting all of it working, given that I want to keep taking this break and am not up for more grinding away. Something changed over here, and I'm more inclined to let you all take care of yourselves for a while. Mastodon is fine, even though I can't write for it using the tools I like to use. So far only my blog qualifies, and my docs and this.how stuff. I'm enjoying the winter here in the Catskills and dreaming of other cool things to do. Software right now far from my mind. That could change at any time.</description>
