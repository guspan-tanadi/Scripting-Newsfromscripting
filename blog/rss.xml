			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/27/todd.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;A friend asked if I was going to get &quot;one of these headsets&quot;? My answer, for the record: &quot;Not even slightly interested, but I suppose that could change.&quot; One of the reasons I'm skeptical is that I have imperfect vision. I seriously doubt if a headset would work for me, given that my left eye is pretty bad, and my right eye is normal. Pretty sure they're for people with good balanced vision. I haven't heard that question asked or answered, for any of the headsets. Another concern is how heavy it is. As you get older you learn that stress on your body accumulates over time. For example, I can't use a full-size iPad. I used one for years, but it wore out my left arm so now it's too painful, but I can use an iPad Mini, without problems, so far. If you're putting some kind of new weight on a human head, what will that do to your neck over time? Your back? These kinds of problems tend to cascade. And I can't help but wonder if there isn't another way to achieve what they're doing without putting extra stress on our necks? And honestly I'd prefer to have a new Mac that ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; would really excite me. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; post, maybe the last, for a while. At some point I'm going to re-watch the whole series, and then might have more observations. Anyway -- people who think that Roman and Kendall have no hope, well I think the writers gave them some cause for hope -- because when they controlled the company for a short period, each showed they were competent, not at running the enterprise, but a small part of it. Kendall was able to sell a complicated and kind of ridiculous idea. And Roman, when he had a clear goal, was able to manage it, and pulled it off. Neither were the kind of person who could run a sprawling enterprise like Waystar, for that you probably had to be Logan. If the two guys team up and manage something much smaller and more focused, they could possibly pull it off, once they get over not being their father. They &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; revert to where they were at the beginning of the show, as some people say, when Kendall was a drug addict and Roman was a pure &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck_(pejorative)&quot;&gt;schmuck&lt;/a&gt; blowing up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sVB_BcbLlUs?t=35&quot;&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt; to try to impress the father. They both get a fresh start now that dad is dead. That is a big difference for men, when your father dies you get a chance to come into your own in a new way, I speak from experience.</description>

			<description>When I was little, maybe first or second grade, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/06/grandpaAndLittleDave.jpeg&quot;&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt; bought me a handheld &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_radio&quot;&gt;transistor radio&lt;/a&gt;. It was the 1960s. I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow#Radio_work&quot;&gt;WABC&lt;/a&gt;, the Beatles and all the great new rock and roll. My grandpa said Iâ€™d see so many amazing things in my life. To him the radio was a futuristic miracle, like AI today. Anyway I just asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ7uXX9K7Sk&quot;&gt;You Canâ€™t Hurry Love&lt;/a&gt; by the Supremes, one of the songs I listened to on the radio he gave me 60 years ago. I realized just now he was so right, I have indeed seen many amazing things in my life.</description>

			<title>Writing into AI chatbots?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I asked about writing into AI chatbots -- ie writing something designed to be queried via something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, or ideally, ChatGPT itself. A few bullet points follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I already have a writing tool that I use for everything. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I figure by now a service probably exists that can ingest &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; or (ideally) &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; -- and have it be processed and kept updated as things change. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a sizable documentation project coming up, and I'd like to, if possible, start off with the new medium. I think we can make docs that work much better. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course I asked ChatGPT itself but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/ed72c797-3aa8-44da-bacb-bcee5fd9902c&quot;&gt;no help&lt;/a&gt;. They said to use their API. I want to use something that uses their API. I can't spare the time to become a developer at this time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you know of such a service, or would like to make one -- send me an email or (better) post a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/262&quot;&gt;comment here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

So you can walk a network of followship, and get ideas of who to subscribe to that way. Click a checkbox and you're connected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That makes it easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering&quot;&gt;peer&lt;/a&gt; with social networks, if they support OPML subscription lists and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds of posts. And -- as of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a135024&quot;&gt;May 24&lt;/a&gt;, we now have that implemented for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, through their API.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everything's ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've spent the last few days teaching FeedLand how to do with Bluesky what it does with old school RSS feeds. Today I got it working. Real sense of accomplishment. Not deployed yet, but I'm pretty sure it will be soon. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smallpieces.com/&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; fit together amazingly well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a regular FeedLand user who also uses Bluesky, please respond to &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3jxbljxkizc2f&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. I'd like to loop you in on the new stuff when it's ready for testing. You don't actually need a Bluesky account to get the benefit, that's the cute/cool thing about it. We're bringing Bluesky to the open web. ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>More Succession. People wonder how can they like a show where everyone is ugly. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that the main character of the show isn't human -- it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0WzqanwlG0&quot;&gt;The Song&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it's just a 4-season-long music video.</description>

			<description>Did you know that you can get Alexa to play the Succession theme song. On the Studio player it's magnificent. Now you can have it be the theme song for your great accomplishments. Get an elegant bit of code running? Fire it up! You're the boss. You did it.</description>

			<title>I was a skeptic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was a skeptic when Apple came out with the iPhone, iPad and the watch and ended up eating my words. I use all three products daily. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When the iPhone came out I was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/15/iStillLoveMyBlackberry.html&quot;&gt;Blackberry&lt;/a&gt; user and loved it. I was angry with Apple for not running Mac software on the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had reasons for not liking the iPad and watch, but eventually used the iPad even more than the iPhone and I wear the watch every day. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;None of them for me were revolutionary products, but they were good products. Worthwhile products. Impossible to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: On the other hand, here's my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/07/25/iphoneMonth1.html&quot;&gt;one-month review&lt;/a&gt; of the first iPhone. It was not at time, for me, a winner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Mastodon, Bluesky and Twitter should not be silos relative to each other. I'm starting to post links to Masto on Twitter, and links to Twitter on Bluesky. All combos. I realized I was, in my mind, assuming these &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; silos. I think other people do too. That's not a good limit to impose, doesn't work in our interests, as users and developers.</description>

			<description>I wonder if any librarians have written about ChatGPT. I bet they &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt; worried about losing their jobs. That's the thing. When Napster was booting up, most of us were thrilled with the ability to finally program our own music. Now we take it for granted. Google was, it turns out, just a glimpse into the future. What we really wanted was a virtual librarian who had access to all the information available to our civilization. Now we're getting there. When I was growing up, the librarians, who became my friends, only had access to a very small fraction of what was known. Basically the books that can fit into a modest-size &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/auburndale&quot;&gt;storefront&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7735726,-73.796516,3a,75y,39.57h,88.29t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sfiPCQ2wAdxLKEBfrKPHoiQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DfiPCQ2wAdxLKEBfrKPHoiQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D39.14713%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;Flushing&lt;/a&gt;.
