			<description>I did not watch the debate. I was watching the previews on CNN and MSNBC, and I could see where it was going. I went to sleep instead, as I did on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html&quot;&gt;Election Night in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't really understand what happened until I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/podcasts/the-daily/presidential-debate-election-trump-biden.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, just now, which included excerpts. Trump is dominant. He really practiced dominance. He's got a knack for it. About halfway through the show I realized this is what happens when you debate a troll. You never get to finish a thought, he always has another nit to pick, an annoying way to say something. He disrespects your dead son. He makes it about him, 100 percent. There's no room for anyone else. He was awful on his town hall a couple of weeks ago. A bluff? Anyway, I never thought Biden should debate him, or it should have been with rules that made it impossible for Trump to talk over him. Trump owned the stage last night. Glad I didn't watch, from what I can tell it was a nightmare. Also it was an incitement. The reporters say he &quot;targeted his base.&quot; Not really. He told his nascent militia to make a mess of the election, and he's setting up &quot;the left&quot; to get the blame. We gave him access to 100 million people so he could fuck us up the ass.</description>

			<description>I usually don't write about work as I'm doing it, but wtf, let's give it a try. Today I'm going to pick up the thread I last worked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1594307363000&quot;&gt;July 9&lt;/a&gt;. LO2 becomes its own reader app. It was always weird that you had to go outside LO2 to read a published outline. It make the connection uneasy. Not obvious how you'd create an outline of your own. By having the published outline (aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/06/170728.html&quot;&gt;instant outline&lt;/a&gt;) be viewed read-only in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, you're right there, in a tab, in the tool that creates these outlines.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld&quot;&gt;Hello World web app&lt;/a&gt; for ES6 modules. It uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/module.js&quot;&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; that defines one function, secsSince. It then calls that from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/code.js&quot;&gt;another module&lt;/a&gt;, and displays the result on the page. It's as simple as I could make it and it works. Not sure I want to use ES6 modules, but at least now I know how to do it, and you do too. All the other tutorials were missing some information you need to understand how modules work. The most confusing thing about modules is that you can only invoke modules from other modules. That means all the JavaScript code in your web app has to be in a module. Not sensible imho, but also not much of a burden. BTW you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/moduleshello/&quot;&gt;run the code&lt;/a&gt; without downloading.</description>

			<description>Joe Biden will show up tonight for a normal presidential debate. Trump is coming to an incitement. He'll point to Biden and say he'll take away your guns. He supports same-sex marriage and abortion. He will give all your money to black people. Biden is the new Hillary. A puppet for the deep state. Your life is over if you allow them to steal this election. The &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; is everyone but White Christian MAGAs. Get ready to revolt. I'll stand by you if you stand by me, says Trump.</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/podcasts/the-daily/donald-trump-taxes-investigation.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the Trump tax returns had a fair amount of info, but overall was disappointing. Barbaro never came to grips with a key idea: Trump is not a rich guy evading taxes. He's broke. He's a loser. That's his usual state, even though he's had two huge windfalls of cash, first from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump&quot;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and then from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;. Each time he's invested in marginal businesses and his management turned them into failures. Then he borrowed, failed to pay back his debt, went bankrupt. He's about to go bankrupt again with the $400 million that comes due in the term he's running for now. But we don't know who he owes the money to, but we can take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_mafia&quot;&gt;good guess&lt;/a&gt;. The big takeaway from the tax returns is &lt;i&gt;Trump is a loser. &lt;/i&gt;It's a shame they don't have a whole podcast series about what's in the returns. We've spent so much time speculating about the truth of Trump, now we have a huge load of data. Podcasts are the best medium for revealing it. Sadly only the NYT has this story, so it's not getting a deep dive.</description>

			<title>The ideal blogging tool</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The ideal blogging tool design would come from merging the publishing of WordPress with the interactivity of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean the culture of either product. WordPress imho is too exclusive in its deployment. It should be easier. And without any FB-like algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You should be able to deploy it on your own. It should install as easily as an app on your iPhone. And you should have full control of hosting. Move whenever you want with no breakage. It should be as easy to port as it was to install.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A cartoon from 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gen.medium.com/i-lived-through-collapse-america-is-already-there-ba1e4b54c5fc&quot;&gt;best thing I've read&lt;/a&gt; today. It says when collapse happens you might not notice. We are post-collapse in the US, the author says. You know what, I believe it. &quot;I used to judge those herds of gazelle when the lion eats one of them alive and everyone keeps going â€” but no, humans are just the same. Thatâ€™s the real meaning of herd immunity. Weâ€™re fundamentally immune to giving a shit.&quot;</description>

			<description>Remember Romney's &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/M2gvY2wqI7M&quot;&gt;47 percent speech&lt;/a&gt; to Republican donors. The nice Republican. They really think this way. Do they think you should live? Probably not. A waste of resources. You just want handouts. Repub dogma: 47 percent of the people are disposable.</description>

			<description>The House could still impeach Trump to halt the ratification of the new Supreme Court justice. And the Democrats, assuming they take power in January, can increase the size of the court to whatever they want. Of course the Repubs will scream bloody murder and the press will repeat that, with volume, because it's an exciting story. And we know the Dems can't stand that. Look what they did to Al Franken. Concerned they would be called hypocrites by the Repubs, itself an act of total hypocrisy, they destroyed his career which was going pretty well, you'd have to say. One of the most eloquent Democrats in a party that has trouble finishing sentences, much less whole thoughts.</description>

			<description>There's some good news about Covid-19 that you don't see in the news -- eventually it will become less deadly. Most viruses in that family do, the virus mutates, and a strain that kills fewer victims comes to dominate, and that process repeats. The virus spreads out to find new victims and over time it weakens. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; ended after two years, with no vaccine, but the virus didn't go away, it became seasonal. It still pops up, to this day, but it's nowhere near the problem it was in 1918. That will probably happen with Covid-19 too.</description>

I made it, I own it, I can make it do what I want. It's the feeling in a young man's heart.</description>

			<description>BTW, here's something obvious but unthinkable. Trump is having all these rallies, larger and larger, knowing the deaths they cause won't be obvious until after the election. Now in a way it's much better not to live in a swing state.</description>

			<title>Shake yourself up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people are trying to get past Covid and Trump without making radical changes to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend asked what could he do to combat fascism. This is it. Do something to radically shake up your life, by choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each of us are trying to reboot as if taking a box, without changing its shape, and moving it across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; going to change. If we emerge from these days, the world will be very different. We have to be different too. We have to be prepared for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At some point you have to ask was the shape really the right shape, and what would I give up by changing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Radical change. Quit your job. Give your car away. Jump out of a plane. Get a sex change. Destroy your business model. Say something unthinkable. Whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Sterling that I keep coming back to. When something radical changes in your life, that's a good time to make other big changes. Death of a parent or spouse. Stock market crash. Major illness. Divorce. A time when you start over. When you have to start over. No choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have been through that. We've had a major change not just on an individual basis, but on a &lt;i&gt;global&lt;/i&gt; scale. Global. Everyone changed. So we can do it. We can change our lives radically. Trump demands it. Covid demands it. The climate crisis demands it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your sense of what's normal is worth $0.24. You might find that much money on a sidewalk. I know this because I buried both my parents, and I know how much they thought their opinion mattered, and I know the truth. In the end, what they thought was worth about $0.24, approx.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So fuck it. Destroy your business model. Start over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once you've made such a change, you'll find you want to make others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Reporters forget past atrocities, so they can re-discover them, so it's (as far as they're concerned) news -- again. This makes their job approachable. Anything beyond this would require them to adapt, risk, improvise, grow. In software, ideas from users can be confusing, but also incredibly valuable. Users have nothing invested in the way you do things. They just know what they want. Knowing what users want is valuable, but news doesn't incorporate that, because they never listen to users, they only listen to each other, and often not even that.</description>

			<description>It's true that in 2016 Trump said he wouldn't honor the vote if he lost, but there is a big difference between then and now. Now he's the president, and he lives in the White House and is commander in chief of the armed forces. There's a lot of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Time Trump can really fuck things up for us, beyond how fucked up they already are. Everyone thinks Trump is going to lose but refuse to leave. I think he has another plan. When I was playing a board game with my little brother when we were kids, if he didn't like how it was going, well you know what little brothers do. That's Trump. A snotty ass little brother if there ever was one. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>BingeWorthy profile pages</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal with profile pages.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You have &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has signed on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; has one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They list all the shows you've rated, from best to worst. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Profile pages are designed to share. When someone asks for a list of good things to binge, instead of thinking of a few off the top of the head, share a link to your profile page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can edit your name, the image URL, description so if you're not happy with the initial versions (which we got from your Twitter profile), you can change them in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/25/settingsDialogLocation.png&quot;&gt;Settings dialog&lt;/a&gt; in BingeWorthy. All this is echoed in your Facebook and Twitter metadata, so it'll show up when you paste a link into those services, and many others that read this form of metadata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If your screenname is bullmancuso, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is your profile page. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, please post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/188&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot of the top part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Trump plus the virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading this piece, carefully, word for word and beling relieved that there was a way to fight the virus. It's a summary of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; McNeil did on March 12. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html&quot;&gt;March 22&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Terrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's one of those things that I'll remember forever. Before listening, I had no idea how we fight this. After listening, I understood how it works. And that it had worked, in China and South Korea and other places. It would have amazed me then that here it is 6 months later and only a few states have done it remotely this way. Our efforts in the Northeast are primitive in comparison, but they worked. A lot of people were made very sick, and a lot of people died, but we got the virus under control. But it's raging out of control elsewhere in the country. You know when the Dems say the election is about health, they're talking about the ACA, but that's wrong. There's a pandemic raging through our country and it's growing again. We have to connect with this. And we won't have any hope, any hope at all, if Trump remains president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini&quot;&gt;September 7&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If you accept the premise that [Trump is] hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and I do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's time to be scared. In the moment when you still have power. Later it will be too late. Trump plus the virus -- that's what we're up against. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
