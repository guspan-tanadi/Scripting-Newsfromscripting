He loved to talk, but didn't listen. He wore hearing aids. My mother, his daughter-in-law, was pretty sure he turned them off when we came to visit. Whenever we said anything he'd go &quot;What what did you say?&quot; So you'd say it again, at the top of your voice, and he still wouldn't hear. Repeat this a few times and remember your job is to listen. The things he said made no sense to me, a well-fed youngster in the America of the 1960s.  We listened. We tried. Every so often he'd use strange words like oligarch and plutocracy. He had the idea that my brother and father and I would join him in an uprising against the plutocracy. He'd say &quot;It's the plutocrracy, Daveed!&quot; in his thick Russian accent. These words were strange then, but it's funny how we use these words fairly regularly today. He had a vision of what was to come. One thing he said, loudly and clearly, I remember very well. &quot;David, some day the Nazis will come to America and this is what I want you to do.&quot; After a short pause he said the next part slowly. &quot;Get a gun. Go up on the roof -- and shoot them!&quot; My mother was horrified. He wasn't kidding. I wrote this off as the ramblings of an old and crazy man, out of touch with the world as it was then, in modern America where we flew coast to coast on 747s and listened to rock and roll, as he ranted in his row house in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canarsie,_Brooklyn&quot;&gt;Cararsie&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn about a long-gone world in the old country. Here's why I'm telling this story today. My grandfather and his family ran for their lives in World War II, from the Nazis. They were living in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Bucharest&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, Rumania at the time. Before that they came from Odessa, Ukraine. Now, here we are, decades later, and once again, the old man's vision was perfect. I don't see myself getting on a roof and shooting Nazis, when they come -- but when I listen to the Ukraine people, many of whom not surprisingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EnglishUkraine/status/1497986717470580744&quot;&gt;look like me&lt;/a&gt;, teachers, programmers, doctors, clerks, people from all walks of life, going up on the roofs of Kyiv and Odessa to shoot at Putin's soldiers who I guess are not all that different from Nazis.</description>

Obviously a little time off did her good, but so did a change of subject. Just as I, as a viewer, couldn't watch Maddow anymore after &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; of the same story -- 1. Trump investigated, 2. obviously guilty of great crimes. 2. Nothing comes of it. But this is a new story, and a continuation of the tragedy of Trump, and she was fantastic, putting it all in perspective, and offering one very valid theory of why Putin is moving now. There are others. I'm hearing them on Twitter and on Facebook, much more realistic than the garbage they say on CNN, where they repeat Putin's spin as fact all too often. I can't stand that shit. NPR does it too. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/10224858840872004&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a story my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danconover.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Conover&lt;/a&gt; just published on Facebook. He was an American soldier based near Czechoslavakia, I think it was probably in the 80s, not sure. Best thinking and writing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidfrum&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter is also fantastic, and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/energy-crisis-russia-gas/622884/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on The Atlantic (one of my monthly free articles, I am not a subscriber) was also fantastic. I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/02/the-old-habits-of-news-consumption-died-with-the-internet-whats-replacing-them/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/author/jbenton/&quot;&gt;Josh Benton&lt;/a&gt; on Nieman late last night that said we get our news outside the control of the news orgs, and I think that's exactly right and good for us. If only they'd truly get on board with that idea, we might solve some of our problems which are in case you hadn't noticed are getting worse. Today's news involves a bit more navigation through paywalls and silos, but the ideas that get out these days are far more varied and informed than those we got in past crises when all we had were the NYT and the three networks. I lived through that period too.</description>

			<description>Comment to CNN: Yes, right now Biden is leader of the free world, but a couple of years ago our president was on the other team, and not too far down the road, if things don't change radically, we'll be changing teams again. Don't forget that context. That's where Putin has fun. He can screw with our political system, but it appears we have no power in the other direction. We can't give him a problem at home.</description>

			<title>Drummer status report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a DM from Ken Smith, an everyday user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=drummer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;It's been so long since I had any hiccups in Drummer that I can't remember when it might have been. Not sure there's anywhere in particular to report that.&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have had the same experience though I'm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; mostly, and testing new stuff in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;web Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen an outline overwritten in a long time. That was the big problem with the new tabs system in Drummer, contexts would get swapped incorrectly, and one outline would replace another. It's a hard problem to get data on, bug reports invariably are vague. You can't see the problem happen, the user typically doesn't see the problem until long afer the mistake was made.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/11/drummer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;There's reason to believe the problem has been fixed. I was led to a problem in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/150&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, on Jan 8, with steps to reproduce an outline overwrite. When I traced the problem to its source and fixed it, it occurred to me that this mis-coding could be the source of the remaining overwrites we were seeing. I didn't say that in the thread, but I did say it in a private conversation with Scott Hanson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still don't know if the problem is gone, but it was worth commenting that the product has been really stable for well over a month, zero problems seen, or reported. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/22&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;, a geography game somewhat inspired by Wordle. Here's the (spoiler!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/23/wordleSoution.png&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; to today's puzzle. I got close on the first guess then putzed around but did finally get the answer. I loved maps as a kid, so I have the shape of countries pretty well memorized.</description>

I was looking for a snapshot of the &quot;What is a weblog&quot; page. A lot of work went into defining what it meant, because there was some confusion about this in the 2003 blogosphere. And then it turns out the page in question is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;still there&lt;/a&gt; on the Harvard site. Good thing it was preserved.

			<title>Heckuva job Putin?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We invaded Iraq with as little provocation as Putin has for invading Ukraine. Which led to this charming moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dubya's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished_speech&quot;&gt;Mission Accomplished&lt;/a&gt; moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Public editors, again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT should have public editors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They should only be copy edited. What they write is up to them.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Their work appears alongside the op-ed columnists, same prominence.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They must not be journalists, but must be good/great writers, and news users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why this has a chance of working?   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The journalists will be more likely to read it, because it gets the same distribution they do, it's harder to ignore.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The writers have no reason to tiptoe around journalists because they don't care about access, and aren't trying to protect a career in journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They come into the job with no fixed ideas on how journalism works. They view things only from the readers' perspective.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so they are vastly outnumbered by the people writing for the NYT who are trying to keep careers going and do care about access.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The author says it's about Russia and the US and that the US doesn't want the new pipeline to be used to pump natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. The one weird thing about this is why would Putin pick this time to invade Ukraine when it gives the US pretext to shut down the new pipeline before it could get started? Seems like he has a lot to lose right now. Why not cement the bond with Germany before having an adventure in Ukraine. In any case, he says the US public is being conned, much as our journalism says the Russian people are being conned by their media. I don't doubt for a moment that the news we're getting is at least misleading if not total fiction.</description>

			<description>I've started bingeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/raised-by-wolves/season-1&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I like it so far into 3 episodes, and I hear it gets better. I have no idea why it's called Raised By Wolves, there are no wolves in the show (so far). The human kids are raised by androids. Here's something good/.interesting. It was liked by one person on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fraised-by-wolves&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;, Jake Savin, who is also considered the best match with me on BW. Jake said it was the Best. Aha I know I'm in the right place. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It could be that Putin gets to pick the day WW III starts. If so why wouldn't he wait till Tuesday so it can be a famous day -- 2/22/22. Just wondering about that while working on some tricky code. Yes, this is the kind of thing programmers think about.</description>

			<title>The Twitter-to-RSS project</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The project is coming along. Implemented so far... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tweets can have titles. Make the first character in a tweet a #. The rest of the first line is the title. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Full Markdown support. Anything you can type in a tweet can be Markdown and will be rendered as it's converted to an RSS item. Markdown is ideal for where Twitter is at now. It a plain text environment, and that's what MD is designed for. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads are rolled up into the first message, forming one RSS item. In RSS there is no character limit. And Twitter has a good thread composition tool built in. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160316075154/http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&quot;&gt;Emoji short codes&lt;/a&gt;. This was an easy one so I thought why not. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure how I'll package it for release. I want to wait until the major coding is done before deciding that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This post as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1495442593630638086&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, and then as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/20/thePostInMyReader.png&quot;&gt;RSS feed item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't watch All-Star games ever since I realized that players never play defense, esp in the NBA. I also understand that sports are pretty meaningless even for &quot;real&quot; games. All-Star games are two levels of meaningless. That's as they say a bridge too far for me.</description>
