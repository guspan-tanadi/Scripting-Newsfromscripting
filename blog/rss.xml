			<description>Do Repubs really want to defund Social Security? Do pensioners know this? Do the Repubs deny this? If true, it’s pure theft. That money was taken from our paychecks so it would be paid back when we retired. It‘s our money.</description>

I looked for the home page for the podcast and didn't find it. That would be the place to put a nice little icon saying RSS is cool and this is where you go to use our feed. Maybe it's time to do a this.</description>

			<title>Something kind of sad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let me say up front -- not everything is roses folks. If I were always going to pretend everything were great, what would be the point of writing, it would all be lies. Anyway.. As I close in on the public release of FeedLand..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just realized something pretty sad. People have raised huge amounts of money to redo the development projects I already did, hired all kinds of product managers, marketing people, and most of them failed, I think because none of them understood what they were working on, or didn't have the skills necessary to move forward, so they just re-did stuff in a different way. If I called something &quot;item&quot; they called it &quot;object&quot; -- each of the elements got new names but did the same things. None of the investment went into  actual new development, moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like to develop, and I have limited patience for the other stuff. So when I finish one project I move on to the next one. So I did a great product last year, spent the whole year doing it, but it's just sitting there, because I've spent the next whole year working on the next one. The two products need each other, they hook into each other. It'll be fantastic. But too few people will use it, if the past is a predictor. To the extent other people use it, I won't hear about it, so none of their experience is filtered back into the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to say that this way of doing development, as much as it fits me, has mostly been wasted. This could still be made to work, but people would have to want to help instead of replace. After people got the idea you can get rich doing internet projects, the spirit of volunteerism has faded. Because the reality is you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; make a fortune here, it's a one in a million shot, but everyone is still trying. Meanwhile everything goes to shit, everywhere you look!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All I've wanted for the last 30 years or so is to lead a team. I know how to do that, having been the CEO of a tech company before. Only I wouldn't cast myself in that role, because when I wake up in the morning I want to keep pushing forward on my development projects. I thought when the VCs were interested in RSS we were talking about me doing the development. Nope, they hired their own programmers, thinking that what I was doing was menial, fungible, or was finished somehow or their guys would know what to do next. My friend Adam Curry started a company, raised huge money, and like the others, thought that he could save some money by replacing me with other programmers. I'm sure the programmers told them they could do it. Something must not have worked. (Sorry that was sarcasm.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Don't cry for me. I haven't given up yet. But one should also accept reality. Even people I thought of as friends wanted to do my work without me. I want to slap them, don't you know anything about software? Fucking idiots. I could tell you some amazing stories about foolishness and greed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After I finish FeedLand the next thing I want to do is straighten out JavaScript. It's ridiculous how much extra work they make you do because they couldn't manage synchronization in the kernel. We have a good start on that in Drummer, I want to finish the job. I want to stop having to stand on my head to get code to synch up. My pseudo code should be my regular code, if you know what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>IndieWeb should love RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am often the only person out there reminding people that it's important to know why podcasting, for example, is so open. No platform vendor controls it. Most people who do podcasting don't know why they can do it without Apple's approval, or Google's or Spotify. Yet RSS gets no credit for it. And that hurts other efforts to create open architecture for the web. People don't see the benefit, but it is there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen where ever you get your podcasts,&quot; that's the key. That's the sign that we won.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;RSS is a huge success for lower-case &quot;indie web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the lack of support for RSS is one of the reasons I'm disinclined to embrace the standards they promote. Maybe if I understood why this is the case I'd feel better about seeing myself as part of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with OPML. With the Tools For Thought market getting so much investment now, many millions of dollars, how that market evolves, whether it's a bunch of silos, or an open ecosystem, is up for grabs. I love outliners, been making them all my life, but again, when it comes to promoting open formats and interop, I'm pretty much out there on my own. I've more or less given up on this one, at least for now. But it's a huge deal for the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Did you know developers get brain fog? We do. I used to call it stagnation. It usually comes after a period of intense productivity. I run real hard and fast in a direction, drive it to its conclusion -- sometimes it results in a feature, other times a dead end, with lessons learned and ideas for other branches to take, later. Either way it leaves the well dry, and you have to patiently rebuild (or re-kindle, re-prime) your flow, which often takes days.</description>

			<title>Let's try something different</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I generally  don't write about features in a product that's still in testing, I wait until it's &quot;done&quot; whatever that means. But I've found that has less than optimal results. I ship everything at once, and then hope people see the good stuff before they move on. There's no time to focus attention on the individual pieces, and that's where the real work is in making software nice to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's so many new ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; for example that almost no one knows about. It's one of my biggest regrets about how software development works. When I read about musicians in the 60s and how they all knew each other and went to each others' shows. I wish some of the people I respect were up to date on my stuff, and it were easy for me to stay up on their stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So let's give it a try. This is a report on a new feature that I added to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; today. It's still in development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I saw a user request, they wanted a way to tell the system to check a feed for updates without having to copy the URL of the feed to the clipboard and enter it into a dialog. We already had a command that works that way, but why make them work so hard? Indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I added a button to the &lt;i&gt;Feed Info&lt;/i&gt; page, next to the place where it says how many items we've found in the feed and how many times it has been checked. The button says (Check now). Click the button, and when it's done it refreshes the page according to the result of the check. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/14/feedInfoPageScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Screen shot of new (Check now) button on Feed Info page in FeedLand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The astute observer will note that this page works much like the main viewing page in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;. No accident there. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Watching the video from Jan 6. No one has so far commended Congress for keeping their cool while their lives were totally in danger. I remember while the insurrection was going on, wondering if right then our government was being executed.</description>

			<title>Substack vs Micro.blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/13/tinaTurnerBarbie.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I once asked a journalist who uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://substack.com&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; how he felt about their editor. His response surprised me. He said he loved Substack and basically wouldn't say anything critical about it. I said I was asking as a software developer. I was wondering if there was any reason to try to put together a nice editor for Substack users, I wasn't asking a &quot;gotcha&quot; question the way a journalist might. I had no intention of quoting the person. My writing isn't like that. I don't quote people very often, and usually if I do, it's without saying who they are, as in this bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was kind of a hypothetical question anyway, because I &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; write an editor for Substack users, they don't permit it. Writers have to use their editor. It's the only reason I don't use Substack myself. I have my own editor that suits my writing style, and don't plan on switching, ever. And I recognize that it's also a lock-in tactic. They make it hard to publish through Substack something you published elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, written by Manton Reece, who I've written about here &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/08.html#a155342&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; makes it incredibly easy to publish stuff published elsewhere as part of your blog. I recently decided to learn how it works, again, after playing with it a bit when it first came out. It's an interesting product that I sense started out very simple, but over time got so many features that now it's hard to approach as a newbie. But after a number of sessions being somewhat confused, I think I now understand what the product is at its core. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First it's a simple blogging tool. Posts can have titles. You edit in a plain text editor. The system supports Markdown styling and links. It supports outbound &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, and where it gets interesting is that it supports &lt;i&gt;inbound&lt;/i&gt; RSS too. So I can give it the URL of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fradio3.io%2Fusers%2Fdavewiner%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog feed&lt;/a&gt; and everything I post there appears as if I wrote it on micro.blog. In fact I did that a long time ago the first time I tried it out, and it must appear to some people as if I've been a regular user all along. People reply to my linkblog posts. I feel bad about that. It seems selfish of me to do that, to push ideas into a system, but to not be there to respond on behalf of those ideas. But I haven't taken the link out, at least not yet. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about it, and the reason I put the two products together in one piece is that micro.blog has the one feature that imho would put Substack over the top, and give it a shot at world domination. On the other hand, wouldn't it be nice if micro.blog added a newsletter feature to put a little pressure on Substack to open themselves up a bit more? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I haven't described all the features of micro.blog. For example, in addition to each user having a blog, each user also has a timeline, like Twitter. You subscribe to other users. Not sure if you can subscribe to external RSS feeds (which would make it a feed reader too). Where the boundaries are is where the confusion is, at least for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I think my presence there makes people uncomfortable, perhaps. While the product is a paragon of openness, the community seems kind of closed, basically part of what I think of as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=gruberville&quot;&gt;GruberVille&lt;/a&gt;. All things that emanate from &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;John Gruber's blog&lt;/a&gt;. I am not part of that world, but I have an account. I am harmless, I have no desire to interfere with micro.blog -- I think it's wonderful that someone is doing what Manton is doing. As I've tried to say a number of times, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt;. I am 67 years old and am aware that every time I start a new product it could be my last. I am not trying to conquer anything, however I am trying to shake at least one part of the web out of the deep sleep it has been in ever since Google Reader took over and then was axed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Multiple-party real estate deals must be a thing. I have a house and want a new house. I want to do the switch in one transaction, rather than risk owning two houses. This is analogous to the arrangement they have in sports. Team A only wants to trade player X if they can also trade out player Y. Similarly, homeowner Judy only wants to buy this house if she can sell her house in the same deal.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to go to Apple's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference&quot;&gt;WWDC&lt;/a&gt; in the 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always thought at least half the time should have devs on stage and Apple people in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had a lot of wrong ideas about developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course they didn't like hearing this! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One time I was invited to speak at the WWDC. My little company was leading an important new technology. Unfortunately, some people in Apple were uneasy about a dev working in this area (system scripting) so they put another dev up before me and he used up most of my time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We did give out free UserLand &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pinknoiz/status/1579579404413734914&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/10/frontierTShirt.png&quot;&gt;t-shirts&lt;/a&gt; to everyone who was there. So at least people had heard of us. And the Apple people who were scared of our product got their way. Also unfortunately. Everyone lost, but mostly me. Sad sad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Think big</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton&lt;/a&gt; asked why I thought his book was sad. I did a lot of writing in response, but in the end I deleted it all and replaced it with a single sentence, really just a phrase. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;it's just sad that people always think so small.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example. Subscribing is a mess in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; world, but at the start there was a plan for it not to be a mess. It required cooperation among the various writing and reading tools. The small thinking approach was that since you're going to dominate, writing tools should just put an icon on their pages that subscribes in your reader. But when no one dominates, the blogs get overwhelmed with these icons, then four years later someone invents Twitter which makes subscription a breeze. A few years later you wonder where all the blogs went. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people blame the big silos for the lack of movement in blogging they should step back and figure out why they left the door open for them to dominate? We had years to create a barrier of user expectation of choice, as was done in podcasting...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To whit, every time someone says &quot;Listen to &lt;i&gt;FreshAir&lt;/i&gt; where you get your podcasts,&quot; I feel a huge sense of pride. It worked there. Victory! Subscribing is still a mess, it doesn't have to be, but the open approach of podcasting got so entrenched that the users demand choice, expect it -- and that barrier was too high for Spotify and Amazon to climb over. We got a little help there from Apple btw -- of all the big vendors they probably could have owned podcasting, but they never made that move and that's something to be grateful for when you see all the great podcasts out there and more coming online all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another bad example, in the news industry, where I and others, consumers of news, are constantly railing about the ridiculous economic model. If I want to read an article in the Atlantic I have to subscribe. And the Detroit News, Denver Post and the Boston Globe. And the New Yorker and New York and on and on. At some point you have to stop subscribing, and then you'll miss the article that you need/want to read. Everyone but three pubs, the NYT, WSJ and WP would benefit from a pay-as-you-go plan, but they won't do it. Isn't it funny how close it is in pattern to the problem in blogging that created Twitter? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all have choices. We can work together or we can go it alone. When we work together we have a chance. When you go it alone, the chance of success is miniscule. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Google Reader is to blame for another huge mess in RSS land. They said posts must have titles, even though RSS specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/10/optionalTitle.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;allows posts&lt;/a&gt; without titles. That basically cut off Twitter from the world defined by RSS because Google Reader became synonymous with RSS, they controlled it, and &lt;i&gt;tweets don't have titles. &lt;/i&gt;Did you ever see how Google Reader rendered a tweet back when Twitter had feeds? They were right to shut that down, but don't blame them, blame Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This kind of disrespect is very popular among techies. They want to say they invented something, which is a lie -- but if they never tell anyone about the things that came before, they kind of hope to get away with it. It's one of the worst things about tech, and why progress takes so long, why we're still &quot;solving&quot; problems that were solved when I was in school, and that was a long time ago. It's not just big companies that do this, sometimes one-person companies do it. Shaking my head. It would work so much better if we built on each others' work.</description>

It's a really sad story, but I don't think it has to be. There was a lot of collegiality in the early blogging community, and we shared our work. He mentions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; in passing, but it solved a big part of the puzzle that eventually became WordPress, Facebook and Twitter, and btw &lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. All the source information is in the archive of Scripting News, this blog. Manila was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;culmination&lt;/a&gt; of a couple of years of open experimentation I did into how you could simplify content management so ordinary people could do it. First we had to understand what the problem was (two models for the content, one the editing view and the other the published view, there needed to be one model), why content management was too complicated for writers, and then how to make it usable. And then there was a lot of code to write, UI to design and endless iteration. And it had an API. That was a big deal. It's probably why Twitter and WordPress have APIs, btw. All that (unless I missed something) is left out of Manton's story. I was hoping for the actual story about how this worked to be chronicled in his book. Not only because I want to be in the story myself, but also so that today's developers know how these kinds of things come to be. Most of the stories tell the wrong freaking story. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Manila was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;culmination&lt;/a&gt; of a couple of years of open experimentation I did into how you could simplify content management so ordinary people could do it. First we had to understand what the problem was (two models for the content, one the editing view and the other the published view, there needed to be one model), why content management was too complicated for writers, and then how to make it usable. And then there was a lot of code to write, UI to design and endless iteration. And it had an API. That was a big deal. It's probably why Twitter and WordPress have APIs, btw. All that (unless I missed something) is left out of Manton's story. I was hoping for the actual story about how this worked to be chronicled in his book. Not only because I want to be in the story myself, but also so that today's developers know how these kinds of things come to be. Most of the stories tell the wrong freaking story. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 08 Oct 2022 15:53:42 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/12/zen.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/10/08.html#a155342"/>

			<description>The Mets suck. As a lifelong Mets fan I know this. I love the Mets. It’s a family thing. Parents and grandparents loved the Brooklyn Dodgers so I love the Mets. But what bullshit that supposed Mets fans booed our starter as he left the field last night, and many left before the game was  over.  As usual  some &lt;s&gt;fucking&lt;/s&gt; Yankees fans got Mets hats and are pretending to be Mets  fans.</description>

			<description>What Facebook is doing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.meta.com/metaverse/impact/&quot;&gt;Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; is doomed to fail. When has a big established tech giant invented the next layer of the virtuality? If there’s any validity to Zuck's vision, the reality will be achieved by a startup, competing with other startups. Facebook which now foolishly  calls  itself  Meta!  (might  as  well  change  their  name  to  Bullshit!)  will,  if  they’re  lucky  get  to  buy  one  of  the  leading  startups,  will  eventually get  a  new  CEO who  will  write  off  the Meta!  foolishness,  and  Meta!  will  go  the  way  of  Topview,  Copland,  OpenDoc,  OS/2,  and  all  the  bullshit  Bill Gates  threw  at  the  open  web.</description>

			<title>Comparing FeedLand to River5</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1271711025&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the FeedLand thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the difference between FeedLand and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for asking. This is a good question, I should know how to answer it. So let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's much more than River5.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a browser-based UI for managing and sharing subscriptions. So the users are kind of members of a club. We can all see each others' subscription lists. We know what are the most popular feeds. When someone subscribes to a feed it appears in the subscription log, which is visible to everyone. There is no private information in FeedLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; easy to subscribe to a feed that's already in the database. Radically easy. Hard to imagine how it could be easier. That's very important.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can create a &quot;news product&quot; entirely in the web browser, no need to use an external tool to manage your feeds and categories. Again, as easy as it can be. I iterated over the design of this stuff obsessively.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It stores all the data in a relational database.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So far none of this stuff is in River5. Underneath all this, FeedLand does almost all of what River5 does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One thing River5 has over FeedLand is that it's shipping, you can use it now. FeedLand is still in development. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically where River5 is a simple feed reading system, this is groupware, collaborative, like Slack it's meant for workgroups. The end result is not entirely dissimilar to River5, but the chance to work with other people is new.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, who I know from early &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; days. One of our best developers, and a steady fellow, which was much appreciated. I know he's a sports fan too, living in Texas he follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs&quot;&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt;, which is of course a legendary team. I am, as you know, a Knicks fan. But I have to say, until the Mets are finished, and probably a few weeks after that, I'm focused only on baseball. I'm very modal with my sports. I'm either in or not. I can't love two teams at the same time. It's just who I am. Anyway, Manton has written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://book.micro.blog/&quot;&gt;book about microblogging&lt;/a&gt; and he runs a service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; which hosts blogs, running his software. I feel that his blog and my new reading software have brought us closer. And I look forward to reading his book.</description>

			<description>For all the ups and downs the Mets ended the season with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/06/standings.png&quot;&gt;exactly the same record&lt;/a&gt; as the Braves, 101 wins and 61 losses. The only reason the Mets are in the wild card and the Braves get to wait for the next round, is that they won one more game against the Mets this year than they lost. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7bgtu2O4E&quot;&gt;game of inches&lt;/a&gt; Al Pacino's character rants about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Life is made of inches.</description>

It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7bgtu2O4E&quot;&gt;game of inches&lt;/a&gt; Al Pacino's character rants about in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I added a new feature to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/04/142201.html?title=feedland&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; today. There's now a white-on-orange XML icon in the upper right corner of each news product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1686843/194099839-d458927b-8b0b-46d8-af83-f27c00f81764.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. The icon links to the OPML subscription list for the feeds on the page. This came from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/239#issuecomment-1268027417&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the thread, basically asking &quot;Where are the feeds.&quot; I love those kinds of questions, they help direct the development of a product. My perspective is so muddled, I've been living with this product for nine months already. I can't see what it looks like to someone seeing it for the first time.</description>

The safest thing for her to have done is to leave the non-reportable leaks out of the book, to avoid the appearance that she's withholding news so she can make more money with the book.</description>

			<description>Someone in a J-school should study paywalls. A PhD thesis? Quantify what's going on and how effective (or not) each approach is.</description>

			<description>Substack has a sadistic kind of paywall. You start reading a piece, get into it, enough to wonder where it‘s going and boom, it’s time to subscribe or get out of here. Leaves a humiliation that’s hard to describe. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-4151-why-goal-cascades-are-harmful&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that triggered the paywall, it's not doing it now -- I have no idea why. This is the second time I've seen this paywall. Anyway, I clicked on the link because I thought I might learn something, instead I have a pain in the gut. Trains you to never read anything on Substack again, and, like all other paywalls, it does not make me want to subscribe. If you have a comment, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1577618434220777473&quot;&gt;original tweet&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
