He has a simple and clear delivery style that reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=John+Dickerson&amp;i=audible&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&quot;&gt;John Dickerson&lt;/a&gt; who did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/podcasts/whistlestop&quot;&gt;Whistlestop podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which I listened to regularly before Trump and the romance of past presidents was gone for me. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Osnos bio&lt;/a&gt; is short, and good reading as the Biden presidency is about to begin.</description>

			<description>If you grew up with parents who acted crazy, having Trump as president seems somewhat familiar, even comforting. It could be worse, you think. It's a dysfunctional feeling, one you can spend years in therapy to uncover, because you bury it so well, as a child. You come to see things from the parent's point of view. You're a bad kid for thinking that your parents are wrong. Even when they were most definitely wrong.</description>

			<description>A fallout is that if Biden wants to gain our confidence, he has to first deal with the fact that a substantial number of people, even those who voted for him, are unfamiliar with the idea of a family that is based on love and a feeling that justice is normal or even possible. We may &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; we feel this way, but that's intellectual, at a subconscious level, it just doesn't seem normal, like something you can trust. It'll be as if we're saying to the president, &quot;Look that's very nice, but no one believes you're actually trying to help us. That's just hype. We weren't born yesterday.&quot; It seems as if Biden may actually be someone who isn't totally corrupt. If so, how's he going to get anyone to believe that. A frontal assault is not likely to work. This may be why I'm reluctant to write about Biden, or even listen to him. It was okay when he was just one candidate, or just one senator, or even the vice president. &lt;i&gt;But it's hard to see him as president.  &lt;/i&gt;It's hard to trust that.</description>

			<description>I've been hearing Serious Things about my writing here, and that's a bit intimidating. Now when I read over what I've published, I see all the mis-capitalized proper nouns, missing words, chopped out accidentally in rushed edits. Please note the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/evenWorse.png&quot;&gt;caveat&lt;/a&gt; at the top of every page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;: It's even worse than it appears. That means what it appears to mean. However it is lovely to hear from people who read this stuff. I esp like to hear what time you read it. In Europe they read it with their breakfast it seems and in California, before retiring for the night. I tend to read it in the middle of the night, around 2AM or so. Yes, weird as it seems, I do read my own blog. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>What's the difference between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/world/asia/china-Zhang-Zhan-covid-convicted.html&quot;&gt;citizen journalist&lt;/a&gt; and a journalist? It's not a useful term. A distinction without a difference. Are journalists who work for AP or the Washington Post not citizens? I like to walk. That doesn't make me a citizen walker. Putting an adjective in front of it is a priesthood thing. Condescending. Do they think somehow it's acceptable for the Chinese government to jail a citizen journalist, but it would be a problem if they jailed a real journalist?</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/metadatademo/&quot;&gt;Somewhat editable tweets&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1343192656470568961&quot;&gt;Alec Moffat&lt;/a&gt;. As you may know, you can put metadata in a web page that Twitter will display when you link to it in Twitter. For example, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/metadatademo/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/htmlScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;obvious spelling error&lt;/a&gt; in the metadata. And here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1343581454186459138&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that links to the page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/tweetScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;). If I correct the spelling error in the metadata, and eventually Twitter will notice, and the tweet will include the changed version. Voila. I've corrected a spelling error in a tweet. It's a really roundabout way to do it, but it works. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>I won't add new Spectrum services</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was determined a few nights ago to find a way to watch the Knicks, but I didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.net/&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; now has a streaming option, with no set top box. I remember before I cut the cable, they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt;, which is the broadcast network for the Knicks. So I thought there was a decent chance they had it on their streaming app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course they make you sign up to find out what the channels are. I was stupidly impulsive. I clicked the button. A minute later I was looking through their channel guide. MSG is not included. So now I figured I'd just go click another button to kill the 7-day free trial. Nowhere to be found. Typical. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I ended up on hold for an hour, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1343601622975475712&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, where they were polite but couldn't help. There was no other way to cancel the trial without calling. The operator was a jerk, raised her voice, tried to upsell, asked me to explain myself, I said I just don't want it, which is a legal reason for cancelling a free trial imho. All of it, the wait, the bad manners must be scientifically proven to drive people to keeping their subscription and even buying more, when they called to cancel. But I wouldn't discuss it. I called to cancel and that's it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This approach is no longer competitive. Hulu, Disney, HBO, YouTube -- they all make it one click to unsub. Maybe with a confirmation, but that's all. They get that if it's not easy to unsub no one is going to sign up because we understand how this bullshit works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will remember hopefully never to sign up for anything with Spectrum again.

				<source:outline text="I was determined a few nights ago to find a way to watch the Knicks, but I didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.net/&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; now has a streaming option, with no set top box. I remember before I cut the cable, they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt;, which is the broadcast network for the Knicks. So I thought there was a decent chance they had it on their streaming app." created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:31:05 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/28/203054.html?title=iWontAddNewSpectrumServices#a203105"/>
				<source:outline text="Of course they make you sign up to find out what the channels are. I was stupidly impulsive. I clicked the button. A minute later I was looking through their channel guide. MSG is not included. So now I figured I'd just go click another button to kill the 7-day free trial. Nowhere to be found.

There was no other way to cancel the trial without calling. The operator was a jerk, raised her voice, tried to upsell, asked me to explain myself, I said I just don't want it, which is a legal reason for cancelling a free trial imho. All of it, the wait, the bad manners must be scientifically proven to drive people to keeping their subscription and even buying more, when they called to cancel. But I wouldn't discuss it. I called to cancel and that's it." created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:32:04 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/28/203054.html?title=iWontAddNewSpectrumServices#a203204"/>
				<source:outline text="This approach is no longer competitive. Hulu, Disney, HBO, YouTube -- they all make it one click to unsub. Maybe with a confirmation, but that's all. They get that if it's not easy to unsub no one is going to sign up because we understand how this bullshit works." created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:33:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/28/203054.html?title=iWontAddNewSpectrumServices#a203310"/>

			<description>When you write an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; on paper, if you feel the need to reorganize, you have to write the whole thing over. This makes the initial structure something you resist deciding on, so you never get started. Doing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outline on a computer&lt;/a&gt; is different. Since you have commands to reorganize the outline, you can use any structure that supports your list-making. Because you can always regroup things, or ungroup them., Whatever works for you, over time.</description>

			<description>I saw Soul. I say meh. What a mess. I paid close attention because Pixar produces good movies. But this one was not good. I know lots of other people say they love it, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/movies/soul-review-pixar.html&quot;&gt;AO Scott&lt;/a&gt; at the NYT. It got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/soul&quot;&gt;85 on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, very high must-see.  One thing I did like is how they portrayed NYC. That was a technical achievement. Maybe they should do movies like that. Star a real-life place. Have normal people just doing stuff there. More mundane. Boy meets girl, perhaps. Pixar movies these days seem to have to bite off so much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story&quot;&gt;Toy Story&lt;/a&gt; was nice. I liked the story of the old man, a kid, a dog and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)&quot;&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;, and the one about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E&quot;&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; who has to deal with post-apocalyptic Earth. Those are simpler themes. Trying to make a story about the before-life and after-life? Hmm. That requires a bit less Hallmark and more math, imho.</description>

			<description>One thing worth mentioning is we may have entered a new era of movie-watching. A major Pixar movie, a Christmas movie, opened without theaters being an important consideration. If you had predicted that just a year ago, people would have thought you're crazy. Things are changing quickly now.</description>

			<description>I turned on &lt;a href=&quot;https://watch.nba.com/streaming-subscriptions?cid=nba:leaguepass:institutional:nbacom:domsites:nbatv:rd&quot;&gt;NBA TV&lt;/a&gt; last night and watched a bit of the Knicks v 76ers. A message appeared after a while saying that the game was blacked out where I live. Presumably because they want me to pay for something that provides a way to watch the game on local TV. Except since i cut the cord with Spectrum earlier this year, and went with YouTube TV for local stations, I can't get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msg.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt; which broadcasts the Knicks locally. I can swith to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fubo.tv/lp/preview/?page_slug=msg&amp;title=Is%20this%20service%20worth%20$65%20a%20month%20just%20to%20watch%20the%20Knicks%20lose?&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt;, which has MSG, but it's the same price as YouTube TV, and I have no idea what it is. So where I'm at now is paying $65 a month for YTTV and only watching MSNBC and CNN there. Seems pretty steep. Also if I get NBA League Pass, which I'm considering, I'm pretty sure they'd black out access for me for Knicks games too, even though I'd be paying $200 for the season. I remember when watching local sports was free, Not that long ago. What might be the smartest move, pay Spectrum, become a wire-splicer. What a mess.</description>

			<description>Two online acquaintances who share many of my values who I consider friends say something horribly negative about the US, a feature of Republican depravity, which I vote against every chance I get. I feel we’re on the same side, but I don’t like them making such sweeping statements about my country, which due to poor Constitutional design, has these awful features such as inadequate health care, or unregulated gun violence. One of these fellows is British and the other is an American expat living in Germany. I could respond by blaming the British fellow for Rupert Murdoch, who is enforcing Republican lunacy in the US and elsewhere. I suppose technically he’s Australian, but who cares. Or remind my German friend that Germany is where the Nazis came from, the same ones who menace my country now. He might say he’s really American so it’s not his fault. i won’t do it. But i liked saying it out loud just for a moment. 🤪🇺🇸❤️</description>

			<description>I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/sports/basketball/amare-stoudemire-brooklyn-nets.html&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; from Lew Perin to a NYT article about how the Nets have Mike D'Antoni and Amar'e Stoudemeyer on their coaching staff this year, supporting Steve Nash. I do have respect for Mike D, and of course Amar'e. But I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a175501&quot;&gt;feeling&lt;/a&gt; about the NBA this year that isn't too good. It isn't just the Nets, it's also the Lakers, who went from nowhere to champions. The Clippers. Harden. Etc. And Kyrie Irving who was too good to play for the Celtics, I guess. Basketball is a team sport, that's what's beautiful about it to me, but we aren't rooting for teams anymore, the franchises are the players. That's fine, I guess -- good for them, but the only player I've felt loyalty to in the NBA recently is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/jeremy-lin-signing-with-warriors-g-league-team/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt;, and he's playing in the G league for Golden State this year. And at this point there isn't much left there, anyway -- other than the bitterness at how the Knicks screwed it up. Maybe something will happen, no one saw Linsanity coming, so there's always hope. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I thought he was a bad choice for the Knicks, all through his career in NY, but how can you not feel affection for a man who keeps coming back, presumably because he loves playing. I hope that's it. I wish he had the humility back then that he has now.

			<description>We're having a huge rainstorm in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains&quot;&gt;Catskills&lt;/a&gt;. Over five inches of rain so far. All the snow from last week's storm has melted and all that water is flowing downhill. And then it's going to get cold and snow tonight. Trees are down. Power and internet went out overnight. It's a wet, soggy, grey Christmas. Of course it is. This is 2020.</description>

			<description>I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1342115217694728192&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; of how we could reconstitute tech so it's not all driven by bankers and techies with the principles and motivations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller&quot;&gt;oil barons&lt;/a&gt;. I remember during the 90s, being at odds, publicly, with Microsoft. Bill Gates was still CEO. The company had risen to dominance in tech with Windows. Apple was on the edge of going under, or getting acquired and devoured for parts. The web was a source of great potential and optimism, but Microsoft was acting as predator. The web had no defenses. He had billions, and his software was the OS on all the world's computers, except for a few on the web (Mac and Unix machines were more common there early-on). He was going to encircle the web and cut off its air supply. You can read all about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/index.html#y1996&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. All the while Gates says he's going to retire soon and spend the rest of his life giving away his money. Something seemed terribly out of balance. Why not start caring for the world now, why wait until the damage is done? So much more leverage now. Why not think bigger than creating a company, how about building a technical foundation that encapsulates all the good stuff we've figured out in the 80s (there was a lot of that) and not charge rent for it. Or at least don't interfere with the rest of us trying to do that. Nope, he persisted, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.&quot;&gt;case and a consent decree&lt;/a&gt;, and a new generation of tech monsters grew up in Microsoft's aftermath, and we're still living in a poisoned ghetto, only it's a lot bigger now. My plea is that once you're worth a billion, there's no value to making more money. Think bigger. There's so much potential, because so many of these avenues haven't been explored, yet.</description>

He wonders why the US government is doing nothing to restrict air traffic from the UK. Made me think what Cuomo will do, as a Democrat, when the president is a Democrat on the 20th of next month. Also, I wonder if Biden offered him a position in the government. He's been an incredible crisis leader for New York State.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a012405&quot;&gt;gamifying post&lt;/a&gt; is getting a bunch of comment. I was thinking of an app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity&quot;&gt;SimCity&lt;/a&gt;. I was already a programmer when it came out, but it taught me so much about the interconnection of systems. Something like that with the virus and people interacting, and people dying or the virus dying (better outcome of course) would probably save lives. And even more important it would teach us the value of working together. Since gaming is something people do in all states, red and blue, it might also help us find common ground.</description>

			<description>I wish someone would gamify the virus so people understand how it works, and how it's actually something like a game, and how we're completely blowing it. One of the skills the virus has is it can mutate. So it's in our collective interest to reduce the virus to almost nothing before it can mutate to something our vaccines can't deal with. The more virus is out there btw, the more mutations there will be. The way we're doing it now, it's like we have all the time in the world. So a million people travel by air to go to family gatherings and then a month later do it again, and fly home, spreading all mutations of the virus everywhere. We don't have a lot of time. We don't have time to worry about who Trump pardons. We need to worry about what the virus mutates to and how it might not be very human friendly, even compared to the virus as we now know it.</description>

			<description>I turned on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-justify-nets-championship-hopes-but-focus-must-remain-on-present/live/&quot;&gt;first NBA game&lt;/a&gt; of the year last night, Golden State v Brooklyn. I had less than no interest. I couldn't even leave it on while I nerded around on my iPad. It was stealing energy from me. I don't like what happened there, in Brooklyn, nor in the NBA at large. It isn't a league of teams, it's a league of superstars and a weird form of narcissism. I lost the tune of the NBA. Maybe I'll get it back. It does come and go.</description>

I had less than no interest. I couldn't even leave it on while I nerded around on my iPad. It was stealing energy from me. I don't like what happened there, in Brooklyn, nor in the NBA at large. It isn't a league of teams, it's a league of superstars and a weird form of narcissism. I lost the tune of the NBA. Maybe I'll get it back.

			<description>A lot of people vote based on how comfortable the candidate is in his or her own skin. Trump, whatever else you can say about him is quite comfortable that way. Hillary and Joe are not. Trump lost because enough people woke up and realized that wasn't a good enough reason to vote for someone. Whether or not the candidate is a sociopath and would-be tyrant should have some weight. Imagine a candidate with the confidence of Trump and the depth of knowledge of HRC.</description>

			<description>I wish my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;hippie uncle&lt;/a&gt; had lived to see legalized cannabis in the US. He also would have loved smart phones. He was always looking stuff up in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please&quot;&gt;Information Please almanac&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of having all the information in the world in his pocket is something he could have imagined, as a voracious science fiction reader, but I don't think he would have seen it as coming so soon. He was born in 1945, would have been 75 now if he lived, but he died in 2003 at the age of 57.</description>

			<title>Trump kills Americans because he likes it.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We know the Trumps were trying to kill more Americans with Covid. We don’t know why, even though the news is reporting the reason as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity&quot;&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;.  What if it had nothing to do with herd immunity what if they just wanted to kill more Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend asks what would be the point? A few answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the point is sadism or being a sociopath. I remember that kids like to kill ants in creative ways. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0&quot;&gt;The Joker said&lt;/a&gt; in The Dark Knight, sometimes people just &quot;do things.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Working with and inside organizations of all sizes I was often impressed with how often people do things for personally selfish reasons. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto&quot;&gt;Warsaw Ghetto&lt;/a&gt; during WW II. A quote stayed with me, from one of the Jews imprisoned there (paraphrasing). &quot;We make money for the Nazis, so why should they kill us?&quot; They figured as long as they were useful they'd be kept alive, as if there was reason to the way things are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc&quot;&gt;Some men&lt;/a&gt; just want to watch the world burn.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the answer is obvious. Once, when I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/425-Manzanita-Way-Woodside-CA-94062/181464824_zpid/&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, a neighbor called and said she was getting baby goats, and they would be making a bunch of noise for a while. I asked why are you getting goats. She said she always wanted goats. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And sometimes there just is no reason. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, perhaps it's too much for people to consider Trump wanted to kill Americans because he liked it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: No spoilers, but Kurt Vonnegut's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan&quot;&gt;Sirens of Titan&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful book, is about the purpose of life on earth, one that would be consistent with the theme of this blog post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze&quot;&gt;Waze&lt;/a&gt; for supermarkets. How it would work.

I'd also like to know how long ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Bread Alone&lt;/a&gt; delivered. I'd rather go when the store isn't packed full, and when my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/peasant-bread&quot;&gt;favorite bread&lt;/a&gt; is likely to be on the shelf. This would have saved me a trip earlier today, when literally every spot was taken. Not a good time to go shopping, esp during a pandemic. I did not even go in.</description>

			<description>I read a lot of audiobooks. Sometimes the narrator is so excellent, it's worth calling out. I just got through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/One-Flew-Over-the-Cuckoos-Nest-Audiobook/B008N1TVDU&quot;&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&lt;/a&gt;, narrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly&quot;&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt;. The book is wonderful, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey&quot;&gt;Kesey&lt;/a&gt; is a great writer, it's funny, warm, a great story beautifully told. Reilly does all the voices. Usually male narrators have trouble pulling off the female characters and vice versa. Somehow Reilly does it. Highly recommended. If you know of audiobooks that are great because of narration, let me know. I'm always looking for a good read. My next book is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Biden biography&lt;/a&gt; by Evan Osnos. Also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Rudy-Rucker-audiobook/dp/B00RBZFYF8/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;first book&lt;/a&gt; by Rudy Rucker.</description>

			<description>The way Trump relates to his base reminds me a lot of the way big tech companies talk to their users.

			<description>As you may have heard, I got a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;OLED tv last week&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm starting to come to terms with it. I've added an old Roku stick to the device, and 99 percent of my interaction with the TV is through Roku. I'm not sure I'm getting the best video this way. Also the annoying LG user interface keeps popping up. And to adjust the hardware of the TV, I still need to use the LG remote. Which makes me wonder if there are any external devices, Apple TV, or some kind of Chromecast or something from Amazon that can also manage the hardware? I'd love to get it down to one remote. I still think &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Roku%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;best remote&lt;/a&gt;. Almost as simple as possible. I loved the way my old TCL did everything from Roku. Perfectly integrated, and one less OS is better than two.</description>

He wakes up in a sanitarium or monastery in Hungary or Rumania, maybe Russia, surrounded by incriminating evidence. Oh life was so much simpler during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_(1962%E2%80%931979)#:~:text=The%20Cold%20War%20(1962%E2%80%931979,d%C3%A9tente%20in%20the%20late%201970s.&quot;&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
