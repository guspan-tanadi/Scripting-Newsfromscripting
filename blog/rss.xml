			<title>Live Like An American</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have an idea that you should &quot;live like an American&quot; as if there is such a thing. But that seems to be what we're arguing about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are some basically dishonest people who act like living like an American means Be Like Me. And some of the things about them are impossible for other people to be like. If being like an American means white, that let's out a lot of people. Be Christian. I'm not that, and can't pretend I am, so that let's me out. The idea of how an American lives is actually very narrow, and there probably isn't a single person anywhere that fits in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's deep confusion about the meaning of life. They pretend to know the answer, it means Live Like An American and you're doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of some of those people, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes I know I'm judging them, fine -- they judge everyone else, so imho it's fair. They either bristle with anger or badly fake feelings of regret. To them that's what it means to Live Like An American. All of it an imitation of living. I honestly have no idea what it's like to be one of those people, what their inner life must be like, what a hell it must be. That's how I imagine it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Outliners I have loved</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tfthacker started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1529930101470773272&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter where he lists all the outliners he's used starting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/more11c.html&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one was a program editor I did on Unix for C programmers in 1977. I started with the source for a Unix line-oriented editor called YALOE and added dive and surface commands (left and right square brackets) for navigating the hierarchy, and commands to restructure the outline. I'm not sure this app even had a name. It had a language parser built in, so it could take bits of code and turn it into an outline structure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I showed the app to some of my friends who were not programmers, one of them asked if they could use it, which set me off in a different direction, an outliner that had nothing to do with programming. The result was High Files, which also had a simple tabular database. Outlines could be cells in a database table, and tables could be contained within outlines. When I had that running, I moved from Madison to Mountain View, and did a deal with Personal Software for the outliner. It was hard to fit that app into 64K on an Apple II, but eventually we did, by then they had a big hit in VisiCalc, and they gave me back the product, and a settlement, and I spent the next few years doing online bulletin-board software. I was totally fascinated with using computer as networking tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is pretty well told in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;Outliners &amp; Programming&lt;/a&gt; piece, up until I started work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, which is a scripting environment build around an object database, and where everything is an outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For more info see &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.com/&quot;&gt;outliners.com&lt;/a&gt;, where I've archived these apps. Hopefully some of the code is still runnable. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My latest outliner is &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, which is the outliner I use today for writing my blog and docs. For writing code I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a distribution of Frontier designed to boot up as an outliner. I can't recommend it unfortunately because it only runs on old versions of the Mac OS. It was also available on Windows, not sure if that version still works, probably like the Mac version, it does, only if you have an older version of Windows around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to bring the code-management features in the OPML Editor to Drummer, at which point I will be able to do everything on Linux, which I look forward to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We like sports because they last beyond one person's lifetime. We don't bring our disagreements to ballgames (at least not amongst fans of the same team). We can hate the owner of the our team (and we do) but we know that no one really owns a team.</description>

			<description>The mass shootings are a TV show we've all watched to the point where we're all prepared to be actors in the pageant if the show comes to our town. There was actually a report on this phenomenon on NPR when the Virginia Tech rampage happened.</description>

			<description>My adverse reaction to the second Covid booster (I assume, I had three vaccinations on Tuesday) got even worse yesterday. And the pain from the shots in both arms made it hard to sleep. But last night was much better. Hopefully I'll be able to get some programming done today, to get back on track with the current project.</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/05/25.html#a161417&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I am irony-deficient. It's kind of a joke, but it's also the truth, as all good jokes are. You could say something ridiculous, intending it to be humorous, but I won't get it. I take things at face value. That's why I find April Fools so disturbing. But if you do it a lot I'll be tuned in, and you'll never get me again. I think it's a good thing to be irony-deficient btw. The universe is amazing and amazing things actually happen all the time. Being ID just means you have an open mind.</description>

			<title>You are the establishment</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was told by a post-boomer that the boomers might have started out promising but eventually we became the establishment. I thought to myself &quot;what an idiot.&quot; Give me credit, I didn't say it out loud. gave it some thought first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's why it's an idiotic thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every one of us from the moment we're born, or maybe even from the moment of conception if the Supreme Court has its way, is a member of the establishment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As if there were a way to live outside the grid that ties all our lives and fates together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=ken%20kiesler&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;My&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;hippie uncle&lt;/a&gt;, born in 1945, actually tried not to be part of the establishment. He bought some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crescent+Beach,+FL+32080/@29.7543309,-81.2748106,1104m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e69977c882aea5:0xe61a1afbdfe01fae!8m2!3d29.76886!4d-81.2536786&quot;&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; in northeast Florida in the early 70s, which at the time was still pretty wild, and they set up a hippie commune that was off the grid. no electricity, phone, no city water or sewer. He was an inventive guy, so he built a windmill and water tower. They grew stuff, but when they got sick or traveled they rejoined the rest of us as part of the establishment. They smoked Marlboros, paid for those with money they made doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macram%C3%A9&quot;&gt;macramÃ©&lt;/a&gt; and sold to hippy dippy head shops through a distributor -- very establishment if you ask me. Turns out even if you're ready to make a full commitment to living an alternate lifestyle, it's basically impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And pointless. Proves nothing. No one of our lives is important in the bigger context. Stopping this juggernaut of civilization is something even the richest megabillionaire sad to say can't influence very much. We all die. We are all living beyond our means from a survival standpoint. And there is nothing any of us can do about it. That's why my younger friend was saying something idiotic. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-South-Won-Civil-War/dp/0190900903&quot;&gt;How the South Won the Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and it was somewhat of a disappointment. Obviously it's a college textbook, because it recites facts, names and dates, ad nauseum, things that are probably required by curricula (just guessing), and there isn't much in the book that I didn't already know. I was expecting something that truly lived up to the title, that explained why were still living with slavery today, but that isn't what the book is about. I think it's a provocative title for a pretty ordinary American history book. My next book is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson-ebook/dp/B084FLWDQG&quot;&gt;Caste&lt;/a&gt; (*) and so far am getting a lot out of it.

			<description>In the previous post the (*) is where I knocked over a large full glass of ice coffee on my desk, the one with all my hard disks. I did something like this a few weeks ago with a glass of ice water. When this happens I quickly mobilize, moving everything of value away from the puddle. There were no towels nearby so I ran to the bedroom and got an old t-shirt that I could sacrifice, ran back and quickly sopped up the puddle and all the random bits of coffee and ice I could find. Now there's dried coffee on my keyboard and my mouse. But everything still seems to work. I went downstairs and made another tall glass of ice coffee, and hopefully this one will end up not on computer hardware and my desk, but rather fueling a day of creativity. This is a blog, therefore I am obligated to tell you, dear reader, about these events.</description>

			<description>Ending Roe v Wade will end the United States. The world is built around reproductive freedom, led by the United States. A country that repeals such a fundamental right no longer is, imho, the United States. Where we go from there I don't know. But if we're going to have a civil war, reproductive freedom would be a good cause.</description>

			<description>Davos is happening now, the first one since Covid started. The message at this year's Davos seems to be &quot;You didn't understand the web and it made mega billions. So here's a new web, called &quot;Web3&quot; -- you don't understand it, of course (frankly neither do we) but this time you must invest so &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; make the billions!&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/19/who-are-davos-man-and-davos-woman.html&quot;&gt;They&lt;/a&gt; will love it.</description>

			<description>BTW, if &quot;Web3&quot; turns out to live up to its name, I will take all this back. I've been wrong before. But so far I've not gotten an idea of how this thing is a new version of the web, and I believe I fully understand what the web is. I'd love to see a one-page description of how you develop apps for this supposed successor to the web.</description>

			<description>I am a JavaScript programmer. I've learned to stack my code via indentation when it could all be done more simply the way you do it in most other languages. It's provable. I can never understand why developers who have worked on the language itself aren't as bothered by this as I am. I realized there might be one difference, something that's been a foundation for all my programming work -- before I was a programmer, I was a math major. In math, you're always looking for broader and simpler statements that you can derive from more narrower and more complicated truths. In a sense that's what math is. So perhaps the language designers of JavaScript didn't study math? This has been a vexing puzzle for me ever since I moved into JavaScript. Not how to simplify JS, that's clear -- rather why don't other people see it, or if they do why don't they fix it?</description>

Unless you understand how the human mind works, how can you market something to humans? It's like becoming a driver, you have to learn what all the controls do. And how products fit into people's minds is one of the biggest controls, and you'd be surprised how not-different people's minds are when it comes to positioning. An example. An ad I saw on Facebook recently for &lt;a href=&quot;https://freshcleantees.com/&quot;&gt;T-shirts&lt;/a&gt; of all things. How many brands of T-shirts can you think of? Probably not too many, but you know there are a lot of them. None have any particular meaning. But what about a T-shirt that Looks Good On You? That's a position. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgl-LFrlPw&amp;t=228s&quot;&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; that no one, so far, is positioned on. Maybe the ladder doesn't exist? Positioning has lots of examples of those. But sometimes it does, and it's huge. Think of all the brands that defined new ladders. Like Starbucks. Tesla. Nike. Coca Cola. There was coffee before Starbucks and cars, shoes and cold drinks before these brands carved out new segments of these markets and because they were first in the prospects' minds, they own them, until they throw away their positioning, which many products do, foolishly, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_line_extension&quot;&gt;line extension&lt;/a&gt;. Heinz is a company that does not understand positioning and is as a result destroying their #1 brand. Think about Heinz. What does the name mean to you? Ketchup, right? Then, recently they decided there are lots of &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; ketchups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heinz.com/products/0000000117&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; at all of them! And they named them all Heinz. Oy. I bet when you add the sales of all the different Heinz ketchups, it's less than standard good old Heinz ketchup. Go to the grocery store, look for ketchup and try to find the Heinz ketchup you grew up with. Good luck!  Line extension is a bad idea. If you own the top spot on a ladder, don't do line extension. You'll lose out to someone who specializes in what you used to own. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=positioning&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;So much to say&lt;/a&gt; about this.</description>

			<description>One of the most important principles in programming is that you want to expose problems in code when you're working on it. The more time between when you did the work and when you find the problem, the more impossible it's going to be to implement a good fix. It's analogous to finding a flaw in the design of something buried under the foundation of a skyscraper, long after the whole building has been constructed.</description>

			<description>I'm seeing this principle today because I'm adapting an app I wrote in 2020 to a new environment. I'm getting to fix problems in this code that would have been very difficult to fix if I weren't doing a complete from-the-ground-up rebuild. And there are no users of this stuff, so no compatibility to preserve. It's one of the reasons that an app doesn't really get done right until you fully implement it for the third or fourth time.</description>

			<title>Is this why Musk got cold feet?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why is Musk trying to pull out of the Twitter deal?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it has much to do with how many bots are using Twitter, or whether Democrats are assholes, or even that Musk did or didn't show his dick to a stewardess. I think what really matters is what's happening to Tesla stock, and with it, Musk's wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are some facts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Musk sent his acquisition offer to Twitter on &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/2167563/an-annotated-history-of-elon-musk-buying-twitter/&quot;&gt;April 13&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On that day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%24tsla&quot;&gt;Tesla stock&lt;/a&gt; was trading at $1022.37 per share.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Today Tesla is selling for $645. That's about a 37% drop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know for sure, but I'd guess that Musk and his partners are all borrowing to buy Twitter. They certainly don't want to sell stock to raise the money to buy Twitter because that would be a taxable event. And if you take out a loan with your stock as collateral, you don't have to sell the stock, so -- no taxes. It's how rich people buy things. Even not-so-rich people do it. A moderately wealthy person who could afford to pay cash for a house, probably would just take out a loan, to avoid paying taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the huge drop in Tesla stock, and whatever stocks Larry Ellison is borrowing against to raise the money for his part of the deal, means that the bankers who are lending against that stock as collateral will want more stock. No problem you say, they all have lots of stock. But maybe he's already used that stock as collateral on other loans? Who knows how much of a stretch this is for Musk. He might not have enough stock to do the deal now. But he signed the deal, so.. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%24tsla&quot;&gt;$TSLA&lt;/a&gt; before and after April 13.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk and his partners are squeezed in a hard-to-have-foreseen way. The deal has become more expensive and harder to do. And maybe the market &quot;correction&quot; isn't done yet. Maybe Tesla will be worth half what it was, or less?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if you want to get an idea of what this is like, season one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)#Season_1_(2018)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; has the young Kendall Roy in a similar bind. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unless the market and $TSLA recover quickly this downturn is hitting Musk a lot harder than it would have if he had not done the Twitter deal. But he did, so he's kind of fucked, or so it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And there have always been people who wanted to be the first. And in no time in human history has it been more possible, and the resulting power been more awesome. And the people who want it, will soon have it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Probably some of them aren't actually trying to dominate the world, some probably just want to kill a lot of people. And that sure is happening. Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's the really scary part. When Hitler tried to achieve world domination in the 1940s, he controlled a very small country, and even though he managed to grow it significantly through war, he never got close to dominating the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think if he had come before FDR, there's a fair chance the US would've sided with Germany, not the allies. Why do I say that? Slavery. It was a very Nazi-like thing we did there. Hitler learned a lot from slavery in the US. America's philosophy with its big ideas was a lie. Our corrections have been big, but short-lived, the post Civil War reconstruction, the New Deal, and the period after WW II when the Repubs foolishly bet too much too early with Goldwater, yielding a huge Democratic majority and a president (Johnson) was knew how to use the power. But it quickly snapped back with Nixon's Silent Majority. And Reagan. And the Bushes. And Trump and who knows what comes next, but it's going in the wrong direction, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;World domination is definitely at stake in the fight between the Repubs and everyone else. Remember, this isn't a small country like Germany in the 30s, we're the military behemoth with the reserve currency for the world. The Repubs won't have to fight a world war to get further than any world dominator has ever gotten. They will have that from Day 1. No need to fight anyone. Putin and Xi will be at the inaugural. NATO will not be invited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read a lot of American history in the last two years when it dawned on me how big the lie was we were told in school. It seems in the last few years we've been starting to tell more truth to the kids, and the Repubs are putting a stop to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lots of destruction if we don't get in the way of the Republican Party's assumption of power. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And Trump and who knows what comes next, but it's going in the wrong direction, obviously." created="Thu, 19 May 2022 16:01:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/05/19/155931.html?title=repubsAndWorldDomination#a160151"/>
				<source:outline text="World domination is definitely at stake in the fight between the Repubs and everyone else. Remember, this isn't a small country like Germany in the 30s, we're the military behemoth with the reserve currency for the world. The Repubs won't have to fight a world war to get further than any world dominator has ever gotten. They will have that from Day 1. No need to fight anyone. Putin and Xi will be at the inaugural.

			<description>Yesterday I wrote about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js&quot;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; that takes an OPML list of RSS feeds and validates them. Only feeds that can be read and are parseable are added to the OPML file it creates. It's what I use to clean up old lists before putting them in a database. I can see from where I'm going next that I won't be swinging back this way for a bit, so I thought it was better to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/blob/main/subscriptionlistcleanup.js&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; to it now, in case people could use it. Important: It's a programmer's utility and meant to be example code. You have to be a JavaScript programmer to use it. If you have questions, post a comment in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/issues/1&quot;&gt;issue thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>The Bose speaker review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Speaker-Amazon-Alexa-Built/dp/B07Q337VV3?th=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/18/boseSpeaker.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've been buying smart battery-powered Bluetooth speakers almost since they first came out, starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G3SNCGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Beats Pill&lt;/a&gt;, which I had mounted on the handlebars of the bike I rode in Manhattan. Lots of people asked what it was, and where could they get one. Since then I've bought speakers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSYQWNY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;JBL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Tribit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFV59PY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Ultimate Ears&lt;/a&gt;, and others. None of them cost more than $100. My favorite so far is the Tribit, it's tiny, has a huge sound, and it's got a great feel in the hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the other day I figured out what I wanted for summer outdoor lounging -- a battery-powered speaker that had Alexa built in. So I did a little shopping, found there aren't many, and they're all really expensive. I asked for advice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1524533392901083136&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to blow some money, ordering a $400 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VFKBQ3K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Bose speaker&lt;/a&gt;. The reviews were stunning. I had a hard time imagining how the sound could be that great, compared to how great the much cheaper models were, but I had to find out. They offered free returns. So all I was risking was a little time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the top line. It was a huge disappointment in every way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had to download their app just to turn it on, and then I had to create an account on their service. I also had to check off their agreement, which of course I didn't read. So right off the bat, before it even says anything to me, I hate it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it takes ten minutes to download the updated system software. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To use Alexa, I had to go through another signon process which required me to remember the password I used for their system, which very luckily I did (I didn't try, I never plan on using that service again). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay now finally, I say &quot;Alexa WNYC,&quot; our local NPR station. Nothing happens. Then the speaker upstairs starts playing WNYC. I yell ALEXA STOP upstairs. No good. So I go upstairs and tell it again to stop, and again it doesn't. So I pull the plug. Then I hear the Alexa in the bedroom is doing the same thing. I go in there and pull the plug. Go back downstairs. The Bose speaker is doing nothing. Okay I take a deep breath and try it again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Exactly the same thing happens. So I go upstairs again, pull the plugs on the speakers, this time, leave them unplugged, go back downstairs and try again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Nothing. I figure I'll try it again later.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm not done with the flaws of the product, but I want to pause here for a moment. I'm accustomed to setting up Alexas by plugging them in, waiting a few seconds while it boots up, then it looks around and somehow finds one of the other Alexas and asks if it's okay if it uses the data on it to configure this one. I always smile at this point, man that's good design, and I say YES of course, and in a few seconds I'm listening to NPR. The process involves no work beyond plugging it in and giving my consent. I imagine it needs to download updated system software, but wisely waits until late at night to do it. Why make the human wait while the robot does its housekeeping?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay the next day I figure enough with Alexa, let's see how this is as a speaker. So I press the Bluetooth button on top of the speaker, and I connect my iPhone in the normal way for Bluetooth. Then I play an old McCartney song. It sounds like any of the other speakers I have. I hit pause and start playing another song, and it never plays. I hit pause and play again, and it plays for a few seconds then freezes. I repeat the pause-play thing again and again, that's it -- it never plays another bit of music. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This is a piece of shit product. Maybe the Alexa problems are really Amazon problems, but if so, I can't believe they shipped the thing in this condition. But Bluetooth is mature technology. I've never had a problem with Bluetooth on any of the other speakers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's no way this product is worth $400. Even if it worked it wouldn't be worth any more than $100, and probably a lot less because the idea is this is supposed to be a portable product and it's much less portable than the $43 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VSPPQXC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Tribit&lt;/a&gt;, and honestly -- if it sounds better, I couldn't tell the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Yes, I plan to share the code, because it's useful and also good example code for reading and writing lists, and reading feeds.</description>
