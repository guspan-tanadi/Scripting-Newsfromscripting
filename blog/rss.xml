			<description>NakedJen is now on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. To Jen, some people are on all the time. I'm not one of them, at least not yet. But I want to hang out with you, so if you want to chat with me, send me a ping. Best way is to start a room, and click + and invite me. I'll get notification on my phone. I may not show up. That's the protocol. Love that you're there!</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pacific-content/trailblazers-with-walter-isaacson&quot;&gt;Trailblazers podcast&lt;/a&gt; about podcasting. The segment with my interview starts around minute 11. I also get the last word. It came out perfectly, couldn't have asked for a better review of my role in podcasting. I only wish my Mom were around to hear this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/25/flatDiscussionGroups.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; on flat discussion groups on the net. Mail lists, Facebook groups, GitHub threads, Clubhouse chatrooms. People in these flat structures always behave the same way over time. After 40 years of being part of online groups, I see there are no new tricks in the human species, these things always evolve the same way. That's what this podcast is about. Might be a chapter in a book someday.</description>

			<description>Over the years I've resisted characterizing the Trump voter because I was pretty sure it was more than racism, because we're all racist. It takes a special kind of racism to act on it the way they do. I think it's best described as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy&quot;&gt;white supremacy&lt;/a&gt;. All kinds of things freak them out but the one that they can't live with is equality for &quot;others.&quot; Strips their gears. Not negotiable. They'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mluckovichajc/status/1298027757990010881/photo/1&quot;&gt;tear the country down&lt;/a&gt; before they let that happen. As long as all they have to do is vote. They're not very strong, and as soon as hard times really hits them they'll crumble. They've lived sheltered lives for generations, feel entitled.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; continues its march to perfection. There's now an &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; that lists all the recent ratings and program additions. It supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; so you can get instant notification of updates. I expect to plug this into other stuff I'm working on.

The place holder in the first version was a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/11/breakingBad.png&quot;&gt;Mr White&lt;/a&gt; from Breaking Bad and in version 2, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/16/schittsCreekCast.png&quot;&gt;Rose family&lt;/a&gt; in Schitt's Creek.</description>

This reminded me of when when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier#Publication_by_BuzzFeed_News&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed published&lt;/a&gt; the Steele Dossier, and the rage of other journalists that they had disclosed unverified information to the public, even though the dossier was being widely circulated in DC at the time. I was glad &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; took the side of the people. There should be little difference between what insiders know and what the public knows. Some things are so important, people should take risks, esp if they want the rep of being a patriot as Schmidt clearly does. Anyway it turns out &quot;collusion&quot; was too polite. The Trump campaign in 2016 was actually run by Russia. This is now an established fact. This should get huge headlines.</description>

			<description>I took my car to a special place that has techniques for cleaning awful smells out of cars. My car, a little over a year old with less than 10K miles may be a total loss because of the family of mice that colonized and then died in its air conditioning system. So I had to rent a car. When I got it, it was clear that it had been smoked in. So I asked for another car. Waited a half hour in the hot sun. The next car also had been smoked in. Impatient, I didn't ask for a new one this time. So I traded in a car that smelled of dead mice for one that smells of (to me) sickness. I haven't smoked since June 14, 2002. It's not a nice smell for me. There must be a lesson in this, but I'm not sure what it is.</description>

			<description>If Trump is re-elected, I think the country has to split in two. I don't think we, in the so-called blue states, can handle another four years of Trump. We'll have to find a way to opt out. I feel for all the people of color, immigrants and Jews in the red states. We have to provide for their migration. Either that or we rebel. But the Constitution, if it allows a man like Trump to be elected and then re-elected, is not worth preserving imho.</description>

My brother went to the Corona school, and I stayed in the Jackson Heights school. Of course I was a kid, so I wasn't really aware of what was going on beyond there were more black kids in our class. It also occurs to me that we moved not long after this happened, further east, to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburndale,_Queens&quot;&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; where there were no black neighborhoods to pair with. I don't know what motivated my parents to move, and it's too late to ask them.</description>

			<description>Heard a report this morning on NPR, interviewing older Trump voters, and while they say his behavior is awful and he lies, and he's botched the virus response, they're still voting for him. Why? They don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, white supremacy. I don't think the Democrats are going to say this but it needs to be said. &lt;i&gt;White supremacy is on the ballot this year. &lt;/i&gt;It may be the single decisive issue. Not the virus, not the Constitution. But the right of whites to dominate. I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/135804.html?title=whiteSupremacyIsOnTheBallot&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is hard to explain, but imho important. I'm going to work on better ways to explain, but for now you have to read slowly, carefully.</description>

			<description>This morning I changed &lt;i&gt;racism&lt;/i&gt; in the title of yesterday's post to &lt;i&gt;white supremacy. &lt;/i&gt;I think thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going through now in the US. Totally unanticipated that the joy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2008/11.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; would be followed by such upheaval. The US wants to shed racism, or does it? I didnâ€™t realize we were still having this argument until recently.</description>

			<description>Following up on yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/21.html#a174124&quot;&gt;hypothetical&lt;/a&gt;, assuming people from blue states relocated to sparsely populated states, let's do an example. The population of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=population+wyoming&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; is 579K. The population one of the boroughs of NYC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=population+queens+ny&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, is 2.3 million. So if 15 percent of the people in Queens relocated to Wyoming, that could yield three more non-fascist Electoral College votes, one member of the House and two Senators.</description>

			<description>Facebook, now that you've merged friend requests and notifications of new posts from friends, the fact that spam friend requests are out of control has become a more serious problem. I don't want to deal with the spam while checking out what my friends say. And there's a small chance a friend request is not spam, and there isn't enough info in the list to tell. So I just delete all of them. I get about 10 spam friend requests every day, or at least that's what it was before they got merged with other stuff. Either get the spam under control, or re-separate them.</description>

			<title>White supremacy is on the ballot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Racism and misogyny are on the ballot this year. Even white men can now feel the effects. I think that's what the last twelve years in the US have been about. Here's the story. George W. Bush was so awful, we needed an antidote, and we liked Obama. We liked how sassy he was, and smart, and how well he spoke, his confidence and ambition. The whole package. It was his moment. Trump is the reaction because there were a lot of Americans who felt tremendous fear and resentment in having a young sassy (they'd probably say uppity) black man as president, no matter that he brought the economy back from the wreck that the Repubs left us. Remember how they drove it into a ditch.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So in 2016 it was Trump vs HRC. But before that it was Sanders vs HRC. That's where I, a white man, learned how men keep women down. In the debates I was so angry that Sanders interrupted and screamed over HRC, his arms waved into her space. She had to take it. Could she respond in kind? No way. Not sure what the women's equivalent of uppity is, but it's a real thing. And because she was my candidate, I felt it, felt it in a way I had never felt it before. I was enraged by it. But it seems most people couldn't even see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people who hated that a black man was president sure as hell weren't going to follow him with a woman president. No matter that she's smart as a whip, would have been a great president, and look who she was running against. What a slap in the face for women as equals -- that so many people chose a huckster, buffoon, Putin surrogate, man-child, tax evader, draft dodger, rich kid, criminal, instead of HRC. It really says something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning while getting ready to write it hit me. The last four years have been a symbolic lynching of Barack Obama. Anyone who still approves of Trump, if they have a mind, must be driven by rage, the kind of rage that results in a young confident black man being strung up on a tree. They're willing to let a virus decimate the country in order to express their rage. Anyone who votes for Trump this time, imho, should lose the right to call themselves an American. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was something of a puzzle to me why racism became the big issue this summer, as the virus was raging through our population. But it would have been even if there had been no virus. Maybe we don't realize it at a conscious level, but the humiliation of the last four years, even for white men in the US, has been that the hatred of blacks and women in our fellow Americans has been exposed, they can't hide from it now. It's out there for everyone to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It took a fully competent African-American president and a fully competent woman candidate for white men to really see it. Some of us &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; the idea of putting racism and misogyny behind us, and others hated it. But it's fully out there now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Apple hates devs, always has</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1980-something I was invited to give a talk at Apple along with a reporter from the NYT. The idea was that we would give feedback to Apple people to help them work better with developers and the press. I took the assignment seriously. I showed up with a list of requests, things Apple could do to give their platform an advantage over the IBM PC, their chief competitor at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I finished, Apple people lined up to give &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; feedback on how ungrateful I am. They do all the work and I make all the money and get all the glory. Funny thing, because I viewed it exactly the other way around. They had real salaries and benefits. I was always skating on thin ice. There were plenty of times when I didn't have any idea how I was going to pay the bills. They never had that concern. They could break me, I couldn't break them. They had all the power. They resented that the VPs at Apple would take my calls or respond to my emails, and those emails would be circulated with notes like &quot;Please do something about this,&quot; which of course resulted in nothing happening other than more resentment. The bosses didn't listen to them, but then again, they didn't listen to the bosses either. They really held the keys, the top people at Apple had no clue about how computers worked, so they were at the mercy of the people in the room who expressed their displeasure with me that day in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did have friends at Apple, people I could take to lunch and ask wtf just happened. It turns out that the rank and file at Apple hate everyone. They hate their bosses, their bosses' bosses. And the press. And most of all, developers. On top of the list loudmouth developers like me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What can you say. Some things never change. They were wrong then, developers saved their jobs over and over. Now they don't need anyone to save their jobs, they're floating on a vast ocean of cash. But someday they will need devs. When it works there's tremendous synergy between developers and platform vendors. But employees of the platform vendors are usually big obstacles to success. They hurt, feel unloved, unappreciated, underpaid, dispensible, ripped off. And I don't know of anything that can be done about that. As they say, it is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In all media I want to pay for what I use. Instead everything is priced flat rate, itâ€™s all pretty much a ripoff. I have Hulu, Disney+, YouTube TV, Netflix, AppleTV+, Amazon. I mostly just watch news and sports. I pay a lot of money for nothing. It's as ridiculous as with news websites. As a user I want an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if people from the cities migrated to places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/wyoming_rb/&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/idaho_rb/&quot;&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, where very few people vote, yet they have two senators and extra &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College&quot;&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; oomph. Might not even be too late for the November election in some states. And btw, Zoom works in Wyoming too. It's almost like a bug fix for the Constitution. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/podcasts/the-daily/nba-coronavirus-basketball.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; explains what it's like for a reporter inside the NBA bubble. Totally worth listening to. But as with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a162754&quot;&gt;last Daily&lt;/a&gt; I listened to, it has a significant error. At the end they say that what the NBA has done is too expensive to replicate elsewhere, but -- it's not true. The NBA is doing what China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Iceland, Singapore, Vietnam did. How did I learn about this? From the Daily podcast, in repeated interviews with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Donald+McNeil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. An NBA-style bubble can be as large as the US.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/aPodcastToProgressives.m4a&quot;&gt;A podcast to progressives&lt;/a&gt;. This was the convention for all Americans who want to fight the virus and keep the Constitution. We know for a fact that progressives want this. We have to appeal to people who may be on the fence. &lt;i&gt;The DNC was a commercial. &lt;/i&gt;Marketing. It wasn't there to make you feel heard. Personally I think to fight the virus we'll need to have single payer soon after Biden takes office. There may never be a moment where you hear from everyone that you were right. You'll have to find the glory within yourself.</description>
