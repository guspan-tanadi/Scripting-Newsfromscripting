That way we can see how they deviate from fairness. Give journalism a means to compare. Help people understand gerrymandering.  Another possibility -- maybe someone like Nate Silver could put together fair redistricting maps for all the states. It'd be an interesting idea to approach it as a non-partisan thing, using the best information and data tools we have.

			<title>Make the invisible hand visible</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of online users trying to get people fired, for me, goes back to the early 90s when UserLand was starting up. I was very active on &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Applelink%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Applelink&lt;/a&gt;, which was kind of an early version of Facebook. Everyone who was anyone, even if they weren't an Apple user or developer, was there. Online systems were still a new thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One day we got a call at the office, back then companies, even mostly virtual ones, still had offices, demanding that they fire Dave Winer. The person who answered the phone tried to explain that Dave is the founder and majority owner of the company, and no one here can fire him, but the caller persisted. Even then I had too many opinions for some. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; from Jason Fried, the founder of Basecamp, about changes at his company, I was impressed with how far this has gone. It's an incredible document. You can skip the preamble, head to the numbered parts where he describes the changes they're making. The infection of people feeling empowered to get people fired now has made it all the way &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; companies. Back then, no employee of my company would consider the possibility that I, the founder, could be controlled. But now, that's not true. Clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/26.html#a140858&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about how I don't trust the NYT on almost anything these days, because of what happened to Donald McNeil. But I think, from reading tea leaves, that I can see that something like what happened at Basecamp, has happened there. A committee of employees has formed, and they will decide who can stay at the company. A lot of it will have to do with age, gender and race. Someone who is young, a person of color, and not male will be able to express stronger ideas than one who doesn't check those boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did anyone consider what this does to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; of a news organization? And, what it does to the integrity of a software development company? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our companies, organizations of all kinds, have jobs to do, and fighting for your cause, unless that's what the organization was formed to do, is not what they're about. You may think a company can take on every cause you believe in, knowing that tomorrow they will be different causes. You should start a company to test your belief. A company like Basecamp was formed (I'm guessing) to serve Basecamp users, to make them happier with Basecamp than competitive products, to generate a profit so it can grow, and to make the shareholders rich for being smart enough to bet on the company. And that's pretty much it. Maybe they had other goals, but it seems from the letter they're letting go of those now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know this has been said by many startup founders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/work/1915278/five-percent-of-coinbase-staff-rejected-its-apolitical-future/&quot;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; went through something like this. You can shake your head all you want, but in the end your only recourse, as an employee, is to accept what the leadership of your company wants, or leave and find something better elsewhere, if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's especially troubling in a time when there are so many looming crises, that journalism is being subjected to this opaque idiocracy. If this is really how the Times is going to operate going forward, they have an obligation to explain it, until the readers understand that the words of the Times are being controlled by an invisible hand. We need the NYT to have courage, to not flinch at the possibility that something they cover might offend their employees. And the best outcome imho is if the management of the Times fires the would-be controllers and lets them start the publication of their dreams which I predict approximately no one will subscribe to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family&quot;&gt;Roots&lt;/a&gt; while I've been waiting for this stomach thing to pass. Maybe not the best choice for reading material when you're feeling sick, but it's a gripping story, very well told. It's long. And the slaves the stories are about didn't have the luxury of switching to a different entertainment medium. Now I find as I poke around on the net and read what people say about prejudice and racism, I think no -- that's doesn't begin to cover it. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/550179-almost-half-of-republicans-say-chauvin-jury-reached-wrong-verdict-poll&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; that 46% of Republicans polled feel the verdict in the Chauvin trial was wrong. The only universe that it was the wrong verdict was when black people, like George Floyd were slaves, and the only crime Chauvin would be guilty of was destroying another person's property. I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1386499946795393030&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;We were taught in school that slavery was over in the US but for millions of Americans it wasn’t and isn’t.&quot; So far no one has objected to that interpretation.</description>

			<description>I did take a break from Roots to watch the Knicks win their 9th in a row. I love this team so much. Then I watched a couple of recommended movies on Netflix, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80991400&quot;&gt;High Flying Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80091936&quot;&gt;Okja&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>BTW, as you may know I also have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt;. I usually look for a link to a story on two sites: CNN and Axios. Neither site is overly cluttered with nonsense, and neither has a paywall. You can find out what the story is a few seconds and not use up any of your free allocation on other sites that do a good job but have paywalls. Thought I should get an endorsement in for this practice. They coud become the most-linked-to news sites.</description>

			<description>I'm having a lot of trouble understanding who the NY Times is, where they're coming from, and how I'm meant to understand what they're saying. Pretty sure they'd say, don't worry about these things, the Times just prints the truth, the whole truth, all sides well-represented. I don't think so. When I was a kid I believed that, I still knew they could make mistakes, but I thought they tried to get the actual story, that they weren't manipulating readers to believe things they wanted them to believe. The firing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Donald McNeil%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; was a big deal for me. They never adequately explained why he couldn't continue as a senior reporter covering the story he had prepared for for decades. I don't believe the facts they presented. They were not adequate grounds for firing. Had something similar happened to a reporter of a different gender, race or age, nothing like that would have happened. Having exposed themselves so thoroughly, they have opened up a huge integrity issue. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; is the difference between what you are and what you appear to be. There's a deeper story there, and they've buried it.</description>

			<description>Another subject the NYT has no credibility on is Facebook. These days I don't even bother reading their coverage. Often the facts behind their criticism could be interpreted in Facebook's favor, but the Times never does that. They criticize Facebook for making a bad choice where all there are are bad choices. Could their own work stand up to that kind of scrutiny? I'd love to see them take a chance, but they don't. For every article that talks about all the terrible things that happen on Facebook, they have never, that I have seen, reported on how Facebook is useful, even indispensible. I assume this is because this idea is abhorrent to them. If they acknowledge that people, on their own, can provide service to each other, with no salaried reporter acting as a go-between, what does this say about their future? Well, a real news organization would put that aside, and go where the story is. A news organization that has more of a sense of service than the supposedly great NY Times.</description>

			<source:outline text="Another subject the NYT has no credibility on is Facebook. These days I don't even bother reading their coverage. Often the facts behind their criticism could be interpreted in Facebook's favor, but the Times never does that. They criticize Facebook for making a bad choice where all there are are bad choices. Could their own work stand up to that kind of scrutiny? I'd love to see them take a chance, but they don't.

A busy week coming up. It would be nice if this virus-like thing were to go away. And this is weird because I thought we weren't supposed to get virus-like things. Still maybe it's something I ate? Oy. Thanks for all the get well messages.</description>

			<description>An easy way to make your writing better. Write the first draft as you think of the ideas. Then &lt;s&gt;go back and&lt;/s&gt; delete &lt;s&gt;all&lt;/s&gt; the connectives, &lt;s&gt;all&lt;/s&gt; the &lt;s&gt;things&lt;/s&gt; words you put in while your mind &lt;s&gt;plotted out&lt;/s&gt; plots where you're going &lt;s&gt;to take the writing&lt;/s&gt; next. And, delete every instance of the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/very&quot;&gt;very&lt;/a&gt;. Only leave &lt;s&gt;the ones&lt;/s&gt; it where it's &lt;s&gt;absolutely&lt;/s&gt; necessary to convey the veryness of the idea. Usually it adds nothing to the writing.</description>

			<description>With that in mind, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/friday-23-april-2021&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; the other day about how that reporter at Vox said something totally wrong about the origin of podcasting, I'm sure the reporter knew it was wrong, and his editors knew it was wrong, but they published it anyway. Naughton thought I must've been furious, but I'm not, I'm exhausted. It's the norm. I'm not a billionaire. I let my ideas float around in the world, I don't lock them up. My goal with podcasting was to create a new medium that everyone could use, and that has worked. Reporters don't need to score any points with me, so they give credit for my work to others. I wrote Naughton an email saying &quot;That's the way journalism works, I'm afraid. They report conventional wisdom, not facts. You're the rare exception.&quot;</description>

			<description>Now that cannabis is legal in New York State, where I live, I've been curious about how much prices vary around the country. I'm not aware of any comparison websites, but I've heard that Oregon is the least expensive, because they have an oversupply. I'm guessing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leafly.com/dispensaries/massachusetts/&quot;&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest state with retail sales, is still relatively high priced, because the business is so new. 1/8 ounce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theorywellness.org/ma/great-barrington-recreational-cannabis-dispensary/?dtche%5Bcategory%5D=flower&quot;&gt;goes&lt;/a&gt; for about $50. I imagine that some of the aggregator sites have a good idea of this. I also wonder what kinds of plans there are for stores in various parts of New York. I imagine that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village&quot;&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan will be a place where there are lots of stores. I expect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York&quot;&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest town to where I live, will also be a big spot.

			<description>I think in general, to rise to a position of fame and wealth in our society, you have to strive to never say anything. I was watching the beginning of an academic conference today, about social media, and recognize the way of speaking, having spent some time in academia myself. My mind drifted, because people weren't saying anything other than how great, amazing and wonderful people in their midst are, and wondered what would've happened at the NYT if the managing editor had told the people who wanted &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Donald McNeil%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; fired for using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anytimes.com+nigger&quot;&gt;somewhat forbidden word&lt;/a&gt; in a discussion about using that word that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; could resign, but they would not fire McNeil. Then I wondered why the people wanted McNeil fired in the first place. Maybe because this is the only way they get to have an opinion that isn't nothing. I recognize the pattern. As a man, I know that the only emotion that people are comfortable with from me is anger. Fear, fun, love, generally speaking happiness, all seem to make people uncomfortable, if you have a penis. I don't know why this is. But I reject it. We all should accept each other as we are, especially ourselves. It's this frustration with being nothing that made people want Trump, imho. We should learn to stop punishing people for being individuals. The other option is not good, as we found out.</description>

			<description>Back in 2015 the Mets were a blessed team, the way the Knicks are this year. You'd tune into a game in the 8th inning, the Mets down by 10, to see how they win. They had a few stars, pitchers and hitters who were all peaking at the same time, feeding off each others' energy, it seemed. Their run went all the way to the World Series, which they lost, unfortunately, but the charm was real. The Knicks are doing the same thing. As the fourth quarter starts to draw to a close in each game in the current run, you say that's it, no way the Knicks win this, but then Derek Rose finds Reggie Bullock, alone in a corner, he zips the ball to him and Bullock sinks a three, and we're off to overtime, which the Knicks dominate. This is sports that is charmed, not bought, like the Nets, Clippers or Lakers. Sure they have pedigree stars, they acquired a championship contender, but who cares about that. I love a team of nobodies who shine off each others' light and create an atmosphere of love, and they win because of it. People will soon forget the Nets, when the three stars go their way, to form some other super team in some other long-forgotten franchise. I think next year a few free agents will want to join up with the Knicks, but I hope the team resists. I want to see this team back again next year and the year after that. I want to watch Barrett and Quickley develop, and Rose be their mentors. I want Julius Randle to become the NBA star with a real heart, true to his squad. I feel about them as family, not acquisitions. All the years in the wilderness were worth it.</description>

They had a few stars, pitchers and hitters who were all peaking at the same time, feeding off each others' energy, it seemed. Their run went all the way to the World Series, which they lost, unfortunately, but the charm was real. The Knicks are doing the same thing. As the fourth quarter starts to draw to a close in each game in the current run, you say that's it, no way the Knicks win this, but then Derek Rose finds Reggie Bullock, alone in a corner, he zips the ball to him and Bullock sinks a three, and we're off to overtime, which the Knicks dominate. This is sports that is charmed, not bought, like the Nets, Clippers or Lakers. Sure they have pedigree stars, they acquired a championship contender, but who cares about that. I love a team of nobodies who shine off each others' light and create an atmosphere of love, and they win because of it. People will soon forget the Nets, when the three stars go their way, to form some other super team in some other long-forgotten franchise. I think next year a few free agents will want to join up with the Knicks, but I hope the team resists. I want to see this team back again next year and the year after that. I want to watch Barrett and Quickley develop, and Rose be their mentors. I want Julius Randle to become the NBA star with a real heart, true to his squad. I feel about them as family, not acquisitions. All the years in the wilderness were worth it." created="Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:39:44 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/07/02/knicks.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/22.html#a143944"/>

			<description>The most common thing that stands between people working together is a dysfunctional kind of pride. People feel they are being put down if another person knows more about something than they do. There's an old management slogan that goes with this. &quot;A people hire A people, B people hire C people.&quot; The point is this -- to win, you have to &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to work with people who have developed skills, or even basic talent, that you don't have. That's how you form a team. If you have to do everything, you're going to have trouble making something useful.</description>

Anyway this inspired a longish &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grovesprof/status/1384871198933331968&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter this morning, All I can say is 1. Oy and 2.

Glad to finally have a credible historian on the record on this. Kafka and Vox you should run a retraction. What people don't get about podcasting, it was a product. Marketed as such. But not with a financial model attached to it. We wanted to create new media, without barriers to entry, so the people could participate. 20 years later and I have to say that actually worked. Reporters don't respect any tech accomplishment that didn't generate a few billionaires (they should, there might be more if they did), but I made a bunch of money in the early tech industry, and I didn't feel very motivated to make more. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; about what money can and can't do.

			<title>Predicting the Chauvin verdict</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At 4:15 PM Eastern.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That the verdict is coming in so quickly that imho means it's a guilty verdict. Here's why.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Given the strength of the evidence and the fact that there are four black people on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/us/derek-chauvin-trial-jurors/index.html&quot;&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt;, it couldn't be unanimous acquittal.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it was a divided jury, they couldn't be adjourning so quickly, the judge wouldn't let them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Therefore the only situation that makes sense, at this point, is a unanimous decision to convict.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the best investments I've made is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp&quot;&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;, the less famous of the two big ones, the other being the Dow Jones. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies&quot;&gt;collection of stocks&lt;/a&gt;, chosen by a company named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_Global&quot;&gt;S&amp;P Global&lt;/a&gt;. Simplifying just a little, they buy shares in those stocks and then in turn sell shares of the collection to everyone, people like you and me. The value of the fund is the totall of the value of all the stock it owns, and fluctuates as their prices change. Every day it goes up or down, like a stock. It means that even if one of these companies does badly, the collection doesn't crash. It's designed to reflect the value of the &quot;stock market.&quot; So why is the S&amp;P 500 such a good investment? This is what I think, everyone has an opinion about this. It's the way presidents are evaluated. If the stock market is doing well, then analysts say &quot;the economy&quot; is doing well, and the president's approval rating goes up. It doesn't make any sense, but that's how it works. So the president will work really hard to make sure that your bet on the S&amp;P 500 goes up and up and up, always, in good times and bad. Now, there are times when the S&amp;P 500 will go down, but usually it goes up. If you put some money there it will probably grow. Over time it will grow a lot. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.INX:INDEXSP&quot;&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; the value of the S&amp;P 500 here. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/19/sp500graph.png&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; of the S&amp;P 500 from 1981 to now. You can see it does go up, but there are times it goes down. You can buy shares in the S&amp;P 500 from any brokerage firm. The list is open source, so any reputable broker can sell you an S&amp;P 500 fund. They all, by definition, behave exactly the same, though commissions on transactions differ according to brokers. That's why I say I &quot;simplified&quot; just a little.</description>

Blink is owned by Amazon. They're sending me &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/19/blinkPlan.png&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; saying that my free plan is about to expire and that I should pay them, for something, they're not clear what, but it sounds like my cameras will be useless once they turn off the plan. In about a week. I don't like that they are so vague about what will happen if I don't pay the money. Amazon hasn't always been the most customer-friendly company, but this is unusual for them, not to be reasonably clear what the proposal is. This is the kind of slimy crap I expect from a cable tv company like Comcast or Spectrum. Or AOL back in the day. Companies that want your money and will do everything ot keep it coming, no matter how unprincipled. Of course I can and will let it expire to see what'll happen. I doubt seriously if, as they threaten, then it will be too late. Heh. This is the kind of campaign that just keeps coming.</description>

			<description>BTW, if it's a summit, you don't have to say it's a summit. The conference with FDR, Stalin and Churchill was simply called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference&quot;&gt;Yalta Conference&lt;/a&gt;. My father once told me that a university doesn't have to say it's a university if they really are one. You don't see car window decals for proud parents that say Harvard &lt;i&gt;University&lt;/i&gt; or Stanford &lt;i&gt;University. &lt;/i&gt;Just Harvard and Stanford will do. He was putting down the window decal I got him for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tulane.edu/&quot;&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;, which did proclaim itself a university. Even worse, they called themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/602l8x/the_harvard_of_the_south/&quot;&gt;The Harvard of the South&lt;/a&gt;. Oy! That's not a good sign. I wonder if they still do that. And doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22harvard+of+the+south%22&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; today I learn that Duke, Rice, Emory and Vanderbilt also consider themselves THOTS.

			<description>BTW, to follow up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/17.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; posts about tabs and bookmarks in the outliner part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like I did get it stabilized yesterday. I have to qualify that because I saw some problems before I shut down for the day yesterday, after fixing a huge number of really serious mistakes and omissions. But I feel confident that I can start the post corner-turn cleanup and get ready for more fun projects starting tomorrow. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1383828003013070850&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;: Re the problems, oy there was a huge problem. In the main closure for a tab there's a background thread that I did not kill when the tab was closed. As a result it kept running. Whenever it saw a change in a file (not its file) it would save it, to the now-closed file, thus wiping out the contents of the closed file. This was hard to track down. Now everything is really smooth. Haha until I find the next horrible omission! Users never see these problems, hopefully, but this is what you have to deal with getting to the point where software is useful.)</description>

			<description>I'm learning that more people from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Ulster County&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood are reading this blog. I find that exciting. Maybe we should have some meetups this summer? At the beer garden at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;the Colony&lt;/a&gt;? I love the idea of a beer garden in Woodstock, and as everyone knows, summers here are the best. There's a lot of planning to do now that cannabis is legal everywhere in NY State now. And Tuesday is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture)&quot;&gt;4/20&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.0426&amp;lon=-74.1183#.YHw_JRNKjUZ&quot;&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; is going to be nice.</description>
