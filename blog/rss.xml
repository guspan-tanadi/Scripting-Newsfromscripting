			<description>In October of last year, before impeachment, I proposed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/10/21/140215.html&quot;&gt;permanent citizen's occupation of DC&lt;/a&gt;. 100K people constantly in protest in DC, rain or shine, 365 days a year, until Trump is gone. On a rotating basis. No one signs up for more than one day. Never more than 100K. Keep a constant presence there for the Democrats and Republicans to remember. To be in the way. To be loud and obnoxious. To help them remember who they work for.</description>

I have a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; for development, and the core outliner in JavaScript is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/concord&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. I've always felt every app should have a nice outliner built-in. &lt;i&gt;Let's have fun!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1277329886080905219&quot;&gt;Gruber&lt;/a&gt;, there's renewed interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. I'd love to have an excuse to work more on its evolution. I have a series of steps in mind, but not enough of a user base to do it with. Gruber would be an excellent user to help drive development. Note that I did a fair amount of &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1580502471000&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; on it earlier this year, adding a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1582640454000&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that I use every day, to grab all my tweets from the previous day. It's turned Twitter into a blogging tool for me, believe it or not. Pretty cool.</description>

			<description>BTW I should add a feature to &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; that makes it possible for me to send the URL of an OPML file in a link and have it open in LO2. Might help people get the idea of what an outliner is. Heh. After I finish with Radio3. This is what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/29/sexy.png&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/a&gt; by &quot;sexier and speculative&quot; ideas. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Why work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; now? I've had it on my list for a long time. It's long overdue for an overhaul. I wrote it when I was new to JavaScript and didn't really understand the rules, it's a weird language and the browser is a very weird runtime environment. But I always seem to find something sexier and more speculative to work on. Programmers notoriously hate to clean up their messes. I'm no different. Then I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=come-to-Jesus%20moment&quot;&gt;Come to Jesus&lt;/a&gt; moment. I use Radio3 all day every day. I use it on my iPad and iPhone as well as my desktop. It does a lot of my Twitter posts, it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links tab&lt;/a&gt; on scripting.com, and the links section of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. It's an important piece of software. Staring me right in the face. Improving it could make everything better. And making it easier to work on the code means I could add improvements in the future.</description>

			<title>Reading tea leaves</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reading tea leaves and being a basically positive person, even when it might not make sense, I think what happened with Pence and masks is that the Repubs in the Senate are shitting their pants over the virus, and said to Trump you can keep trying to stoke race hate if you want, but Pence has to take over the virus and start actually trying to fight it and support the states, and stop undermining Repub governors. Trump said &quot;Whatever&quot; and Pence started, slowly, trying to do this job. Meanwhile get Governor Cuomo in there as a Guest President, and he can run the US effort against the virus, on loan from the Democratic Party. That would probably work, and if presented the right way Trump would probably be okay with it as long as he doesn't go to jail.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bulleted list in reverse order of stuff I'm looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Have to test to see if it still works with Slack. I suspect it does. Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.smallpict.com/2015/05/25/pushLinksToSlack.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for posting to Slack from Radio3.  (Tested: Works, so Slack remains in the UI.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm removing the UI for the features that ping updates for the feed in custom ways. You can use rssCloud, which is specified in the feed Radio3 keeps for you. If you've built a system that depends on this please let me know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;OPML &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/oldsettings.opml&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for the original settings dialog is here. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm removing Facebook and Wordpress from the user interface. Trying to preserve as much of the code as possible, so if we ever can resume the connection with one or both, it will be as painless as possible. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, it's no coincidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt; has huge momentum now when we have the most racist president in generations. Just as it's no coincidence that the most racist president followed the first African-American president. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It appears we're going to flip back to the positive direction, so the question is what do we want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big issues are imho:    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Voting rights.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Health care.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Climate crisis.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even more immediate: Assume the US government will spend $10 trillion in the next year to keep the US from crashing. Should that money go to the 1% (where it would go by default, imho) or should we focus on making sure the money goes to solve the critical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That money could restructure health care so it works for everyone. It could start the transition to a green economy. It could certainly help assure voting rights, and therefore a fairer government in future years, and maybe prevent the flipping back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm very concerned that we will end up settling for symbolic victories, removal of the stars and bars from the Mississippi state flag, removal of monuments, and nothing material will change. Symbolism is important, but we have big non-symbolic problems to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The focus has been on changing minds and attitudes. I am open to that in every way. I learned a tremendous amount from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html&quot;&gt;1619 podcast&lt;/a&gt;. More of that please. I am reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0030MR076/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&quot;&gt;People's History of the United States&lt;/a&gt; -- again, eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But you can't change people who don't want to change. This is why the approach that pundits are taking, saying we have to change people, they have to understand what it's like to be X, as a prerequisite for real change, that's not a good approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can find win-wins right now. Restructuring health care won't just help people of color, it will help everyone. But imho is is a #BLM issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Voting rights matter, even if it only re-enfranchises African-Americans, because many of us want the kind of government African-Americans will vote for.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be either/or, in fact if it is, we will all lose. Repubs will continue to dominate, and all the resources will continue to flow to the 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of change in the next year. This is a pivotal time. We must organize, black, white, all genders, all races, ages, erase the wedges and act in all our interests to save lives, and overcome the challenges in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's find our inner-Americans, and fight to live up to the promise of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This post first appeared in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1277220379669467136&quot;&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; this morning.

			<description>We're going to start on the road out of racism in the US when intelligent, loving, courageous, driven and visionary people of all races decide to listen to each other and find things we can do that benefit everyone regardless of race, now -- immediately, not some time in the future.

The Democrats could do it too, no imagination. Or a startup could. Hire a former head of the CDC, and do the hourlong briefing Cuomo did, a weather report for the virus, and make recommendations for business and people. Huge piece of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/01/13/ahugechunkofbluesky.html&quot;&gt;blue sky&lt;/a&gt; here. JC is a risk-taking angel investor with experience in journalism.

			<description>For the next few days &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; will be unreliable if the past couple of days are any indication. I'm retooling the server, and grappling with some mysterious problems. BTW, the reason I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/179&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about a Hello World app for WordPress is that if there's an easy way to get WordPress support working again in Radio3, (the WP API changed some time back and broke Radio3 in this regard), I will. But I don't have time to do a deep-dive into the WordPress API at this time.</description>

			<description>In the meantime, I think I found what was screwing up my new server. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt; has a feature, that by default is enabled, where it checks with the GitHub repository every 15 minutes and downloads changes. It doesn't restart the app, so you don't see the effect of changes until you restart. The apps are running in the new version of PagePark that has Forever integrated. The way it knows which JavaScript file to run is via the &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt; attribute in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/package.json&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how this goes wrong. At some point, the app checks with GitHub, sees that its version of package.json is different from the on the repo, and downloads it, replacing the one I customized. Ooops. That version does not have a &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt; attribute. So next time I launch PagePark, which I am doing a lot of these days as I debug it and add features, the nodeStorage-based apps don't run. Vexing little bug. The feature should probably default to off. Thing is, when you implement a clever feature like this you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; it to default true. Then, years later it bites you in the ass. That my friends is the way programming works, when it doesn't work. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>This may be the last I write about Trump. Suppose Trump were a brilliant political strategist. On hearing of how awful the virus was, in January, he would have thought to himself, &quot;I just won re-election.&quot; How could that be you ask? Simple. He waits a bit until it's obvious to the press that it's an emergency then he gives a big Oval Office speech announcing the emergency and what we're going to do. It's exaclty what the CDC says to do. &quot;This is going to hurt,&quot; Trump reads off the teleprompter, &quot;but we'll get through it together.&quot; Then guess where his approval rating would be? 95%. Because that's how it works. We rally behind the leader in a time of crisis, even a douchebag like Trump. Who is more dumb than a sack of nails. I'm sure one of his advisors saw this as a political gift. All Trump had to do was listen.</description>

			<source:outline text="This may be the last I write about Trump. Suppose Trump were a brilliant political strategist. On hearing of how awful the virus was, in January, he would have thought to himself, &quot;I just won re-election.&quot; How could that be you ask? Simple. He waits a bit until it's obvious to the press that it's an emergency then he gives a big Oval Office speech announcing the emergency and what we're going to do. It's exaclty what the CDC says to do. &quot;This is going to hurt,&quot; Trump reads off the teleprompter, &quot;but we'll get through it together.&quot; Then guess where his approval rating would be? 95%. Because that's how it works. We rally behind the leader in a time of crisis, even a douchebag like Trump. Who is more dumb than a sack of nails. I'm sure one of his advisors saw this as a political gift. All Trump had to do was listen." created="Fri, 26 Jun 2020 17:58:31 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/26.html#a175831"/>

In my old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; in Queens, they said it about Jews, when we moved in.

			<description>I havenâ€™t had any interaction on my Facebook posts in the last week. No comments, no likes, nada. Itâ€™s like it just ended. The people are gone, or Facebook algorithm isnâ€™t showing anyone my posts. Meanwhile itâ€™s rock and roll on twitter and on my blog. Later: Well it turns out, I have been posting mostly-private messages on Facebook since May 23. Not sure how it happened but only a few people were seeing them. I just posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1263656047175131&quot;&gt;something public&lt;/a&gt; and it's as if the lights turned back on.

			<description>Driving on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike&quot;&gt;Masspike&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, going west, listening to the audiobook of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;People's History&lt;/a&gt;, when a phone call comes in. Looks like spam so I don't answer. Then the car's audio, coming from my fully updated  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FT5A2LL/A/refurbished-iphone-xs-max-64gb-silver-unlocked&quot;&gt;iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/&quot;&gt;CarPlay&lt;/a&gt; switches over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt; app, and plays an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/podcasts/the-daily/facebook-twitter-black-lives-matter-trump.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;The Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, an episode I didn't want listen to, and there's nothing I can do until I can stop the car and reactivate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/ep/apple&quot;&gt;Audible app&lt;/a&gt;, about 15 miles of driving. To be very clear, it should have resumed the book, which was interrupted, not start a podcast. This is the kind of software lunacy that never gets fixed. Next year they'll revamp the OS of the car, or the phone, or switch the processor, or get rid of iTunes or Cookie Dough or whatever, and more stuff will break, and the process will continue next year and the year after, and it will not have been worth it. At some point some adult will run Apple, someone who can't be bluffed on software, will tell the engineers to shut up and eat your vegetables, you can watch TV when you finish your homework.

			<title>JavaScript and who made it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glitch/status/1275809005093429249&quot;&gt;Glitch asks&lt;/a&gt; a very interesting question.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you could rename JavaScript what would you name it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk this through.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First what is JavaScript. Let's make a list of things it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a single syntax that works in the browser and on the server. A lot of the built-in routines work in both place.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a vastly too-hard-to-learn language, but it's what we got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you were going to design one language that everything should be translated to, it would never be JavaScript, but once again, it's what we got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every toolkit shows up as a package in the server runtime for JavaScript. It's the default platform. If you want to write software that integrates lots of back end services, JS is your best choice. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was created by the immediate competitive need of Netscape's visionary, and a future venture capitalist, combined with the longevity of a standard syntax that has grown a lot especially in the last couple of years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In most of the answers to &lt;i&gt;What Is It? &lt;/i&gt;you could summarize it by saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;. In every category, given a choice between elegance and simplicity, performance and ease of use, JavaScript picks the worst of the options. And since worse is better, that's good! That's why it wins. It doesn't worry about being better, does it work, if so, let's use it and go forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to the beginning when Marc Andreessen didn't (presumably) want Java to run away with the web. That's the position Java had, and they were pressuring Netscape to bundle it with the browser, and he didn't want to do it, but he had to have something to put in his place. Pretty sure that's why he asked Brendan Eich to write it,  the legendary &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/&quot;&gt;10-day project&lt;/a&gt;. So what was &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; product? Maybe that should be the name? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though they weren't thinking of server-side language that JS would become, really JS is &lt;i&gt;the language of the web.&lt;/i&gt; That idea fits both the original vision and the current use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But that's not really a product name: Language Of The Web. LOTW. Nah doesn't really live well in the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would have just called it Netscape. It's so central to everything the company was doing, you could have said -- this is the reason we created the company. The web is the UI, and that's important, but the real power is the network behind it, and that network is defined by the language, and this here is the language. It would have given Java a run for the money, probably would have pushed it closer to Microsoft (that's a whole other story) but long term, it would have worked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW all that's left of Netscape today is -- JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They didn't do it then, but you could do it now and it would be cool and fun, historic, respectful and something people would talk about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to drive today on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;New York State Thruway&lt;/a&gt;, south of Albany. It was a long enough drive that I had to stop to use the facilities. I dreaded going into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waze.com/livemap/directions/united-states/new-york/new-baltimore/rest-area-i-87-mile-127-new-baltimore-service-area?place=w.187564456.1875579027.457925&amp;utm_expid=.K6QI8s_pTz6FfRdYRPpI3A.0&quot;&gt;rest stop&lt;/a&gt;. Happy to report that everyone, without exception, was wearing a mask. I had another thought, watching a woman walk her dog in the special area set aside for that. I thought geez if the dog can pee outside.</description>

A reader, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pirx2691&quot;&gt;Richie B&lt;/a&gt;, sent me a link, and I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6OYSDYuvoA&quot;&gt;this version&lt;/a&gt; even better. Very sweet, jazzy. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I asked a friend whoâ€™s Jewish, as am I, how heâ€™d feel if a statue of Hitler was in the middle of his town. He said itâ€™s different. Itâ€™s not. Imagine, after surviving the war, getting your freedom, the people you lived with, who controlled the town you live in, celebrated your enslavers.</description>

			<description>The people who flirt with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan&quot;&gt;KKK&lt;/a&gt; tactics, use the intimidation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws&quot;&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt;, we canâ€™t cleanse their minds, but we can force them back into the shadows. Blacks are every bit as American as any of us. Stop worrying about the feelings of the evil people, start caring for their victims.</description>
