			<description>One of the reasons I love writing for the blog is that I've made the best software for me for editing it. I didn't make it for anyone else. I know of one person who has adapted it for his own use, that's it. The software still is far from as good as it could be. It needs the one feature my old outliner in Frontier had, scriptability. I need to get outside the limits of the JavaScript environment in the browser and on the server, while relying on the software I've built so far, to define a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/19/suspensionOfDisbeliefAppli.html&quot;&gt;virtuality&lt;/a&gt; that is perfectly scriptable. To exist at a higher level, both as a writer and a developer. I've been to the top of this mountain before, but this time I'm taking a different path to the top. And maybe it isn't even the same mountain. That's what makes these writing/software explorations so interesing, and risky. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I like Chris Lydon who does the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; podcast. In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/plague-year-two/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing an expert on pandemics, he exclaimed &quot;Oy oy oy,&quot; almost wearily. Now Chris is nice, as I said, but heâ€™s a total &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy&quot;&gt;goy&lt;/a&gt;, so it was LOL funny to hear him say that phrase. Oy!</description>

			<description>I want to know more about who the listeners are for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I bet they're amazing. I'd start by asking listeners to send in a photo of where they listen to the podcast. We'd publish them (after reviewing to be sure they're safe for work). It'd be quite a conversation starter. They have a Disqus comment section on the blog, and they get some comments.</description>

			<description>Key fact: Every time someone gets infected, the virus has another chance to mutate and thereby get around our vaccines. So it's in all our interests to reduce the number of infections, to slow mutations. Does this make sense? Somewhere in my education, I don't remember where, they taught me to think like this. Two or more processes that interact happening at the same time. It's reality. We're in a contest with the virus. It won for many months, and it's still winning, but now we have a strategy for slowing its growth. We will not eliminate it. These are basic facts most people haven't begun to absorb.</description>

			<description>I don't like the Holier Than Thou BS of the Democratic Party. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-never-trumpers-are-becoming-pro-democracy-republicans.html&quot;&gt;Never Trumpers&lt;/a&gt; form a new party, I might join up. I'd like a party that endorses only two things, 1. the Constitution and 2. a return to majority rule. All other issues, up to the individual to decide.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/05/whatIveLearnedAboutWhereWereAtWithTheVirus.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: What I've learned about where we're at with the virus. When will it be over? Depends on a lot of things, including many that are completely out of anyone's control, and unknowable. All we're doing basically is going with hunches, and trying to see what works. The virus our vaccines were tested against is not the same virus that's out there today. Variants and mutations make the virus a moving target. We need better monitoring, hopefully the Biden Administration is working on that. 15 minutes.</description>

			<description>All of a sudden the opportunities to get vaccinated are exploding here in upstate New York. We are over-supplied, it seems. It's always been true, the United States is the country you want to come help when you have a disaster. We were not prepared for this pandemic, but we could invent, test and manufacture a vaccine, and we are able to distribute it. We're good at this stuff. And we're big and rich enough to do it right. If the pandemic had happened with Biden as president, we'd have cleaned up the virus by now, and also gotten started of ridding ourselves of the insurance industry, which does nothing for us, and takes so much.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html&quot;&gt;One year ago today&lt;/a&gt; I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how the world was about to change and how Americans weren't ready for it. And for a few hours I replaced the contents of the home page of my blog with a simple statement in very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/urgent/2020/03/05.html&quot;&gt;big letters&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;A deadly virus is taking over the world and the United States doesn't have a government.&quot; A year later, and the virus did take over the world, and thankfully the US now has a government, yet it is very damaged by the traitorous behavior of the ousted president. But we're doing better now.</description>

			<description>In the podcast I said the virus was going to hit us hardest, because we feel invulnerable. Lots of other things, it's worth a listen. I'm glad I did this podcast. It was a transition point, the world changed around March 5, 2020. On the other hand as it turns out I overestimated how bad it was going to be.</description>

			<title>JavaScript: Repetitive code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript you enter this form a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if (err) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;else {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me there's an opportunity to create a construct to factor this repetitiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But for the life of me, I can't come up with something simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think all apps should be scriptable, whether they run on the desktop or in the cloud. See the use-case in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1367477718976061441&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Eli wants a feature in Zoom. He has to wait for them to give it to him. If the app were scriptable, any developer could write it.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Stallman&lt;/a&gt; has a similar idea. He says everyone should give him their source code. But if you do that, you get a million silos instead of one. The correct way of doing this (freedom for users) is to build powerful systems that can be easily and arbitrarily hooked up to other systems.</description>

			<description>BTW, I'm going to be beating the drum for scriptable apps probably just as &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=annoying&quot;&gt;annoyingly&lt;/a&gt; as I did it in the 90s. We need to do it. Too many silos. System-level scripting is the same idea as it was on the Mac, except most of the apps now run on servers in the cloud.</description>

			<description>All the water my house uses comes from a well 140 feet underground. The water contains some minerals, not much, because the Catskills are renowned for water quality. The pipes also contribute minerals to the water, esp when the pressure drops to zero as it did the other day when the pump failed. And again when the power went out. When the water comes gushing back after an outage, it dislodges little bits of crap from the walls of the pipe that were loosened when the support of the water suddenly disappeared. There are filters that catch the chunks large enough to cause problems in some of the devices hooked up to the water supply. But not all, some have no filters, and the bits get lodged in bad places, but then given enough time, they disintegrate and things slowly return to normal. I learned all this in the last few days. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>An idea for a social net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea -- a net where no one knows your name or bio. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People listen to what others are saying without an idea of who's talking. All you know is that they were chosen to be part of the group because they're interesting, known to think well/carefully, have respect for other points of view.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are criteria to be accepted, like a university has criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe you have to take a test. I know entrance exams are inevitably skewed to favor white men. Hire a team sociologists to try to overcome that.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Limit to say 10K people. Like a good-sized town. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I live in one, so have an idea how communities this size work online. With good moderation, the communities solve problems, people help each other. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your real world identity is secret. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All you know is that everyone in the community likely has something in common with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your screenname persists, so people get to know you but have no idea who you are in the real world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you reveal your identity, you are kicked off the system. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I was part of such a community a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was called CB Radio and was a service on CompuServe, an ancient and long-gone social media site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>An idea re Andrew Cuomo. Do a full investigation. Invite all accusers to come forward. The allegations are published by a 9/11-style commission. Then have an election, let the voters decide. I explained in some detail how I feel about this situation in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/02/theCuomoProblem.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I recorded yesterday. Summary: No I don't think Cuomo deserves our mercy, I think &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; deserve it. He led us very well during the darkest days of the pandemic, and for all we know even darker days are ahead. We are not out of the woods yet, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972952844/texas-and-mississippi-to-lift-covid-19-mask-mandates-and-business-capacity-limit&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/us/texas-governor-mask-mandate/index.html&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; are acting as if we are. The very things that make Cuomo such an asshole may also make him a great leader in times of trouble. In this way it's totally parallel to the Al Franken cancellation. Also I suggest his daughters, whom we've heard a lot about (too much, although his critiques of their boyfriends were funny, I guess, you may have to be from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; to get the humor), have a talk with him. Sit him down and make him listen. Dad we can possibly save your ass if you listen now. I'm guessing they know how unacceptable his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-209&quot;&gt;non-apology apology&lt;/a&gt; is. But ultimately this is not a decision for the press, or for other politicians, it's for the voters of New York to make. I think that in all but the most egregious emergencies, that's the right answer.</description>

			<description>BTW if you asked me when I was a kid if Queens would someday elect a president, have the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grubstreet.com/bestofnewyork/absolute-best-chinese-restaurants-in-flushing-nyc.html&quot;&gt;Chinese food&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and pretty much every other kind of Asian ethnic food, I would have thought you were out of your mind. On the other hand no one expected the Mets to win the World Series in 1969, so there's that. Queens is a weird place. But it's kind of nice that the world comes to Queens these days, and it emanates from Queens too.</description>

I accepted it, and we became friends.

I don't know, but re-reading the post, I was able to feel the relief today that I felt last year. One of the many wonders of having a blog. I went back looking for comments about the looming (then) pandemic.</description>

			<description>Yesterday with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/02.html#a171711&quot;&gt;power outage&lt;/a&gt;, I listened to a lot of podcasts, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/opinion/the-argument-congress-filibuster-senate.html&quot;&gt;The Argument&lt;/a&gt; from the NYT. They had a two-sided discussion of the filibuster. One side for getting rid of it, and the the other for preserving it. The latter was argued by a establishment Republican &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JessAnderson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/&quot;&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I kept thinking, they aren't the other side any longer. They represent possibly 10 percent of the Republican Party which represents maybe 40 percent of the electorate. The real &quot;others&quot; are the nutjobs and fascists. They want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc&quot;&gt;burn the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; down. I doubt if they have anything specific to say about the filibuster. I'd love to hear a debate between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein&lt;/a&gt; faction (smart, thoughtful, polite) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy&quot;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; who runs the US Postal Service or Josh Hawley. I also listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mea-culpa-with-michael-cohen/id1530639447&quot;&gt;Michael Cohen podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He has something. A real radio personality. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lawn%20Guyland&quot;&gt;Lawn Guyland&lt;/a&gt; guy for sure. Surpringly it held my interest.</description>

			<title>Sex in the workplace</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was founder and CEO of a small Silicon Valley company in the 1980s. A few dozen people at its peak. I had invested everything in the company, and it was touch and go all the way. If I lost, I would have been totally broke, financially and personally, so I didn't have time to play around. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also had a girlfriend, a long distance relationship, and remember being frustrated that her friends told her no man could be faithful that long, but I was. Maybe I was a fool because I got blamed for it anyway. But that's not the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of women in the company, including execs. I wanted the best people I could get for the job, and I was raised by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt; who was accomplished and smart, so I believed in the idea of gender balance and practiced it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also was propositioned a fair number of times by women who worked for me. Totally inappropriate. I brushed them off, but occasionally had to sit down and say this was something you could get fired for, if it didn't stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was so much sex going on in the company. And there was also gossip about who I was sleeping with (CEOs get gossiped about, no surprise). The whole thing was depressing. Our company was often on the brink of going under, and to some it was just a job, and maybe they felt it was hopeless, but I couldn't afford to. And there was no way to stop the gossip without making the issues even bigger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually we had a hit product, and noticed that when the company was growing the gossip became less important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of the story is that sex in the workplace is complicated. It isn't just about men with power using it to take advantage of lower level employees. I think a lot of people must know this, and are overlooking, deliberately or not, when discussing this topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330&quot;&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; I made a change to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute&quot;&gt;script scheduler&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to get rid of drift, so that the nightly email would go out more or less precisely at midnight. The fix worked. Sometimes it's one second after midnight, but usually it's exact. The important thing is that any difference is not cumulative, it gets back on track on its own the next day. Here's a screen shot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/02/footer.png&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/a&gt; on last night's email.</description>

			<description>The weather. Oy! Very cold very windy and the power has been out, on and off, since yesterday afternoon. I charged up all my devices before the power went out and loaded up lots of podcasts, so I'm very entertained. Made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy82ekHbVpM&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;nice fire&lt;/a&gt;, but the house still got down to about 45 degrees. I was worried about pipes freezing if the outage lasted much longer. But the power is back at about 12:20PM Eastern and I'm feeling pretty good now.</description>

			<description>How are we going to be sure we remember January 6 and the fact that we've done &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; so far to punish those responsible. Congress is filled with instigators. Yet the Dems go along as if it's four years ago and perhaps HRC is president and the Repubs are just being assholes.</description>

			<description>I was asked what would you do if you were in charge of the Dems. Okay. I would do the equiv of what Trump did on Jan 6, but do it legally, within the limits of the Constitution. Turns out the Constitution gives the Dems enough power to do what's needed. Yes, it will provoke what remains of the Repubs. So when are you going to stop worrying about that and realize that the rest of us have been totally provoked. They don't worry about provoking us. Maybe that's something we have to fix.</description>

			<description>Like many others I learned to live with an alcoholic parent. You try desperately not to provoke them. They drink and that's all the provocation they need. But they're the adult, and you're a kid so you believe them when they say you provoked them. But kids are not stupid, you can't see how.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SBNation/status/1366420617600192513&quot;&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;. The Knicks are surprisingly good this year, and fun to watch. Finally NYC has a real NBA team. Not like Brooklyn which was annointed by an itinerant group of star players. They'll be as hollow as Miami or Cleveland when they move on.</description>

			<description>I am pissed that the press is going after Andrew Cuomo, who led us through some very dark times, when it helped to feel like someone was in charge. We may need that again, and thanks to this purge, he may not be available. But if you really want to nail him, learn about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_New_York_City_mayoral_election#General_election&quot;&gt;1977 campaign&lt;/a&gt; between his father and Ed Koch, for mayor of NYC. It was very mean-spirited, and Andrew was part of it. I find what the Cuomos did utterly abhorrent, but you know what, we still need people who can lead. Perfection is nice, if you can afford it. We can't.</description>

It appears it'll be coming out in installments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/nytimes-peru-n-word-part-one-introduction-57eb6a3e0d95&quot;&gt;The first&lt;/a&gt;, which was published today on Medium is mostly preamble. I know what he means about being edited. I wrote briefly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awired.com+%22dave+winer%22&quot;&gt;for Wired&lt;/a&gt; in the early days. I loved my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen&quot;&gt;first editor&lt;/a&gt;, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes.</description>
