			<description>BTW, I never made software for iOS. I remember clearly when I decided not to. The day they announced the iPhone. I was expecting it to run Mac software. I had a great scripting environment for the Mac. I thought this is it, the perfect platform for me. Then I heard it was going to be nothing like the perfect platform for me. Now, 14 years later, give or take, the big story in tech is that it's an awful platform for developers. Y'all should just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Save a lot of time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A bug in journalism is that it tries to put people in boxes. Your ideas only have value if you have credentials to back them up. This method makes reporters easily replaced by algorithms, and keeps us from hearing the most interesting  even eclectic idea stimulating ideas. Of course no one in journalism will hear this because heh I lack the proper credentials.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/20/the-pandemic-is-accelerating-who-warns-of-dangerous-coronavirus-phase-video&quot;&gt;something to say&lt;/a&gt; that we all must hear, but they didn't get much coverage. We were all too busy focusing on Trump's shenanigans, as always. There should be a daily briefing with Dr Fauci, broadcast on all channels, treated as news, I don't care if he has to quit the government to do it. The WHO message is this -- the virus is spinning up to a new level, and it's going to cost us hugely to get it to quiet back down. This has to be said clearly and repeatedly with authority. In America the only one who can do that is Fauci. Without Trump, obviously. Maybe Wolf Blitzer, who clearly has a rapport with Fauci should take a leave from CNN to be his partner in this.</description>

So they had 800K signups, with room for only 19K fans. Only 4 million live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma&quot;&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. So the numbers were fishy. Even so the Trump campaign hyped them. They seem to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/06/20/trump-overflow-crowd-speech-phillip-sot-nr-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/a&gt; them. They must've wanted to. Ethan Zuckerman &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EthanZ/status/1274685979182485505&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it was activism, it was, and it's surprising how well it worked.</description>

			<description>The episode on &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/reviving-reconstruction/&quot;&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; of Radio Open Source is a must-listen, esp the interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberl%C3%A9_Williams_Crenshaw&quot;&gt;Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;. I got goosebumps listening to her, and at the end I was fistbumping &lt;i&gt;YES&lt;/i&gt; out loud on my bike ride. We are close to breaking through. The pandemic presents a huge opportunity for change that must not be wasted. Working together is required. I say something she didn't, white people will never know what it's like to be black, but we can work together, we must, we will.</description>

			<description>Today was the last Cuomo briefing, and the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/cuomo/&quot;&gt;Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrianbluestein/&quot;&gt;Richard Bluestein&lt;/a&gt; for doing the audio. Learned a lot from it, and also got to listen to some good leadership. I wonder who's going to fill the void. I hope the Democrats see there's a vacuum, maybe they could get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci&quot;&gt;Dr Fauci&lt;/a&gt; to do something like what the Governor was doing. Or a former head of the CDC? We need a trusted source of advice and scientific info to keep going. Not just in New York, but around the country, and elsewhere.</description>

			<title>The revolution will not be televised</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was very much active in politics when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Scott-Heron&quot;&gt;Gil Scott-Heron's&lt;/a&gt; 1971 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJFhuOWgXg&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The revolution will not be televised,&lt;/i&gt; was a hit. I just saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ToriNicksWho/status/1271581194602180608&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; where he explains the idea behind it.  Back then I liked the song, but it was scary. Maybe that's why I liked it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of blacks leading a revolution, when the images on TV were of violence and looting, was fear-inspiring. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party&quot;&gt;Black Panthers&lt;/a&gt; were fear-inspiring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=black+panthers&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03mZAaIwlnwjCIpODhnxfEyskr7aQ:1592572085234&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwihjK2r-Y3qAhUkSN8KHem2DGUQ_AUoAnoECBwQBA&amp;cshid=1592572121919779&amp;biw=1489&amp;bih=1165#imgrc=oT8EPDvkkW4OiM&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; that went with the song, for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look, there's no absolute truth to any of this, only points of view. It was much later in life that I came to see that blacks can be hippies. When I was young as far as I knew only white people smoked pot. Did I ever see a black person smile? Not that I recall. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember in 1980 on a beach in Jamaica, the only white person, and feeling really scared. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've come quite a ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ToriNicksWho/status/1271581194602180608&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago. Gil Scott-Heron is a friendly artistic dude. I didn't get that way back when. Listening to it many years later, I realize now the song probably wasn't intended for me, a 16-year-old white kid. But it reached people like me, and influenced our thinking, the way we felt about blacks and revolution. But it's not 1971, and it seems we've learned how to listen to each other better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Simpler server-side JavaScript</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I posted here and on Twitter this idea:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I‚Äôd like to do a new server-side JavaScript environment that‚Äôs compatible with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;, ie runs Node apps, no breakage, but it also eliminates the need for &lt;a href=&quot;http://callbackhell.com/&quot;&gt;callbacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/14/144017.html?title=javascriptPromisesVsCallbacks&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt; or async/await. I believe it‚Äôs technically possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend suggested using &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; to prototype this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I could imagine a modifier keyword on a function that means this function is internally going to do async things and calls to it should block until until it completes. That could be translated by a Babel plugin into somewhat that internally uses promises queuing to make callers wait for completion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the way to start. I wonder if anyone reading this has the expertise in Babel to make this work. I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/178&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; over in the repo to discuss.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will write up some code to demonstrate what the Babel plug-in will do, hopefully later today. Stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why try to simplify?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was asked on Twitter why I want this. There are all kinds of overhead, time, space, and intellectual. I program in a high level language instead of machine language because there's less intellectual overhead. It would save both time and space to use machine language. But I'm saving complexity by programming in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language&quot;&gt;HLL&lt;/a&gt;, and that means I can build more complex and useful software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why not just use promises, they're easy my correspondent asks. I say it's easier to not have to program something than use something that makes it easier to program. That's the philosophy of factoring. However the JavaScript I envision would be backward compatible with EC6. It would run any code that runs in Node. But it would also be able to process asynchronous functions with syntax that's as simple for a programmer as calling a synchronous function. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's any question that callbacks are something we'd like to simplify. &lt;i&gt;I'm saying it's possible to simplify callbacks by removing the need to use them for simple asynchronous I/O operations, yet give up none of the efficiency. &lt;/i&gt;Most other languages do it, so can JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's another reasons, transparency in APIs. For example, I might want to prototype a function by storing its data in memory, but at a later time may decide to store it on disk or on the net. I want to keep the interface unchanged, but with today's JavaScript you can't, you have to go to callbacks/promises/etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In general, the philosophy of factoring says you take a problem that you're solving over and over, and create a library of functions that do it, and call them instead of replicating the code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I was asked on Twitter why I want this. There are all kinds of overhead, time, space, and intellectual. I program in a high level language instead of machine language because there's less intellectual overhead. It would save both time and space to use machine language. But I'm saving complexity by programming in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language&quot;&gt;HLL&lt;/a&gt;, and that means I can build more complex and useful software." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:26:12 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142612"/>
				<source:outline text="Why not just use promises, they're easy my correspondent asks. I say it's easier to not have to program something than use something that makes it easier to program. That's the philosophy of factoring. However the JavaScript I envision would be backward compatible with EC6. It would run any code that runs in Node. But it would also be able to process asynchronous functions with syntax that's as simple for a programmer as calling a synchronous function." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:28:28 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142828"/>
				<source:outline text="I don't think there's any question that callbacks are something we'd like to simplify. &lt;i&gt;I'm saying it's possible to simplify callbacks by removing the need to use them for simple asynchronous I/O operations, yet give up none of the efficiency. &lt;/i&gt;Most other languages do it, so can JavaScript." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:58:27 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a145827"/>
				<source:outline text="There's another reasons, transparency in APIs. For example, I might want to prototype a function by storing its data in memory, but at a later time may decide to store it on disk or on the net. I want to keep the interface unchanged, but with today's JavaScript you can't, you have to go to callbacks/promises/etc." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:19:09 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a141909"/>
				<source:outline text="In general, the philosophy of factoring says you take a problem that you're solving over and over, and create a library of functions that do it, and call them instead of replicating the code." created="Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:20:15 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/18/141711.html?title=simplerServersideJavascript#a142015"/>

			<title>My two cents about Hey</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In an email to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;John -- A few things bother me about Hey.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They're doing what they say they don't like about Apple. If I want to make a product for their platform, something that does something different with their email, I can't even pay them 30% of revenue. I'm locked out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Email already means something, and having choice in clients is part of that. So maybe they shouldn't call it email, that might alleviate my concern.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's another Twitter. Five years from now people will get it. They're in a silo and there's no way out and no one can offer the features they offer without cloning the whole thing, which is kind of pointless, because the people you want to reach are still over there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This will definitely be a blog post. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also is there a non-hyped list of new features that aren't present in email? Not a marketing list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1273263575067492354&quot;&gt;PS&lt;/a&gt;: It's okay as far as I'm concerned to invent a new email protocol, and even have it be closed, but if others can't implement it, then we should know that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I did create a new Hey account, I'm davew. I like it, but hey what I actually want a really simple scripting interface so I could write my own rules without having to try to figure out how the user interfaces for rules work in Gmail or Hey or Ha or Hmm or Heh or Who or Whatever. Silly thing is I had exactly that a long time ago with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt; and Frontier and it worked exactly as well as you would think. I did all kinds of interesting web content apps with it. Email is a nice interface for web work. I bet you didn't know that. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>White people are never going to understand what it's like to be black. But we can listen, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html&quot;&gt;empathize&lt;/a&gt;, and try to do what they ask us to do to help. That would be success imho. Last night &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Melber&quot;&gt;Ari Melber&lt;/a&gt; asked a panel what victory looks like. It's a good idea for everyone to ask and answer that question. Let's find common goals and work together to achieve them. You have to figure out what needs to change to make America safe for blacks. We can help. One of the big lessons of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html&quot;&gt;1619 podcast&lt;/a&gt; was that the struggles of blacks for equality gave us all greater guarantees. This will happen again and again. But we must not waste the opportunity.</description>

			<title>Smells as a time machine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Smells are an incredible thing, a time machine, when you get a whiff of something from long ago, it reaches deep into your emotional memory and you experience the feelings from long ago, most deeply felt are the feelings of childhood and the people who raised me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, when I moved to NYC from California in 2010, when I went for a walk in the morning in Central Park, I'd get the smell of the woods and the morning dew, mixed with salt air of the ocean. It took me back to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5735409,-73.8634283,3a,75y,52.24h,89.64t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sH90kfd-HjSqxwYfJBxsdGQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DH90kfd-HjSqxwYfJBxsdGQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D44.51749%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;grandmother's house&lt;/a&gt; in Rockaway. She's long gone, the house isn't ours anymore, but the memory sure is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Morning smells here in the Catskills, where I live now, take me back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Copake,+NY+12516/@42.1092826,-73.5762083,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89dd867b736b3061:0x1ec908b2690186d1!8m2!3d42.1034549!4d-73.5499249&quot;&gt;summer camp&lt;/a&gt;.

The food they served that my mother never did. Butter on bread. What a revelation. We didn't eat butter at home. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Playing softball every day. Swimming. Canoeing. And most deep gratitude for the weekly care package from mom with home baked cookies and stories from home. I'm sure she put as much care into the packages as I did in savoring them. Until I experienced the summer smell of camp, here and now, at age 65, mom gone, I never recalled those packages. If I had I would have never doubted our bond. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We'll carpe some diems</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I read a post from my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/annamasera&quot;&gt;Anna Masera&lt;/a&gt; in Italy who was going out to eat at a real restaurant. Not outdoor seating. Inside. Then I realized how great it's going to be to re-experience all the things we took for granted just a few months ago. If we survive this it'll have been worth it from that standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're going to have some fun, yes we will. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every once in a while, Siri in my back pocket says &quot;Sorry I couldn't hear what you said.&quot; I didn't say anything. Or my Alexa says it doesn't recognize my voice, would I like to register. It was Andrew Cuomo talking in a YouTube video. Little unforseen consequences. It's like being in an episode of Westworld. I'm sure it's already happened that the two have had conversations, being confused about what the other said.</description>

			<description>I'd love to get a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neal_katyal&quot;&gt;Neal Katyal's&lt;/a&gt; study as he appeared yesterday on Ari Melber. It looks like the room of someone who spends all his time online and in his mind. I recognize it, I've existed in such a space as long as it's been possible. Also the interview with Fauci with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday which by luck I watched live. They've known each other a long time, clearly are friends. Blitzer asked him a personal question, Fauci answered. He said he spends all his time writing emails. He puts so much in, and he must have so much frustration, given how badly we're doing, and how he's prevented from speaking. I keep wondering if we, online media tech makers, couldn't do more to help him communicate, given the limits of TV.</description>

			<title>News has been unbundled</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a grad student, I'd grab a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://madison.com/ct/&quot;&gt;Capitol Times&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://madison.com/wsj/&quot;&gt;Wisconsin State-Journal&lt;/a&gt; and hang out at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/&quot;&gt;Memorial Union&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on the news, do the crossword or read the cartoons. The good old days in the 1970s.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd still want to hang out at the Union but I'd get out my laptop or iPad and read the news via Twitter and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/river/&quot;&gt;RSS river&lt;/a&gt;. Key difference: Today  no single publication delivers the full news experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Union &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60859-d4480969-Reviews-Memorial_Union_Terrace-Madison_Wisconsin.html&quot;&gt;terrace&lt;/a&gt; is where people meet in Madison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, they could have seen this happening, and done more to bind themselves to Twitter or RSS, or even produced their own hybrid and add their expertise as users of news. And if they had let it evolve it might have been, by now, a fantastic news reading and interacting experience, far better than what we use today. They didn't so this is where it's at now, an unbundled, √† la carte reading experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But today the news industry is still set up as a business as if I'm going to get my news the way I did in the 70s. And how are they going to convince me to do this? A paywall. The price for reading the article that's caught my eye is to give them my credit card and the right to charge me $10 per month for perpetuity. No. The answer is no. Always no. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many subscriptions the CEO of the Atlantic and Mother Jones have bought this way? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see a bar graph with online subscription revenue for the top 15 pubs. I imagine it looks something like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imaginary subscription revenue for top 15 pubs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a person who thinks about business models of news, ask yourself, how many subscriptions can one reader afford? Feel good about? Feel like they aren't being ripped off by? For me the answers to the three questions are: 3, 0 and 0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm paying about $30 per month for this, and am not happy about it. In contrast I pay &lt;i&gt;$200&lt;/i&gt; per month for TV. And I'm ready to spend more. But, get this, I spend a lot more time every day reading on the net. And I know the news orgs don't think very much of us readers, but I'm not reading crap, I'm learning, getting information about a lot of local stuff (despite the belief there is no local news, there is). And I can afford to pay much more than I am, I'm just waiting for some part of the news industry to wake up and realize it's not the 1970s anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I spend a lot more money on that might be closer to news is political campaigns. As Election Day approaches, I'm giving out $100 gifts to candidates to help save the world, the same way I would like to throw money at news orgs who help to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Subscriptions? I don't think so. I don't commit to vote for the governor or mayor beyond the next election. It sounds stupid to even put it that way. I'm sure the politicians would like that. And there are good arguments for it. But we get to choose again and again. And that's how I like it. It keeps them interested in communicating with me, maybe even slightly, to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read so many stories about how news orgs feel about their role, maybe it's time for the news orgs to try to find out how their readers see their roles? Basic business. Know the people who pay your bills and do things that delight them. Not much of that going on with news. Too much talking to be heard by other news people. I visualize it as two barbers passing the time cutting each others hair. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the news experience I want back in May.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I missed the anniversary again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#When:7:55:32AM&quot;&gt;18 years ago yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I quit smoking. The number of cigarettes I've had since, zero. Not one. Yet I still sometimes dream that I'm a smoker, buying packs of Marlboro Lights on the sly, feeling guilty that I'm lying to my friends when secretly I'm still a smoker. I quit smoking because the arteries on my heart were so clogged that they didn't work anymore. I had to get blood vessels from my legs and chest transplanted to bypass the blockages. These continue to work to this day, keeping me alive, riding my bike, writing software and blog posts that seem to make some people happy and piss other people off but are ignored by almost everyone. Makes sense. Anyway, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#smoking&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; on my blog a few days after I quit. &quot;I figured something out in the hospital. I'm the kind of person who likes to solve problems by smoking. How do I know this? Because every time my mind encounters a problem it says &quot;OK, I'll just have a cigarette then.&quot; I bet a lot of other cigarette smokers deal with problems the same way. Now that I don't smoke, I still have the idea that smoking will help me deal with problems. It's funny, one part of my brain has figured out that this is wrong (in fact smoking causes more problems than it solves) but a deeper part of my brain still believes it. This leads to some funny arguments inside my brain. But so far so good. I got to go through the worst of the withdrawal in a hospital where there was no possibility of smoking, and now the craving seems manageable. No doubt other people have smoking stories to tell. I was one of the lucky ones, I survived to tell my story. So far so good.&quot;</description>

			<source:outline text="I missed the anniversary again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#When:7:55:32AM&quot;&gt;18 years ago yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I quit smoking. The number of cigarettes I've had since, zero. Not one. Yet I still sometimes dream that I'm a smoker, buying packs of Marlboro Lights on the sly, feeling guilty that I'm lying to my friends when secretly I'm still a smoker. I quit smoking because the arteries on my heart were so clogged that they didn't work anymore. I had to get blood vessels from my legs and chest transplanted to bypass the blockages.

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/15/foreverAndPagepark.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how I merged &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever-monitor&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt;. A few weeks ago I did a podcast where I explained how the pieces &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/01.html#a204659&quot;&gt;came together&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier in the late 80s and early 90s. I was thinking about that then because a similar thing was happening with PagePark and Forever. I was putting the two together and had an aha moment where the pieces snapped together. PagePark has a very simple idea of what a website is, it's a sub-folder of the &lt;i&gt;domains&lt;/i&gt; folder. The name of the sub-folder is the domain that maps to that content. The aha was realizing that you could also put a Node app, to be managed by Forever, which is a package you can integrate into an app, in one of those folders too. Not only did it work at a technical level, but it also provides Frontier-like integration. It's very nice. I've been managing apps in this little world for a couple of weeks now.</description>

			<description>A random &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/15/ppCommandLineScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; for docs I'm writing. This is what a table for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/tree/master/cli&quot;&gt;command line tool&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for PagePark displays. It's equivalent to the table that Forever displays at the command line.</description>

			<description>I read that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is going to get rid of the concept of master for repositories because it's a reference to slavery. According to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;By default your repository has one branch named &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt; which is considered to be the definitive branch.&quot; A search of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+master&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt; finds a lot of uses of the word master. And in the rest of the world, there are master bedrooms and master's degrees. Courts appoint special masters. There are a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=master&quot;&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt; in the thesaurus.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/177&quot;&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; from yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/14/144017.html?title=javascriptPromisesVsCallbacks&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; is that adding promises to JavaScript wasn't much of a gain. Some people find promises more readable. There are some problems that are unwieldy with callbacks that are simpler with promises. There are already packages that have cast aside callbacks and only use promises in their APIs. If I need to use those packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/177#issuecomment-643828855&quot;&gt;I will use&lt;/a&gt; their promises-based API. No choice. My two cents. I wouldn't have supported this addition to the language. I much prefer tech that adds functionality in a clear understandable way. I would prefer if we could put our effort into (for example) making Dropbox work on Linux. Everywhere you look systems we depend on are in disrepair. It's like the way NYC worked when I was in high school. Burned out neighborhoods that people still live in. At some point you have to start thinking about the size and shape of the community you're serving and focus on making the language work better, not making it more complex. I still think there should be a JavaScript option to bury the synchronization functionality in the runtime, and let people write code in the natural way they do in pretty much every other language. Why JavaScript is different is something I've never heard a good answer to.</description>
