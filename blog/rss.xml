If you're closed, say you're open -- and let everyone debate whether you're scum or just an opportunist.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;You should be listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-countdown-with-keith-olbe-99705496/&quot;&gt;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt;. He's saying the things I've been thinking about the news, how the business really works, from the inside, the things they will never say on CNN or MSNBC. Plus he's incredibly funny. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the things he won't say about I Heart Radio, the company that owns his podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Clear+Channel&quot;&gt;Clear Channel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/clear-channel-communications-inc-history/&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; dominant force in broadcast radio and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=clear+channel+billboards&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZ39eBjyVCa1XTI5iai3tHDrUwBNQ:1662226537560&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiitrqylPn5AhUbGFkFHdqKDZUQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=1000&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;outdoor advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They would probably love to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, but they aren't so all their podcasts available &quot;where ever you get your podcasts,&quot; my favorite phrase that I will never get tired of hearing. (I own that, I made sure podcasts would be that way.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I Heart Radio hopes to stop saying that at some point. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how much they pay Olbermann or if it depends on whether they can lock it down?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All that said, listen while it's not behind a paywall, it's wonderful Golden Age of Podcasting stuff. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

I can't believe it's already September, on the other hand, it's freaking me out how cold it is this morning. I might have to put on a sweatshirt. It feels like summer just started. Maybe I need to move to Florida or Palm Springs. Oy. I love the mountains, but I dread the winter. Maybe it won't be so bad this year.</description>
