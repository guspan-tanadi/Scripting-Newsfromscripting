			<description>Another thing I heard but cannot place is that at one point Putin said he could buy anyone he wants. I wonder what would happen if Putin decided to talk to the people of the west, rather than rattling the cages of the people who own the west. Talk about a nuclear option.</description>

			<title>I'm flying blind about energy use</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's an idea of how to cut fuel consumption for electricity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My electric bill has been going up, dramatically. Not sure how much this is due to rising energy cost, or my purchase of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tesla&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; electric car last year, or something else. I use electricity for lots of things. More all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's the difference in cost between keeping the thermostat at 65 vs 60? Maybe it's insignificant, or maybe it's very significant. I have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have no tools to tell me what my electric consumption is graphed over time. If I did, I could for example, unplug the car and see how much the consumption goes down. Or turn down the thermostat to 60 and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who knows what my car is doing when I'm not watching? It has a mind of its own. Not like old cars that did nothing when they're turned off, my Tesla is always waking up and doing stuff. I bet that uses energy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of my devices is somehow malfunctioning and using a lot of energy and I could reduce consumption by replacing it, or leave it turned off unless I'm using it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all flying blind. Let's create the tools to optimize energy use. I bet it would save a lot of money and be a good way to cut energy consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reply to Jeff Jarvis</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeff Jarvis posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1500107275872133121&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about Ukraine on Twitter. My reply was too long to fit in a tweet, so I'm posting it here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read your whole thread, and agree -- it's confusing because norms are being busted now, norms of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction&quot;&gt;nuclear deterrent&lt;/a&gt; that has been present for all our lives. Putin went first. A nuclear superpower, which Russia is (which until now most seem to have overlooked), is not supposed to provoke another nuclear superpower so blatantly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin's complaint is he isn't getting the respect a nuclear superpower is entitled to. The expansion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO&quot;&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; into the former Warsaw Pact was insult #1, but that wasn't enough, NATO then added former states of the USSR. And that wasn't enough, the US promised to add Ukraine to NATO, as I understand it that was one of the final acts of the Bush II presidency, no one noticed here because we were obsessed with the financial collapse of 2008. This happened in a NATO meeting in Bucharest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I think the US and NATO sitting out the war in Ukraine is probably the right thing to do, because either way Ukraine is destroyed, and we're giving up a chance for politics in Russia to stop the next more provocative steps, if we were to intercede before Ukraine is settled. The sanctions will hurt, and I bet the Russians who care know what a debacle this has turned to. Why not take the chance that could work? If we go into the war in Ukraine, the war all of a sudden isn't the war with Ukraine, it's a war with the West. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I have a dream however unrealistic that Ukraine will defeat Russia, and then cross the border into Russia and take a few towns and maybe destroy them just to send a message to the Russian people that Putin is bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

At first you think okay I can understand that. But why should he care. We had Cuba 90 miles away from Florida for decades, they were a client of the USSR, and were spreading revolution all through Latin America, which according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine&quot;&gt;Monroe Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; was our sphere of influence. We didn't like it, and we did try to invade Cuba, but in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion&quot;&gt;small way&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn't work and that was the end of that. So why does Putin care if Ukraine becomes part of NATO. So what if they don't like Russia. Russia isn't going to get invaded the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia&quot;&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa&quot;&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; did. Why would they bother dealing with all the mud and the ferocious Russian soldiers. Why not just hurl a few nukes at them. I think we all know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340&quot;&gt;World War III&lt;/a&gt; will be fought with nukes. So what's the point in Putin owning Ukraine? Why not just launch some nukes at us. That's where this is headed, right? I'd love to see someone sit down with Putin, like a therapist, and work this out with him. What would his dream outcome be? What would make him feel like he won? This is all so confusing. The basic premise of the nuclear age was that something like this can't happen.</description>

			<title>Evolution in software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've figured out something about evolution and how it relates to software, and I think it's time to try to write it up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It goes back to a puzzling statement made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt; in his Cosmos series. He said that human eyes evolved when our ancestors were fish and thus are designed to see under water, and don't work nearly as well in the air. You might think that evolution would fix that, but it doesn't work that way. Evolution never goes back. Evolution never fixes a mistake. We just muddle through somehow with what we have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm not a biologist so I can only guess why it works that way, maybe someone reading this is more savvy and will correct me. Basically evolution can't revise the design of our eyes because to do so would require a mutation that has no eyes, so it could re-evolve eyes the way the first fishes did. But that eye-less animal, which no doubt has existed, would have to have a survival advantage over humans with eyes, even the flawed ones we have, but such a creature would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a survival advantage. So we're stuck with our inferior fish-evolved eyes. I think that explains why evolution can't fix past mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I came across something I posted on Facebook a few years ago, imagining that a programmer from the 80s had time-traveled to the 2020s and wondered why we used such crappy writing tools, when in the 80s we had a remarkable variety of excellent writing tools. In evolution terms here's my theory of what happened, and I admit I'm vastly simplifying this, I know a lot more about it because I lived through it, and made software in this period, and until recently was puzzled why some ideas took off and other good ideas did not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the early 90s a technological asteriod hit the software world called the web and wiped out all the GUI apps. To access the new network (the asteroid) all you needed was a web browser. And that was all that survived from the desktop operating systems of the 80s. The server operating system, Unix, came to dominate because it had the networking that the new world evolved from. The creatures from the network survived, the ones that lived on GUIs did not. To the animals that lived in UnixWorld, the web looked pretty amazing. But they liked their editors, and didn't see the need for anything more. Further, the desktop writing tools couldn't do the things a Unix programmer needed to do. So they just kept using the ones that came with Unix, Emacs and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Evolution could have taken a different path in regards to eyes and writing tools. If the first life evolved on land, our eyes would see much better in air. If the Macintosh developed open and easy networking as Unix had, making the switch to the web unnecessary, ad we could have kept using all our wizzy writing tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it seems obvious now why some of my ideas caught on and others didn't. For example, the idea of editing a website in a browser, something I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, an idea that evolved into blogging, then Twitter and Facebook and all the other stuff we edit in browsers or browser-like environments (iOS and Android). That thread had a long life. But editing a blog in a word processor or outliner, for example PageMill or FrontPage, desktop apps which everyone thought would be used, didn't go anywhere. They weren't of the web, so it wasn't continuous with the Unix philosophy, they were part of the species that were wiped out by the asteroid, even though they came about after the asteroid hit. The ecosystem they depended on was no longer viable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, much more powerful programming and runtime environments were possible, but didn't catch on like Python and JavaScript et al, again because they weren't of-Unix. Even if they borrowed big ideas from Unix but were still tied into the GUI philosophy, that made them unusual, not on the mainline of evolution. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The general rule is this, you can't go back in time and redo a decision. What's done is done. Build on the stuff people use and your ideas have a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I've figured out something about evolution and how it relates to software, and I think it's time to try to write it up." created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:40:35 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware#a134035"/>
				<source:outline text="It goes back to a puzzling statement made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt; in his Cosmos series. He said that human eyes evolved when our ancestors were fish and thus are designed to see under water, and don't work nearly as well in the air. You might think that evolution would fix that, but it doesn't work that way. Evolution never goes back. Evolution never fixes a mistake. We just muddle through somehow with what we have." created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:40:53 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware#a134053"/>
				<source:outline text="Now I'm not a biologist so I can only guess why it works that way, maybe someone reading this is more savvy and will correct me. Basically evolution can't revise the design of our eyes because to do so would require a mutation that has no eyes, so it could re-evolve eyes the way the first fishes did. But that eye-less animal, which no doubt has existed, would have to have a survival advantage over humans with eyes, even the flawed ones we have, but such a creature would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a survival advantage. So we're stuck with our inferior fish-evolved eyes. I think that explains why evolution can't fix past mistakes." created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:44:01 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware#a134401"/>
				<source:outline text="Then I came across something I posted on Facebook a few years ago, imagining that a programmer from the 80s had time-traveled to the 2020s and wondered why we used such crappy writing tools, when in the 80s we had a remarkable variety of excellent writing tools. In evolution terms here's my theory of what happened, and I admit I'm vastly simplifying this, I know a lot more about it because I lived through it, and made software in this period, and until recently was puzzled why some ideas took off and other good ideas did not." created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:45:49 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware#a134549"/>
				<source:outline text="In the early 90s a technological asteriod hit the software world called the web and wiped out all the GUI apps. To access the new network (the asteroid) all you needed was a web browser. And that was all that survived from the desktop operating systems of the 80s. The server operating system, Unix, came to dominate because it had the networking that the new world evolved from. The creatures from the network survived, the ones that lived on GUIs did not. To the animals that lived in UnixWorld, the web looked pretty amazing. But they liked their editors, and didn't see the need for anything more. Further, the desktop writing tools couldn't do the things a Unix programmer needed to do. So they just kept using the ones that came with Unix, Emacs and the like." created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 14:08:40 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware#a140840"/>

The combination of the Echo-Dot and the Audioengine speakers is sweet. Very little hardware but the sound is incredible. I installed Alexa on my new iPhone, and can now make music play near the Peloton any time, which I do, just for the sheer power of it. I have three Echos in the house. And now thanks to Alexa on the iPhone I can make any of them &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/03/fartsOverEcho.png&quot;&gt;fart&lt;/a&gt; at any time, or all of them even. I think back to my primitive networking experiments at UW in the 70s (favorite was Bells-For-All) and realize I've looped all the way back to that, except instead of bells I can now have farts too. And just thinking out loud, I would have thought farts would a prohibited word like fucks. But we're allowed to use it in polite company with kids around. (Of course all kids love farts.) So the world has become more democratic too! And they say the Boomers were the good-for-nothing generation. Keep on truckin.</description>

			<description>I cruised through the first season of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=raised%20by%20wolves&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and the first four episodes of Season 2. But then I caught up and I'm waiting a week for every new episode, and this show doesn't work well that way. It's too complicated, so many characters, and they keep adding new ones, there's too much to remember, and I never got caught up with the story before the last episode was over. They're making different kinds of shows now, and the one episode per week style of distribution often doesn't work. For a show like Rick &amp; Morty, fine. I don't even know if there's any continuity between episodes. The characters talk about the season, the fourth wall is often permeable in that show, but I don't care. The shows stand alone too. Some series, like the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Counterpart&lt;/a&gt; are completely unwatchable except by watching one season immediately after the other. I found the second season impossible to follow after the hiatus. Also if the show had a great runner in the first season don't bother with another season unless the same runner is still doing it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=killing%20eve&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt; is the example. The third season was crap. There's a fourth one out now. Not planning on watching it.</description>

			<description>The thing that's so cool is how much the fans love Freddie Mercury. That's because, unlike a lot of musical performers and other kinds of leaders, he knows they're there and includes them in the performance. If you want to be a big hit and have your fans love you, you have to do that. Let them in on the fun.</description>

Count the number of steps it takes to get to a folder you need to get to all the time. A simple bookmark facility could reduce that to one step. Amazon if you'd like help with the design, I've learned a lot about it. My rates are reasonable. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I was thinking of being a poli sci major. When they got around to polling, it was made clear was you could get people to say whatever you want by how you asked the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example if they asked this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. Do you think Americans should support the president in times of war, regardless of party? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2.
