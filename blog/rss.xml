			<description>Unix question. Suppose I have a Node app running in the background. Is there a way to send CLI-type commands to the app while it's running? Or do I need to write a small app to communicate with it?</description>

			<description>Here's the news experience I want. As I read Twitter or my &lt;a href=&quot;http://river6.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;, and I see an article I want to read, I click the link. I get a preview and a price. Click the button and I pay the price, read the article. No spyware, no ads, nice big font. It's in my story list so I can go back and re-read it any time. This requires a centralized payment system, it could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.com/&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt; or something similar to it. The tech is not a problem, the problem is the news orgs giving users what they want. Now questions come up -- what's the price? The news orgs set the price. They have to experiment. They could run specials. They could drop the price to $0 after a story has reached a certain threshold, giving readers a further incentive, to help a story they think is important to circulate. Lots of possibilities. We should get on this train asap.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1590698591000&quot;&gt;Bug fix release of LO2&lt;/a&gt;. For a new user, one who has never logged onto LO2 before, there was a problem with the initialization code that creates your first outline. It's possible that you would get a blank screen instead of a new outline. Not a very good user experience. It should be fixed now. If you had previously tried to create an account and failed, it might be a good time to try again. If it works. please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1266109713667821588&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I got lots of good suggestions for yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/173&quot;&gt;prior art search&lt;/a&gt;, but no one had advice on getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/27.html#a183347&quot;&gt;iPhone to update&lt;/a&gt;. And then the problem got even worse. As I was about to go out for my afternoon ride, my iPhone informed me that it had disabled Bluetooth for everything but my AppleWatch. No explanation of why it decided to do this. On my way out, with no music or podcasts to fill my mind, I thought how ridiculous it was that I had spent over $1000 on this device and I still don't own it. Apple says &quot;I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.&quot; They should change the name of the company to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE&quot;&gt;Hal&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Journalism has to take chances</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was an entrepreneur in my youth.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've never stopped thinking like one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalism needs to be entrepreneurial. And that means taking risks. And challenging your assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a resolution that &quot;micropayments&quot; don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't like the term either, because I was thinking of giving them large amounts of money. I like to splurge. I like making impulse purchases. I like voting with dollars, but...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a user, I don't trust subscriptions. It's incredibly hard to change your mind. How many times have you found out that you have to jump through endless hoops to cancel a subscription. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A subscription is a commitment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to date before we get married. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, every time I try to start a discussion about this, the users agree, and the journalists that show up tell me why they don't have to to listen to scum like me. It really feels like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They have to take chances. That's the way of business. And money and business are kind of the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The biggest chance they have to take is recognizing that their users are sentient and smart and are good people who they are not treating very well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This started as an email to my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, but I could hear myself saying -- why are you saying this just to him, say it to the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've tried all the things the recommend, to no avail. Do you know what it means? I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; don't want to reformat the phone.</description>

			<description>I picked a good time to leave the city for the country -- March 2019. Just enough time to get established. I don't think I would have done very well in a 1-bedroom apartment in the middle of Manhattan.</description>

			<description>Old TV shows had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track&quot;&gt;laugh track&lt;/a&gt; that simulated audience applause and laughter. This was before they started recorded sitcoms in front of a live audience. As a little kid, I thought they must have little microphones in the TVs, maybe only some of them (not mine of course) and they could pick up the sounds made by people at home. The laugh track and other audience sounds were real, little Dave imagined. So you gotta wonder why they don't do actually that for &lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/2020/05/27/sports-poll-fans-prefer-natural-sound-in-telecasts/&quot;&gt;live sports events&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming seasons for basketball, baseball, hockey, football, etc -- when there won't be any fans in the stadiums and arenas. You could even pipe the audience sounds into the venue so the players can experience them. The technology is totally up to it. Why not have some fun with it?</description>

			<description>BTW, what do you think the odds are that one of the sports players contracts Covid-19 during these new experimental seasons. I figure it's a near-certainty. And what happens then? Do they keep playing?</description>

			<title>Where did RSS come from?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ejoep/status/1265522849973927940&quot;&gt;Joe Pezillo says&lt;/a&gt; he's pretty sure Dave Winer (me) got the idea for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; from Newton. He's also pretty sure I won't admit it. He's wrong on the first count, and right on the second. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a tweet that was too long to fit in 280 chars that lists the steps that led to what we think of as RSS today. It wasn't an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/11/didYouInventRss.html&quot;&gt;invention&lt;/a&gt; as most people think of invention, it was more of a synthesis, one idea leading to another and then another. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It started with seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/14/cnnonyourdesktop.html&quot;&gt;Pointcast&lt;/a&gt;, being blown away by the idea. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/11/25/Thanksgiving1997.html#4&quot;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft wanted me to do something with XML, so I turned my &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11&quot;&gt;blog into a feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then Netscape reinvented what I did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I said OK let's do it your way. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then someone leaked the XML feeds for the NYT to me.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then I repurposed them and published them so people could use them from Radio UserLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then they shut me down (they were nice about it). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html&quot;&gt;let me have them&lt;/a&gt; for free.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then we &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/how-the-ny-times-came-to-support-rss/&quot;&gt;turned&lt;/a&gt; them into &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then RSS took off like a bat out of hell! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And thus was born what we now think of as RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who lives in Manhattan and has made it through the last few months without going completely crazy deserves a prize.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/nyregion/amy-cooper-dog-central-park.html&quot;&gt;Karen story&lt;/a&gt; with the off-leash dog in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ramble_and_Lake&quot;&gt;Ramble&lt;/a&gt;, an area I am familiar with, imho deserves a second chance. Wouldn't that be great if out of the virus we learned to forgive. Give her the dog and the job back and accept her apology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As someone who used Central Park when I lived in the city, the rules are broken a lot, my peeves were no smoking and no bike riding on the walking paths. Two rules I felt strongly about, as the man did about off-leash dogs interfering with birding in the Brambles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A lot of NYers, even when they aren't stressed by isolation, act in a way that might look insane to someone not from NY, when you say they've violated the rules governing use of space. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And NYers are sensitive to those rules being broken because there is so little space. It's kind of a powder keg that way, even in normal times. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She did something awful, but it doesn't rise to the level that requires her life to be destroyed. I think it would be good for all of us if we perhaps just this once practiced forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The user experience of news sucks. I remember how software exploded when we put the focus on ease-of-use. News people underestimate the power of happy users.</description>

			<description>Why is the only way news orgs will accept money from readers subscriptions? Before the net I could buy a single edition of a newspaper or magazine without a long term commitment.</description>

			<description>The idea of a self-contained news product you subscribe to is a vestige of the way news used to be distributed. Now, in my Twitter timeline, or RSS &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/26/riverScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;, I see links to stories all over the place.

			<title>GitHub, platform for time capsules</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft owns GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I post a project to GH, I'm hoping I'm preserving that work for a long time. As long as MS exists? Would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something MS could market. Think of the repos at GH as time capsules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tech can be imaginative. Like this. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Chad Tolkien &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/c_tolkien/status/1265381771572469760&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://archiveprogram.github.com/&quot;&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt; on it, but it's only for some projects. So it's going to have a Microsoft bias. Oy. I want to send my stuff into the future so they can use it as prior art for the software they'll be doing then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Bug reports, not pull requests</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Basic philosophy: If you spot a mistake, I want to know about it so I can fix it. Always.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now here's the background: I share most of the software I write as open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes people report bugs by submitting &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests&quot;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn't work out very well because I write my code in an outliner, and it generates the JavaScript code from the outline. So what you see as source on GitHub actually isn't what I edit. I couldn't accept a pull request to the generated code. It would just be wiped out the next time I made a change to the outline and re-generated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the best thing to do when you spot a mistake is flag it as an issue in the repo, point to the code in question if that's helpful, and I'll thank you and make the fix myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/24.html#a180909&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I really liked Season 2 of Homecoming. I noted that it's based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/shows/homecoming/episodes&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; from Gimlet of the same name. I've started to listen to that. It's also very good. I like the whole thing. I think finally I'm going to have to re-watch Season 1 on Amazon, to complete the experience.</description>

I don't particularly care for that approach, I think honor and modesty are traits that should apply regardless of gender. We have the president we deserve. We're the country that went to war without a draft, whose citizens got tax cuts while at war, whose citizens expect more of that, to us it's never enough. We expect to be able to inflict chaos around the world and somehow never to be touched by it ourselves. That's why people are out partying with abandon this weekend. They can't imagine they can pay a price. There's a reason Vietnam is responding to the virus so incredibly well and we're responding so poorly. They remember fighting for their independence. To us, independence is a birth right. A distant memory that's become perverted. We have to fight for it again. The virus is giving us that chance. We can't get out of the pandemic until we grow up as individuals and collectively. Trump is the right president for who we are. We won't get a better one until we deserve a better one.</description>

			<description>Taking it easy today, not much writing or programming. The weather has turned gorgeous, real upstate NY summer weather. After a long winter and an even longer almost-spring, including snow on May 9, and a pandemic, it's pretty ecstatic weather, luxurious, great-to-be-alive type weather. It's the contrasts that make the eastern part of the US so much more livable than the west, say I, a native son of the east who spent many years in the west.</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homecoming_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;second season&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/homecoming-season-2-review.html&quot;&gt;Homecoming&lt;/a&gt; is out, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085SW2PFQ/?ref=dvm_us_dl_sl_go_ast_522HO|m_2aaNnzkwc_c436988553276&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwtqj2BRBYEiwAqfzur97nIZDGWdlC1jUutPGDdtug_T52f__inue8ztQOoGDGkQsFlYfKrBoCP3oQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I started it the other night instead of watching the news. I had forgotten most of the plot of the first season, I remember liking it, but it didn't leave much of an impression. The second season is nicely done, has a Mr Robotish feel, there's a constant stream of twists and surprises, it's fun and so far intellectually gratifying, and it reviews the plot of season 1 as it goes. We have an inkling of how it will end because the first episode is about how it ends, or so we are led to believe. I don't know otherwise because I still have a few episodes to go. But nothing in this show is a straight line, and as I said it's well done. I especially like the end of each episode. They end with a twist, but they stay wtih the scene as the credits roll. I had not seen this technique before.</description>

			<description>Opening churches could flush out the last of Trump's  supporters who'd be ok if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue. The key assumption was that he was shooting someone else, not them.

A silver lining to the pandemic is the only way out of it is to cut the level of insanity to zero and start acting according to science. There is no other way out of it, assuming you don't want to bet exclusively on a miracle. Either we stay collectively insane, we'll all get the virus, sooner than later, and a shitload of us will die, and the survivors will have a new Dark Ages. If we could only apply the objective brainpower to this problem that we do to a sports game like football or basketball. There is a winning strategy but it requires teamwork.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The latest save my life &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/534/just-this-breath&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; (must-read) makes me wonder how to listen to people we support.

And how can we help?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The author wasn't able to convey her condition to the first doctor over the phone. I wanted to know how the doctor could do better. Also how the doctor could have made a difference when there was no treatment, at the time -- not sure if there's treatment possible now, even.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's about more than science.

			<title>Node deprecates request</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a technical post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The three words in the title of the post are noun, verb and subject. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular developer platform with set of common libraries called packages. It's based on JavaScript which is a very popular language. And its power comes from the very deep set of freely usable code you can build on. That part is the reason why I switched to JavaScript in 2013. I wanted to tap into the work of all the other developers using Node. That it was JavaScript was incidental, and honestly the Node platform had nothing to do with it, because at the time I switched I had little idea what it was.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techterms.com/definition/deprecated&quot;&gt;deprecates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a word that platform vendors use when they are going to break the implicit promise that the platform you're developing on is stable. The word &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; implies stability. The fact that platform vendors can do this is one main reason we like to work with open source software, because if we don't agree with what they're doing, we don't have to go with them, which hopefully means they'll be less willing to break us.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is possibly the most used package in Node. I'm not sure. But since Node is used to make servers and one thing servers do a lot of is call other servers to get information, and request is pretty much the only way to do that, you'd have to say even if it isn't the most popular package, it certainly is one of the most important. If you were to remove request almost all Node apps would break. And that is exactly what they're doing. It won't work. I'm sure of it. And they don't know it yet. But they'll find out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A couple of stories to go with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Back in the late 90s when we were working on a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we were generating a lot of new routines for developers to call. We had packages of routines called suites, and as we were generating them we didn't know which package an individual routine would go in when the new version was finalized. So we created a temporary package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+toys&quot;&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt;, disclaimed it would be deprecated before we shipped. We gave it a silly name so people would remember it was doomed. I said to devs, don't depend on anything in toys being there after we ship. Well, as promised, when it came time to ship, we sorted all the routines in toys to their permanent homes and deleted toys. Everything broke. Everything. The outcry was so loud and angry that we put toys back. The lesson is this, when you ship something to developers you're stuck with it, so be sure you can live with it when you ship. You have to live with your mistakes too. Clearly the Node developers think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; is a mistake. Well tough shit, you have to live with it. Sorry I didn't make the rules. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave Gandy's company makes a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. It's great. When it came out I knew I was going to use it. I had even been asking someone to do what it does. Anyway, when they came out with a new version, they broke lots of stuff. The conventional wisdom was if the new version is a &quot;full point release,&quot; like you're going from version 4 to 5, you can break whatever you want. Well it was a huge setback for Font Awesome and it got users (like me) to fear upgrading to new versions. If they want to improve their product, Dave and his company learned, they would have to add functionality, they can never take functionality out. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/16.html#a180941&quot;&gt;wrote it up&lt;/a&gt; in February of this year, which feels like a decade ago! :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At UserLand we came up with the fundamental rule, so fundamental that we called it Rule 1. It was this: Don't break users. There's nothing more sacred in the relationship between platform vendors and the devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So with all that background, I wonder what the Node platform vendor thinks we should use in place of request? To make it as smooth as possible it should just &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; request, of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

					<source:outline text="Back in the late 90s when we were working on a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we were generating a lot of new routines for developers to call. We had packages of routines called suites, and as we were generating them we didn't know which package an individual routine would go in when the new version was finalized. So we created a temporary package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+toys&quot;&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt;, disclaimed it would be deprecated before we shipped. We gave it a silly name so people would remember it was doomed. I said to devs, don't depend on anything in toys being there after we ship. Well, as promised, when it came time to ship, we sorted all the routines in toys to their permanent homes and deleted toys. Everything broke. Everything. The outcry was so loud and angry that we put toys back. The lesson is this, when you ship something to developers you're stuck with it, so be sure you can live with it when you ship. You have to live with your mistakes too. Clearly the Node developers think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; is a mistake. Well tough shit, you have to live with it. Sorry I didn't make the rules. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 23 May 2020 17:02:23 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/23/165637.html?title=nodeDeprecatesRequest#a170223"/>
					<source:outline text="Dave Gandy's company makes a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;. It's great. When it came out I knew I was going to use it. I had even been asking someone to do what it does. Anyway, when they came out with a new version, they broke lots of stuff. The conventional wisdom was if the new version is a &quot;full point release,&quot; like you're going from version 4 to 5, you can break whatever you want. Well it was a huge setback for Font Awesome and it got users (like me) to fear upgrading to new versions. If they want to improve their product, Dave and his company learned, they would have to add functionality, they can never take functionality out. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/16.html#a180941&quot;&gt;wrote it up&lt;/a&gt; in February of this year, which feels like a decade ago! :-)" created="Sat, 23 May 2020 17:06:03 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/23/165637.html?title=nodeDeprecatesRequest#a170603"/>

				<source:outline text="At UserLand we came up with the fundamental rule, so fundamental that we called it Rule 1. It was this: Don't break users. There's nothing more sacred in the relationship between platform vendors and the devs." created="Sat, 23 May 2020 17:07:45 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/23/165637.html?title=nodeDeprecatesRequest#a170745"/>
				<source:outline text="So with all that background, I wonder what the Node platform vendor thinks we should use in place of request? To make it as smooth as possible it should just &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; request, of course. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 23 May 2020 17:08:34 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/05/23/165637.html?title=nodeDeprecatesRequest#a170834"/>

			<description>New version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/publicfolder#readme&quot;&gt;publicFolder&lt;/a&gt;, a Node app that runs on your desktop and keeps an Amazon S3 location in sync with a folder on a local disk. It's available as an NPM package and an Electron app. I use it to publish this.how, and am starting to use it in place of Dropbox. Much lighter weight, and I have all the source (and so do you).</description>

			<description>I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Forester&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt;. Nice car. But every so often the rear door refuses to open. Three beeps. So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=subaru+forester+open+rear+gate&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=subaru+forester+open+rear+gate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l6j69i61.12667j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt;, have trouble finding an answer. So confusing, they talk about buttons my car doesn't seem to have. Anyway it turns out if you hold the touch point for six seconds it'll open the rear door. Software glitch of some kind. From then on it works as normal. Wonder what the logic is. If it has the means to reset itself why doesn't it just reset itself without me having to jump through hoops?</description>
