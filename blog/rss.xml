I agree with all you said, had discovered it on my own, quickly -- that I could build on Mastodon's docs (and did), but the ActivityPub maze of specs is not an API, and not something a busy developer can approach. It all has to be simplified. We're still far away from the dream. As I said in my open voicemail -- it's time for developers to do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html&quot;&gt;BDG&lt;/a&gt; for the social web, with docs &lt;i&gt;and software, &lt;/i&gt;that embraces not just Mastodon and other ActivityPub services, but also Bluesky, and WordPress, which has a very mature API, offers stability, a foundation with clear value.</description>

			<description>In general, if there's a change in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, you want to be sure you're getting the latest client software. Normally the browser caches the code, but you can force it to get the latest versions. In Chrome/Mac with Cmd-Shift-R. Obviously it's different in different browsers.</description>

			<description>There was a problem in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sally.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Sally's Reader&lt;/a&gt; that only showed up on some machines, having to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt; permissions. I think I've worked around it, so it should work everywhere, one hopes.</description>

			<description>As we are fond of saying in show business, this is a test. Had this been an actual emergency, well we would have found some other way of notifying you, because this is hardly the way to tell a fine person such as yourself about an emergency. I hope all is well with you and yours and have a nice day! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Confusing enough that I thought where did I put that tab with the tweet I'm quoting in it. In the meantime, someone ought to grab the trademark MuskCo is abandoning. It's hard to express how valuable it is, the words twitter and tweet are in the everyday language of everyone. It might be the most valuable thing Musk owns. Even the Tesla name is nowhere near as deeply entrenched. I hesitate to say it's a bad decision because I've been proven wrong so many times. But my brain doesn't like what he's done. That one person has so much power over me, I don't like to be reminded of that either.</description>

			<description>I've spent the last week trying to do my normal development work on a laptop. And at the end of the week, I'm kind of getting the hang of it. The secret is to use Dropbox again, not just to manage servers (as I have been, but am transitioning away from because Dropbox on Linux is unwieldy), but to keep several editing places in sync without too much chance for error. This morning I lost some changes I made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/264&quot;&gt;Sally's Reader&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a really simple app, and not very mission critical, yet, so it was easy to re-do the changes. But that got me thinking about how to get it to work more smoothly and reliably. I've had various systems over the years for this, and it'll be interesting to do it again. Luckily all the saving and opening of projects flows through two scripts, and I wrote them both, and they work very reliably. So I'll add some features, already am doing that. Feels good actually, didn't think it would.</description>

			<description>Journalists are concerned that replacing them with AI writers would make the news less trustworthy.  On the planet I live on, when I read a news story about something I know about it's filled with bullshit and lies, ones that could easily be corrected, but they just copy what they found on Wikipedia. Thus I am pretty sure that stories about stuff I don't know about are filled with similar bullshit. On those same subjects, ChatGPT gets it just as wrong, probably because the bot is relying on the same Wikipedia article that had the original lies in it. If journalism really wants people to have to truth, try giving it to them instead of complaining about how your jobs are in jeopardy.</description>

He says basically everyone should get behind it and stop inventing new formats and protocols for the federated social web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Without any judgment, it seems to me that ActivityPub should have started with RSS 2.0, building whatever new features they needed on top of it. But they didn't. I don't know why. We were going down that path, but then one day I saw that all the people I was collaborating with were meeting with Google and out of that came a completely incompatible protocol, which I believe became ActivityPub. Not sure, because they seemed more interested in reinventing what already worked than trying to build as much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really mean &quot;no judgment&quot; -- because this seems to happen in tech all the time. It's the knee-jerk reaction. People wanting to make a name for themselves, don't have a new idea, so they pretend that what already exists doesn't. Let the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/19.html&quot;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; sort it out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think it's inevitable that there will be more protocols. There already are. So what will be needed is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/142200.html&quot;&gt;analog of the internet&lt;/a&gt;, which bridged the differences between incompatible networks. I think at this point that's the best we can hope for. And in that spirit I offer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; which did that for blogs. Maybe for once we won't have to start over from scratch. I doubt it, but hope is still possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, before you pat me on the head and thank me for &quot;fighting the good fight&quot; (which I hear as &quot;loser&quot;) remember this one motto: You can fake caring but you can't fake showing up. Put some skin in the game. You've been sitting on the sidelines your whole life. If you think we can make the new network useful and fair and learn from our mistakes and experience, get in the middle. There's no point accumulating capital if you never spend it. Now is a good time to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

These people are beyond stupid. Why don't they take a minute to think about how you develop a new medium. Is it done by adding a few sentences to a spec? I don't think so. You get an idea, in this case it came from Adam Curry (thanks) and start figuring out how it will work. Then you make the software for both publishing and listening, and then publish Grateful Dead music, thinking all the people will now figure it out but they don't. So you try something else and another thing, and you give up for a while. Then you meet an NPR guy and ask him if he wants to try this idea out. For some reason he says yes, when everyone else said no or didn't listen. So you get that going, and it's great and for sure you figure now everyone will get it, but they don't. So a year later in frustration you decide to put out your own show, and do it again and again, and leave the freaking mistakes in, and because of that people get the idea that Hey if that schmuck can do it, I bet I can too, and 20 or 30 people start doing it, and it's fun, and from there, it builds and after four years you have the start of a new medium. And no that idiot journalist did not give this new medium its name.

You can stop reporting that it set records.

The thing you should say about Bluesky is that it's freaking nice that these people made a nice UI and backend for the social web and give it away for nothing. Yay Bluesky for believing in all of us. And come on if you think moderation is so great and you think it can be done for free, why don't you volunteer to do it. Yeah I didn't think so.</description>

They have an architecture for more instances, but now that we've gotten a look at what federation is like in practice with Mastodon and ActivityPub, I don't look forward to the same idea around Bluesky. Which is where the bind is, because that means that Bluesky, like Twitter and Facebook, would have to take on moderation and will get a lot of grief if they don't do it to people's liking. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3k2jrmmygel2w&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I don't think they or anyone else can afford to stand against abuse on the web, it's diseconomic. People don't pay for the service, and there's an infinite supply of abuse. You know how when they add a new lane to a freeway thinking it'll ease traffic but doesn't? imho it's the same kind of thing. I do think there's hope for small social nets with dozens or maybe hundreds of users, and let Facebook have the monster social nets, they more or less have found a way to make moderation pay. I've written about this idea a lot, filed under the phrase &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=fractional+horsepower+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;</description>

It was fairly painless, but it did break some pages. If you have an &lt;i&gt;img&lt;/i&gt; element in the HTML or use the &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; attribute in OPML, and the url of the image is on HTTP, the browser will refuse to load it, and at least on Chrome it'll look like it's still loading for a long time, possibly forever. For most of these, I'll never get around to fixing them, it just is what it is. So HTTPS despite the hype, no matter whether you convert or not, still breaks the web, and Google must know all about this and doesn't care. If a platform vendor really cared about the web as a platform, they'd look at the risk in reading an img over http and say wtf, let it go. They're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt;, they have you by the balls, you know it and they know it.</description>

			<description>This bit of arcania has also crept into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. As you may know &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is now on HTTPS, it has to be because it's managing identity for itself, and if a feed item has an image only accessible over HTTP, the browser won't load it. I guess all feed readers have this problem, and I guess images from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; have always been broken? But this isn't how I remember it. Hmmm. Maybe they're doing something special, like accessing the image through a proxy running outside of Chrome's control. Haha if so &lt;i&gt;holy shit.&lt;/i&gt; Either it's a security problem or it isn't. I really don't think images need to be protected, but what do I know. In any case, from this point on, my images will be HTTPS too.</description>

			<title>Twitter approaches textcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Someday tweets will allow you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/07/15/chatgpt.html&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; web page on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You will be able to give a tweet a title.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can already style text bold or italic. They kind of snuck that in there quietly? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see them support Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can edit your tweets for up to an hour. That's pretty good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is basically checking off the boxes on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if their competitors are noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also a nice RSS feed coming out of Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let me enclose an MP3 for a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
