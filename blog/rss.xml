			<description>If you saw the last Trump town hall, a few weeks ago, you wouldn't be so mad at NBC. He doesn't like questions from voters. He can't call them fake news. I don't think it'll help him.</description>

			<title>My Borgen review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fborgen&quot;&gt;Borgen&lt;/a&gt; last night. Three &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70302482&quot;&gt;seasons&lt;/a&gt;, and I would love to watch the fourth season right now. As I do my work this morning, my mind keeps drifting back to how the last season ends. How the conflicts get resolved, and the questions that are left unanswered. Every character is about to embark on something new. But they got there by stretching themselves, taking a risk, and coming out okay. Not perfectly, they pretty much all got hurt, but in the end they more or less have a clean slate, lots of possibilities, and I wonder what's next.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You end up loving them. They bare their souls to you. You see them weak, and dealing with it. To pull that off, in TV, is pretty amazing. And that all that comes through from reading titles in a Danish-language show. The characters at times switch into perfect British-accented English, mainly because they're doing something international. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No spoilers, so I can't tell you the roles the various characters play, but I will say that this is sort of like the Danish equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt;, only more adult, and less &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=schmaltzy&quot;&gt;schmaltzy&lt;/a&gt;. The writing is very good, but it's not Aaron Sorkin, and that's neither a plus or minus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also have an English-dubbed version. I tried that at first, but the subtitles were for the Danish version, and there are differences. I prefer shows, even in English, that have subtitles. I think dubbing is generally cheesy, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After finishing it, I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my BingeWorthy page&lt;/a&gt; and changed the rating from Loved to Best, the top rating. If you have the time, and can read titles, I would put this on my watchlist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Usually when we're watching a travesty happen in Washington, a gun massacre, starting a war, giving money to the rich, there isn't much we can do but say &quot;Remember to vote two years from now.&quot; This time everyone gets to stick it to the Repubs in real time.</description>

			<description>Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/10/13/a-new-way-to-publish-your-blog-posts-simultaneously-as-twitter-threads/amp/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for shipping their twitter-threader tool. It gives me something to compare my software to. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Little Pork Chop%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt; back in 2014. It was the one of the first Node-based web apps I shipped. A little thing I whipped up in a few days and finished while I was traveling in Europe. It was a lot of fun. After a while spammers found out about it, and used it to spray messages through accounts with no real followers, to influence some algorithm, presumably. Kind of humiliating. Now I'm ready to make it useful for people and not useful for spamming. I think. Also considering making it a personal tool for people to deploy on Glitch. I'm looking for something to put into that pot. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>PS: WordPress should do a tool that goes the other way. Lets you write a blog post in a series of tweets. I know that probably seems counter-intuitive, but I learned today a fair number of users don't like the new block editor. And Twitter is, these days, a fairly fluid writing tool</description>

			<description>I mostly write without typos, but they get introduced when I edit. I've noticed more typos than usual in the last few days. I think it's the changing of the seasons. Swimming is over until late spring. Still bike riding but some days it's too cold or wet, so I walk instead. And I'm no longer good at walking. This summer was the first time since I left California in 2003 that I was swimming every day. It's very good for me. And its absence is very unsettling. I thnk that's why I feel a bit off now.</description>

			<description>So here's a question for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davenewworld_2/status/1316398093877772288&quot;&gt;Trump supporters&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/republican-response-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;enjoy&lt;/a&gt; making &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libtard&quot;&gt;libtards&lt;/a&gt; cry. Do you think they're crying because you hurt their feelings? Is that what you're into? Do you also like to hurt yourself? Because the thing the libtard probably is crying about is how you're going to lose your health care, or job, or freedom, in other words how your injured dignity is going to hurt &lt;i&gt;even more.&lt;/i&gt; If you make me sad it isn't because you called me a name, it's because our once-great country has been reduced to jealousy as a popular form of political expression. I wish you were happier with your life, I really do, but I don't think trying to give your pain to others is actually going to make you feel better. I think if anything it'll make you feel worse.</description>

			<title>Theory about Georgia</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a theory why the Repubs are tanking in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least a few Republican voters in Georgia are pissed off about voter suppression of blacks. It might not be the final straw for a majority of Repubs, but it probably is for some.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is based on something I learned in software in 1984. We shipped ThinkTank for the Mac in April. One of the first products to ship for the Mac. How did we do it so fast? We left out a lot of features, figuring we're getting a fresh start on the Mac. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knew what ThinkTank could do on the Apple II and IBM PC, and they felt ripped off that the ThinkTank they bought for the Mac was less capable. We rushed out another version by the end of the year that came closer to matching what they expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How does this apply to Georgia? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well the Repubs never thought how some of their supporters would feel about voter suppression. Sure there aren't many blacks who vote Republican, but some of the whites don't want to vote for a party that would do what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that while Georgia didn't go for Obama, there were probably a fair number of Republicans who voted for him in Georgia in 2008 and 2012. People who had gotten over their fear of blacks enough to vote for one. The US is changing. As much as we emphasize that racism is still here, and it is -- we also had a black president for eight years. That is change. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That, and people know more than you think they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The post also &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2020/10/13/where-is-your-soul/&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress.com, so it elminates the need for a separate app that turns a thread into a post. Makes me wonder if Substack and Medium are going to add this feature. Also does WordPress support email bulletins?</description>

			<description>I object to the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/podcasts/the-daily/abortion-rights-amy-coney-barrett.html&quot;&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Why The Left is Losing on Abortion.&quot; Once again it's a horserace. Winning and losing. And the subject is wrong. I guess &quot;The Left&quot; is losing but really it's the people of the United States who are losing. This is a terrible disease in American discourse and until we train ourselves to stop ignoring ourselves and realize that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are the government, and insist that our journalists do the same, we will all keep losing, left, right, center, all of it.</description>

			<description>BTW, a Supreme Court justice is part of the government, and therefore governs, and since we are the government, the justice represents us. Who among us do Alito, Roberts, Kavanaugh, Thomas and Gorsach represent? Not me, not anyone I know. Probably not many Trump supporters either. So should we really be adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedsoc.org/&quot;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt;? This is the way journalism should be approaching this story, imho. But who am I. Just a voter, citizen, taxpayer. According to our rulers, insignificant.</description>

			<description>I was talking with a friend the other day, just rambling about software and how I'm not terribly focused and I'm kind of okay with that. They asked what would you like to work on if you had your way. No question about it -- outliners. We have lots of unfinished business. But it still remains a boutique category, and I'm not succeeding at getting my outliner to get enough use to get to critical mass. Other people, newcomers (from my point of view) have gained traction, like Roam and Workflowy. What I really want is to combine outlining and blogging (i.e. fluid online writing). Then I think we'd be inventing a new kind of communication on the net. I have lots of technology for that, but what I'm missing is users. This idea goes all the way back to the beginning of blogging in the mid-90s. Eventually we caved and made a blogging tool that worked the way people expected. I don't want to try to raise venture capital and start a company. I've done that before, and it just takes me away from what I love to do. It isn't my calling. And at my advanced age, there's no time for doing work that isn't what I'm meant to do.</description>

			<description>I have a couple of hours to kill today in Kingston, but it's pouring rain outside. In the old days I'd bring a laptop and hang out in Starbucks or the library. But now that we have Covid, I think I'm going to be listening to podcasts in my car. Oy. I'll have a nice latte of course from Starbucks. But I'm not going to hang out inside and risk getting killed. (Update: Better idea. I'm almost finished with Season 3 of Borgen. I think I'll download it on my iPhone and watch that. Blogging is amazing. Sometimes you figure stuff out.)</description>

From there, we could be informed of how to vote. And so much more. It would be as revolutionary as the Declaration of Independence.</description>

			<description>When you think about how Trump became president, it could be that from now on we elect people to play the role of president, more than &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the president, and maybe they should be separate jobs. Seems a good defensive move, in case this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the future, would be to start a few shows with characters who are powerful &lt;i&gt;Democratic&lt;/i&gt; ideals for president. We have Martin Sheen, but he's a little old, and he is doing Trump-like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3yi41gfgA&quot;&gt;cheezy commercials&lt;/a&gt; now for cheap drugs. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geena_Davis&quot;&gt;Geena Davis&lt;/a&gt;.

It was depressing to find out that fighting for equality, to the extent that it works, would not end the hatred for my people. After that I looked at every conversation there differently. Never spoke again. I still have the app, am still a member, so this all could change, but I thought it was good to update.</description>

			<description>I woke in the middle of the night with an idea. What if your soul, my soul, if all our souls exist in a different dimension from our bodies? We can't physically find our souls with microscopes or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-mri#1&quot;&gt;MRIs&lt;/a&gt;, or electron microscopes, perhaps because they aren't visible where those tools exist? Reminds me of an experience I had many years ago at an outdoor bar in Austin. There was a big tree in the middle of the stage. They had built the stage around it. There was a band playing, something lively and Texan, and I was thinking, I wonder if that tree even knows we're here. Can it sense the music, and the people, and the beers, and the relaxed mood? And if it can, what must it think is going on? So it's possible that our souls may not even be in another dimension, they may only exist in a manner that our senses can't detect. Or maybe we can only detect them as feelings, as intuitions, as middle-of-the-night dreaming epiphanies?</description>

			<description>The mistake we keep making, the voters, is not organizing in a way that we stay organized after the election. So the parties and the press revert to ignoring us. You can see the next year take shape, awfully, even if Biden wins.</description>

			<description>The Repubs do something awful. The Repubs do it again. The Repubs say the Dems will do something to fix the awful things the Repubs did. The press goes for it. Court packing is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillaryâ€™s Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillaryâ€™s Emails&lt;/a&gt; of 2020. Journalism is fed the question by Repubs, ignoring what a 6-3 majority means for the people. If youâ€™re not careful weâ€™ll spend the rest of our sad lives living in Trumpocracy.</description>

			<title>Watchlist feature for BingeWorthy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnL1eMCKQgk&quot;&gt;Quick video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the new BingeWorthy &lt;i&gt;watchlist.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you see a program you want to watch, look for the + icon in the upper left corner of the program box. Click it. The program is added to your watchlist, displayed just below the box. The icon changes to a checkmark. Click again, it's removed from the watchlist and the check icon changes to a + icon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The icons are weird, imho, but they are the ones Netflix uses for their watchlist, and Amazon Prime video copied them. So I went with Netflix's icons. As usual thanks to Font Awesome there was no work to finding the icons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a few more projects in mind for BingeWorthy. This one was a relative quick hit, took three days from beginning to end. Of course when I started I thought it would take one day. I think there might be another API layer possible for SQL databases that would make such a job much quicker, but I'm not ready to approach that yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Inline videos on Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Added a new feature today to the blog. Still have to check it out in the nightly email. I can now include videos inline, which is a feature I've wanted for special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Below is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwcD8ftY0Mg&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; I took on a country road as some bikers roared by. It seems like I must have been standing there waiting for them, but it was a coincidence. They are really awful, incredibly loud, you can hear them for ten minutes as they go up and down the hills in and out of the valley. I'm not sure why they don't use their mufflers or if their bikes have them, but they really do disturb the peace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway here's the video.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I just realized that Joe Biden may be &lt;b&gt;The Politician from Nowhere&lt;/b&gt;. I can't think of a single issue that he's associated with. Oddly I think that's exactly what we need from a president in 2021.</description>

			<description>New blog feature. There's now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/06/bidenHarris2020.png&quot;&gt;Biden/Harris ad&lt;/a&gt; on the home page of my blog. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingDesktop.png&quot;&gt;desktop browser&lt;/a&gt; it's in the right margin. It was tricky on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingOnPhone.png&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;, so I just had the ad overlay the page, at .5 opacity. You can still read the text underneath it, but it's better if you scroll it out of the way.

			<description>Happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/friday-9-october-2020&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; quote my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; on breaking up tech monopolies. He calls it radical. It's the kind of judgment courts issue all the time. Look for ways to set things right.  Make everyone whole. The web should have remained open. Google and Facebook didn't respect that. So undo what they did. It's the way a programmer looks at things, and imho that's the right way, because it's tech we're talking about setting right. Usually they don't consult techies in these things, however.</description>
