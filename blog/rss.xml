			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/howTheMoviePigReallyResonatedForMe.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: Pig is a beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pig-2021&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; because it's about showing people the beauty inside themselves, using the beauty inside yourself. I loved it. Warning, there are spoilers in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/howTheMoviePigReallyResonatedForMe.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, but something to know about the movie is that it isn't the kind of movie that you can spoil with spoilers, but you have been warned. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>opml.org is a mess, like all of my long-term tech projects, suffering from lack of focus, but no lack of experimentation!

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/&quot;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt;, my primary registrar, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html?title=theyCanMap&quot;&gt;did something important right&lt;/a&gt;. You could use a CNAME for any name, including the top level of a domain. It's so rational, I don't understand why all DNS service providers don't allow it. Except now it no longer appears to work on Hover. I'm trying to set up opml.org to be CNAME for pagepark.scripting.com. I don't want to hard-code it to a specific server IP address. The whole idea of having a name like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;pagepark.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is so that I can easily relocate it to new hardware someday without having to find all the places that have its IP address hard-coded. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/15/hoverScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what it says when I try to do that now. It appears to be a user interface thing only, the domains I set up previously using this feature still appear to work. If you have an idea what's going on, please post a note &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/220&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I discovered yesterday that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbomax.com/hub/classics-curated-by-tcm&quot;&gt;TCM library&lt;/a&gt; is available on HBO Max. Well I think that did it. I'm going to be spending a lot of time with that. The first movie I watched was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor/Victoria&quot;&gt;Victor/Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. I love everything about that movie, even the cornball stuff. But the best part is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews&quot;&gt;Julie Andrews&lt;/a&gt; playing a woman playing a man playing a woman, and it's so entertaining. I first discovered TCM when I was recuperating from surgery in 2002. They gave me an unlimited supply of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone&quot;&gt;Oxycontin&lt;/a&gt;. So I was weak and completely stoned for a full month watching TCM movies basically non-stop. Without commercials. For such a serious life moment, I was actually enjoying it pretty well, I have to say. One of the movies was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09.html#victorvictoria&quot;&gt;Victor/Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. I probably watched it all the way through 20 times in 2002 (I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09/27.html#l478d29742a10d66001e366393966eb78&quot;&gt;TiVO&lt;/a&gt;). It was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140102022028/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/940179%7C0/Robert-Osborne-on-Joan-Crawford.html&quot;&gt;Joan Crawford Month&lt;/a&gt;, so I watched every JC movie they had, going back to silent movies. She was a super cutie, whatever you think of her &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/06/publicShamingIsWorthALook.html&quot;&gt;as a mother&lt;/a&gt;, I could watch her all day, esp with the Oxy. Then they did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_in_film&quot;&gt;movies of 1939&lt;/a&gt;, which was probably the best year ever for Hollywood. The way the early web may have been the best time for tech. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/08/14.html#When:1:03:47PM&quot;&gt;The Women&lt;/a&gt; was an unusual movie from 1939. You don't realize this right away but there are no men in the movie, not even an extra. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Women_(1939_film)#Cast&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; of superstar women actors of the day. There was also The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Anyway, after all this time, I can't get Oxy anymore (glad for that, I liked it too much) but I can get as much TCM as I want, and I get to do the programming. Geez. All I need is a bungalow in the Florida Keys or a hacienda in Taos, and nice way to watch TCM, and I could just disconnect. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/world/meanwhile-in-america-august-3-intl/index.html&quot;&gt;Taliban crush&lt;/a&gt; the Afghan government so quickly makes quite an impression. I think bringing our military home was probably a good idea. While we were protecting Afghanistan from their Taliban, we've been growing our own fundamentalist terrorism culture here. The Afghan Taliban wants to return their country to the 5th century, the American Taliban wants to go back to before the Civil War. They want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesaurus.land/?word=subjugate&quot;&gt;subjugate&lt;/a&gt; women. Our fundamentalists also want subjugate non-whites and non-Christians.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went for a walk in the noon heat and was wiped out.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/podcasts/the-daily/climate-change-IPCC.html&quot;&gt;today's lame Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;climate crisis&lt;/span&gt; is a lot worse than they were willing to say, obviously, based on facts they cited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then they got all weepy about how it's the fault of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;boomers&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the story they should have reported.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We have not yet started to decrease carbon emissions, in fact it's still going up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even if we never emitted another ton of carbon, the next 30 years are going to be an escalating climate catastrophe. What we're seeing now is nothing compared to what we are certain to see in five years, ten years, all the way up to thirty years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then in thirty years it will level off, assuming somehow in 2021 we stopped emitting any carbon. The climate will still be horrific but it won't get any worse. But (repeated, sorry) only if we turn our carbon emissions down to zero, now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/13/194244.html?title=wereCooked#a194426&quot;&gt;#1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So the boomers are to blame, say the host and the guest. The guest is a boomer, the host is younger. This is where their version of the story ends. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the crazy part. They're doing exactly what the boomer supposedly did and feels so guilty about. Not owning the truth of now. Softening it. Shifting to blame instead of what to do. Now, even if we got our shit together, and we aren't and won't, we're &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; fucked. It's already too late.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the new generations are so cool, why are they doing the same thing? Why are they making it sound like we're not living in a wrecked ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I know the answer. Here it is. It's a myth that anyone has any ability to turn the ship around, or even that all of us acting collectively could turn the ship around. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The true story that I've yet to hear the NYT say, and today they had the perfect opportunity to say it, is that we're already over the cliff. The planet is ruined for life as it currently exists. It's done. Nothing to worry about. It's over. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the true true version of the story, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM0uZ9mfOUI&quot;&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from The Newsroom, which was broadcast in 2014, seven years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Hit a milestone today. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; is working with &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/span&gt;. So the best outliner now is hooked up with the best blogging CMS. Friends are trying it out now and letting me know if the software works, and if my docs work. Exciting moment.</description>

			<description>I've been looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; forever. It was part of my blog that was wiped out in the transition in May 2017 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; to Electric Outliner and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/span&gt;. I finally had the thought to look in my previous editing system and there it was. I said this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;I want my old blog back&lt;/a&gt;. I decided that all the crazy michegas in trying to make Twitter, Medium, Facebook, the defunct &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/span&gt; that still limited what we could do with blogs, from its grave, to make all those work with my writing -- it wasn't worth it. All these limits amounted to there was nothing I could write that would make even a small subset of them happy. And no links, titles, bold, italic, or podcasts. Fuck you Facebook. What a bad netizen they are. And Twitter, although I love it, it's fucked up too. They support every damn type, video, audio, gifs, whatever -- except HTML text. What the fuck Jack. I'm out of patience with Twitter too. So in May 2017 I broke free of all that bullshit. And now four-plus years later, I'm getting ready to do more.</description>

			<title>From 2017, why I prefer blogging on the open web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I prefer to blog here rather than on Facebook is that if I get an Aha! idea about a feature, over here I can implement it. On Facebook I'm just a user. That was/is one of the great things about the web. Anyone can develop features for it. On Facebook, just their employees can. No wonder it never moves.#&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When a company dominates an activity, they tend to invest elsewhere. Seems kind of perverse, but that's why markets don't always evolve to fill every niche. Open platforms are more favorable. If you want to perform a new style of music in Central Park, you can. If you want to do it in Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, you need to get the approval of a lot of rich people&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been reading books this year by black cultural figures. Really informative, perspective &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;exploding&lt;/a&gt; stuff. Some great writing, like Alice Walker. And she narrates so beautifully. An interesting side-effect is that I embrace my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1425130084038545408&quot;&gt;own cultural heritage&lt;/a&gt; with more confidence.</description>

			<description>I need to create an S3 bucket that's publicly accessible over the web, so serve web content. I used to do this routinely, but not recently. They've changed it enough that I can't figure out how to do it.  BTW, I found a current tutorial and filled in the missing bit, and now my bucket is happily serving over the web.</description>

			<description>Is there a theory on why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/08/biden-infrastructure-bill-senate-502785&quot;&gt;the Repubs&lt;/a&gt; are going along with Biden's infrastructure bill? I've heard that it's their way to break away from Trump. Also thought it might be a trap, to push forward the date when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling&quot;&gt;debt ceiling&lt;/a&gt; has to be raised? Very odd.</description>

			<description>I loved everything about Alice Walker's narration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Color-Purple-Audiobook/B07LCV3R2F?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&amp;pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&amp;pf_rd_r=ZQPG218HEYYMHVWY2V03&quot;&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/a&gt;. It's a beautiful story, and Walker has such a beautiful voice, oddly I find myself narrating my own story in my head in her voice. The book is in the form of letters between two sisters, who lead very different intertwined lives starting in the early 20th century. This has been so far a year where I have let black authors speak to me of the black perspective on life in America. I'm going to continue this exploration.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/simpleCrossNetworkScript.html&quot;&gt;Back in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, we were getting ready to simplify scripting of apps that ran on other nodes on the net. I felt there was no reason function calls should be more complicated than they need to be, just because the function was on a server. Spoiler alert, we did implement this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; and it was wonderful. Now the question is -- can we implement it in JavaScript, or will it require a pre-preprocessor, which is an option in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; since we have a very thin pre-processor. I opened a thread for discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/219&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>When I was in grad school I was famous for writing great error messages. That was from their point of view, and the time (mid-late 70s). From my point of view, then and now -- I was making tools that made computer science useful for people, not just better compilers and databases. My error messages &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; better, because I was writing them to try to communicate something to the user. This, at the time, was a relatively new idea. They certainly didn't teach it in CS grad school. I wonder if they do now?</description>

			<description>I have a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S92QBCJ?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&quot;&gt;Logitech keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, but the keys started sticking due to humidity so I bought a replacement. Just set it up. The instructions were horrible, just diagrams, no words. And the whole thing doesn't work if you plug the keyboard into charge it up before doing the setup. You gotta wonder if they test the instructions with human beings. I like products that just work. But. Now that it's set up, having a brand new keyboard is one of the great pleasures of life. Like having a new car to drive. Every keystroke feels wonderful. But then one of my neighbors is cutting down trees, and making huge loud noise doing so, at unpredictable times. There goes my concentration! Oy.</description>

			<description>&lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/span&gt; -- one of the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; ever. It had barely registered with me until about a week ago, when I, in a fit of boredom, decided to give it a try. I was hooked almost from the beginning. Rick, Morty's grandfather, has spent his life exploring the universe, and has a really depraved sense of everything, but he also loves to party. Morty, who is high school age, sort of puts up with Rick, and he always has issues with him. Every episode has at least a couple of really novel and funny scifi themes involving alien civilizations who are truly weird, and horrible situations Rick gets them into. It's like a lot of sitcoms, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeymooners&quot;&gt;Honeymooners&lt;/a&gt; for example, where Rick is Ralph Cramden and Morty is Ed Norton. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Lucy&quot;&gt;I Love Lucy&lt;/a&gt; where Rick is Lucy and Morty is Ethel Mertz. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad&quot;&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt; where Rick is Walter White and Morty is Jesse Pinkman. It is LOL funny almost every episode. The people who do this show are off the scale creative. How do they keep thinking up these things? So perverse, sexual, vain, moronic, pathetic, depraved, mean, evil, pointless -- all the funniest crazy things we laugh at humanity over. I'm just through season 2, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rick_and_Morty_episodes&quot;&gt;five seasons&lt;/a&gt;. Archive is on HBO and &lt;a href=&quot;https://showrss.info/show/44.rss&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; places. Season 5 is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adultswim.com/&quot;&gt;Adult Swim&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I'm starting to get more concrete ideas on what to tag and what not to tag. In the piece about Rick and Morty, above, I tagged the name of the show. I did not tag the names of the shows I compared it to. In the post about the Olympics gold medal game, I tagged the Brooklyn Nets, because I have an issue with them, and that issue a pivotal reason I didn't love the US Olympic team as much as I would have if they were more of a team. The Nets aren't a team either, maybe they will at some point. We're going to keep watching them, so I think there's a reasonably good chance I'll write about them again and again in this same context. They're an ongoing thread on my blog. And I have an issue with the Olympics, so I tagged them too. I did not tag any of these things in this post, but I did tag &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt;, because that's what this post is about. ðŸ’¥</description>

			<description>I got to watch the second half of last night's gold medal game between France and the US. Something strange happened, almost immediately I was rooting for France, because the USA team reminded me of the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Brooklyn Nets&lt;/span&gt;. A team formed quickly with star NBA players for the sole purpose of winning a championship. The French team, on the other hand, while they had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert&quot;&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; or two from the NBA, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier&quot;&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ntilikina&quot;&gt;former&lt;/a&gt; Knick, practiced together for quite some time, and had the fluidity that comes from being a team. The American all-stars did not. But they did have &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/span&gt;, and that made the difference. He is an awesome talent, maybe the best to ever play the game, certainly in the top ten. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/06/sports/olympic-basketball-usa-france&quot;&gt;USA did win&lt;/a&gt;, and I can't say I'm sad about that, because I'm a nephew of Uncle Sam, but I did like the spirit of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_men%27s_national_basketball_team#2020_Olympic_roster&quot;&gt;French team&lt;/a&gt;, and I would have been happy if they won. I am not a fan of the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Olympics&lt;/span&gt;. I think they are playing for NBC and their advertisers, and I also think they should have one great venue for summer and winter, and stop all the waste. We have to change the way we run our civilization, or we won't have a civilization.</description>

			<description>I recently got &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; to work reasonably well on a tablet like an iPad. But I'm thinking about doing something different for phones. I wonder if you think any note-taking tool on a phone is doing a particularly great job. Just the right size. Not too complicated. Easy to make notes, easy to refer to notes. If so, could you post a screen shot &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1423267186794246154&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. BTW -- I don't &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1423269337763303427&quot;&gt;insist&lt;/a&gt; on doing this app. In fact I'd prefer not to.</description>

			<description>I just had an &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/span&gt;. What if you could view my blog in a special mode where you could tag individual words. Create your own index for my writing. It wouldn't be easy to spam it, or be abusive. Maybe at first your tags would just be aggregated with your other tags, but they would be publicly visible. Fan sites might develop, that remix blogs in different ways. I've been looking for ways to make my blog more participatory, without opening it up to too much uglyness. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>There's a renewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1423261135021740034&quot;&gt;interest&lt;/a&gt; in people getting &quot;verified&quot; blue checkmark on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;. It's interesting that &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/span&gt; who is also the founder and CEO of a big successful payments company, can't get it together for Twitter to verify the identity of users in a routine way.The post office does it using credit cards. I can have my mail forwarded simply by paying them $1 with a credit card that has the address being forwarded from as its registered address. BTW, I got verified myself a few years back by doing nothing. They sent me an email saying they know who I am and that the account I registered really is me, so they went ahead and gave me the blue checkmark. I'm sure Dorsey et al know how valuable that asset is for them, and the people who have them.</description>

			<title>My two cents on Cuomo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many people calling for &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/span&gt;'s resignation know what he was accused of in any specific way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many people calling for Cuomo's resignation have regrets about forcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=al+franken+forced+to+resign&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-al-franken-resignation-20190722-kaivwbwj4jhmfnf7sr3z53kuxy-story.html&quot;&gt;resign&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many NY voters agree that Cuomo should resign? And if most of them don't, he shouldn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don't trust NY politicians, even the Attorney General. I think they're all corrupt. And I certainly don't trust the NY press, who, without dissent, has decided it's time for him to resign. That alone would be enough for me to encourage him to fight. It's not their call. They don't care what the voters think. They arrogantly think they are the public. They are not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Accusations must be litigated, to a verdict, using the American justice system, and then when there's a decision, we should talk about him resigning. He holds an elective office. His source of power isn't the approval of the Attorney General or other politicians, or journalists. His power comes from the people of New York. Their opinion is imho what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't like the Cuomo family, they've been in NY politics my whole life. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2013/03/mario-cuomo-was-disappointed-homo-signs-or-not-000000&quot;&gt;They&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecentralvoice.com/stories/history-lesson-decades-later-vote-for-cuomo-not-the-homo-mailer-resurfaces,1844&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/09/11/andrew-cuomo-has-been-playing-dirty-in-politics-for-years/&quot;&gt;dirty&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn't be surprised if the accusations were true. But there's a difference between accusations and a verdict. We have a justice system to protect against mob rule. And this is a mob trying to rule, and the answer must be emphatically no, as it should have been with Al Franken. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
