			<description>BTW, yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack&quot;&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1336423955826143235&quot;&gt;one of my tweets&lt;/a&gt;. Not quite a RT, that would have been amazing, but in Silicon Valley I bet it's a funding event. People used to say that about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22John Doerr%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;John Doerr&lt;/a&gt;.

It was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1336423955826143235&quot;&gt;good tweet&lt;/a&gt; for Jack to call attention to.</description>

			<description>Sooo, the Dems are horrible at communicating with the people. You'd think that would be something a political party would be &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; at. But most Dems suck, even Obama, and definitely Clinton, going all the way back to Dukakis, which was the first presidential campaign I tried to give a free idea to (and a good one it was, in hindsight). Al Sharpton is great, as is Mayor Pete, and of course they're shipping him off to China. See how &lt;i&gt;ridiculous&lt;/i&gt; they are. Oy!</description>

			<description>Noteworthy: Scroll, which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; in February, has gotten &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1336448166636494850&quot;&gt;McClatchy to trust them&lt;/a&gt;. As I said then, it's a big chicken and egg thing. Once the pubs sign on, they will be gold, we need Scroll to succeed. Well they scored with a big publisher. Good for them, and maybe good for us (people who want to be able to read everything on the web, without subscribing to every publication with a paywall, which is obviously not possible).</description>

			<description>Google changed the icon for Chrome? It's as stupid a thing to do as a cigarette maker changing the taste or packaging of their product. It's an addiction you don't even know you have until they &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; you conscious of it. Going to the web is programmed so deep into my neurons, it's at the base of my spine, a total reflexive thing, addict behavior. Now I think about it every damn time. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/09/iconbar.png&quot;&gt;Safari icon is next to it&lt;/a&gt;, and btw it &lt;i&gt;hasn't&lt;/i&gt; changed. Which browser you use is something they want you not to think about, as long as it's their browser. Maybe it's a bug, in which case never mind. But if it was deliberate, it's a stupid move. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Positioning%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Positioning&lt;/a&gt; for the importance of what's in peoples' minds.</description>

			<description>I got some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PYMWPFH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;headlamps&lt;/a&gt;, very nice to have. Esp for taking out the garbage at night. You can carry all the bags and still see where you're going. One special feature is that the spy cam can't see your face, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stQIznrn-1E&quot;&gt;illustrated in this video&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Apple zealots suck</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a very pragmatic problem with the religious zeal people have for Apple products. I can't tell when I should take their advice if they always gush about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two recent examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A friend, a VC, told me that the XS Max was totally worth the $1500. So I got one. No way it was worth that. I replaced it this year with a new SE for $350, and I love it, actually more than the XS Max because it's only $350. I'm cheap that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another friend told me last month I had to get the new earpods. $250. A little steep, but the way he was talking, it sounded like Moses had come down from the mountain with the secret to human happiness, and I could get it for only $250. So I did it, on an impulse. Well, they're nice enough, but there's absolutely nothing special about them. I like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=WH-1000XM4+Wireless+Noise-Canceling+Headphones&amp;qid=1607538440&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVEtROTdWUkwwVVExJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDEwMDc3MjJONDJPRklMN0dBMSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODA4MjY1MjVEWVdBQ1VSVDBXNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=&quot;&gt;Sony overear headphones&lt;/a&gt; better (almost exactly the same price, btw). I buy headphones on a whim, so I know what's good. These are ok, but didn't not deserve the review they got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So all this ends up backfiring for people who want to help Apple sell product, which btw, I'm happy about since I bought Apple shares in 1997, and have watched them make me rich,. But as a user, I am offended by the way people go on and on about such bullshit. Headphones and iPhones aren't sex toys or drugs. They're products. They're good products, but they also suck like all products do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Back in the day there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage&quot;&gt;million pixel web page&lt;/a&gt;, they sold individual pixels, $1 a pixel. The guy made the money, got paid for all the pixels. Anyway what made me think of this was President-elect Biden could sell seats at the virtual inauguration and use the money for a good cause. I'd like to be part of a million people participating in the inaugural, without endangering people's lives (including my own).</description>

			<description>Highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gov-cuomos-briefing-for-december-7/id1506413883?i=1000501621982&quot;&gt;yesterday's Cuomo podcast&lt;/a&gt;, esp the conversation between Cuomo and Fauci. Important: we need 80 percent to be vaccinated to eliminate the virus. Everyone, legal or illegal, no matter where they live. Of course, not likely, given that more than half of NYC firefighters say they will &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc7ny.com/fdny-vaccine-covid-pfizer/8560168/&quot;&gt;refuse the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. These are people who run into burning buildings, but think the vaccine is too dangerous?</description>

			<description>Journalism should use some of their space to debate how they should conduct journalism going forward, the discussion not overseen by journalists, btw. Assuming Trump doesn't manage to overturn the election before January 20, the first chance they're going to get to change things radically over in journalism-land is if Trump has a rally to counter-program the inauguration, in what will probably unprecedented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/06/birx-winter-covid-surge-the-worst-event-that-this-country-will-face.html&quot;&gt;moment of misery&lt;/a&gt; for the country re Covid. Journalism no longer has to cover Trump because he's no longer POTUS. They could choose to focus totally on the inauguration and the virus. It's so perverse now that they could go the other way, they could have Chris Cilizza and Gloria Borger discuss whether infecting millions of people and destroying the health care system was a brilliant political move, horse-race-wise, for Trump to set up on his way out, moderated by Wolf Blitzer (who btw, sometimes seems to think he's Speaker of the House).</description>

			<description>Until very recently my Twitter feed didn't have ads. They really suck. Itâ€™s all stupid tabloid celebrity paparazzi bullshit.

			<title>My plan for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today Om Malik posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2020/12/07/what-twitter-can-learn-from-spotify/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; outlining the future of Twitter as very different from where Twitter is today. As I read it I thought, yes that is the future, and about a dozen other things. We should do them all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note I said &lt;i&gt;we,&lt;/i&gt; not they.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's my plan for Twitter. Become an investment banker and distributor. It's the same advice I have for every tech company that achieves the size and seniority that Twitter has achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their strength is operating servers and raising money. They have access to an infinite supply of both. They also have a unique platform, with virtually universal adoption. Their service is so many places, that's where the distribution comes into it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Commit to the API as a developer ecosystem, and invest in developers with promising apps. Buy them when that would be in the interest of both. That's how you grow from where Twitter was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also for crying out loud, broaden the pipe to allow text objects greater than 280 chars. &lt;i&gt;Please.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the advice I came up with for &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Microsoft%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; when we were studying them in the 90s and they were helbent on taking over the nascent web. With hindsight it was good advice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was also my advice for pre-1997 Apple. I even wrote a piece where I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;dreamed I was CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and outlined how I would reorganize Apple's relationship with devs. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; would be perfect for Twitter in 2021. Imagine Jack Dorsey as CEO of a new Twitter that does deals with devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is too big a boat to turn. But it can be a safe harbor for thousands of startups with ideas for what to do with the basic ingredients of Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We. Have. To. Work. Together.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When we were first rolling out podcasting in the winter of 2004, we had a hard time getting anyone in established media to listen. I think people could have understood, but they didn't make the effort to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It does take effort to listen, I've seen it in myself. We just have our heads down and are focused on what we do. It's even worse today, sixteen years later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump stumbled across the idea we were selling, me, @ev, the other blogging and RSS folk. Trump understood it intuitively, we understood it technologically (and some of us as writers and designers).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So now this method of communication is owned by the tabloids, only worse. Real journalism is reduced to writing about the hoaxes spread in the more powerful media channel. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To win, we have to work together. The people with a vision for how the tech could help, and the people who are able to actually run the complex machinery of government.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We. Have. To. Work. Together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the past when that happened, when there was real collaboration, the result was explosive, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My house makes this sound..</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When it's windy, as it was last night, my house makes a really jarring loud sound, and I haven't been able to figure out what it is. So I took out my iPhone, and opened the Voice Memo app and recorded the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/windSlammingSound.m4a&quot;&gt;http://scripting.com/2020/12/06/windSlammingSound.m4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can hear it clearly at 2 seconds, then 8 seconds and then at 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In real life it's a lot louder than it sounds in the recording. Sounds like a metal door slamming. You can't sleep through it, and it sounds like it might be doing damage to the house. Last night was particularly bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The sounds always come in pairs. As if something is slamming open and then slamming closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been going on since I moved in, in March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The wind has to be going about 35 mph or so. It only does this when it's gusting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had a couple of contractors look into it, but of course never when the it's making the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Any theories welcome. If you know what it is, even better! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Studying the Unix source code when I was a CS grad student was a revelation. Here's how I summarize the gestalt. &lt;i&gt;This code looks like what it does.&lt;/i&gt; It takes a lot of time, care and craft to do. Up till that point, my code tended to quickly get out of control, but somehow the Unix developers kept it clean. From that point on I knew it was possible, and it's what I always strive for. Some languages make it easier than others, but even if you're writing in assembly language, if it's a well crafted language, you can make the code look like what it does. JavaScript is notorious for making it very difficult. As a language designer I keep wanting to fix it. Someday I will. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>In programming there's a moment when the code you're working on first does what you're trying to make it do. It's only barely doing it. But it just went from doing nothing to doing The Thing. I call this the moment when &lt;i&gt;the first blade of grass pops through the surface of the earth. &lt;/i&gt;Later there will be a nice lawn here. You hope it'll be thick and green. But for now it's just the one blade of grass. It's nice moment. The code is no longer just an idea, it's now a thing.</description>

			<description>On BBC Radio on WNYC this morning they ask why are people not listening to government warnings about holiday gatherings? The answer is eluding them. It's the commercials on the telly, dummy. Happy families giving each other hugs and presents. And the virus! Commercials are engineered to perfection to make you think of doing the things in the commercials. They're selling the illusion of an idyllic holiday with love and friends. It may work next year, but this year it ain't love that's being transmitted at these gatherings. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I like to evolve funny names for things. Just ask my close friends and family. Anyway, for a while I was pronouncing Facebook's name as a Dutch person might. Fasch Boke. You say it without opening your mouth very wide. It makes people laugh for some reason I can't figure out. Anyway, now I've evolved that to be more American: Fast Buck. Which oddly enough is what they are all about! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If I could go back in time and explain to my exes why they had so much trouble understanding me I would say that I was just beginning to learn that there are women who are nothing like my mother. So please be patient with me. I meant well. And btw, I'd suggest that perhaps they have me confused with the men they grew up around and to consider the possibility I'm not &quot;just like them.&quot; (An accusation I've heard many many times.)</description>

			<description>Tonightâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maddow&quot;&gt;Maddow&lt;/a&gt; says clearly weâ€˜re going over a cliff in the next weeks. If true, one way to save lives is for NBC and other networks to control the seasonal commercials they run, ones that show families gathering pre-Covid style. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS8npcVD4Ik&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;. Commercials set the mood, everyone knows what Christmas season is, but this year has to be different or lots more people will suffer and die. I had this thought while watching her sobering presentation, followed by one of these feel-good everything's normal holiday commercials.</description>

I had this thought while watching her sobering presentation, followed by one of these feel-good everything's normal holiday commercials." created="Fri, 04 Dec 2020 03:26:51 GMT" type="outline" urlvideo="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS8npcVD4Ik" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/03/covidVaccineCandidate.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/12/03.html#a032651"/>

			<description>I like watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maddow&quot;&gt;Maddow&lt;/a&gt;, but every once in a while, usually when she talks about Facebook, I am reminded that she can be as mean-spirited and dishonest as any Fox host, Hannity, Carlson or Ingraham. An example from last night. Trump recorded an unhinged video that they distributed via Facebook. Something anyone can do. You can, I can, anyone. This feature has been used in some amazing ways. A woman recorded her boyfriend being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile&quot;&gt;murdered by police&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis using Facebook's live video. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/10/1368.html&quot;&gt;remarkable&lt;/a&gt; and I think even a journalist Facebook-hater would have to admit, revolutionary. The whole point of &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; on Facebook is that &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; can do it. What Maddow said: &quot;Facebook would run it.&quot; Technically true, but irresponsibly misleading. She repeated it as she often does, with pauses and a look that was withering in contempt for Facebook. Her implication was that Fox wouldn't run it, Newsmax wouldn't run it, but Facebook, super slime that they are, would. There's an honest way to explore this, the way she does with other things she isn't expert on, have a discussion one night the tradeoffs of allowing anyone to post live video. But -- I what I really resent is that Maddow, who I want to believe is doing the best she can, in this case is misusing that trust and it makes me doubt the stuff she reports where I don't know enough to see through the bullshit.</description>

			<description>I rearranged my office a few weeks ago so now I have room for a second monitor on my desk, something I had gotten accustomed to when I lived in Manhattan. But when I set up the second monitor, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IZBIMLK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;BenQ&lt;/a&gt;, it was depressingly ugly. The text was fuzzy, the color was impossible to get right. On Cyber Monday, on Amazon, I spotted a deal for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0199W9UMS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;HP montitor&lt;/a&gt;, the same size, 27 inch, for $170. It arrived yesterday and I set it up this morning, and what a difference! It's a pleasure to look over to the left and see the readout windows I leave over there. Night and day difference.</description>

			<title>HBO Max is a historic mess</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know what HBO Max is. I also don't know what HBO Go or HBO Now was. I do remember HBO. I started subscribing in the late 70s, when I was a grad student. It was a miracle. Home Box Office. First-run movies just after they finished in theaters. No commercials. Uncensored. The really good stuff. Much later they started producing their own shows, but for many years it was just movies. And it was great. Before that home entertainment was so awful, but we didn't know, until HBO showed us how it should really work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for a long time I got HBO with my cable subscription, until earlier this year I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-cut-the-cable-tv-cord-in-2020/&quot;&gt;cut the cord&lt;/a&gt;, and around the same time HBO cut the cord with Roku, the company that makes the operating system that my TV runs on, and at the same time introduced HBO Max and discontinued HBO Now and HBO Go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So no more HBO for Davey. I missed it. I tried buying in as part of Hulu, but I didn't like that. HBO is its own thing, not something I want mixed in with all of Hulu's stuff. It would be like having to go through a minor cola brand to get a Coke. There's this institution called HBO. It's like the Statue of Liberty or the Eifel Tower, it's grand and revered, it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; something to be folded in with Hulu, which is great too, but it's just nowhere near the stature of HBO.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I saw something somewhere that maybe HBO and Roku are sort of getting it together, and I checked and lo and behold I can subscribe to HBO using the same HBO app that I love, not Go, Now, Pro or Max, just HBO. Maybe they've come to their senses! Okay, no Max but who cares, I never understood what it was anyway (probably because I don't care). Only when I tried to use it on my iPad, it wouldn't accept my login. It said something incomprehensible. I'll let you see if &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/02/hboerror.png&quot;&gt;you can decipher it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I posted something &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1333920269140889601&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and they responded, I gave them the info and they did something no company should ever do, they told me to talk to Roku. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HBO can't help you watch HBO. See if Roku cares. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I get it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250075/att-restructures-warnermedia-hbo-turner-streaming&quot;&gt;A really shitty company&lt;/a&gt; bought HBO, and they're remarketing it, and in doing so, taking something that once was grand and superior, above the fray, beyond reproach, the gold standard of quality and turning it into schlock and schmutz, a schmatte. We're watching a great brand slowly and deliberately dismantle itself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing. They should get rid of the Max stuff. Just plain old HBO was great. I don't understand what's so max about it. Maybe it would be better to call it HBO Mess. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Interesting comments on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/196&quot;&gt;yesteday's braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. I've never used Asana -- I don't qualify, but apparently it's used for managing projects the way I described. I have used Trello. What I described apparently is &quot;Agile&quot; -- which, to me, means paying attention to how your product is used and making it better based on what you learn. Scrum is where you apply what you learned when being agile. I've always done this, made software for myself first, paid attention as it was used by myself and then others, and devised methods to get users to tell me more about their experience. Interestingly the BTQ itself is a form of agile, I'm trying to learn how to evolve &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;my outliner&lt;/a&gt; to make it better for people doing this kind of work, and to make its advantage more obvious.</description>
