			<description>Thereâ€™s no comparison between Twitter and Mastodon for idea distribution. I routinely get hundreds of RTs on Masto. The Twitter system thinks the same ideas are worthless. Iâ€™m guessing virtually no one sees my tweets. For an idea why that is, see the next item.</description>

			<title>Trump was a free man...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/22/trumpWasAFreeMan.html&quot;&gt;Jan 22, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, two days after Trump was inaugurated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump was a free man until he took the oath. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But once he assumed the office, and until he leaves, he belongs to us, the American people. I'm sure this is a new feeling for him. But we all must submit to something. The president submits to the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine what hell it must be behind the closed door that leads to the press room. The ranting and screaming, the tears and the &quot;there there's&quot; from his staff, the promises to get even. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But he will keep bumping up against the reality that now, we own his ass, even the ones who thought his campaign was crazy and dangerous. The people who voted for him thinking it left the rest of us powerless are in for a surprise too. The other politicians you elected care about what we think, because they need us to keep their jobs. The election is over, now they're worried about the next election. And like it or not, they need us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Harry Truman famously called the White House the &quot;crown-jewel of the federal penal system.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how Trump will come to terms with this. We have an idea of what a president does, says, how he or she reacts to events. We just had eight years with a guy who never lost his cool over anything. The new president sees a report on TV saying he lost the MLK bust in the Oval Office and he loses it? He has a long way to go before he is our president. He may hold the office but he hasn't embraced it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>RSS-spect</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping that people would see &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; as a key to decentralization, but it's hard to draw the picture because people have the wrong idea about RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a similar problem explaining why a Pub-sub company should support RSS without thinking of it as a &quot;third party opportunity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pub-sub could use a &quot;really simple&quot; interface. You could send any kind of message with RSS, and the knowledge of how to find the new stuff in a feed is totally established in developer-land.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that's what the Pub-sub people wanted. Ideas for new simple APIs. They look down on RSS as beneath them. I've seen &quot;serious&quot; devs do that over and over and it's a mistake. Simple is better, not trivial. Microsoft, for example, had something &quot;much better&quot; than RSS coming in the late 90s. Eventually they did get on board with RSS, to their credit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the answer is so obvious you can't even see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Twitter API still works. If that changes I'll let you know. Yes, they shut down the clients, but the people who make the clients should have known that was coming. It happened before. Every corporate platform vendor will defend their cash flow. If you bet otherwise, you're probably going to lose. If you don't like it, develop for an open platform or stay out of the platform vendor's path.</description>

			<description>I went to Davos in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/01.html&quot;&gt;January 2000&lt;/a&gt;, just once, with a white badge (access to everything). Not as a journalist. I was a representative of the web, which was the hot thing at the time. Not sure what other people were doing but I was a celebrity and enjoyed all the attention.</description>

			<description>After Davos, I went to Amsterdam, to write and enjoy the local herb. Back then it was the only place in the west where you could buy and consume the weed openly and semi-legally. Scroll to the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/02.html&quot;&gt;February archive page&lt;/a&gt; for pictures from Davos and Amsterdam, as well as a few pieces with closing thoughts about my experience at Davos. This is one of the advantages of blogging and keeping relatively decent archives. You get to relive experiences like this.</description>

			<title>Twitter's developer program</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've seen recent editorials about Twitter's developer program. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't great. The first time I ever spoke with a person from Twitter who worked with developers was in spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have been developing for the platform since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of what they developed for developers wasn't what we needed. It was what they thought of based on not having much contact with actual devs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What we needed more than anything was a way to be validated by the platform and promoted to users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/05/the-art-of-evangelism&quot;&gt;evangelism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/26/letathousandflowersbloom.html&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Apple should stop looking inward for the answer. Do your software shopping in the developer world. You get there sooner and it costs less.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Users never heard about our products and struggled with limits in Twitter that our products overcame. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realized there was no point pouring effort into the platform because users would never hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter except at the very beginning had almost zero entrepreneurialism in its dna.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt; et al did a great job of promoting it at first via SXSW. They had some kind of exclusive marketing deal with them. And then momentum carried the service, not innovation or creativity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then, with no where to go, Elon Musk bailed them out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I was a very small shareholder and was bought out by Musk. I didn't want to sell. I wanted Twitter to get with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My apps still work with the Twitter API. I don't think any developer should try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/make+hay&quot;&gt;make hay&lt;/a&gt; out of the pain of another developer. I wouldn't do that to you, even if I had questions about the foundation of your product. You see this in sports, no one puts down a competitive team just because one of their star players is injured. For good reason -- it can happen to you too and you don't want to see people do that to you. Remember this isn't just about Twitter, it's about developers too.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TribuneKevin/status/1615632786378956800&quot;&gt;Kevin Williams&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Every time Dave Chappelle comes up, Black folks cape for him, and it's weird. Learning when to let people go when they have done harm to a community, even if it isn't the Black community, is a muscle that has to be trained. Hell, folks haven't let R.

			<description>When Twitter shuts down client apps everyone says Twitter is bad. But Google deliberately &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;breaks their browser&lt;/a&gt; and blames my blog, people don't seem to care, probably because it sounds like Google is being benevolent when they're actually engaging in a huge act of piracy.</description>

			<title>On owning a Tesla</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Tesla Model Y.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will no doubt get a new EV in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I bought a new PC every year or so when they were new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn't miss driving a Tesla now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMo36SfyQhw&quot;&gt;Harry said to Sally&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how I feel about EVs. It's like driving an amusement park ride every time I go out. I deserve this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The WordPress user interface must be seen as a platform, a command line, and much higher level writing tools built to run on it. It should be possible to never see the UI of WordPress except for configuration and global settings, much the way you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/16/systemPreferencesMac.png&quot;&gt;System Preferences&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac. This is why blogging software has languished. The software we use for blogging must fit into the One Timeline paradigm, above.</description>

			<description>When I think of obvious missing tech products, I canâ€™t do most of them, because as soon as the idea gained traction as a product it would be taken over by a big company, partly because users prefer that. So a lot of gaps never get filled. Thatâ€™s the lesson from twitter shutting down the clients again. It isnâ€™t just twitter, you as an independent developer, canâ€™t step into any platform vendorâ€™s territory, they will eventually take away your business.</description>

			<description>If Google  succeeds at burying the open web, we'll create a new open easy to write for web that Google doesn't own. In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about this I suggest we should just use the web since it already does what we will ultimately need. There will be too much creativity locked up behind Google's blackmailing, and it has an easy way to escape, we just need to create a new open web. TBL showed us how to do it, we'll just do it again.</description>

			<title>Gmail shut me down</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while I writing some stuff Gmail said it detected that my computer was sending some kinds of unspecified messages, and they were concerned about it, so they logged me off. I could still check my email on my other systems. I tried to go through the &quot;prove this is you&quot; process, but when it said it had sent a message to my phone, no message arrived. When I got to that place on other systems, the message did arrive on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed my account on Google, everything looks fine. The phone I have hooked it up to is an Android. I have a backup email address connected to my account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I changed my password, and re-logged-in on my various other systems, everything worked, but not on my desktop. The problem is -- no confirming message ever appears on my phone, or anywhere else I can read my Google chat messages. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their help system is unhelpful, they keep telling me things I already know and have tried. I can live without accessing Gmail from my desktop because oddly while Gmail won't work with Chrome, it works fine with Safari. But there are often links in my emails and when I click on them the pages open in Safari. So this is very disruptive to my workflow. I'd rather still use Chrome on my desktop because everything is set up to work there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/248&quot;&gt;post a note here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, still can't get GMail to open on my desktop. I've had it try to send me a security message to my Android phone, without luck. I've quit ever app, removed every extension to Chrome, still no luck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Bingeing report. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/band-of-brothers&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt; all the way through. It's good, but I had forgotten how bloody it is. Since I was in that mode, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-2022&quot;&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix. Same idea, with 2020's production, a different war, and from the other side. I think the next thing will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/they-shall-not-grow-old&quot;&gt;They Shall Not Grow Old&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I think an AI could have plotted this path for me.</description>
