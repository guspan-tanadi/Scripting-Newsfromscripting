			<description>ChatGPT desperately needs customization. I'd like to get my Amazon Music history connected to it, so I can ask it to create a workout playlist for me. I can describe what kind of music works for me, a strong fast beat, big bass drum and guitar. Something I can sing along to is good. And I like a certain set of bands from the 70s and 80s, so we might as well start with that. Now I'm going for a 40-minute walk. Program the music please and put it on my phone and off I go.</description>

And today I ask a different question, which Succession character do you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0fWUxqcyYWbE9XByTQwV5nV7Y6bGD4SQHU7uxJ7JG6hHNGnJmMD2MCJgqyGUnf2wUl&quot;&gt;like the best&lt;/a&gt;?</description>

I have a lot of old dear friends on Facebook who I'd never see online or in real life -- and this is such a huge blessing, given that I live in the remote Catskills, where some very nice &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; people live, and many of them are friends on Facebook too. There is no such thing as a purely good social network, whether it's owned by the mega silicon valley tech cartel, or if it's a distributed fediverse -- the networks for most people are defined by the users, not who provides the system. Yeah in a way that's naive and in another way it's humble and practical. We all are only going to be around for a few more years. Enjoying the people you like and love, imho, is a big part of what makes being alive worth it. So if it's a small sin to help Facebook dominate in a very very very small way, well sometimes I don't recycle either. And no one knows the big picture, so I'm going to go ahead and keep using Facebook, because I find love there, and that's a big deal.</description>

			<title>Little Feat and Irma Thomas</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked Amazon Music to play some songs for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first they chose was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaQ3VGeQ8Uw&quot;&gt;Long Distance Love&lt;/a&gt; by Little Feat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a perfect song. Driving beat. Lowell George poetry. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;No matter what I do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even pray to heaven above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;All I ever get from her is Long Distance Love. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Raining_(Irma_Thomas_song)&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjDmpyWfBs&quot;&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irma_Thomas&quot;&gt;Irma Thomas&lt;/a&gt; who we used to see at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maple+Leaf+Bar/@29.9542913,-90.1416967,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8620a53fb836c8ed:0x1982e3718f7b6dcd!8m2!3d29.9489368!4d-90.1320837!16zL20vMDlsaDN0&quot;&gt;Maple Leaf&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans when I was a student there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard her?

As I see it, all that is happening right now. Twitter is still orders of magnitude more installed in the modern news system than Masto. But I am on Masto, it's among the first links in my browser's chrome. But we're all still figuring out what it's used for. Twitter, even though it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; greatly diminished from its former heights, is still the incumbent in the news world.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; was a breakthrough, it accumulated a library of solved problems that you could borrow from, but you'd have to figure out which pieces went with others, and that was often an long arduous process, when it worked, and it didn't always work. ChatGPT is the next level after Stack Exchange. Now you just ask the question and you get docs customized to the exact problem you have and it writes docs that are better quality than what programmers write on Stack Exchange (not in any way diminishing their contribution). So this is like moving from a calculator to a spreadsheet. It's simply a higher-level tool.</description>

It's got something for everyone. Heterosexual men get the example set by Melvin, played by Jack Nicholson, who despite his obvious insanity, is able to find love. Carol, played by Helen Hunt, gives up on not having a life, and accepts Melvin, even though he's so obviously completely out of his mind (as is she btw). For the mom, she gets to see her daughter have a life. The kid gets healthy and Simon gets a place to stay and friends who respect him for the loving generous person that he is (and also crazy). And we the audience get to relax and stop believing the lie that there is such a thing as human perfection. We learn to accept ourselves and others as having valid points of view, that may seem crazy, especially when combined with our own insanity, and realize that we can be kind and generous to each other, even if they aren't the perfect person we insist we're entitled to.  The title sums up everything. If you're happy, if you feel good, that's good enough, in fact it's as good as it gets. BTW, I like to write about this movie. I've done it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22as+good+as+it+gets%22&quot;&gt;bunch of times&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

The book is an introduction to psychology, it explains why we aren't the logical perfect people we imagine we are, as we are told we should be, and why the people we mate with always push our buttons so thoroughly and seem to contribute to our misery, when the promise was that they would do alleviate it. Basically our upbringing and education about how life works were all lies, designed to get us to conform, to be good little consumers and reproducers, and our happiness had nothing to do with anything. So if you are lucky enough to find yourself in a loving relationship and find it isn't working out as you hoped it would, I couldn't recommend this book more highly. I'm reading it again now as sort of a refresher, the way you watch an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=succession+season+4+episode+4&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; a few times.</description>

			<description>I'm not going to leave Twitter in support of NPR. You can only do that once, and if I'm ever going to do it, it's going to be for a better reason, esp when other mainstream news orgs aren't leaving in sympathy.</description>

			<description>I just got notice that Twitter was turning off the identity service for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;my.1999.io&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first one that I care about. Gets me thinking about how I might resurrect this app. I wrote it shortly after I became a fan of Facebook. I wanted to create a blogging system around their UI breakthoughs, and to improve on them.</description>

			<description>I had ChatGPT write some SQL code for me. I probably could have figured it out in a couple of hours, but instead it took me five minutes to specify the problem, and it took ChatGPT another five minutes to code it up and explain it to me. I wanted to see how many feeds each FeedLand user is the &quot;first subscriber&quot; of. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/13/mysql-database-design-users-feeds.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of the conversation.</description>

			<description>I'm not getting very much work done these days. Still more work to do on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. And after that I'm thinking the next project might be a Linux port for Frontier. I really want to leave a functioning &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; behind as part of my body of work. And the Mac isn't a very reliable platform going forward. It's so funny -- the best product I ever did, really -- and it got all mired in the jealousy of Apple employees. Thinking about it.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/12/spacex-funding-in-2022.html&quot;&gt;According to ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; just one of Musk's companies, SpaceX, received almost $10 billion from the US government in 2020, the last year ChatGPT has data for. In contrast, NPR received no money directly from the US government, and a few million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is partially funded by the US government. In other words, if receiving money from the US government to subsidize your business is a sin, Musk is a far greater sinner than NPR.</description>

			<description>I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/11/air-fryer-explained.html&quot;&gt;air fryer&lt;/a&gt; and had a chance to try it on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_eye_steak&quot;&gt;rib-eye steak&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and omg it was sooo good. It took six minutes to cook, and then a few minutes to &quot;rest&quot; and it was as delicious as a steak off the grill, but without any of the work. I got the &quot;budget pick&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/COSORI-Airfryer-Dishwasher-Safe-freidora-Exclusive/dp/B0936FGLQS/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1PC51CTUNFD0Q&amp;keywords=COSORI%2BAir%2BFryer%2BPro%2BLE%2B5-Qt&amp;qid=1681214771&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sprefix=cosori%2Bair%2Bfryer%2Bpro%2Ble%2B5-qt%2Cgarden%2C88&amp;sr=1-3&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18630bbb-fcbb-42f8-9767-857e17e03685&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; by Wirecutter. It's easy to use, just plug it in and press some buttons. Not sure what I'll use the toaster oven for now.</description>

But -- is there anything other than conforming? Is there any way for any of us to be unique? When I think of my friends, I think of their individuality. I don't think I judge anyone based on their conformity. But I think I am always judged negatively for not conforming. It's all very confusing. I'll let you know if I figure it out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
