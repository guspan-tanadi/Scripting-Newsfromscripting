			<description>My new (today!) chatbot, programmed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/scriptingNewsSource/scriptingInMarkdown.zip&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog, going back 28+ years, is up and I've been playing with it, and am as impressed as I hoped I would. An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/28/whoInventedRss.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, I asked who invented RSS? Can you imagine how much I’ve written about RSS in 20+ years? The first part is boilerplate, could have come from any site, but the second part was a very concise, thorough and interesting synopsis of years of &lt;i&gt;my writing&lt;/i&gt; about feeds. The chatbot did very good work.</description>

			<description>One great thing about the new chatbot for my blog is that it gives me a greater incentive to post here, vs social media. Of course we must be just days away from a Mastodon instance that you pay to join that adds every tweet to its dataset. A place of record. Maybe they should even charge per tweet.</description>

			<description>In the next election the Dems must make the Repubs defend the idea of school kids being murdered without any help from the government. If they can't manage that, we need to find new political leaders. And when the Repubs bullshit, the Dems have to say they're bullshitting.</description>

			<description>Silicon Valley is full of sore winners (and losers). Not a whole lot of grace there, imho. But, tucked away in the corners, far from public view, there are still a few people there who get off on making great products and actually do.</description>

			<description>I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/19/152612.html&quot;&gt;my Tesla&lt;/a&gt; over a year ago and it still feels like a privilege to drive it. Like I won the lottery. I feel like a teen with his first car when I drive it. It's so smooth and powerful, grabs the curves on mountain roads so effortlessly. Elon Musk -- feh. What a schmuck. But they obviously have some wonderful engineers inside Tesla who dreamed of making the best car ever, and somehow they &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; it.</description>

			<title>Started on Scripting chatbot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelhop.io/&quot;&gt;pixelhop&lt;/a&gt;, in the UK on this. Started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/255&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For this project, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/scriptingNewsSource/scriptingInMarkdown.zip&quot;&gt;one big archive&lt;/a&gt; with all the stuff I have from 1994 to 2023. All converted to Markdown, organized by year, with a separate folder for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt;, which is how it all started in 1994. We should just import all of it. And that will be the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As we make progress I'll report it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/255&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- I was sure Scripting News would make a good test case for this stuff, because the archive goes back so far and includes lots of stuff from other blogs, esp at the beginning. It was the hub for the early blogosphere. I think researchers in general will find it's a strong use-case if not reference source. I was very conscious of this as the years went by, and tried to make it an archive not just for my work but for what was going on around it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Spoilers follow. Last night was the first episode of the last season. At the end, two characters who are married came to the conclusion they'll divorce. A sad moment, beautifully acted. The scene ends with them lying on a bed together, clothed, far apart, but holding hands. I thought, if you're going to do it, this is the way. Let there be at least a little love in the last moment.</description>

			<description>It would be nice if someone developed a Mastodon gateway for apps. A system that played the role that twitter.com played for the Twitter API (only it would be really easy to be better, btw). Otherwise does every developer really have to do one of their own? That's gotta be factorable. Just because Twitter is languishing, it doesn't mean that a new system that does what Twitter did, without any of the Muskness or history, couldn't come in and fill the space occupied by Twitter. Don't assume people don't want. I bet a lot do. Learned this from our experience with RSS. You have to accept facts, not be wishful about these things. Be prepared.</description>

			<description>Ken Smith tried an experiment.

It took me the longest time to find this song which was buzzing around my head this morning, but I couldn't find the lyrics. What I was ultimately looking for was this line: &quot;What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz.&quot; I was asking for &lt;i&gt;beautiful world&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;beautiful girl. &lt;/i&gt;A few minutes later another bit of a lyric became clear and it turned out to be the title of the song. I brought it to Bard, it got it right off. A few seconds later Alexa was playing it for me. So ChatGPT is also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, which was a breakthrough because all of a sudden we could program our own music. It'd amaze today's young people to know there was a time when we had to depend on radio stations to get around to the song we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jonesing&quot;&gt;jonesing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jonesing&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;. We'd sit there with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck&quot;&gt;cassette recorder&lt;/a&gt; waiting for the song to come around so we could get a copy of it. Then think of what a huge revelation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; was. All of a sudden the floodgates of music opened up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia&quot;&gt;Jerry Garcia&lt;/a&gt; didn't make it to that moment, he would've loved it, I'm sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&quot;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was alive, not sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bollier.org/blog/goodbye-pete-seeger&quot;&gt;how he felt&lt;/a&gt; about it. But anyone who really loved music imho, had to have been overjoyed. People were talking about music in airports and supermarkets. You had to be there. Napster was like years of Christmas every day for music lovers everywhere. Of course the music industry didn't agree.</description>

All of a sudden the floodgates of music opened up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia&quot;&gt;Jerry Garcia&lt;/a&gt; didn't make it to that moment, he would've loved it, I'm sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&quot;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was alive, not sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bollier.org/blog/goodbye-pete-seeger&quot;&gt;how he felt&lt;/a&gt; about it. But anyone who really loved music imho, had to have been overjoyed. People were talking about music in airports and supermarkets. You had to be there. Napster was like years of Christmas every day for music lovers everywhere. Of course the music industry didn't agree." created="Sun, 26 Mar 2023 14:54:12 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/16/santaCoke.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/03/26.html#a145412"/>

I'm still pretty confused about what it is, the same way I was confused about the web in 1994 when I first got Mosaic and was reading various early websites. I can use it, but how do I create for it? I have a huge dataset of my own, most of 28+ years of my writing here on Scripting News starting in 1994. Anyway, the first thing I did was ask if I can add my own data to their massive dataset (their term) and it said yes. I asked how, and it sounds really easy, totally within my ability to do, and almost certainly within your ability too. I took screen shots of the relevant parts of the discussion and added it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254#issuecomment-1484102808&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I started on this topic.

			<description>Here's the thing about Twitter. Since they started showing the number of impressions on every tweet, you can see how meaningless the number of followers is. You could have 66.7K followers, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1639404110725402626&quot;&gt;your tweet&lt;/a&gt; might still only get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/25/tweetscreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;764 views&lt;/a&gt;. Once, a long time ago, Twitter was a flow machine. Now it's like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2022/11/29/drying-california-lake-to-get-250m-in-us-drought-funding&quot;&gt;dry lakebed&lt;/a&gt;. A void. It looks like Twitter used to look, but looks aren't everything.</description>

			<description>On the dark side, AI is going to be a great tool for 1984-type governments, because with a single script you could rewrite history everywhere. Write people out, and other people in.

What if I have no prompts, what's the result? They say be careful of the cost, what is the cost based on. I feel lost like I did when I first saw what the web could do, I wanted to know -- how do I set up a node on the next. The answers I got from those in the know made no sense to me, until they did.

			<title>Looking for Chat/AI expertise</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know if you read this blog, I've been intrigued and enthusiastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chatgpt&quot;&gt;about ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; as many people have, and specifically am anxious to load up one of these with the content of my blog so I can see what can be learned from the aggregation of what I've written. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have over 25 years of archive, all in &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, a flavor of XML. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course OPML can be converted into any other reasonable XML or JSON-based format. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's all by one author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.com/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;, covering roughly the same topics for all those years, including pointers to source sites.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For reference, here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; where my archive is stored. You're welcome to experiment with it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I've been writing about this, another blogger, &lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;, has the same thought about his &quot;corpus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We'd like to work with a developer or group of developers who have mastered the technology behind ChatGPT and other similar systems. We don't want to become experts in this technology. But we are willing to do the work to get our data in a compatible format.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to discuss, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I still use Twitter</title>

I don't see any fascist messages, or antisemitism, or race hate, for some reason -- that everyone else seems to see. I still have longtime friends who I only see here. It still has that annoying character limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also use Mastodon, and it's more interesting all the time, esp when it comes to technical discussions. One thing I don't like about Mastodon culture is it seems to assume Twitter is over, and only terrible people use it. This feels a lot like the political divide in the US and elsewhere. I don't find this is a political thing for me. Maybe I'm too old to give a shit. That's probably it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who say Musk is stupid don't understand how this works. No one who has reached his position in the world is even remotely stupid. Same thing with presidents, or people who reach the pinnacle of accomplishment in anything. There's more to it than you can see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk may have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/22/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;screwed with&lt;/a&gt; Tesla's products, but he had the good sense not to screw with the driving experience, which still is like nothing else I've ever loved in a car, and I've had some good cars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has screwed with Twitter, I guess, but so far it's still Twitter after all is said and done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A cool feature for FeedLand users. When you &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; an item, it's automatically added to two RSS feeds -- one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;your likes&lt;/a&gt;, and one for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/all.xml&quot;&gt;likes of all users&lt;/a&gt; on your FeedLand.It's basically a single-gesture linkblog. There's a lot of that in FeedLand, where things have been factored to a point where they couldn't possibly be simpler. Of course since they're standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, you could follow them from any feed reader.</description>

I was very excited, and it shows. In hindsight, I was about to have some great adventures. One of the best experiences of my life. Now twenty years later, I'm still very grateful for having had the opportunity to work with the people I met at Harvard, and the power afforded to me with the H-bomb business card. The friends I made there still benefit me to this day, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference.</description>

			<description>So it's been twenty years since I started at Berkman. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nesson&quot;&gt;Charlie Nesson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain&quot;&gt;Jon Zittrain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey&quot;&gt;John Palfrey&lt;/a&gt; for giving me the chance. Met so many who became lifelong friends, and the things we accomplished really did make a difference.</description>

			<description>I remember when I got a key to the building. I didn't ask for it, and I certainly didn't expect it.  My first thought was hmmm i wonder what i can do with &lt;i&gt;this?&lt;/i&gt;  That's where the regular Thursday evening meetup came from.</description>

			<description>The first thing I did when I started at Berkman, twenty years ago, was to get a blogging server up and running. It was 2003, so I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, a product we made at UserLand. It was the first weblog server at any university, in the world. Early days. A few years after I left they converted to WordPress. A solid move both times because by then UserLand had shut down and the default blogging server was the software made by my friend Matt.</description>

			<title>Don't conflate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you should never do in reporting a bug is conflate two events that might not have anything to do with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to work to figure out that you're doing this. Esp when a lot of unnecessary info is mixed in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because theories like this from people who aren't familiar with how the code works behind the scenes (no reason you should be) almost never get this right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to boil it down to the minimal number of steps-to-reproduce. Those are facts that are incontrovertible. That one problem caused another? Probably not. In general. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, if you're being asked to log in every time you go to the site, you're probably opening it via a bookmark that goes to the old URL. The easiest fix is to edit bookmark so it goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;https://feedland.org/&lt;/a&gt; -- note the &lt;i&gt;https.&lt;/i&gt; Another fix is to do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;hard-reload&lt;/a&gt; of the page. This will force a new version to reload. It redirects if it gets a non https request.</description>

But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;docs page&lt;/a&gt; to answer this question. Looks pretty good to me! No bullshit in the page either.</description>

If you're signed in, to subscribe to a feed just click the feed's checkbox. You can also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?userslist&quot;&gt;who's been on&lt;/a&gt; recently, when they signed up, how many feeds they subscribe to, and how many pages they've viewed. You can also see the feeds that have recently been &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?log&quot;&gt;subscribed to&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to make feed discovery as easy as it possibly can be. We steal (and improve on) ideas from social media apps that didn't exist last time I took a fresh look at feed systems. I don't think of FeedLand as a feed reader -- it's more of a feed management system, imho.</description>
