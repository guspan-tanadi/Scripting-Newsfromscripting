			<description>It's nice to see two people you know on Facebook are friends only because you know both of them. Like Dan Conover and Steve Goodman. Cori Kesler and NakedJen. I'm sure I'll think of others. A visible legacy. In basketball, an assist.</description>

			<title>I remember Watergate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember Watergate and the Gerald Ford pardon of Richard Nixon. Because right now that's the prior art. That's the event we're paying for now, and it seems as if we're about to repeat the mistake Ford made. While all the attention is focused on Putin and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember Watergate. And I remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon&quot;&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt;, and remember that some people were very angry about it but I wasn't -- I was relieved. Finally we could stop obsessing over Nixon. He was obviously guilty right from the outset. Yet it took what seemed an incredibly long time to get from the initial reports of the break-in to his waving goodbye from the White House lawn as he left for the last time. That was the way I wanted to remember Nixon. Humiliated, brought down, going &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0&quot;&gt;off to exile&lt;/a&gt; to spend the rest of his days wondering what if he hadn't cheated. Because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3iF4Rpe&quot;&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of Watergate is the same issue as the heart of Trump, only what Trump did was a million times worse. We excused Nixon. I guess Trump, who is also old enough to remember it (he's ten years older than me) wasn't too concerned about paying a price if his attempted coup didn't work. Now they're getting ready to do it again, they're doing it in the open, and it looks like a perfect plan. If it works, we've already had the last real national election in the US. From now-on they will all be Putinesqe parodies of fair elections. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0&quot;&gt;Nixon's farewell&lt;/a&gt;, 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine how the rest of the world sees the January 6 attack on the US Capitol?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: It scares the shit out of them. Because the main product the US sells is safety. Our financial system is where the world stores their money for safe keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What scares them even more? We haven't done anything about it. Trump and all the people who organized the coup are free. No prospect of any punishment. The can do it again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're smart you're looking for the next safe place to put your savings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to know this -- why isn't journalism running constant articles, reports and panels on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When will Trump be charged?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We failed to learn the lesson from Nixon it seems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of the networks should give time to Dan Rather to look at the story from that angle. Every night at an assigned time. Rather reported Watergate. No doubt he remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: One thing that seems evident after the Putin attack on Ukraine. The only people outside the US who want the Repubs to win are other despots whose people would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu#Death&quot;&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; them if they could. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be cool if we had a channel that could speak directly to the Russian people to tell them that many of us in the US are of Russian descent, we celebrate the culture, but we can't have you guys invading sovereign countries, and that's our main problem with Russia.</description>

			<description>The idea that software is a process was the big idea in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html&quot;&gt;We Make Shitty Software&lt;/a&gt; in September 1995.   Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/25/shittyQuote.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the relevant portion. I got a lot of shit from devs who said they don't make shitty software, but in fact, they do. All devs do. Those that don't know they do don't know to set up a process that accounts for the shittiness of their software. A corollary -- some of the shittiest software is made by devs who think their software &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; shitty.</description>

			<description>Putin must not have known how much power he had. Ukraine is small potatoes. He was the czar of one half of the political system of the US.

			<description>The point of yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/23/135414.html?title=aPhilosophicalQuestion&quot;&gt;philosophical question&lt;/a&gt; was this. The Constitution says the government may not search you unless there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20probable%20cause,or%20was%20committing%20a%20crime.&quot;&gt;probable cause&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn't mean that people you invite to enter your house should be allowed to go through your private stuff. It may not be illegal, but we still recognize it as wrong. In the same way, you have &quot;free speech&quot; in America, even when it isn't the government restricting your speech, when it's your employer, school, family or friends. No law prohibits them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1357/&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;, but being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans of all persuasions, wrong, un-American.</description>

The Constitution says the government may not search you unless there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20probable%20cause,or%20was%20committing%20a%20crime.&quot;&gt;probable cause&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn't mean that people you invite to enter your house should be allowed to go through your private stuff. It may not be illegal, but we still recognize it as wrong. In the same way, you have &quot;free speech&quot; in America, even when it isn't the government restricting your speech, when it's your employer, school, family or friends. No law prohibits them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1357/&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;, but being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans of all persuasions, wrong, un-American." created="Thu, 24 Mar 2022 13:47:45 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/24.html#a134745"/>

			<title>Are African-Americans fungible?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First let me say up front that, of course, African-Americans are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fungible. It's a stupid question, but I didn't raise it -- the Supreme Court process did, over many decades of the comings and goings of black justices and also women.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So -- are racism and genderism part of the Supreme Court process? Yes they are and I can prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall&quot;&gt;Thurgood Marshall&lt;/a&gt; retired, the Repubs replaced him with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=who+replaced+thurgood+marshall&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the &quot;African-American&quot; seat's significance was supposedly preserved. Marshall was the Supreme Court's first African-American justice. Thomas is the second.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;African-Americans are fungible, they seemed to say. Of course Marshall and Thomas, even though both were black, were almost exact opposites in philosophy and rage-suppression. The former was very liberal, a highly respected scholar, and the latter is fascist and resentful, and the depths of his depravity are only now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086535100/wife-of-justice-thomas-rebuts-claims-of-conflict-of-interest&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; died, she was replaced with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett&quot;&gt;ACB&lt;/a&gt;. Yes both are women, and thus women are considered fungible as well, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, at least by some people, in some sense. Politically, ACB is the opposite of RBG, probably is committed to reversing all of RBG's accomplishments. Yet the number of women on the court remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is in the hospital while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson&quot;&gt;Ketanji Brown Jackson&lt;/a&gt; hearings are going on, which gets you to consider that the number of AA's on the court would be preserved if KBJ was ratified and the unspeakable happens to CT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I actually love the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=fungible&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;fungible&lt;/a&gt; for some reason, always have, so I was somewhat delighted that the latest tech scam are NFTs where the F stands for fungible. This means I get to think of this word more often and that generally makes me happy for some odd reason. I hope the scamminess of NFTs doesn't end up spoiling that, or maybe I'm wrong and NFTs are the basis for a new capitalism? I have been wrong before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A philosophical question</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Constitution says the government can't conduct unreasonable searches, without a warrent or probable cause. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone you have invited into your house goes through your private stuff. Reads your diary, your financial records, calendar, contacts list. Looks in your medicine cabinet, your collection of drugs, legal and illegal, sex toys. Etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Should you be prevented from writing a tweet or a blog post about how it felt to be violated that way? Would it be fair to rebut the post by talking about the Constitution? Can you imagine someone actually doing that? (I can't, it would seem pretty cruel.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, with the question posed this way, it's ridiculous to think someone would be condemned for expressing their thoughts and feelings about being so violated. Note that I didn't say their rights were violated, in any legal sense. But their rights were violated in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might not be illegal for someone you invite into your house to violate your privacy, but legality isn't the only thing we're permitted to write about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Then I copy the text and paste it into the Scripting News outline. Edit it, review it and then decide it's not worth the trouble and hit the backspace key. Back to work.</description>

What will come out of it will not be a feed reader in the sense that people think of them for the last 20 or so years. They all try to read everything, and that makes it hard to go beyond the intersection of features found in all feeds. I don't see any point in producing yet another one of those. If people producing blogging software want to give this another shot, they should be ready to retool, a bit. Not very much. Maybe not at all (if you've been considerate in your feeds). And not breaking anything. This is absolute. I will not break anyone either with feeds I produce (I write a popular blog and make blogging software.) Which is a bit tricky because there are important features in my feeds that most readers don't support thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. This is how everything got broken. I want to go back to before this all became such a mess, and slowly and carefully pull through something beautifully simple and easy to work with. And then go from there. Not leaving the past behind, but also not being limited by it. It's possible. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I gotta say there are a few public figures who, if they died tonight, I'd do a little jig, drink a toast, in private of course. In anticipation my heart beats a little faster.

			<title>If money is speech...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1505904993223725058&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi tweets&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You're probably paying for Putin TV.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's right, you are. If you have a basic cable package that includes Fox News, you're paying your share to keep Tucker Carlson on the air. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Joe, I think this would be an incredible political cause to raise a fuss about. Focus the spotlight on how we're subsidizing Fox. I think that law, whatever it is that makes this possible or necessary, needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's as fundamental as the First Amendment. I should not be required to fund speech that I find abhorrent. The Supreme Court ruled that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC&quot;&gt;money is speech&lt;/a&gt;. Let's get some lawyers working on this! Make news. It's the kind of issue Repubs raise huge money on. And it pisses me off that my money goes to fund the destruction of our political system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote about this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/27.html#a160229&quot;&gt;1/27/2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The Second Amendment’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-slave-owners-dictated-the-language-of-the-2nd-amendment&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; was to enable slavers in Virginia to put down a slave rebellion without depending on the federal government. It wasn't put in the Constitution so people could protect themselves against robbers, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and if appropriate there could be laws that allow it specifically. But it isn't really a Constitutional right.</description>

			<title>A Wordle hack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/20/wordleResult.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; is an addictive word game that became popular and then was bought by the NY Times. It's free to play, as far as I know (I have a NYT subscription so if it weren't free it's possible I might not know). The diagram to the right is a standard, produced by the game. It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's the hack...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you know the second and third letters, as above, and have eliminated a fair number of consonants, and are sure the first letter is a consonant…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Type one of the eligable consonants and the next two letters into a web browser and check out the auto completes. Repeat. That's how I figured out the answer to today's puzzle after I got to the situation in the third line. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty consistently getting the answer in four steps. In the first two steps I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just gathering data. By the third, I constrain my guess by the information I've gathered so far, assuming I've got one or two hits.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case I got two green squares on the first one. I thought for sure I'd get the answer in three instead of four, but I hadn't eliminated enough consonants to be able to puzzle it out. I was surprised by how hard it was after step three, mostly because (I think) this was a weird word, letter-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT editorial is a good sign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of time to write this morning but I wanted to get this out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, my goal for the web has always been that I want the bright minds to be on the web, sharing important stuff that comes from what they do. These people would be considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; in journalism, not reporters. I've been working on this since I first started using the web as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;writing platform&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that keeps bright minds from fully expressing their ideas on the web is the sense that it's a savage place, where people cut you down, make your life miserable, possibly lose you your standing, even your job. So they don't take the step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This idea comes from journalism. From organizations like the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They paint us all with the same brush. They talk about us as monsters. All the same. They don't listen. Only their ideas get out. Reporters are easily fooled, we've learned, with great cost for all of us. Journalism says Facebook sucks, a lot, and that scares some of my neighbors from using Facebook, and keeps us from making connections that would make things work better on a local level. We need more of that. Journalism has stood in the way of good uses of the web. Maybe they don't know they've been doing it, but they have been doing it just the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when a big influential organization like the NYT says, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;its official voice&lt;/a&gt;, that this is a problem, and presumably we should do something about it, I see that as huge progress. We have an ally in organizing our knowlege and passion, the good stuff of human intelect, with their support, instead with their derision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I am so sad when I see people who already have mastered the tools predictably try to put the NYT down for noticing this problem which &lt;i&gt;all of them know about, &lt;/i&gt;I'm sure of it. So who has the old idea and who has the new one? Who's wired and who's tired?  In my mind, the NYT has made a breakthrough. I love it. Build on it. Bring that philosophy into the NYT itself. Look for the good on the web, not just the mean stuff. Set the example. I think the light will come on for others, not all of them, some are too dug in, but progress can be made here, I feel it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Save me the lecture about the First Amendment. I go way back with the fight against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;CDA&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. You use the First Amendment as a hammer, the same way the gun lobby uses the Second Amendment. I see you as exactly like them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I used one of my montly gifts as a NYT subscriber to provide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;link to the editorial&lt;/a&gt;.

Much like the update I did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; last year. Really simple sample code. It was time to pull together the code I use to parse feeds these days in JavaScript apps and publish it as open source. It builds on Dan MacTough's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; package, so it inherits its support of different feed formats: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, Atom and RDF. The result is what developers want in 2022. A simple JavaScript object containing the information in a feed and nothing more. One system call to parse it. Works like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse&quot;&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a simple feed reader could be built. Or any other feed-consuming software. I felt it was time to try to bring this together, enough time has passed, don't you think? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="I have something new coming shortly, it's the beginning of a thread that implements a JavaScript API for feed reading in Node.js. Much like the update I did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; last year. Really simple sample code.

			<description>My two cents: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1504807644963479562&quot;&gt;The NYT Editorial Board is correct&lt;/a&gt;. We all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/220318/p17#a220318p17&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt; what we say to avoid all kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsuris&quot;&gt;tsuris&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it's cops at your house in SWAT gear, guns drawn, responding to a call there's been a murder. Or a knock on the door from a stranger, saying they just wanted to know if this is where you live. It could be a small thing, or it could drive you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape&quot;&gt;out of business&lt;/a&gt;. The key point is people hold back what they think because they don't want the drama or danger that would come from expressing the idea. The rebuttals are stale. Heard them for decades. It doesn't change the fact that there's important ideas not being exchanged. And we need the best minds, with the freshest ideas to deal with the issues of the day.  And btw this kind of suppression is just as effective as what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/florida-senate-approves-dont-say-gay-bill-00015120&quot;&gt;Repubs are doing&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, for example. Think about that, and look in the mirror. You aren't that different from them.</description>
