			<description>We're having a huge snowstorm today in the Catskills. Expecting about two feet of wet heavy snow. I'll probably lose power at some point and my internet connection, but I have Starlink as a backup.</description>

			<description>Rachel Maddow is bullshit. Every time I listen to her, when she's talking about something I know about, she makes something innocent sound nefarious, I assume depending on her viewers not knowing the facts.</description>

A forbidden place. Hardly anything came out, except culture created out of Communist Party lies. I wrote letters to the Chinese Consulate in New York asking for everything they had. They sent a huge poster of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong&quot;&gt;Chairman Mao&lt;/a&gt; and colorful books with gorgeous drawings of Chinese kids doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/13/chairmanMao.png&quot;&gt;amazing things&lt;/a&gt; because they studied the teachings of Chairman Mao. I wasn't stupid, I understood this was propaganda, but I loved the way they did it -- as a genre. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/13/autographFromSixthGrade.png&quot;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt; in one of my best friends' autograph book when we graduated sixth grade and went on to junior high.</description>

			<description>Another glitch -- the other day I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/11.html#a150413&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; FeedLand users who had not already registered an email address to do so now. It's basically impossible for me to test this, because I don't have any accounts to use to test this since the connection with Twitter has been pretty glitchy lately. It turns out it's too late to do this transition, so we'll go ahead with the switch to email identity for feedland.org. When it switches over, you'll have to log into feedland.org using your email address, which should work for people who pre-registered. I know it's complicated, I hate it -- it's the worst use of both of our time, we get no new features for all this bullshit. But Twitter is no longer reliable in this role, so we had to do it. I'll keep you all posted here on progress, and appreciate your patience. I think it'll all be pretty smooth after this change.</description>

Probably due to the switch to Daylight Savings Time, the wrong version of Scripting News went out at midnight. This feels familiar, but there's nothing in my notes about how to work around this. I will have a look at the code during the day today and see if I can figure out what went wrong. I was able to get the correct email to go out at 6AM EDT today by editing the stats.json file for the app to indicate that the email for the day hadn't yet gone out, and it immediately started sending out the correct email.</description>

			<description>On the other hand, we should have an &lt;i&gt;open source Twitter replacement&lt;/i&gt; that's fucking easy to install and runs itself. Node.js. Runs on desktop in Electron for local users. It could be much easier than Mastodon. A fractional-horsepower tweeter. If anyone wants to work on that, let me know, I'd like to be part of such a thing (mostly as a user and app developer).</description>

			<description>Okay now I have to tell you about my latest experience with ChatGPT. The subject is CSS. It's possible to do all kinds of crazy logic on DOM elements, given all the different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt; they have. But how to combine them to do what you want to do? You can stare at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; for hours, and do trial-and-error, but if you're like me, you gave up before you even started. But with ChatGPT, you can formulate the question according to what you want to do, and it creates a docs page that probably never existed before, that shows you, with examples, how to do what you want. I just did that. Amazing. It digs you out of corners. Nothing like this has ever existed.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;what would a chatgpt-like twitter be?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i type a query, and the bot responds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;then you can type a query that builds on mine, starting a new thread, which other people can build on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;the thread to the first tweet forms a stack, a context for each subsequent reply?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;what comes out at the end is pure singularity?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/12/chatgpt-like-twitter-platform.html&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; chatgpt and it says no, it would not be a singularity because &quot;ChatGPT-like models are limited to generating responses based on their training data and do not possess true consciousness or self-awareness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I try to avoid the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/11/demagoguery-appeal-to-emotions.html&quot;&gt;demagoguery&lt;/a&gt; by unfollowing, even blocking people, but it must be growing, because increasingly it can't be avoided and more and more of the messages are touting events that I know are pretty freaking insignificant. As an implementer, you have to watch out if you support features that are only in Mastodon and not based on ActivityPub. Which suggests that as the bigco's start implementing AP support, they're all going to face a conundrum. If we want users to think what we're doing is anything more than symbolic, we're going to have to use the Mastodon API and not ActivityPub, because no one else is doing it in AP, therefore there's nothing to interop with or test against. It's hard to promote a feature when you've never been able to test it. The whole thing is pretty shaky. And most people aren't aware of the subtleties. Time to get out a bucket of popcorn and stay on the sidelines until some of this becomes real.</description>

			<title>What ChatGPT could become</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The thing I look for in &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; style products are new interesting information sets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to work out some JSON-based formats for flowing writing through the engine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to know the cost. And how much human work is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this written up anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately -- we'll use ChatGPT style apps in place of Wikipedia and Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is like GUIs to character based.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or the open internet to proprietary LANs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another generation of every information app on the net, and that's more or less the whole net. A top-to-bottom rewrite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Earlier today I used Google to try to find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few years ago. I am the author. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;. Well a bunch of people copied my file and posted it on their sites, with their template and their ads (I don't have ads), and for whatever reason Google ranks their docs higher. Mine isn't even on the first page. So tell me, how is that Google isn't implementing a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack? Why aren't they taking the heat for delivering incorrect results?</description>

			<description>Same thing happened with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;. There is only one original. Try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=rss+2.0&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=rss+2.0&quot;&gt;find it in Google&lt;/a&gt;. Lotsa luck. There's so much bullshit on the search results page. It's amazing we're trained not to see the lies that Google passes off as facts, but somehow we're supposed to hold the startup accountable instead.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT breakthrough</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I achieved something of a breakthrough with ChatGPT yesterday. I can now do the following: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Search for something in ChatGPT.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on a bookmarklet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A static HTML page opens, ready to be linked to from a blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB2RVlhm5SM&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/march-8-birthdays.html&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; generated in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; I am using, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcubic&quot;&gt;jcubic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/36bec44af6892abb870c5fa798bf7431&quot;&gt;Frontier script&lt;/a&gt; that runs on my desktop, every second.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;the app&lt;/a&gt; that syncs a folder with a location on Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Podcast Wars</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/15/chihuahua.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Re the supposed re-invention of podcasting, coming to a tech tabloid soon... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I probably should have explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/07.html#a182022&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; why having two or more groups claiming to be the future of something that currently no one is fighting over might damage the thing they say they’re trying to help (assuming they are saying that). We've been to this place before. How long before the press starts calling it The Podcast Wars. Some of us will try to douse the flames, to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/bombastic-meaning-4-words.html&quot;&gt;bombastic&lt;/a&gt; names because they want more for themselves than they want for podcasting. I have a lot of experience with this. People are always looking for a way to make a billion dollars. It never occurs to them that if it all has to be for them, there will be nothing. Now a whole new generation has to learn that again, and as usual the thing that pays for it is podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know all the people, or what they're planning to do, but the names they chose for their efforts tells me they don't want work with anyone, they may say they do, but they've reserved for themselves the authority over -- &quot;podcasting,&quot; if you can believe that bullshit. They're all little people trying to sound like big people. If you want to do some good for podcasting, throw your ideas out there in the middle, and fight for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;. When the other guy does something that you do, do it their way. That's how you build.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My sense is it's too late to fuck over podcasting, that it's mostly for the people involved that I ask them to lower expectations, and don't try to make this a business model. But if they want to do it, they'll do it and the press will have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22podcast+wars%22&quot;&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; to write about, and in the end &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/podcasting-definition.html&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; will stay what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Heard someone say you can't leave your PhD to your children, but you can leave them your farm. I take exception. Both my parents had a PhDs, and this gave me examples for the value of knowledge and intellect, and how to figure things out.

The new things in open formats tend to sound boring when you first hear about them, they take a few years to fill out, but this is enough to get the ball rolling. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is imho going to be an important product. NetNewsWire already is. Between the two products there's enough to start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. Now I'm using their announcement to entice others to jump on board. They're listening more carefully than before. That's why I'm writing this second post, to be sure people don't miss it. Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInFeeds&quot;&gt;developer notes&lt;/a&gt; for adding Markdown to your feeds and to your reader software.</description>

			<source:outline text="BTW, the bit about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/issues/3896&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire supporting&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;source:markdown&lt;/a&gt; element in RSS may sound ho-hum, but it's actually huge. The new things in open formats tend to sound boring when you first hear about them, they take a few years to fill out, but this is enough to get the ball rolling. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is imho going to be an important product. NetNewsWire already is. Between the two products there's enough to start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. Now I'm using their announcement to entice others to jump on board. They're listening more carefully than before. That's why I'm writing this second post, to be sure people don't miss it. Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInFeeds&quot;&gt;developer notes&lt;/a&gt; for adding Markdown to your feeds and to your reader software." created="Mon, 06 Mar 2023 15:34:06 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/30/grannySmithApple.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/03/06.html#a153406"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/05/immanuel-quickley-carries-knicks-over-celtics-in-double-ot/&quot;&gt;Last night's Knicks game&lt;/a&gt; was wonderful. As the Nets gave up on their buy-a-championship nightmare, the slow-growth Knicks approach has been going great. I'm sure the Knicks would've signed KD or Kyrie if they had offered, but so thankful they diss'd the Knicks instead. Idiots. Now the normal order has been restored. Hopefully the Knicks continue to add pieces slowly and let home-grown stars like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;IQ&lt;/a&gt; continue to grow. It's intoxicating to watch him get the chance to excel as in last night's game, and completely exceed all reasonable expectations. The whole team is fantastic. Our loyalty to the team has paid off.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/city-names-with-t-english.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;:  &quot;Give me the names of 23 cities, anywhere in the world, whose names begin with T and have exactly three syllables in their names.&quot; Obviously some are wildly wrong. But it's still useful to come up with potential codenames for projects. Better than my previous way of doing it, browsing a Google Map sort of randomly.</description>

			<description>I have a new way of syncing up my outline with the public web, and it's quite a bit slower than the previous method. Which means sometimes I rebuild my home page before all the changes are uploaded, leading to some hilarious mistaken posts. Have to tighten this up.</description>
