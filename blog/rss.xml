			<description>Following up on yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/21.html#a174124&quot;&gt;hypothetical&lt;/a&gt;, assuming people from blue states relocated to sparsely populated states, let's do an example. The population of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=population+wyoming&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; is 579K. The population one of the boroughs of NYC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=population+queens+ny&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, is 2.3 million. So if 15 percent of the people in Queens relocated to Wyoming, that could yield three more non-fascist Electoral College votes, one member of the House and two Senators.</description>

			<description>Facebook, now that you've merged friend requests and notifications of new posts from friends, the fact that spam friend requests are out of control has become a more serious problem. I don't want to deal with the spam while checking out what my friends say. And there's a small chance a friend request is not spam, and there isn't enough info in the list to tell. So I just delete all of them. I get about 10 spam friend requests every day, or at least that's what it was before they got merged with other stuff. Either get the spam under control, or re-separate them.</description>

			<title>Racism and misogyny are on the ballot in 2020</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Racism and misogyny are on the ballot this year. Even white men can now feel the effects. I think that's what the last twelve years in the US have been about. Here's the story. George W. Bush was so awful, we needed an antidote, and we liked Obama. We liked how sassy he was, and smart, and how well he spoke, his confidence and ambition. The whole package. It was his moment. Trump is the reaction because there were a lot of Americans who felt tremendous fear and resentment in having a young sassy (they'd probably say uppity) black man as president, no matter that he brought the economy back from the wreck that the Repubs left us. Remember how they drove it into a ditch. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So in 2016 it was Trump vs HRC. But before that it was Sanders vs HRC. That's where I, a white man, learned how men keep women down. In the debates I was so angry that Sanders interrupted and screamed over HRC, his arms waved into her space. She had to take it. Could she respond in kind? No way. Not sure what the women's equivalent of uppity is, but it's a real thing. And because she was my candidate, I felt it, felt it in a way I had never felt it before. I was enraged by it. But it seems most people couldn't even see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people who hated that a black man was president sure as hell weren't going to follow him with a woman president. No matter that she's smart as a whip, would have been a great president, and look who she was running against. What a slap in the face for women as equals -- that so many people chose a huckster, buffoon, Putin surrogate, man-child, tax evader, draft dodger, rich kid, criminal, instead of HRC. It really says something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning while getting ready to write it hit me. The last four years have been a symbolic lynching of Barack Obama. Anyone who still approves of Trump, if they have a mind, must be driven by rage, the kind of rage that results in a young confident black man being strung up on a tree. They're willing to let a virus decimate the country in order to express their rage. Anyone who votes for Trump this time, imho, should lose the right to call themselves an American. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was something of a puzzle to me why racism became the big issue this summer, as the virus was raging through our population. But it would have been even if there had been no virus. Maybe we don't realize it at a conscious level, but the humiliation of the last four years, even for white men in the US, has been that the hatred of blacks and women in our fellow Americans has been exposed, they can't hide from it now. It's out there for everyone to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It took a fully competent African-American president and a fully competent woman candidate for white men to really see it. Some of us &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; the idea of putting racism and misogyny behind us, and others hated it. But it's fully out there now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Apple hates devs, always has</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1980-something I was invited to give a talk at Apple along with a reporter from the NYT. The idea was that we would give feedback to Apple people to help them work better with developers and the press. I took the assignment seriously. I showed up with a list of requests, things Apple could do to give their platform an advantage over the IBM PC, their chief competitor at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I finished, Apple people lined up to give &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; feedback on how ungrateful I am. They do all the work and I make all the money and get all the glory. Funny thing, because I viewed it exactly the other way around. They had real salaries and benefits. I was always skating on thin ice. There were plenty of times when I didn't have any idea how I was going to pay the bills. They never had that concern. They could break me, I couldn't break them. They had all the power. They resented that the VPs at Apple would take my calls or respond to my emails, and those emails would be circulated with notes like &quot;Please do something about this,&quot; which of course resulted in nothing happening other than more resentment. The bosses didn't listen to them, but then again, they didn't listen to the bosses either. They really held the keys, the top people at Apple had no clue about how computers worked, so they were at the mercy of the people in the room who expressed their displeasure with me that day in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did have friends at Apple, people I could take to lunch and ask wtf just happened. It turns out that the rank and file at Apple hate everyone. They hate their bosses, their bosses' bosses. And the press. And most of all, developers. On top of the list loudmouth developers like me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What can you say. Some things never change. They were wrong then, developers saved their jobs over and over. Now they don't need anyone to save their jobs, they're floating on a vast ocean of cash. But someday they will need devs. When it works there's tremendous synergy between developers and platform vendors. But employees of the platform vendors are usually big obstacles to success. They hurt, feel unloved, unappreciated, underpaid, dispensible, ripped off. And I don't know of anything that can be done about that. As they say, it is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In all media I want to pay for what I use. Instead everything is priced flat rate, itâ€™s all pretty much a ripoff. I have Hulu, Disney+, YouTube TV, Netflix, AppleTV+, Amazon. I mostly just watch news and sports. I pay a lot of money for nothing. It's as ridiculous as with new websites. As a user I want an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if people from the cities migrated to places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/wyoming_rb/&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/idaho_rb/&quot;&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, where very few people vote, yet they have two senators and extra &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College&quot;&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; oomph. Might not even be too late for the November election in some states. And btw, Zoom works in Wyoming too. It's almost like a bug fix for the Constitution. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/podcasts/the-daily/nba-coronavirus-basketball.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; explains what it's like for a reporter inside the NBA bubble. Totally worth listening to. But as with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a162754&quot;&gt;last Daily&lt;/a&gt; I listened to, it has a significant error. At the end they say that what the NBA has done is too expensive to replicate elsewhere, but -- it's not true. The NBA is doing what China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Iceland, Singapore, Vietnam did. How did I learn about this? From the Daily podcast, in repeated interviews with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Donald+McNeil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. An NBA-style bubble can be as large as the US.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/aPodcastToProgressives.m4a&quot;&gt;A podcast to progressives&lt;/a&gt;. This was the convention for all Americans who want to fight the virus and keep the Constitution. We know for a fact that progressives want this. We have to appeal to people who may be on the fence. &lt;i&gt;The DNC was a commercial. &lt;/i&gt;Marketing. It wasn't there to make you feel heard. Personally I think to fight the virus we'll need to have single payer soon after Biden takes office. There may never be a moment where you hear from everyone that you were right. You'll have to find the glory within yourself.</description>

			<description>Sometimes you have something to say but it's a general thing, not about one specific instance. For example, someone could come up with yet another exhausting attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.c2.com/?NotInventedHere&quot;&gt;re-invent&lt;/a&gt; RSS without saying that's what it is. The tech world is littered with them. Each one is a bad idea. But I'm not going to call out any specific one, that's not practical. I'd be saying it all the time.</description>

			<title>Biden nailed it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's DNC went by quickly. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1296681978029322241&quot;&gt;funny&lt;/a&gt;. The speakers spoke warmly of Joe Biden, including Bernie Sanders. Everything was great until the moment Biden stepped up to speak. His first few sentences were awkward, the words were vague and muffled. I started to get up from the chair, not wanting to listen. I thought I'd clean up and go to bed, but I decided that I have to sit through this, so I did, and I was quickly riveted and glad to hear him touch on all the important points, ones that no one had made through the week. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until that point I thought Michelle Obama's speech was the best. I thought Barack Obama's was weak. I don't think the Constitution is the strongest appeal, it's the lack of leadership, we're all left to fend for ourselves against a virus that's killing huge numbers of Americans. We could deal with a little authoritarianism, I feel, if it was in the cause of saving our lives. The fear isn't rooted in the 170K Americans who have already died, it's the next 170K and the ones after that. We all want to survive this. With Trump in for four more years, our chances of not being destroyed by the virus are zero. I think that is by far the strongest appeal. And until Biden, amazingly, in four days of the DNC, no one had made it. He didn't quite make it explicitly either, but he came pretty close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I often feel there's this divide between our leaders and the people. And I don't kid myself, the divide is there between Biden and us too. All the stories about how he gave people his phone number, or sat down and talked for hours with a random person, those are touching for sure, and even if they are real, I know he'll never call me. It was the equivalent of having a beer with Bush or shooting hoops with Obama. I wish one of these politicians had a practical vision -- of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;political social network&lt;/a&gt; that mobilized us 365 days a year, every year, not just when there's an election. Biden is not that person, nor is Kamala Harris. When they're elected they will govern like Obama did, and will be vulnerable to the same Republican sabotage that he was. But. Biden was not awkward. His speech was more a fireside chat than a DNC acceptance speech. Yes, I am convinced he is on our side, relative to the current president. A low bar for sure, but it grabs me emotionally, also physically, cheering, sobbing. It would be such a relief, on Election Day, to find we had come together and elected Biden and Harris in such large numbers that everyone will see what a fool Trump is, even his most vocal supporters, and we'll tell him to STFU, with one voice, and just retire in disgrace to his bunker in Russia. It's a dream I allow myself to have. And it was supported by Biden's speech last night. That's political speech at its best. It was a good thing I sat my butt back down and listened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder why the DNC didn't create an actual crowd for one or two speeches. It can be done safely. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4&quot;&gt;eulogy&lt;/a&gt; Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Maybe they'll create such an event tonight for the presidential nominee. I went to Obama's acceptance speech in Denver in 2008 in a football stadium. Quite an event.</description>

I'm sure they've thought it through, but next year we'll know a lot more about living with the virus than we do now. Look at how much we've learned in the last six months. Net-net, we'll do better in terms of human lives, if we give it more time. Work up to it slowly. Maybe have conferences on campus but do everything else online. Create projects for people to do collaboratively. I know the economics are dismal. But I think it's better if universities die to keep students alive rather than the other way.</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/podcasts/the-daily/dejoy-postal-service-trump.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about Trump and the USPS. They present something as theory that I'm pretty sure is fact, that Trump is trying to and quite possibly succeeding at making the postal service incapable of doing its part in the November 3 election. Also, they got an important fact wrong, if this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/trump-mailboxes-sorters-usps-2020-election-louis-dejoy-20200816.html&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The author of the NYT story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater&quot;&gt;Luke Broadwater&lt;/a&gt;, said that disabling by-mail voting would not hurt Democrats more than Republicans. On the other hand, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png&quot;&gt;Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt;, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. &lt;b&gt;Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. &lt;/b&gt;So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction.</description>

			<description>I finished John Barry's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. I would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend it, if your goal is to learn as much as you can about the pandemic itself. In the afterword, Barry explains why the book isn't really about the pandemic, it's about how scientists collaborate. He used the pandemic as an example. I had pretty much already figured that out. So much information about the lives of the individual scientists. It went on and on. I skipped whole chapters. Now, I like a good story as much as anyone, but nothing about his tale made me care about them as people. And that isn't why I picked up the book. I want to learn as much as I can about influenza pandemics, because I'm living in the middle of one. To his credit, the book was published 15 years ago, long before Covid-19. I'm going to keep looking for a book that focuses on the science.</description>

			<description>BTW, then as now the government lied about the disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has since had his reputation somewhat cleaned up, was apparently not a very great president. Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video&quot;&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu.

The same story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/woodrow-wilsons-case-of-the-flu-and-how-pandemics-change-history&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker earlier this year. He also says the flu resulted in Wilson's stroke and disability. Perhaps a cautionary fact for our current president. Also interesting that there is no mention of &quot;influenza&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for Wilson! Amazing. I wonder how Trump's epitaph will read? I expect Covid-19 will be prominent.</description>

			<source:outline text="BTW, then as now the government lied about the disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has since had his reputation somewhat cleaned up, was apparently not a very great president. Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video&quot;&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu. He theorizes that the terrible deal that Germany got was due to Wilson's flu, and if he had not gotten ill, maybe Germany wouldn't have gone fascist?

			<description>Yesterday I started to write a new post at the end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/18.html#a155149&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;, and I forgot to complete it, and missed it in the final edit before shutting down for the night. It went like this. &quot;I had to take my car in for service because an animal died in there.&quot; As far as I know only Randy Green caught it. I told her it was there to see if she was paying attention. I lied. It was there because I'm a space cadet. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Mouse invasion</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I've had two of mouse invasions in my car. One where a mouse chewed through a vent in my air conditioner, and the latest where a family of mice made a nest in the air conditioner and then proceeded to die! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ay ayay.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had the mouse family cleaned out by the local Subaru dealer, but the smell lingers, and now I have to figure out what to do. It's not a nice problem to have! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I know some are in dismay because the Democrats are appealing to Republicans, but they are doing the right thing. It's so much more important what we agree on than what we disagree about. We agree in the Constitution and government of laws. Right now, in 2020, that's what matters most. Later we can re-divide on issues, but right now, we have to organize for one thing: America.</description>

			<description>America is like Microsoft, I hope. They were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+microsoft&quot;&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt; in the 90s. Trying to destroy everything they didn't create. Later they calmed down, not deliberately, but it happened anyway. Now Microsoft is a big machine without much personality. Which is fine.</description>
