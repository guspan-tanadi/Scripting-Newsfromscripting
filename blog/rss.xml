			<description>When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/08/kevin-durant-new-york-knicks-are-not-cool-anymore/&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant said&lt;/a&gt; the Knicks weren't cool, the Knicks immediately became the coolest team in the NBA. As a Knicks fan who couldn't care less if KD thinks they're cool, I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/news/reports-kevin-durant-requests-trade-from-nets&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; how it turned out.</description>

			<description>The beginning of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2022/08.opml&quot;&gt;month ritual&lt;/a&gt; is done. I can't believe it's already September, on the other hand, it's freaking me out how cold it is this morning. I might have to put on a sweatshirt. It feels like summer just started. Maybe I need to move to Florida or Palm Springs. Oy. I love the mountains, but I dread the winter. Maybe it won't be so bad this year.</description>
