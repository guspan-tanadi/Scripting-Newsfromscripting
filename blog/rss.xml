			<description>People are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/15/21325708/twitter-hack-global-security-crisis-nuclear-war-bitcoin-scam&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2020/07/16/more-than-just-a-twitter-hack/&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the risks associated with Twitter, hacking and misinformation, after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/former-twitter-employees-sleuthing/index.html&quot;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; of last week. There's an even bigger risk. Twitter itself could be bought for 1/2 of $28 billion, the company's valuation according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/&quot;&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; price. That's a fraction of the net worth of a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2020&quot;&gt;billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. And you could probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout&quot;&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition, so you would need much less than $14 billion to pull it off. Basically Twitter itself, legally, is very insecure. We're depending on something a bad actor could take over, legally. I've been writing about this for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. I hope other people tune into it before it actually happens. (Do you think Peter Thiel hasn't thought of it? Don't be naïve.)</description>

			<description>Biden is now getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-warns-of-russian-election-meddling-after-receiving-intelligence-briefings-idUSKCN24J02N&quot;&gt;intelligence briefings&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, someone is actually reading them. I bet his staff is planning on how to address each of the issues. Anyway, for now he says both Russia and China are interfering with our election and he says what you'd hope a president would say. BTW, &quot;meddling&quot; is the wrong word, meddling is what a Jewish mother does. What Russia did in 2016 was an act of war. Americans are dying because of what they did.</description>

			<description>I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;  to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;. I like it because it's clean and simple. They gather reviews of lots of pubs, rate them on a scale of 1-100, and they give the movie or show a rating based on the average. A show with an 80 or higher is must-watch.</description>

			<description>I was talking with a friend yesterday about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen&quot;&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt;. We both felt that he had been unfairly &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woody+allen+condemned&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt;. And yes the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/woody-allen-memoir-canceled-hachette-outrage-1202216039/#!&quot;&gt;applies&lt;/a&gt; to his experience. He's one of the great film makers of our time. The movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(1979_film)&quot;&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; came up in our discussion, I saw it was playing on Amazon, so I watched it. What an incredible movie. People forget that Allen wrote the movie, so any flaws you see in the main character, and they sure are there, were put there &lt;i&gt;by him. &lt;/i&gt;In the end you feel his heartbreak at having been so dismissive of Mariel Hemmingway's character, she was so much more wise than him, even though she was so much younger. I had forgotten that Diane Keaton was in the movie. It's a masterpiece.</description>

			<title>Simple is not stupid</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people seem to think I'm realllly stupid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it's because I strive for simplicity in my work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened right from the start, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt;. I factored it for years, until it was super easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The others said they could do it in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Heh. They couldn't&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the next version, we added a blindingly complex feature, cloning. It was actually also pretty simple, but when you demo'd it, you could see their minds exploding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hooo, what was that? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ohhhh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to impress them if you want them to believe you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Biden appears to be doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html&quot;&gt;what I hoped he would&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to suck in as much of the Republican Party as possible. Yesterday I saw AOC pointed out that the Dem Party is a conservative party. That's cool, so maybe we'll end up with 3 or 4 parties out of this instead of 2. And we can have governments that aren't all one or the other. We keep doing and undoing, with little consistency in American govt over the decades. Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. Biden is the single most comfortable Democrat for Repubs. Good. Let's have a unity government that isn't completely nuts. Let's get used to compromising and working together. Let's have some goals, and not drift from them. I know it's a lot to hope for.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep&quot;&gt;Steve Inskeep&lt;/a&gt; seems like such an affable fellow on NPR, but he's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep/status/1276320073809100804&quot;&gt;bit of a snob&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/a&gt; is a real concept. Yes he has one, even if he thinks it's just a &quot;buzz phrase&quot; that's &quot;oft-parroted&quot; (his phrasing). It's bad enough the AG lies about important things, the problem is squared when a supposed neutral news org lets him do it without correction.</description>

			<description>I like to ask questions like this:  &quot;In a sane world, X would be Y.&quot;  I'm not saying I have a plan to turn X into Y, just that it would be ideal if X were Y.  It pays to know what success looks like, that way if it ever shows up by chance, you know immediately to say yes. (Example, in a sane world Fauci would be president.)</description>

			<description>We have to change how we think of Trump. He’s the enemy and he’s president. If you can’t resolve that apparent contradiction, the half to give up on is that he’s president.</description>

			<title>Stop giving Trump the benefit of the doubt</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay stupid question -- who does?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You do. You evaluate his actions against what a president would do, and you know he's not a president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He's trying to kill huge numbers of Americans.&lt;/i&gt; Teachers and children. And make even more live with disabilities, in great pain, for who knows how long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity&quot;&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; -- that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are purposely committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There isn't a more heinous crime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The virus is making us smarter. We can't get out of it until we become experts. At least as virus-savvy as we are about the weather. If you can prepare for a tornado, that's not unlike the virus. Except it's always virus season, everywhere. That's why I say journalism will fix itself. We can't get back to work until we develop information flows we all trust. That's why I'm always banging on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+fauci&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Fauci&lt;/a&gt; drum. As long as he's muzzled by the government, we can't get out of this mess. I wonder if he sees this. But you and I should see it. If you're smart enough to read this blog you're smart enough to understand this simple idea. The virus makes us smarter. The faster we get smarter, the less the damage. That's where our power is. There's no time for bullshit and we need all hands on deck.</description>

			<description>DuckDuckGo is getting more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/schlocky&quot;&gt;schlocky&lt;/a&gt; all the time. When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649&quot;&gt;started using it&lt;/a&gt; as the default linking service for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;, it was as plain as could be. A logo and a text box. Maybe a link at the bottom or off on the side, I have no recollection. But over time they've been adding junk to the page, so much so that this morning, doing a search there, I ended up at a page where you install a Chrome plug-in. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I paused, tried to imagine how I got there, hit the back button and square in the middle of the DuckDuckGo home page is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/15/duckduckgoButton.png&quot;&gt;big button&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;only button on the page,&lt;/i&gt; and it doesn't submit your search, it takes you to this crazy-ass page to install a plug-in. I chose DuckDuckGo precisely because I thought they would never do crap like this. Seriously rethinking my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;. Are there any nice search engines that do a decent job that don't have dreams of world domination?</description>

			<description>My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+zilar&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Jeremy Zilar&lt;/a&gt; asked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyzilar/status/1283199584756432897&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; last night on Twitter: &quot;Do you organize the silverware as it’s going into the dishwasher, or on the way out as it’s being put away?&quot; My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1283199984863674368&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;As it's being put away.&quot; Fascinating question and it got lots of response. Everyone else seems to sort the silverware on the way in. That doesn't feel right to me. First, who wants to handle the dirty silverware any more than you have to? Second, like everything in my kitchen, the dishwasher is not designed for a tall person. The silverware caddy is basically on the floor. So I save time by kind of tossing the silverware. I'd have to bend all the way down to get it into a specific part. And I do sometimes miss, but that makes life more interesting, I find. It's not really an issue for me, because I find that putting away the clean dishes and silverware takes less than a minute. By sorting the silverware on the way in how much could I possibly save? As a programmer I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; think about things like this. Even though it had never occurred to me before that you could sort your silverware in the dishwasher.</description>

I'd have to bend all the way down to get it into a specific part. And I do sometimes miss, but that makes life more interesting, I find. It's not really an issue for me, because I find that putting away the clean dishes and silverware takes less than a minute. By sorting the silverware on the way in how much could I possibly save? As a programmer I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; think about things like this. Even though it had never occurred to me before that you could sort your silverware in the dishwasher." created="Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:13:16 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/20/shrek.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/15.html#a141316"/>

			<title>Moving pocalyp.se</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got it in my head that I should move &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/26/0720.html&quot;&gt;an old app&lt;/a&gt; off an old server onto my newest server using the modern ability of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; to run apps from &lt;i&gt;domain&lt;/i&gt; folders. 2.0 days later, I think I have it running. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the ideas of the new PP stuff is to remove the server dependencies from Node apps, so you can just move them around where ever you like. Ideally there would be no concept of a server, just apps running in the cloud somewhere. I know there are lots of things like this, don't send me links (we need an acronym for that).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;pocalyp.se a URL-shortener I wrote in 2015 that makes it possible to categorize links.

			<title>Not breaking the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My email conversation with Allen Wirfs-Brock took an interesting turn. I had written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript&quot;&gt;Really Simple JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that the language would benefit from removing features. A path well-explored &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2&quot;&gt;AWB pointed out&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my last post I talked about various &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3&quot;&gt;programming mottos&lt;/a&gt; that help with the design issues JavaScript has encountered. Then AWB commented about the design slogans that guide the evolution of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWB on design slogans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m big fan of design slogans. The one we used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; about not breaking things was “Don’t break the web!”  It’s a preservationist perspective.  Much of the human digital heritage of the last 30 years and for the foreseeable future is stored as unmaintained web documents. Every breaking change to a web technology (JS, HTML, etc.) is likely to make part of our heritage permanently inaccessible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another slogan we used frequently while I was active in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; was  “consider the complexity budget.”  The idea is that there are  limits (whose bounds we don’t know) to the complexity that a programming language can accommodate and still remain useable, learnable, comprehensible, fun, etc.  Every time a feature is added or a inconsistency is introduced we use up some of the complexity budget and it can never be recovered. So any such addition limits what do to the language in the future. Each proposed feature needs to be evaluated not just concerning its utility but also whether that utility is worth limiting future language design flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is something that I worry may have faded as TC39 has grown much larger and participants somewhat more transient.  A person who is representing a company in a standards group is most likely to see a positive effect in their performance reviews if they get things added to the standard rather than for helping control complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course, committee-made decisions are always going to involve disagreements and compromises.  In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386327&quot;&gt;JavaScript history paper&lt;/a&gt;. I have a short section (21.3.5) where I cover the deliberations that resulted in the inclusion of arrow functions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DW on not breaking the web&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't break the web. That's a big one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That might be the biggest rule of all. For me, all my work really for my whole career has been directed at the web. Not breaking it is the one hope that the work won't have been for naught, as well as the work of millions of other people (of course my work is the most important heh).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As you know, Google et al are hell-bent on breaking the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if some of the people on your design committee come from companies who agree with Google on breaking the web. So maybe it would be good to have a bigger dialog on what &quot;Don't break the web&quot; really means. Of course the people at Google et al have never responded to anything I've written about that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWB on not breaking the web&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Most  individuals (even those representing BigCos)  who participant in web standards groups generally buy into &quot;don't break the web.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But to some, and in particular some big companies, it means don't break the 100 (or 1000) top web sites rather than don't break web legacy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also some have higher or lower bars for exceptions to that rule.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DW on the behavior of guests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks Allen for the clarity. I fully agree with all of it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have another &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; that I'd love for the standards designers of today to contemplate. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;BigCo is a guest on the web, as we all are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guests don't make the rules.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That imho is the single most important thing about the web. It's a platform with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/04/fourYearsOfXmlrpc.html&quot;&gt;no platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who proposes to work at the center of the tech that implements the web in whatever decade it is should behave as an archeologist, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/87459/when-we-go-mars-how-will-we-protect-martian-life-us&quot;&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. You have to wear an attitude of non-contamination. The software version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazmat_suit&quot;&gt;hazmat suit&lt;/a&gt;. Any little change could have huge unforseen consequences. The web today is so large and diverse, no one can understand all that it does. Whatever new feature is enabled by what you propose to add is worth a small fraction of what has been built on technology you've never seen or understood, or if you do, would consider arcane. You're free to innovate, but you have to do it in a sandbox you create, with rules you define. The web already has a rule.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Every breaking change to a web technology (JS, HTML, etc.) is likely to make part of our heritage permanently inaccessible." created="Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:54:35 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/11/pizza.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/14/155151.html?title=notBreakingTheWeb#a155435"/>
					<source:outline text="Another slogan we used frequently while I was active in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; was  “consider the complexity budget.”  The idea is that there are  limits (whose bounds we don’t know) to the complexity that a programming language can accommodate and still remain useable, learnable, comprehensible, fun, etc.  Every time a feature is added or a inconsistency is introduced we use up some of the complexity budget and it can never be recovered. So any such addition limits what do to the language in the future. Each proposed feature needs to be evaluated not just concerning its utility but also whether that utility is worth limiting future language design flexibility." created="Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:55:18 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/14/155151.html?title=notBreakingTheWeb#a155518"/>
					<source:outline text="This is something that I worry may have faded as TC39 has grown much larger and participants somewhat more transient.

No inspiration. Seemed machine-designed to hit the demographics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Project Lincoln so far has been great entertainment. Good for base-rallying. They can't really get into inspiring visions, given that they are Republicans and won't be in power if the ads work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will have a government problem when Biden wins. His vision will largely be undetermined, it seems to me. And I expect it'll drift. And they've done nothing to organize the post-inauguration campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far no political campaign has managed to retain power by keeping the flow of ideas going out 365 days a year, every year, not just once every four. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Closest has been Trump, but he just has the Twitter account, and there's no imagination to what he says, no inspiration, no ideas, other than pointing to what he's going to destroy next. Talking points from Moscow. I'm not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a vacuum here, still. An online organizing system that wasn't just about raising money, rather building support and keeping it organized all the time&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I think they should change their name to Project Lincoln.

			<description>This is why you take pictures of your food. A picture of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/odessadinner&quot;&gt;dinner at Odessa&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know what all of it is. The sausage is probably a kielbasa. And the dumplings are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi&quot;&gt;pierogi&lt;/a&gt;, and come with fillings like sauerkraut, mushrooms, potatos and various meats. The pancake on top doesn't look familiar. I think that might be stuffed cabbage on the right at 2 o'clock. There's some kind of soup at the upper right.</description>

			<description>Can you imagine if the virus were a hurricane (it's doing a lot more damage) we would be debating whether or not it's over. That's because we haven't set up our radar yet. We know how to do it. But Trump won't spend the money.</description>

			<description>I want a system where voters have buddies, like sponsors in a 12-step program, who they commit to voting, and they engage on Election Day and make sure they do. They escort each other to vote. We should have drills. What an incredible demonstration that would be.</description>

			<title>Re-open schools? Not yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sraDVyksYMs&quot;&gt;great scene&lt;/a&gt; in the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq70brIQP40&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; where the lead character interviews for a job in a local bank. She's had a hard life, no job history or résumé. The bank officer explains: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When the beach party is over you don't get to say, you know what, I think now I'd like to have what everyone else has worked their entire life for. It doesn't work that way.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the speech the virus is giving to the Republican governors of Texas, Florida, Arizona and all the other states that are collapsing under the weight of the virus after re-opening before they did the hard work of getting the virus under control. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The predictable thing happened. The pandemic exploded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The analogy to the main character of Monster is pretty close to perfect. The governors may have been  naïve, as she was, but life doesn't care about that. You have to pay the price before you get the prize.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Charlize Theron in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(2003_film)&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First there's no question &lt;i&gt;the schools will not open in the fall. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should stop discussing it. It's out of the question. What may happen is they will try to open the schools in a few of the Republican states, and close them within a few days as the rate of infection goes even higher. Cause and effect. You do something stupid and a week later the infections go up, two weeks later the hospitalizations go up and two weeks after that, the death rate goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this dimension the virus is totally predictable. Opening the schools in a month, with such a high density of infections, is suicidal on both the individual and societal level. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;New Covid cases per million. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the plan we would be executing now if we had competent management. I'm not inventing this, it's the protocol they used in China, Vietnam, Singapore, New York, basically everywhere, to defeat the virus. This was a known method back in March. I first heard about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nationwide lockdown until the rate of new cases is flat and near the baseline.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile stand up national testing and contact tracing. Open source the data so the public can help analyze it. Also useful for teaching the kids, at home, what's going on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Create a network of places to isolate newly infected Americans. Hotels, convention centers, college dorms, schools.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Once all that has happened we can open the schools.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Florida&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How bad is it out there? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeahDaisyD/status/1282314539460112389&quot;&gt;Leah in the Florida panhandle writes&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Any state whose residents keep coming to Florida on vacation will keep getting a taste of it. We’re having our busiest tourist season &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; this summer. No masks. No social distancing. A fresh batch comes every Saturday to stay a week. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publix.com/locations/153-watercolor-crossings&quot;&gt;Publix Watercolor&lt;/a&gt;, always packed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Publix in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Rosa+Beach,+FL+32459/@30.3960316,-87.3494376,8z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8893e19100c879b1:0xaadc3fb91d731d0b!8m2!3d30.3960324!4d-86.2288322&quot;&gt;Santa Rosa Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Until you go through the pain, then the hard work of containing the virus, it's suicidal to re-open the schools.

The disaster will explode, but we will learn.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile teach the kids at home that they're living the consequences of having a poorly educated electorate. Help them study the math and science of viral infections. And study the history, as it's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On NPR this morning a question that has a simple answer, but no one can seem to find it. How did the flower children of the 60s become the Boomers of the 90s and 00s? Not a good question, because that isn't what happened. Hippies were a very small part of the Boomer generation. George W. Bush is a Boomer, but not a hippie, then or now. And sure, some hippies didn't drop out, but then a bunch of them did. My uncle, for example. He really did live the dream of the hippies. As I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me&quot;&gt;Lies&lt;/a&gt; book, I come to appreciate that there are people applying the scientific method to history, and not accepting the simple and wrong stories of heroes and villains, weak and strong, the savages and the civilized. BTW, some of the hippies became programmers. That's a whole other thread to pick up. That's why the freedoms of the net and the web &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;persist&lt;/a&gt; to this day. A fair number of people believe in them, still, and follow the grain, instead of trying to build forts.</description>
