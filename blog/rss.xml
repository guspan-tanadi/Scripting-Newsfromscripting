			<description>One of the really nice things about Facebook is that every morning after breakfast they show me my posts from the past. So right now I'm re-living the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March&quot;&gt;Women's March&lt;/a&gt; after the Trump inauguration. And this makes me wonder -- why aren't we in the streets marching now? In 2017 it was mostly symbolic, a cry of pain that we all heard, ourselves, but it didn't help make the government better. Today if we were all in the streets the Repubs might not be so bold in Congress. They all saw what happened in Georgia. Show them it could happen in Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, North Carolina and Florida too. Make sure they know what we demand. They're scared and confused now. It's a good time to apply pressure. And to the Democrats, why aren't you organizing us! What are you waiting for? How many more chances to save American democracy do you think we're going to get?</description>

			<description>Yes I know these rants don't accomplish anything. At some point it has to stop. When I ran a startup in the 80s I remember trying to visualize the last day there, but I couldn't. Then one day I realized I had left, and I didn't even remember the last day. Like the last time I saw my mother, or an old girlfriend -- I don't remember most of those days either. But I do remember the day Trump took office. And I remember marching, and wondering if it would do any good. Like the rants I write today. Anyway one thing is for sure, we won't get many more chances to fix the country. I believe I know the answer -- look to the left and right not up or down. We don't have to unite with the miscreant Republicans in Congress. Most of them work for Moscow. We have to connect with other Americans who vote against democracy. This is not optional. So it's important to remember that and think of things we can do to shake ourselves out of our ruts and get out in the streets, figuratively and literally.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/raines.cohen/posts/10159415645719669&quot;&gt;Raines Cohen, on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Five years ago a 400-mile day trip for a family baby-naming ceremony was routine. What will be 'normal' five years from now?&quot; I commented: It's a good thing we stopped doing that. I only took one plane trip myself in the couple of years leading up to 2020. it was shocking, after being away for so long, how much carbon was burned for so little reason. we have to stop having this &quot;carbon party&quot; -- and the virus gave us a new perspective for that. It's a total silver lining. BTW I was already living in the country when I took the trip. I was going to Austin, and flew through Albany NY, which is a very small airport compared to the bay area or NY. But I had to make a connection in O'Hare, and that's when it hit me how ridiculous this was. I was going to a conference that could just as easily have been held online. It will be held online from now on, I expect (and hope). I guess what this means is that where you park your ass makes a much bigger difference now than it used to. The people you have personal contact with will be the ones who live where you do. Everyone else will be virtual. Long distance travel will be a luxury.</description>

			<description>As you may know, I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/20.html#a210604&quot;&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; on the 20th. Only side-effect: a shoulder-ache at the injection site. I wonder why there isn't a database I'm registered in, so data can be gathered on the effectiveness of the vaccine over time and geography, so it can be added to other data to learn more about the virus. I registered for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Kinsa%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Kinsa&lt;/a&gt; groupware thermometer for that purpose. Millions of people have been vaccinated all over America, but as with everything it's fairly disorganized. I do have an official-looking CDC identification card, but no corresponding web registration.</description>

			<description>I read in the comments of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10157399193110947&amp;id=109161715946&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook how particular people in Vermont are about people who come from other places. The places I like best are where people don‚Äôt have any weird ideas about how they‚Äôre better than people who were born elsewhere. I‚Äôm a first gen American, child of people who ran for their lives, and were welcomed to this great country. They had no other place to go. What if America hadn't welcomed us? I've been to places where they hate outsiders, and many more places where they welcome them. I had a warm feeling walking around a small city in Italy, where I didn't speak the language and almost no one spoke English, but people were patient and smiled a lot and were gentle with the tourist from America. I got lost on the train, hundreds of miles out of my way, and the workers on the train spoiled me, passing me off to the next one to get me to my destination. Maybe they laughed, but I never saw it. The note they gave me explained my predicament in Italian, very respectfully (it was translated for me by my host when I arrived in Trieste). So I try to go out of my way to welcome visitors. Because it's a generous thing to do, but also because I know that I have benefited from this kind of generosity myself. And I always try to remember that I'm no better than anyone else, even if they were born in Vermont. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>On Facebook, a friend, a doctor who cares for very sick people, says he loves his job. I said: I understand. A little over ten years ago, my father had an accident and it put him into a coma that lasted a month. He was intubated, and put in a ward where they parked people who were in various stages of vegetativeness. I spent a lot of time there, reading to him, watching out for him, and I got to know various people on staff in the hospital. I had thought these were some of the worst jobs in the world, but I got an impression that it was quite the opposite, so I checked it out, and they all said they loved their jobs. I had plenty of time to think, and I realized that in many jobs, esp the ones I have done, the way you help people can be kind of abstract, hard to visualize.

			<source:outline text="On Facebook, a friend, a doctor who cares for very sick people, says he loves his job. I said: I understand. A little over ten years ago, my father had an accident and it put him into a coma that lasted a month. He was intubated, and put in a ward where they parked people who were in various stages of vegetativeness. I spent a lot of time there, reading to him, watching out for him, and I got to know various people on staff in the hospital. I had thought these were some of the worst jobs in the world, but I got an impression that it was quite the opposite, so I checked it out, and they all said they loved their jobs. I had plenty of time to think, and I realized that in many jobs, esp the ones I have done, the way you help people can be kind of abstract, hard to visualize. But people who care for others as their job, see the result of their work every day, all the time." created="Fri, 22 Jan 2021 17:23:17 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/08/enochChoi.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/22.html#a172317"/>

			<description>It's important that Biden fired a bunch of Trump loyalists on day one. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/11/08/150950.html?title=throwAnElbowJoe&quot;&gt;Throw an elbow&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning. Probably have to throw a bunch more, setting the Repubs off screaming, and just let em do it. We've had a lot of practice w Trump.</description>

			<description>A bunch of museums have made digital scans of their art available for re-use, but they always seem to make you download one image at a time. Sigh. This makes it very labor intensive to create applications that offer new ways to browse art collections. I want to make a nice screen saver, and display it on the big screen in my living room, for me and my guests (when we start having guests again). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2021/01/21/over-700000-paintings-from-the-rijksmuseum-online-copyright-free/&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; to do this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en&quot;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam. So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1352321597370101760&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter if anyone had downloaded a large number of the paintings, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoodBrain/status/1352352014315909120&quot;&gt;turns out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/10/19/the-rijksmuseum-as-bittorrent.html&quot;&gt;someone has&lt;/a&gt;!

			<description>I spend an awful lot of money on video entertainment and receive very little in return. There were many months I paid for HBO but didn't watch a single thing on it. I paid for Showtime, but I think there were whole &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; that I never watched anything there. I'd love to re-watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-knick&quot;&gt;an HBO show&lt;/a&gt; that I recommended to a friend (and am hereby recommend to you) but I'd have to re-sub to watch it legally. Couldn't I just use one of those months in the past where I watched nothing but paid anyway? Okay so they need so much money for the lavish productions of new stuff. Maybe they could price their archives separately? How about that. Anything more than 10 years old say, you can have for $1 a month, and do a bundling deal where I can get everything that's 10 years or older from any of the majors for $10 a month. Problem is they'd find they have a glut of good stuff. We don't really need that much more. The whole thing is grossly out of whack. BTW, I did sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/19.html#a125040&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt;, only to find out they don't have an app for my LG TV, which is a whole other rant, why exactly do there have to be special apps for every TV. (Yes I know the answer, but I'm asking at a deeper level. Thank you.) I thought I might watch the Knicks, but there was an inauguration, and I had my Covid vaccine, and it made me tired, I think, so instead I just went to bed.</description>

			<title>Twenty years ago in podcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ericnuzum&quot;&gt;Eric Nuzum&lt;/a&gt; for writing this &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/first-podcast-feed-history&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;first podcast feed&lt;/a&gt;, about the project I did in January 2001, twenty years ago. The feed he writes about was used to test software I had developed that reads podcast feeds, otherwise known as a podcatcher. The feed was a small effort compared to the software that reads podcast feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few people on Twitter have criticized Eric's story, they say it was wrong, but actually &lt;i&gt;he got it right.&lt;/i&gt; That's why it's always a good idea to hedge a bit when you say someone is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay first, a nit -- the idea that Chris Lydon had the first real podcast is not true. There were a couple of others that predate his Radio Open Source -- Doug Kaye's IT Conversations and Steve Gillmor's Gillmor Gang. They were doing MP3-based radio when we came out with the podcast format, and they quickly adopted it. I've written about them here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt;. Lydon's podcast was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/21/cbcsOriginStoryOfPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; I had a role in producing. I've shrugged off the distinction a few times, because Chris was the first who showed up to play in my sandbox, and that, to me, was worth a lot. I learned from his experience, a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My UserLand on the Desktop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's where Nuzum got it right and his critics are wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In early 2001, after meeting with Adam in New York, which Nuzum documents, I produced a daily feed of Grateful Dead songs. I don't think the RIAA would have had a problem with it (as Nuzum jokingly says) because the Dead had a culture of letting their users do what they like with their music. I thought it was completely appropriate that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=320&amp;v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&quot;&gt;Heart of Gold Band&lt;/a&gt; would play a role in bootstrapping the new medium. I created the feed to test my new podcatcher. Here's the story of that software, whcih is also documented in the archive of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, at UserLand, we created a product called My UserLand, to compete with Netscape's My Netscape. Both were server-based RSS reader apps. This was the very beginning of RSS being used as a news publishing format. Then a we created a desktop version of My UserLand called, unimaginatively, My UserLand On The Desktop or MUOTD for short. It did what the server-based product did, but it ran as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;app on a user's desktop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Grateful Dead podcast feed was there to test the podcatcher functionality in MUOTD.&lt;/i&gt; That predated Adam's iPodder by over three years. Adam used it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;MUOTD was later merged with Radio UserLand, a desktop blogging tool, creating something that has yet to be matched by anyone -- a desktop blogging and reading app, all in one. It was pretty cool. I'm pretty sure the guys who later formed Twitter used it. It was more or less Twitter on the desktop, based on RSS, five years before Twitter. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was all part of an idea I loved that I called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers&lt;/a&gt;. MUOTD and Radio UserLand were full powered web servers that ran on the user's machine. Most probably weren't even aware they were running a server, because the user interface was so smooth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News for January 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of MUOTD from 1/11/2001.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Okay first, a nit -- the idea that Chris Lydon had the first real podcast is not true. There were a couple of others that predate his Radio Open Source -- Doug Kaye's IT Conversations and Steve Gillmor's Gillmor Gang. They were doing MP3-based radio when we came out with the podcast format, and they quickly adopted it. I've written about them here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt;. Lydon's podcast was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/21/cbcsOriginStoryOfPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; I had a role in producing. I've shrugged off the distinction a few times, because Chris was the first who showed up to play in my sandbox, and that, to me, was worth a lot. I learned from his experience, a lot." created="Thu, 21 Jan 2021 14:13:47 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting#a141347"/>

				<source:outline text="In early 2001, after meeting with Adam in New York, which Nuzum documents, I produced a daily feed of Grateful Dead songs. I don't think the RIAA would have had a problem with it (as Nuzum jokingly says) because the Dead had a culture of letting their users do what they like with their music. I thought it was completely appropriate that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=320&amp;v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&quot;&gt;Heart of Gold Band&lt;/a&gt; would play a role in bootstrapping the new medium.

				<source:outline text="In 1999, at UserLand, we created a product called My UserLand, to compete with Netscape's My Netscape. Both were server-based RSS reader apps. This was the very beginning of RSS being used as a news publishing format. Then a we created a desktop version of My UserLand called, unimaginatively, My UserLand On The Desktop or MUOTD for short. It did what the server-based product did, but it ran as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;app on a user's desktop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Grateful Dead podcast feed was there to test the podcatcher functionality in MUOTD.&lt;/i&gt; That predated Adam's iPodder by over three years.

				<source:outline text="MUOTD was later merged with Radio UserLand, a desktop blogging tool, creating something that has yet to be matched by anyone -- a desktop blogging and reading app, all in one. It was pretty cool. I'm pretty sure the guys who later formed Twitter used it.

			<description>Highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/podcasts/the-daily/trump-supporters-biden-transition-capitol-riot.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. They interview Trump voters about the Capitol invasion/insurrection. Lots to think about. Here's what I'd like to tell people who support Trump and feel like invading the Capitol and killing people was kind of okay. We didn't like Trump. We protested. But no one invaded the Capitol and no one killed anyone because we didn't like the result of the election. Also, we do a really good job with elections in the US. The best in the world by some accounts. So if you say our election was bad, you'd better have some facts to back you up, or seriously shut the fuck up. What I've heard so far is totally lame. And if you think you're the good guys, well, it doesn't seem to me you are. It seems you're bullies. You think what the rest of us, the majority of us, think doesn't matter. You get your way even if you're the minority. That is un-American as hell.</description>

			<description>On this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/howlongfortrump/&quot;&gt;last full day&lt;/a&gt; of Trump's presidency, I am grappling with an inconsequential decision. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351299875791634486&quot;&gt;CNN vs the Knicks&lt;/a&gt;. I can have one of them, but if I want both it'll cost me an extra $65 per month. If I felt strongly about either, or both, the decision would be easy. It's difficult only because I'm somewhat ambivalent about each. CNN is for mindless relaxation. I like watching Wolf Blitzer because he's so pompous. &quot;This &lt;i&gt;just in&lt;/i&gt; to the Situation Room,&quot; he likes to say, but of course it's a studio not a room, and nothing is &quot;in&quot; there. It's the most old and stuffy place. It's totally out. I find it relaxing the same way I used to find it relaxing to watch my grandmother knit, or my cat lick herself. I like watching Erin Burnett because (I know this is weird) I think she's hot. Esp when she's angry, and these days, she is very angry, a lot (at the same things we all are angry about btw). I also like CNN because they have better guests. But I could live without them. For 20+ years I never watched CNN. Then there are the Knicks. I've been a Knicks fan, on and off, for most of my life. I came back strong for Linsanity, and hated them for screwing that up, and then they fired Melo and Porzingas, well I kind of gave up for a while. The pandemic and the bubble made it seem illegit. But with a new coach this year, they're looking interestings, and they're competitive, and sometimes they win! I'd like a chance to watch, not sure I would actually watch. The sports news service Fubo doesn't have CNN, and YouTube TV has CNN but no Knicks. So I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351299875791634486&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; to find out what people thought. As I write this the consensus is to leave CNN and go with the Knicks. I think it's time for a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_la_carte&quot;&gt;√† la carte&lt;/a&gt; menu. Most of what's on either Fubo or YouTube TV doesn't interest me. Too many good choices on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, and podcasts are great these days too.</description>

Instead of reporting from NY and DC, do it from Chicago or Dallas.   Same news, same people, just put the host in the middle of the country. When and why did CNN move from Atlanta?</description>

			<description>When the virus is under control will the networks revert to having in-studio guests? If not, one of the tech companies should make a total turnkey home TV guest computer, with everything you need to sound and look great when your Maddow moment comes. This sounds like a project for Microsoft. Or one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/best-smart-speakers-of-2021-amazon-echo-google-nest-mini-and-apple-homepod-compared/&quot;&gt;smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; companies? A lot of interviewees use Skype. One thing to start, teach people how to make ther room sound good. Lots of pillows to start with. You can handle a poor picture better than awful audio.</description>

			<description>I think the people who invaded the Capitol are telling the truth when they say Trump told them to do it. But that's not all. Trump made them feel special. They were one of a few thousand people that he trusted to set this right. It may not be logical, but the people in the videos seemed drunk. From the recognition from god. The ProPublic videos show that, at the demonstration. They actually called him god. Trump. The scene in the Senate from the New Yorker video, sounded like what I think a hospital for the insane would. Where was their sense of self. DId they think they would get away with it? Why would they think that? Hard to imagine someone could be so far from reality.</description>

			<description>Here's why you need super lightweight easy to deploy networking interfaces. So you can quickly create connections between apps when the idea occurs to you, when you have the need. Then you can use it, and then you have experience using the 1-in-10 idea that's so good to want to further develop, when you develop it for real. That's why your second version of something is so much better than the first, and the third version is good enough for other people to use (even though we make them use the first two versions anyway). The idea we had, for connecting apps on a single machine, back in the mid-80s was right. It has been a big part of the evolution of every layer since. (And probably before, I just wasn't around during those evolutions.) I mention this because in less than 10 minutes I whipped up a connection between two worlds I'm working on, and watched the newer app update based on a ping from my older app. Ping! It &quot;just worked&quot; and if you're a programmer you know how satisfying that can be.</description>

			<description>I've been working, in slow mode, on a new feature for my outliners, tagging. I saw a similar idea in action with &lt;a href=&quot;https://roamresearch.com/&quot;&gt;Roam Research's&lt;/a&gt; outliner, and thought it was a really nice idea. I always want to save references to my notes in a cumulative index, like the index in the back of a book. This has always been a good companion to the fluid hierarchy, the outline structure which is more like the table of contents in front of a book. Only when you're working electronically, there isn't really a middle. Everything is in both places, at the same time. It's ideas like this that make programmers' eyes glaze over. They start using words like orthogonal, or loosely connected, and of course the always welcome &quot;distributed.&quot; Really having fun programming the last week or so. As the world is falling apart. Why not? It's not like any of us are getting out of this alive. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>White supremacy is the crisis in the US. There was confusion after 9/11 if we were at war, and now it's even more confusing. What's not confusing is that both events were Acts of War. If I were white, and I am, I'd want to have a way to clearly say I am not with them.</description>

			<title>Good morning everybody</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a weird feeling in the world right now. Tomorrow is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day&quot;&gt;national holiday&lt;/a&gt;, and Wednesday is Inauguration Day. No matter what, things will change radically in the US in the next few days.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got an answer to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/16.html#a170934&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; I asked yesterday, about who 20K+ troops in DC will report to, until Biden is sworn in. By law they report to the commander-in-chief, President Trump. Just a fact. If Trump orders them to assassinate everyone at the inauguration, it's not all that different from what Trump told the mob to do on January 6. So unfortunately it is in the realm of possibility.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It all hinges on who the troops are loyal to. Turns out the military thought of that, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2021/01/troops-inauguration-pre-screened-extremism-says-dc-guard-commander/171456/&quot;&gt;pre-screened&lt;/a&gt; the soldiers assigned to this job to weed out white supremacists. I kid you not. They know how to do that? I guess it would be naive for them not to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a nightmareish vision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat&quot;&gt;Anwar Sadat's assassination&lt;/a&gt; in 1981. If you haven't seen it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKu-u-W5J84&quot;&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;. You've never seen anything like it, even in a movie or TV show.  As they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/16.html#a170600&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, this is why you want to have programmers around, we think about these things. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read last night that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/01/pentagon-wont-throw-traditional-farewell-ceremony-trump/171408/&quot;&gt;the Pentagon turned Trump down&lt;/a&gt; for a great military send-off on Wednesday morning. Interesting, are they allowed to do that? No one seems to be questioning it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if it goes smoothly and the Bidens end up running the government on Thursday, and recinding Trump's orders, the tension goes down a lot. We still have to deal with Trump, and Republicans, but really if they could just STFU our real business is with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the usual mottos apply, Let's Have Fun, Still diggin, and It's not like anyone gets out of this alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
