			<description>On the other hand, we should have an &lt;i&gt;open source Twitter replacement&lt;/i&gt; that's fucking easy to install and runs itself. Node.js. Runs on desktop in Electron for local users. It could be much easier than Mastodon. A fractional-horsepower tweeter. If anyone wants to work on that, let me know, I'd like to be part of such a thing (mostly as a user and app developer).</description>

He would scrunch up his face looking at a plate of food and say &quot;I don't like this!&quot; And they would in a chorus sing &quot;But Ken it's &lt;i&gt;gooooood&lt;/i&gt; for you!&quot; They were the cutest kids and he was pretty cute too gotta say.</description>

			<description>Okay now I have to tell you about my latest experience with ChatGPT. The subject is CSS. It's possible to do all kinds of crazy logic on DOM elements, given all the different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt; they have. But how to combine them to do what you want to do? You can stare at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; for hours, and do trial-and-error, but if you're like me, you gave up before you even started. But with ChatGPT, you can formulate the question according to what you want to do, and it creates a docs page that probably never existed before, that shows you, with examples, how to do what you want. I just did that. Amazing. It digs you out of corners. Nothing like this has ever existed.</description>

			<title>TweetGPT?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;what would a chatgpt-like twitter be?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i type a query, and the bot responds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;then you can type a query that builds on mine, starting a new thread, which other people can build on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;the thread to the first tweet forms a stack, a context for each subsequent reply?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;what comes out at the end is pure singularity?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/12/chatgpt-like-twitter-platform.html&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; chatgpt and it says no, it would not be a singularity because &quot;ChatGPT-like models are limited to generating responses based on their training data and do not possess true consciousness or self-awareness.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

As an implementer, you have to watch out if you support features that are only in Mastodon and not based on ActivityPub. Which suggests that as the bigco's start implementing AP support, they're all going to face a conundrum. If we want users to think what we're doing is anything more than symbolic, we're going to have to use the Mastodon API and not ActivityPub, because no one else is doing it in AP, therefore there's nothing to interop with or test against. It's hard to promote a feature when you've never been able to test it. The whole thing is pretty shaky. And most people aren't aware of the subtleties. Time to get out a bucket of popcorn and stay on the sidelines until some of this becomes real.</description>

			<title>What ChatGPT could become</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The thing I look for in &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; style products are new interesting information sets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to work out some JSON-based formats for flowing writing through the engine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to know the cost. And how much human work is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is this written up anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately -- we'll use ChatGPT style apps in place of Wikipedia and Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is like GUIs to character based.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or the open internet to proprietary LANs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another generation of every information app on the net, and that's more or less the whole net. A top-to-bottom rewrite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Earlier today I used Google to try to find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a few years ago. I am the author. I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;. Well a bunch of people copied my file and posted it on their sites, with their template and their ads (I don't have ads), and for whatever reason Google ranks their docs higher. Mine isn't even on the first page. So tell me, how is that Google isn't implementing a &quot;man in the middle&quot; attack? Why aren't they taking the heat for delivering incorrect results?</description>

			<description>Same thing happened with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;. There is only one original. Try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=rss+2.0&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=rss+2.0&quot;&gt;find it in Google&lt;/a&gt;. Lotsa luck. There's so much bullshit on the search results page. It's amazing we're trained not to see the lies that Google passes off as facts, but somehow we're supposed to hold the startup accountable instead.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT breakthrough</title>

I can now do the following: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Search for something in ChatGPT.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on a bookmarklet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A static HTML page opens, ready to be linked to from a blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB2RVlhm5SM&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; that shows how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/march-8-birthdays.html&quot;&gt;web page&lt;/a&gt; generated in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt&quot;&gt;bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; I am using, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcubic&quot;&gt;jcubic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/36bec44af6892abb870c5fa798bf7431&quot;&gt;Frontier script&lt;/a&gt; that runs on my desktop, every second.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;the app&lt;/a&gt; that syncs a folder with a location on Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We've been to this place before. How long before the press starts calling it The Podcast Wars. Some of us will try to douse the flames, to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People choose &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/bombastic-meaning-4-words.html&quot;&gt;bombastic&lt;/a&gt; names because they want more for themselves than they want for podcasting. I have a lot of experience with this. People are always looking for a way to make a billion dollars. It never occurs to them that if it all has to be for them, there will be nothing. Now a whole new generation has to learn that again, and as usual the thing that pays for it is podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know all the people, or what they're planning to do, but the names they chose for their efforts tells me they don't want work with anyone, they may say they do, but they've reserved for themselves the authority over -- &quot;podcasting,&quot; if you can believe that bullshit. They're all little people trying to sound like big people. If you want to do some good for podcasting, throw your ideas out there in the middle, and fight for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt;. When the other guy does something that you do, do it their way. That's how you build.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My sense is it's too late to fuck over podcasting, that it's mostly for the people involved that I ask them to lower expectations, and don't try to make this a business model. But if they want to do it, they'll do it and the press will have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22podcast+wars%22&quot;&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; to write about, and in the end &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/08/podcasting-definition.html&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; will stay what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/05/immanuel-quickley-carries-knicks-over-celtics-in-double-ot/&quot;&gt;Last night's Knicks game&lt;/a&gt; was wonderful. As the Nets gave up on their buy-a-championship nightmare, the slow-growth Knicks approach has been going great. I'm sure the Knicks would've signed KD or Kyrie if they had offered, but so thankful they diss'd the Knicks instead. Idiots. Now the normal order has been restored. Hopefully the Knicks continue to add pieces slowly and let home-grown stars like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley&quot;&gt;IQ&lt;/a&gt; continue to grow. It's intoxicating to watch him get the chance to excel as in last night's game, and completely exceed all reasonable expectations. The whole team is fantastic. Our loyalty to the team has paid off.</description>

			<description>It's time to see what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; is up to these days. I've had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; there for many years. Of course it has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.tumblr.com/rss&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. Previous posts are in March 2014 and then May 2011. The feed looks pretty straightforward.

They wanted me to put this text in a blog post so they could quote it. There was no request, no &quot;please,&quot; just here's the job. I didn't do it, and got a flamey email from the guy which surprisingly included a threat to never quote me again. What shocked me then and still shocks me today was how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_forma&quot;&gt;pro forma&lt;/a&gt; it seemed. The kind of thing they do for each other all the time in the news business? As far as I recall, I never wrote about it, and certainly never mentioned the name of the reporter. All that's interesting about it to me is that it appeared to be standard practice.</description>

			<title>Love your friends like a dog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What if friends treated their friends as nicely as they treat dogs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you sensed they needed a little support, look them in the eye and ask &quot;Who's a good boy?!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rub behind the ears. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When they sit give them a treat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let them rest their head on your knee.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Inside of us, everyone, including you, is a little pup who just wants to know they're in the right place doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/25/blackLab.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
