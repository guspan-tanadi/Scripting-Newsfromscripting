			<description>Bernie Sanders on MSNBC last night talked about new Repub voter suppression. He  never said the thing I hoped he would. Repubs know they can't win a fair election, so they cheat.</description>

			<description>I was asked if I know that tech companies hate the web, and asking them to help the web is stupid. I can't defend that, it might be stupid, who knows. But it isn't taking a lot of time, and in talking about wanting to rekindle the writing tools category, I'm not just talking to the platform devs, I'm also talking to users, who may not have realized that they don't have to become copypaste machines just to have a newsletter, or cross-post to Facebook. There's no technical barrier. And if they wanted to use their favorite editor to write blog posts or newsletters, because they now understand that it's possible, that would create pressure for tech companies to do it. Now the big ones wouldn't, at first, but one of the also-rans might, as a way to get users to use their service. And if the feature is as sexy as I believe it is, they &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; get more users, and in doing so might attract the other, bigger companies, to do it too. Also there are some idealists around, believe it or not, some tech founders who believe in the web, and even read this blog, and might respond to a friendly nudge. Anyway, what's the difference. It gives me pleasure to stand up for the web, and hope. I think the world can work better, and if I can help, you bet I'm going to say something.</description>

			<description>This story isn't really about George O'Connor (a made-up name), it's about something else. Here's the story. Many years ago I was at a party at CES, only people with connections were invited. So you could walk around this big ballroom and every few minutes you'd run into someone you know from a long time ago. In this case I ran into George, a person I knew from the early Mac days because he worked at Anderson (also a made-up name), one of the networking hardware companies of the Mac. A respected company, and George was well-thought-of. But I had another connection to him, his sister had worked for my company, a few years before, and I wanted to ask how she was doing and to say hi for me. George started talking after I said hello, and he said he couldn't help get me into TED. He was a producer there, and presumably everyone in the room was hitting him up for tickets, I guess he was tired of it. I didn't want to go to TED, and I also didn't hold this against George. I think I see this all the time, but rarely is it so open as it was at that party. People assume you want something from them, when you just wanted to say hi because you have good memories of them. It's the flipside of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/theguyatthegasstation/&quot;&gt;story I wrote in 2013&lt;/a&gt; about a clerk at a gas station having a bad day.</description>

			<description>With the Repubs openly threatening corporations, the question is who do they think they rep?</description>

			<title>Copy/paste-to-publish</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing this email to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jjn1&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; re his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Memex&lt;/a&gt; daily posts, but I thought both of us being public writers, I should just post it here and send a pointer. So here goes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;John, I've been following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/monday-5-april-2021&quot;&gt;story of the strange URLs&lt;/a&gt; from your Substack newsletter. I also appreciated your telling how you produce your newsletter by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/06/naughtonWorkflow.png&quot;&gt;copy/pasting&lt;/a&gt; from WordPress into Substack. I bet 90 percent of Substack's text comes in this way. And that's what this letter is about. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been asking them to automate that part for you via an API or RSS, or whatever they specify, to remove the copy/paste step from your publication workflow. I am deliberately being a squeaky wheel, hoping that writers who use Substack will join in.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Basically, it should be possible to hook your writing tool directly to both WordPress and Substack.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I would have used Substack myself if it weren't for this limit. As a writer, I want to eliminate steps, to make my writing more effortless. Publishing an idea takes too many steps, as a result, a lot of ideas don't get out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to have a better flow on the web as a writer, and I think if other writers knew what was possible they'd want it too, and hopefully they would write about it. You wrote about it yesterday! ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JN, writers have a lot more power imho than they think. Esp in the early days of a service like Substack. They are listening to you. They know they depend on you. If enough writers wanted a feature, they would implement it. That's how development works. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please consider writing something yourself about eliminating copy/paste-to-publish step. There's a lot of power trapped in that limit. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1379453137963122688&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink&quot;&gt;permalinks&lt;/a&gt; in Substack.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why is it interesting to think about what became of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/04/174604.html?title=theLostAppsOfThe80s&quot;&gt;Apps of the 80s&lt;/a&gt; -- because imho we still need what they do. I want to use one writing tool, the perfect one for me, and flow the text through various services. We know how to. Rather than just accept more and more editors, let's build interfaces that allow choice. APIs. We know how to do it. We just need one or two products to demo the concept and define the interfaces. Any blogging tool or newsletter mailer could take the next step.</description>

			<description>I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chia.net/&quot;&gt;Chia&lt;/a&gt; today. Sounds like it's a crypto currency, but what makes it interesting is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Cohen&quot;&gt;Bram Cohen&lt;/a&gt; is involved, and he's the guy who brought us &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;, and that works pretty well, and seemed really wild when it first came out.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know I've been asking a question pretty persistently -- where did the apps go? Specifically where did the writing tools go? Before the web, there was a deep market for software writing tools, all kinds of word processors, text editors, desktop publishing tools, even spreadsheets and database software were used to write. Yet few of those tools transitioned to the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the web, we thought it was very innovative for browser-based apps to create and write for public websites, which eventually became blogs, entirely through web forms in the browers. It was such a miracle, look at how easy it is! -- that we overlooked that as a writing tool, the web browser is pretty awful. We know how to do it so much better! Why didn't we? Why don't we do it now?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introducing Ray Ozzie...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been having an email conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Ozzie&quot;&gt;Ray Ozzie&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow productivity tools developer from the 80s. We never worked together but we worked with people who worked together. He did several products you might be familiar with. Lotus Symphony which was the height of the &quot;integrated software&quot; period in the mid-80s, and the corporate groupware product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/2431837/7-things-it-managers-should-know-about-lotus-notes.html&quot;&gt;Lotus Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Since then he has been CTO of Microsoft, and has founded several successful startups. He was recently honored as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://computerhistory.org/events/building-a-better-world-through-tech-for-collaboration/&quot;&gt;fellow&lt;/a&gt; of the Computer History Museum. I asked if I could include some of his comments in a blog post here, and he agreed. I didn't do any editing, his words appear exactly as he typed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dave (me) kicks it off...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There used to be, as you know, a deep market for tools for writers. Highly customizable products, or products with UIs with character, people had something they don't have now -- choice. And that made it competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, we don't have choice. If I want to write on Facebook, I have to use their awful buggy editor. If I want a Substack newsletter or a Medium blog, or whatever -- I have to use their editors, which vary in quality, but none of them would have stood a chance in the 80s software market.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We could argue how this happened, but there's no question that it did happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there should be networked spreadsheets. And since it's 40 years later, there should be products we never imagined in the 80s. They aren't there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the starting point. I'm not saying we should fix it, I don't want to take that on, but I want to focus the tech world on the fact that this happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now Ray opines on the lost apps of the 80s...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly that there are things that we were incredibly fortunate to have experienced, and they seem to be gone.  Seemingly forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ThinkTank and outliners in general is one of them.  I don’t understand this because I think there are many outliner-type people out there who would enjoy them, but because they never became mainstream they aren’t being given a chance to be mainstream once again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think that there were calendar-centric PIM-centric extensions to the outlining concept that were in Agenda that were worth saving; they’re gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pito Salas’s spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/pito-s-blog/why-improv-didnt-succeed-3e06a43acf73&quot;&gt;Improv&lt;/a&gt; had incredible things – far more than just the pivot table – and yet the world is now deprived because the world seems comfortable with a simpler concept of a spreadsheet.  And yes, networked spreadsheets of one form or another would be amazing – especially given that many real-world spreadsheet scenarios involve periodic consolidation/roll-up involving multiple people and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A VC friend told me several years ago that it was incredible that even though there is now a wave of “low code” tools such as Airtable, that there is nothing out there with the power and usability that Lotus Notes had back-in-the-day.  And so we cobble together many tools, ignoring the fact that there was a better answer that we’ve chosen to discard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you said, I can’t fix it.  I can’t even explain it.  I’ve put an incredible amount of energy and love into products that have commercially failed, and it has made me a bit more cautious.  I’m fortunate that I don’t tend to descend into cynicism, but it remains perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a writer and an analyst, I do think this would be a great topic to explore: why have so many great ideas been discarded?  Even if their initial implementation was destined never to withstand the test of time, why do we choose to ignore those aspects that were good?  In an internet that was supposed to allow us to have ‘bubbles’ of special interest groups, why haven’t we created a thriving environment that might support the creation and maintenance of bespoke power tools for creativity and productivity?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's where I'd like to leave it for now, there will be more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote my side of the conversation in GMail. A pretty standard browser-based text browser and editor. In Chrome on my Mac. I don't know what email app Ray used. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26692308&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about this piece on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Yes, journalism is a thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03.html#a131835&quot;&gt;Journalism is a thing&lt;/a&gt;, a whole, it makes sense to talk about in the way I talk about it. I don't need a lecture at this level, although people often do it for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read a piece recently somewhere, I forget where, that said people who think rapid universal change can't take place -- they aren't paying attention. The example they cited was that not too long ago people were smoking everywhere. Now there are severe limits on where you can smoke, and people seem to respect the limits. We made a decision as a society to change our behavior and it happened quickly. And you could have made the same kinds of arguments, that there is no such thing as a &quot;smoker&quot; -- but there was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#Legal_recognition&quot;&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Hard to believe it first became legal in the US in 2015! Had you asked me in 2014 if that was possible I would have said no. Then it changed, just like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Covid is another one. Who would have thought that people could hibernate for more than a year in the US. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html#a181825&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in March last year, just to mark how ludicrous I thought it was yet at the same time inevitable. We do go through real transitions. I expect there will be plenty more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And at some point some journalism org will trip over the idea that repping the people's interest makes their art work as a business like nothing else before. Sometimes I think that's all we're arguing about in the US. The elites talk to the elites and ignore the rest of us. So remind me, why are we supporting this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've thought more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613&quot;&gt;Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt;. It's amazing to hear the Beatles' perspective on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band&quot;&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;, I had never really thought how it was created, yet as a creative person myself, I’m often surprised and even offended that people don’t consider my point of view about the things I created. But at one time, Sgt Pepper was their thing, their secret. That's why the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/01.html#a155654&quot;&gt;final quote&lt;/a&gt; was so strong for me. &quot;You just wait,&quot; says McCartney -- echoing the feeling in 1967 when he knew he had something great, that was going to shake the world (as it did) and no one but he and a few others knew what it was. And the lesson of the Making of Sgt Pepper is that you and I will never know Sgt Pepper the way McCartney does. And one more thought, if only John Lennon could have been there, what would we have learned.</description>

			<title>The Making of Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wear a lot of hats. One of them is as a developer of scripting systems. I did a big one, Frontier, developed mostly in the late 80s and 90s. People seem to refer to it in the past tense, but I use Frontier as do others. it does things no other product can. It works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you may know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; is my new outliner-based scripting system for the web. It's still at least a few months from shipping, maybe more. But I'm making big decisions about how it works right now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The same way Frontier was designed around an &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/manual/objectDatabase&quot;&gt;object database&lt;/a&gt; and the Mac filesystem (and later Windows), Drummer works with public and private files on a server.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Frontier is a very broad and deep product, but it wasn't originally designed to be so big. The initial idea was to integrate it with the Finder, add a Scripts menu, and have it do things with the file system, and provide a way to program and connect scriptable apps. That was it. Simple.  I offered it to Apple. At the time, the early 90s, I knew all the decision-makers there, but I asked for too much money, they thought they could do it for less. So now I had tipped my hand, showed them my product, I figured to be competitive I'd have to add more stuff, which I did have available to me, since I always try out ideas that don't make it into the final product. The product got deeper, but it also got more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always wondered if it would have worked better if we had started with the small product. We could have shipped sooner. It would have been more approachable, more immediately useful. I think there is a good chance it would have worked better, but it didn't go that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This time, I'm trying to keep Drummer small, focus on a few innovations, and make a lot of the parts replaceable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am creating a product, but as with Radio UserLand, I also want to try to create a new use for our computers. With Radio it was blogging and RSS. This time it's a richer, better connected working environment on the net for power users and devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Power users is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user&quot;&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt; that has fallen into disuse, but they still exist, and you can design for them. Some users are very skilled with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation&quot;&gt;key innovation&lt;/a&gt; in Drummer is JavaScript without the callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: I posted something about Drummer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1378357655874498561&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A proposal for newsletter tools</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we could help one of the newsletter distribution companies support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi.html&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt; or  equivalent.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to help design it, and would implement an editor as open source example code to help seed the market. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This would be an easy upgrade for the web, and good publicity for an innovative platform. Let's create a great new market for writing tools for the web. All it takes is one developer to get this going. It's something I would support with all the influence I have.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Writing tools for the web have been languishing. This is easy to fix, it just requires a little leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Pleading for Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I feel so sad about what's happening to Stallman.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;He's 68&lt;/a&gt;. I know what that's like, I'm 65. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has fixed his whole existence on a single idea that software should be free. Not free of charge, but free to use and to adapt. It's not that far from the kind of openness I believe in, that I believe is an ethical responsiblity for developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's useful to have a person like Stallman around, consistently marking an extreme view. It's like knowing there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backpacker.com/survival/how-to-navigate-by-the-stars/&quot;&gt;North Star&lt;/a&gt;, you may not be going to it, exactly, but knowing where it is makes it possible to go other places. And some people agree with Stallman in total, and to them he's their leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you step back and look at what's being said about him, basically people don't like things he says or the questions he asks. I read these things completely factoring out the non-factual stuff, where they tell you what his questions mean in some pure sense, when what they're really saying is what these questions mean to them. To a reasonable person imho they're just questions. Some people don't argue with questions, they just ask them. For the people who attack him, it's the opposite, their questions are accusations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Stallman is actually a naive innocent, almost child-like &lt;i&gt;harmless&lt;/i&gt; person. That's based on years of observing him, being connected through communities. Maybe he did terrible things I don't know about. But maybe you have too.  Is this how we're going to coexist? All of us worrying about who's going to make a credible case for destroying each others' lives? This isn't about Stallman, it's about your sense of justice and how far it extends, and how unfair that is for the rest of us who fear being judged by you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A quote from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/05/randombreathlessstuff.html#2&quot;&gt;1994 blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I try not to get offended on principle.&quot; I was quoting someone else, but I've remembered that. Just because I should be offended, doesn't mean, if I'm not actually offended, that I have to pretend I was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If you still think Stallman should be destroyed, go see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others&quot;&gt;Lives of Others&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful film about intellectuals in East Germany during the Cold War. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The best part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613&quot;&gt;The Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt; is the very last line, with Paul McCartney. &quot;The musical papers which you used to read, started to slag us off because we hadn't done anything, because it took five months to record. And I remember with great glee seeing in one of the papers 'ohh the Beatles have dried up, there's nothing going on, they've been in the studio, can't think, what are they doing. And I was sort of sitting rubbing my hands just saying Oh you just wait.&quot;</description>

			<description>A famous John Lennon quote. He was asked if Ringo was the best drummer he knew. “Ringo wasn’t the best drummer in the world,&quot; Lennon is said to have said. &quot;Let’s face it, he wasn’t even the best drummer in The Beatles.” Ringo complains about that in the video. He says all the other Beatles wish they were drummers. I think we were having our legs pulled.</description>
