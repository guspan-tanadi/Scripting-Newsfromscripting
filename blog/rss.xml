Thank heavens &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; did this. The Democrats are terrible at being nasty. For that you need a Republican.</description>

			<description>I think the #BLM protests will become more substantial as the hardships of the virus get deeper. In the US, for example, the rent moratoria are expiring. Unemployment subsidies as well. Hunger and homelessness will explode as unemployment did in March and April.</description>

			<description>I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22the+correspondent%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;The Correspondent&lt;/a&gt; this morning, the first communication since they disappeared. I contributed $25 so I could find out what contributors got. Did it ever amount to anything? TheC didn't make sense, didn't come close to earning the universal acclaim it got, or the money they raised from the people. They claimed they would open a new kind of news org in America, and when they met their money-raising goal said that was never their intention. The problem with snake oil pitches like The Correspondent, aside from the fact that they're dishonest, is that they suck resources away from ideas that might actually make news work better. This happened repeatedly in tech. A famous successful tech entrepreneur claims to have found a breakthrough, and the press gets all excited. It sucks up all the money and attention that might have gone to products that could really have helped, and then they do it again and again. People should be suspicious of grand claims, no matter who is making them. And if you, an analyst, really think you've found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUN1ClT9i9w&quot;&gt;The One&lt;/a&gt;, you should get opinions from friends before you stake your rep on it.</description>

			<description>The other day I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a135058&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a short definition of blogging, including a word I suspect not a lot of bloggers would use -- fluid. To me the process of writing on your blog, if it isn't fluid, it isn't doing its job. By fluid I mean this. I have an idea. Count the steps before the idea appears on your blog and how complex the steps are. The more steps the more likely you'll lose your way, and find it hard to get back to what you were doing. You respond by skipping it altogether next time, the idea is lost. You can engineer fluidity, the same way you can optimize for other attributes. But most blogging software doesn't imho even try.</description>

			<title>Defensive driving in code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing the example from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/07/140541.html?title=aCaseStudyInReadableCode&quot;&gt;previous case study&lt;/a&gt;. The routine, pad, takes three parameters, a string or something that can be coerced to a string, a character to pad with, and the number of places to pad to. So &lt;i&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4)&lt;/i&gt; returns a string whose value is 0008. It's useful for neat tabular displays.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In an app I'm working on, I call pad a lot. Then, while testing it in a new environment, I got an error message from the JavaScript runtime:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the stack, the error was in the first line of pad.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I conclude that val is undefined in one of the many calls. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The question -- should I find the place I called it with undefined and add logic to not call pad in that case, or should I add the test in pad, and return something reasonable when val is undefined?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the point of this case study.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Changing a core routine like pad is tricky. If you change its functionality, you potentially break code that calls it. If it's been around a while, who knows all the places it has been called. However in this case, that's not an issue, because any call that has undefined as the value of the first parameter is going to fail. So it's already broken, therefore you can't break it and therefore it's okay to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the question is if it's &lt;i&gt;desirable&lt;/i&gt; to fix it in pad, or in the place that calls it that causes the app to fail. For me that's a no-brainer. It would clutter up every call if we don't put it in the function. The whole point of factoring like this is to trade off a tiny bit of time for space and reduced complexity. Factoring is a good thing, and you should do it whenever it's responsible. Remember what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; said. Basically factoring is good, but don't do too much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I call this coding technique &lt;i&gt;defensive driving. &lt;/i&gt;It's something you do in case the other driver (the caller) screws up. You want to prevent the accident. Most of the time it won't accomplish anything, but when it does, it saves you from a crash. One less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the new version of pad, with the defensive driving code added:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = (val === undefined) ? &quot;&quot; : val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while (s.length &lt; ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;s = withchar + s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (s);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes &lt;i&gt;pad&lt;/i&gt; a little more complicated -- a fact of life. Production code is rarely as simple as demo code because it has to deal with all the crap that gets thrown at it. Defensive driving is how you deal with that, the same as in driving a car or riding a bike in traffic. You never know what the other idiot is going to do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I still want an automatic blog indexer web app. I would pay you $50 a year to do this for my blog. Create a website that's organized like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/10/index.png&quot;&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; in the back of a book. It digests my new stuff every day (or hourly, even better), and adds each item under topics in the index.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I'd like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs. But not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend hours reading a book via its index. A bootstrap. I'd love to help drive such a project. We need this.</description>

			<description>The biggest problem in police in America are the unions. You want to reboot the police? Knock out the unions. Redefine them. Limit their power. Then the voters can pass new laws about police. Until then, anything Congress passes is powerless. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/reagan-fires-11359-air-traffic-controllers&quot;&gt;Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, when he took office, outlawed the Flight Controllers union. So you can do it. No more police unions. Police, you don't like it? You're fired.</description>

			<description>Trump, if he had any competence could have easily made himself indispensable. The virus was the perfect storm. Not only did he blow the initial response, he refused to do anything beyond that. Any other president would have an approval of 99% just for having a pulse.</description>

			<description>Heard a bit this morning on NPR about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22defund+the+police%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=news&quot;&gt;Defund The Police&lt;/a&gt;. I heard it said if Joe Biden doesn't embrace it his election could be in doubt. That's fucked up.  It doesn't mean what it says. It's a really bad slogan, and if he were to say he agrees, it would lose &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; a lot of votes.</description>

			<description>Defund is not a good word. Whoever came up with the slogan, it may work in City Council meetings, but it isn't a slogan for the presidential election. This needs to be driven by the people, and that's what's happening. The Dems now have all the support needed to make change. Now let's see if they are independent enough to do it. Or are their strings to money too rigid?</description>

			<description>There was so much happening so quickly during the first days of the protests. I couldn't figure out what was going on in NYC. And that's just one city. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/podcasts/the-daily/police-brutality-protests.html&quot;&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; filled in some of the blanks, if you're confused I highly recommend it. It pays to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War&quot;&gt;The Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; every so often for a reminder of how confusing war is. In America, our military thought the Vietnam War was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory&quot;&gt;war against communism&lt;/a&gt;. On the other side it was a war for independence. We fought that war for years, at huge cost, and we didn't even agree on what the war was about. Think about that.</description>

			<description>In a late night &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressthink.org/2020/06/battleship-newspaper/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Jay Rosen tells the story of the editor in chief of the LA Times in the heyday of print news. He likens his publication to a huge battleship steaming along, and describes critics as swimmers throwing dead fish at the ship. Of no consequence. The ship will go where it wants to go, as fast as it cares to. Fast forward to the NY Times in 2020, being forced to listen to their reporters, a new class of critic. They say we might personally be hurt by this thing you did. And no one stops to notice that there are millions of other people who would be hurt, and the Constitution (which makes the idea of a news org possible), and a way of life. Not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/200607/p6#a200607p6&quot;&gt;all the tweets&lt;/a&gt;, op-eds, blog posts, no one sees the problem. In the analog of the LA Times editor, what matters is the ocean. Not the captain, or the deck hands, not the swimmers or the dead fish, or even the battleship. It everything. And that's what's so incomprehensible to an industry that has struggled to be blind to the people it's supposed to serve. Always inventing new distractions. Never showing up for the only job that matters, serving the people.</description>

			<description>At Living Videotext, my first company, I used to pore over the regcards when they came back. After they were entered in the database they were cycled back to me a few months later, I would call a few and find out how they were doing with the product, and if they were really using it (I could tell) I'd ask what they wanted to see fixed or added. After a while there was a consensus, and they were usually the things I also wanted added or fixed (and they already had been, I was CEO and lead developer). I saw my job as using the product myself, and also listening to the other people who used it. Actually it was my favorite part of the job. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A case study in readable code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just wrote a JavaScript function that pads a string with a character you supply, to a certain number of places. You call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would return:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;0008&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a useful thing to have around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now how would you write it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet you could do it in a single expression. It might be hard to understand, but in a way that's kind of cool. You have to be smart to understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, as a less spectacular coder, I would write it in eight lines of the most boring code possible. For example, &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while (s.length &lt; ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;s = withchar + s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (s);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can quickly read it and see what it does. I don't have to spend any time thinking about it, so I get on with my project that much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now this might strike you as inefficient. Look at all that code, and the looping. Oy. For fun, write a benchmark script. Call it a million times and see how long it takes. I'm pretty sure you'll see that it's fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It tooks 0.04 seconds to call &lt;i&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4) &lt;/i&gt;a million times on my iMac. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/07/oneMillionLoops.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Albert Einstein &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
