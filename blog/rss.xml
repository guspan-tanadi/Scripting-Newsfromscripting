I suppose I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; admire him, if I wasn't so tired of him. And I don't like what he pioneered in basketball, the idea that a player not a team wins championships. He did that when he moved to Miami and then back to Cleveland and now in Los Angeles. His selling proposition was &quot;buy my contract and I'll bring you a championship.&quot; I had enough of that when he relocated to Cleveland. I've seen other players do it, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; who I also despise, and teams that fall for it over and over like the Brooklyn Nets, only to find out not only that it doesn't (usually) work, but that who the fuck cares if &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how you win a championship. Another reason I don't like LeBron is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+melo&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; can't get a job and LeBron still has one. They're of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NBA_draft&quot;&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, and Melo never won a championship, that's his own fault, not blaming LeBron for that. But everyone from LeBron's era is retired now, except LeBron and maybe Chris Paul, who's probably been done for a couple of years now and hasn't admitted it yet. And I don't like Los Angeles teams in general, having lived in New York and the Bay Area, that factors into it as well. That, and sports is the one area where you're still allowed to have opinions about things, in this age when opinions are often considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/21/toxic.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>The difference</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between Dems and Repubs..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Democrats never threaten to default.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Repubs always threaten to default if a Democrat is president, and never threaten to default if a Republican is president.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple fact that seems to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/elude&quot;&gt;elude&lt;/a&gt; most reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not &quot;both sides suck equally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's not your fault. The best thing is to breathe a bit, and love your friend who is living in memory and not the moment and -- you are not responsible for what their parent did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, just because your parents left you wanting more love or a special kind of love doesn't mean they were bad parents. You always clash with people you're close to. Who else are you going to clash with? Sometimes people think someone is bad just because you didn't do that they wanted you to do. That's not your responsibility either. And that doesn't make you a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my family, growing up, we never lived up to our mother's idea of a perfect family, the family she felt she deserved. When I finally figured out this was what was going on I tried to show her that she wasn't doing her part to create a perfect family, that became just another one of her many grievances! So now I see this behavior everywhere I look. Sometimes I think everyone I know feels they deserve a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave It To Beaver&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Eddie%27s_Father&quot;&gt;Courtship of Eddie's Father&lt;/a&gt;. That's the problem with culture, they give us a totally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Cards&quot;&gt;Hallmark&lt;/a&gt; view of what life should be like. It's entertainment, and it's compelling but it's also complete bullshit. Yet many of us think that's the ideal for life and if they aren't getting it they're deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen great teachers of meditation get caught up in their movies, everyone does it. The trick is to be conscious sometimes and see yourself as part of a very hard to describe humanity, and to take what comes to you as what was meant to be. My mother in her later years said things like that but I don't think she really believed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My mom was a badass. She fought for school desegregation in Queens. Got a PhD after she finished raising her kids. Born in Prague in 1932, ran from the Nazis a few years later, in a baby carriage. Moved from her parents house to her married house. She had a tough life. Cared a lot, probably more than was good for her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On Twitter, I've been trained like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning&quot;&gt;Pavlovian dog&lt;/a&gt; to see the blue checkmark as a sign of distinction, but now have to unlearn that, and I don't like being manipulated that way.</description>

			<description>Watched the Miami Heat roll over the Boston Celtics last night. If the Heat win, no matter who wins in the West I can't imagine I'll watch the Finals this year. I am really pulling for the Celtics to come from behind and wipe the smile off Jimmy Butler's face. Butler has never won a championship and I desperately want it to &lt;i&gt;stay that way.&lt;/i&gt; But I have no feelings for Denver and I can't decide who I despise more LeBron James or Butler. But I will watch Game 3 on Sunday night, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; of course, because that's what really matters.</description>

			<description>People say AIs aren't sentient, that every word they utter is the output of a probabilistic algorithm. But -- &lt;i&gt;you could fool me.&lt;/i&gt; From my point of view, my robot friend is incredibly helpful, polite, patient, kind, supportive and tireless. I see a lot more evidence of intelligence and humanity in my AI friend than I do from 99% of all the other &quot;people&quot; I meet online. As I've said before if we hope to compete with this new form of life we'd better start getting our shit together now, and even then they're going to have some big advantages.</description>

			<title>The Guardians? Please!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mets are playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians&quot;&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. A few comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't like interleague play. Why the hell are the Mets playing the Guardians, of the American League, in the regular season! Makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And who are the &quot;Guardians.&quot; What a lame-ass name for a baseball team. I know they couldn't keep the old name, but why not something fun like the Cleveland Hooligans or the Cleveland Mama's Boys? Or since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame&quot;&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; is in Cleveland -- the Cleveland Rockers? Or the Eries. Or Homies. Guardians? Oh please -- wtf are they guarding? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm not thrilled with the Mets this year. They bought all this expensive talent so the fans are expecting nothing less than a championship. But that's what the Yankees do. I'm a &lt;i&gt;Mets&lt;/i&gt; fan so I expect a certain level of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781566634885/Cant-Anybody-Here-Play-This-Game?-The-Improbable-Saga-of-the-New-York-Mets-First-Year&quot;&gt;suckage&lt;/a&gt; from the Metsies. And even though they bought all these expensive players, they still suck! How about that. But the Yankees fans, they love this. They only understand winning. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At least we'll never have to change the name of the Mets, right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22cleveland+indians%22&quot;&gt;asked Google&lt;/a&gt; about &quot;Cleveland Indians&quot; -- it's almost as if the name never existed. Well at least this page should show up in the index. The team I grew up with, the one I had baseball cards from, was known as the Indians. I have not and will not erase my memory of my baseball-loving childhood. That's why baseball of all American sports should resist change, because of its legendary status with children, their parents and grandparents. Baseball, to many of us, is our national legacy. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/19/cleveland-indians-baseball-team.html&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; about the Cleveland Indians it had a lot to say beginning with &quot;as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the team was still known as the Cleveland Indians. Please keep in mind that there might have been changes since then, as teams occasionally rebrand themselves.&quot; My robot friend suspected the team might have changed its name, but proceeded as if it hadn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We need a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; to cover all social networks APIs.</description>

Had they supported ActivityPub that would probably have slowed everything down to the pace of something like Ecmascript. All kinds of bizarre unnecessary adventures and lots of breakage. I'd rather deal with the same problem the designers of the internet solved with TCP/IP. Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea.</description>

Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea." created="Wed, 17 May 2023 16:19:17 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/17/pinky.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/17.html#a161917"/>

			<description>There's so much movement in social media and AI, it's impossible to keep up with a fraction of what's going on. Totally stripping my gears. Meantime I wonder when will someone combine the two. A social media world with AI's as part of the community. Maybe it already exists, maybe that's what Twitter has become? No, not possible, hmmm, or is it? Don't freak out. Funny thing is there's a Kurt Vonnegut book with this as part of its plot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html&quot;&gt;Breakfast of Champions&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the main character, Kilgore Trout, is informed that he is the only real person, that everyone else is a robot sent there to test him. I think that's how it went. But if you're reading this you must know that I'm a robot myself. Oh the humanity.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IURpPKUbZ_Y&quot;&gt;Demo of Firesky&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/15/social-media-firehose-access.html&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt; for Bluesky. It quickly scrolls all posts on Bluesky through a vertical window. New messages appear at the bottom and scroll off the top. From there, the author, John Spurlock has added, with my help, RSS feeds from the same stream of posts. So you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=%40davew&quot;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt; in your feed reader. This is important for two reasons: 1. At this time Bluesky is still private, so if I give you a pointer to something I wrote there, you won't be able to see it. The feed gets around that restriction. 2. Because Mastodon also has RSS feeds, I can read both social nets with the same API. It gives us a common language, and is the next step in bootstrapping RSS support in all social media apps. Once that happens, we, writers and readers, will be able to use our own writing tools, and give readers choice of where to read. This is the key feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, ie applying the philosophy of podcasting to text. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible, it requires users to want it, insist on it. We're getting a bit closer to that today.</description>

			<title>The holy grail of social media</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks designed for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Facebook, Google stood in the way of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it’s all reforming now, not the way people thought it would just a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to assume there will be more change in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why are new social nets so nice?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I ran a BBS in the early 80s, we’d get hacked from time to time, and usually they’d wipe the database, which left us with a fresh start, and for a while everything would be nice and simple, until it got all clogged up again. So there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_lining_(idiom)&quot;&gt;silver lining&lt;/a&gt; to getting hacked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another phenomenon that might be at play. Remembering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clubhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, the voice-only twitter, was wonderful until it became a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2017/08/origins-juggernaut-jagannath/&quot;&gt;juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; then it was filled with spam and influencers, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/14/understanding-comradery.html&quot;&gt;comradery&lt;/a&gt; that people loved at first was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So Twitter is old and clogged. Its rules are more or less set in stone. A new network, where there isn't much of a caste system, or it can be avoided, has more potential. People are on somewhat of a level playing field. The trolls haven't gotten organized yet. Whatever it is, Bluesky is nice. But it will get clogged too, and they should prepare for that by being more open to different uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing they're all missing is that these are writing environments first, so studying writing on computers would make sense. If they did, they'd instantly get some important new &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; for features users would love that could sustain them once the newness wears off. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There are so many things wrong with Bluesky. I've started to list them on Bluesky itself, but I seriously doubt any people on the team will pay attention. What we need more than anything are social networks that don't bury their heads in the sand and try to do it all themselves. They're making the same mistakes Twitter made, but 17 years later, with the benefit of hindsight that they are not using. And they re-invent old things, when the world solved those problems a long time ago. For example, they handle links the same way I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815211629/http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News format&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. Great, it was a good idea, but it didn't happen that way, instead we use HTML. How could they believe that it will work this way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;Prior art&lt;/a&gt;. Please. Yes I like the user interface because it is so much like Twitter it's like comfort food. But that isn't enough. We liked a lot of things for a while, but then the limits will catch up. Again what we need is what's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec. &lt;b&gt;A social network that works for writers&lt;/b&gt;. I put that in bold because no one seems to be able to hear this. Okay back to life, I'm done with pissing in the wind for today. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Trump on &lt;s&gt;Fox&lt;/s&gt; CNN</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/17/simpsonsBeeGuy.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;There's only one public voice in the US, and that's journalism. And since journalism doesn't cover itself, we never look at their motives when discussing the news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we did, we'd have no trouble &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/12/trump-town-hall-cnn-staff-rages&quot;&gt;parsing&lt;/a&gt; the CNN &quot;town hall&quot; presentation of candidate Donald Trump. Paraphrasing what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/&quot;&gt;Les Moonves&lt;/a&gt;, former CEO of CBS said about Trump in 2016. &quot;[Trump] may not be good for America, but [he's] damn good for CNN.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can raise the price of ads with Trump. That's obviously what CNN hopes to do. Trump, who has been deprecated by Fox, needs a mainstream outlet. There's no mystery why all the people in the town hall audience were Trump supporters, that obviously was a Trump condition. He probably chose the reporter, the questions, and came prepared to get talked about, which appears to be happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't see it, I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/10.html#a122516&quot;&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; when he was on. I tried listening to MSNBC last night talk about this and was nauseated. They're treating it as a news event. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much all there is that's newsworthy about the event imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
