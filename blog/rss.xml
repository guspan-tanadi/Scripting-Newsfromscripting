			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2023/06/27/lets-welcome-meta.html&quot;&gt;Manton Reece writes&lt;/a&gt; that we should welcome Facebook's new cage fighting platform, not block it. I'm neutral. I don't know what it is. I seriously doubt it'll be exciting. And I think they should stop calling themselves Meta, that's stupid and dishonest. They're Facebook. They need to own that, because it's their actual name.</description>

			<title>My friend Doc</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Doc is about to lose his Harvard blog, and he's stuck in California with too much to do and is afraid it will slip through is fingers if he has to prioritize his time so as not to be able to save it. I wrote him this email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A perfect storm. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had something smaller happen when I was moving out of my house in Berkeley in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My server was down, it was a serious system thing. But I had to turn over the house to the new owners and get in my car and start the trip back to NYC.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I got a call from someone deep in Amazon, their CTO who reads my blog had asked him to call to see if he could help, but I had no time. I had to leave. 1.35 million reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After that, no one at Amazon will talk to me. They must have given me a zero in their rating system. I was offered Cadillac support and turned it down. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How dare me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We suck Doc. We don't matter. I'm receiving confirmation of that every day, except from friends, who remind me that I do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So I'm your friend -- even if your blog doesn't come with you, you're still my friend. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

And that's info the company &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; people to have, and it ’s well documented on their site. We were supposed to be creating an information rich world, but so far it hasn’t worked.

There are at least two URLs you can use to access the RSS 2.0 spec on the Harvard website. When I looked up the one with the apparent problem, it was one they only started tracking in 2016? I don't know. &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/at.kyefox.com&quot;&gt;Kye Fox&lt;/a&gt; on Bluesky &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/at.kyefox.com/post/3jyxlk4hgn72x&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; an archive of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20030801072832/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss&quot;&gt;the spec&lt;/a&gt; that is available on archive.org starting on July 22, 2003. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/07.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for this blog for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/07.html&quot;&gt;July 2003&lt;/a&gt; (the actual page, not on archive.org). This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss&quot;&gt;the URL&lt;/a&gt; we were using at that time. It hadn't been moved to cyber.law.harvard.edu yet. So we have found a snapshot of the spec from 2003. And it was my mistake, not archive.org's. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/20/224546.html&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it had been at the same address for all 20+ years was not true.

Why can't they do it for me? I've been spoiled by ChatGPT which actually parses the words I type, and gives me the answers I asked for. For example, I have a Google Workspace account, set up by someone else. I want to add new email addresses to my account. I can't find out how much I'm already paying for the email addresses that are already allocated. I do know the total amount, $26/month. It's way too much money for what it's doing, btw. Basically I'd like to give it instructions in my language. &quot;I'm thinking of adding five new email addresses, how much will that add to my monthly bill?&quot; Then if I decide to go ahead, I could just tell it, in my own language -- &quot;add them please.&quot; Pretty simple, right? It's what I would say to a human being, and the human would get it. And so would ChatGPT. Why can't Google Workspace? See how much software now has to be redesigned to meet the expectations of people who expect the ease of use of ChatGPT?</description>

			<title>Question the W3C's advice re RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The net-net of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/feedvalidator/issues/106&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; this week with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; and their hosting or pointing to a modified &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; spec is that at this time, before trusting any advice it gives based on RSS, you must be sure that it's covered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;original spec&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the discussion we had with the W3C, the sysop of their website &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/feedvalidator/issues/106#issuecomment-1600956714&quot;&gt;said clearly&lt;/a&gt; and I believe innocently that the modified &quot;version&quot; of the spec is what they're using to guide the validator.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But there are no versions of RSS 2.0. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's frozen. It says it clearly in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, which explains &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/24/roadmap.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;why it's frozen&lt;/a&gt;, developers need stability. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that happened over twenty years ago. And it worked. RSS is one of the most broadly supported formats on the web. It's the basis for podcasting. It's widely supported by news orgs and blogging software. All kinds of systems have been built around RSS. Twenty years of development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the W3C's defense, I gather they inherited the validator, and the people who wrote it originally were trying to steer people away from RSS to another format. They wanted their ideas in all our feeds, and used the validator to get their way. In the end their steering people to the other format didn't do any real damage that I could see, just added unnecessary confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I have to draw the line at the W3C.

There are no modifications allowed, that's part of the spec. It's a rule, and a validator that breaks that rule is not validating RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I believe I've explained this from every possible angle. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Net-net, until it's fixed -- be careful with the W3C's advice re RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Subsequent work should happen in modules, using namespaces, and in completely new syndication formats, with new names.&quot;" created="Thu, 22 Jun 2023 01:27:54 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/24/rssCoffeeMug.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/21.html#a012754"/>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;It worked.&lt;/i&gt; RSS 2.0 has stood the test of time. Lots of innovation has taken place in the namespaces, and the core has stayed intact. There were a lot of people who wanted to control and own RSS when I wrote that. If it hadn't been frozen they'd still be fighting over the basics. We've made a lot with RSS and we're going to make a lot more. It'll be important in the evolution of social media, podcasting, blogging and more. This is what the roadmap says. It worked and continues to work.</description>

			<title>Write specs for humans</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I like to write specs for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho too many specs are organized the way a computer would want them, the way software is organized. Establish basic vocabulary in layers then and assume the human reader will know how to put the pieces together to do things. Never answer questions a busy developer would have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Humans like it the other way around. Show me how to do X, Y and Z, the most common things people want to do with the API, and then later explain how the pieces fit together. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of AI, computers can now read what humans read. So you should just write your specs for humans and it'll work fine for computers too!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Gotta change with the times. 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This should probably be filed under &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Heh.

			<description>But here's some good news. There's no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it's probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is &quot;really simple&quot; and the benefit of federation is well known &lt;i&gt;to users.&lt;/i&gt; That's been what's kept it from being pwned by bigco's all these years.</description>

			<description>Also it'll be interesting to see how much of ActivityPub Facebook supports in their product. When Google Reader came out for RSS their trick was to break RSS by not supporting a key feature. This did huge damage that we're still dealing with long after Google is gone.</description>

			<title>The old weblogs.com feeling</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is we can all look at each other's feed lists to get ideas about what to subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was playing with ideas, looking at a bunch of different people's collections, and I saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1&quot;&gt;John Naughton's feed list&lt;/a&gt; a reminder of a centerpiece of the early blogging world, weblogs.com. You could quickly see which blogs had updated recently so you knew there was a reason to go there. It was the beginning of what eventually became Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over time as more blogs came online, it got diluted, we had to come up with something better and luckily &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; came along, and without much thought we switched over to that and weblogs.com fell into disuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20021123211136/http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;archive.org snapshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/18/weblogsComScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of weblogs.com from November 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1&quot;&gt;Naughton's list&lt;/a&gt; I had the old weblogs.com feeling! These are all people I'm interested in, but I don't have them in their own category anywhere, so I never see it like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With a bit of coordination it would be pretty cool to have a FeedLand page that tracked a bunch more Old School bloggers who are still blogging, or give ones who aren't a reason to restart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/18/feedlistscreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Partial screen shot of Naughton's list shortly after this item was posted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sell Reddit to its users?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reddit as a business is going down a user-hostile path. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I had this idea, I wonder if a compromise is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They want to do an IPO. Why not sell it to the users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A tech company run for the benefit of its users. What an idea! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a site that the users should own it's Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reddit could reboot as a non-profit or public benefit corp. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run intelligently to keep costs to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get help from a foundation perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you want to know why we feel stuck, next time you decide not to be compatible with someone else, that's why, right there. It just takes two to set a standard. I speak from experience. My partner with RSS 2.0 was the NYT. With XML-RPC it was Microsoft. With rssCloud it was Automattic. See how that works. Companies that decide to partner with truly independent developers can have the agility they don't usually get with their internal processes. It's how simple stuff actually makes it into the market. Again I speak from experience. Us little guys can work together too, but I guess they don't see they could be part of getting a consensus going. &lt;i&gt;But they can.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="Developers even the best ones are terrible at compromise, that's why it's so hard to federate in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/06/16/cowpaths.html&quot;&gt;pave-the-cowpaths&lt;/a&gt; way and big companies run by venture capitalists and Elon Musk always kick our butts and we end up wasting 17 years losing all the good stuff we had before, with no simple path forward. If you want to know why we feel stuck, next time you decide not to be compatible with someone else, that's why, right there. It just takes two to set a standard. I speak from experience. My partner with RSS 2.0 was the NYT. With XML-RPC it was Microsoft. With rssCloud it was Automattic. See how that works. Companies that decide to partner with truly independent developers can have the agility they don't usually get with their internal processes. It's how simple stuff actually makes it into the market. Again I speak from experience. Us little guys can work together too, but I guess they don't see they could be part of getting a consensus going. &lt;i&gt;But they can.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Fri, 16 Jun 2023 14:35:19 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/27/mayochup.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/16.html#a143519"/>

			<description>One of the things I did this morning was carefully read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API docs&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in 2002. This became a widely supported standard almost instantly on publication. There was a demand for it. At that time, being compatible at an API level was a competitive issue for blogging software. A must-have feature.</description>

			<description>Did you wonder why there were no Jan 6 crowds at either of Trump’s arraignments? Isn’t it obvious? Any would-be insurrectionists saw the Jan 6 folks get tried, convicted and put in jail. That makes the whole thing real. Americans of 2023 are soft. We’re the ones who got tax cuts from Bush while we were at war. We had no draft, no price controls. War was okay as long as we could ignore it. We’d rather have others make the sacrifices for us. We like to own guns to support our fantasy that we’re badasses, but truthfully we’d rather watch the revolution on TV than go to jail, esp for a crybaby snob like Trump.</description>

When you achieve a certain amount of wealth, you are declared a winner. A champion. There's a ceremony where you get a medal and a special kind of credit card that allows you entry to the VIP room wherever you go. In that room you have free drinks, the most comfortable chairs, fantastic snacks, for you and a guest. Everywhere you go people are required to salute you. All the benefits. You eat the best food, sit in first class, and you live in a very nice house or apartment where all your neighbors are also champs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that, sounds great right, but what do you give up? You can't make any more money. That's it. Your earning days are over. You won. Now find something else to do. You can't have more than one house, one car -- no private jets, you can't own sports teams or CNN. You have to live like a human being, not consume more than double what a non-champ consumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like socialism or communism, deal with it. Because when you own 12 homes and fly around in your private jet, and consume hundreds of times more than you can possibly use, you're putting the continued existence, of all of us, in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: You get free guitar lessons too, and a nice guitar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🎸&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
