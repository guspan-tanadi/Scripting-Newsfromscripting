			<description>We optimize iteratively for incompetence in government, that's why you end up with actors who look ok in a suit who say words and get to be on tv and live in nice houses, eat good food, fly on private jets, and go around in motorcades.</description>

			<description>A nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1583546691549921280&quot;&gt;testimonial&lt;/a&gt; from Matt Mullenweg, about my role in getting podcasting started. Matt has made his own huge contribution to the open web with his WordPress content management system, and many other projects. I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml?title=startingUpInFeedLand&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; will fit in well with their new open source podcast client. Scroll to the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2022/10/open-source-podcasting-client/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/22/pocketAnnounceClip.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; how enthusiastic they are about sharing subscription lists. They don't know it yet, but they're going to get some incredible support from FeedLand. It's designed to plug into that interface. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1583551708621217792&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; to Matt that they go the next step and let the user enter the URL of an OPML list, and read it periodically so they can manage their subscriptions elsewhere. I like it because it'll mean all my favorite podcasts will be available there and on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dave.podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;web podcast site&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>We the people ought to make this election a blowout of turnout. Fill the streets with voters. A real show of power. Fuck the politicians. The Dems seem pretty complicit if you ask me. Scare the daylights out of all of them.</description>

Stop being so fucking patient. &lt;i&gt;Trump stole the documents because he has customers for them. &lt;/i&gt;That's all he cares about. Stop defending him. These aren't coincidences.</description>

			<description>If I were in charge of the Democratic Party's advertising leading up to the midterms, I'd zero in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/thomas-constitutional-rights-00042256&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas's opinion&lt;/a&gt; on the Dobbs case which said the insane part out loud. The next things that are going to be made illegal, after abortion -- contraception, same-sex marriage. The other conservatives say no, but we've been down &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices-said-roe-abortion-confirmations-rcna35246&quot;&gt;that road&lt;/a&gt;. People expect to be told about the evilness of the other side, and if there is no evil in the advertising, it's reasonable to assume there is no evil.</description>

The announcers describe the scene. Someone from the crowd had run out on the field and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AriA1exander/status/1583287947469918208&quot;&gt;tried to hug&lt;/a&gt; the Houston infielder &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Altuve&quot;&gt;José Altuve&lt;/a&gt;. They described how the police were trying to catch the guy. How much would his lawyers cost for this? $10K another announcer thought. And he'll spend the night in jail, another collegue guessed. But we didn't see any of this. The camera never pointed at the action because to do so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/&quot;&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; felt, would encourage people to do more of this. It's a rule for a kind of journalism, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator#Main/play-by-play_commentator&quot;&gt;sports play-by-play&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think there's much actual journalism in the coverage of professional sports (I can go into that another time). Okay so what if there were a similar rule to political journalism, if they were not allowed to run stories based only on polling. For a different reason, because polling has proven to be wildly wrong in the last few elections. Polls were almost certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; would win. They got whole sections of the country wildly wrong. Many other examples. There are theories about why this is, but no one knows. So it seems hugely damaging, even unprofessional to report poll results as news, esp when it isn't disclaimed in the headline, so it's clear they're writing about fiction and the story is almost certainly 100% &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/span&gt;.</description>

			<description>One of the big lessons I learned from selling what people now call &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/span&gt; a long time ago, that there's a very limited market of people who see their job as thinking, even if there's a lot of thought to what they do. If you go to a Monday staff meeting and when it's your turn to speak you say &quot;I spent the week thinking about stuff&quot; you might be the first one they cut when it's time for layoffs or promotions. Bosses want to hear what you did, not what you thought about. The secret is this -- production applications. Things they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; with your product as opposed to thinking about things. If you find one of those that resonates, sell the shit out of it. For us it was presentations. It kept showing up near the top of lists of what people used &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/span&gt; for. When we made features specifically for presenting, the product took off. We went from selling &quot;idea processing&quot; to presenting. Sure there's a lot of thinking in preparing presentations, that's why the product worked so well for that. It's like saying there's a lot of steering in driving the car. What you're doing is driving. Steering is just part of it.</description>

			<title>Someone else's feed list</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/screenshots/someoneElsesFeedList.png?x=1&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/span&gt; list as viewed by another user. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/20/someoneElsesFeedList.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;My feedlist as viewed by another user.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are the feeds I'm subscribed to. When I look at the list, all the feeds are checked, but when another user looks at the same list, only the ones they're subscribed to are checked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is a core feature of the product. It's how we share new feeds to follow, both inside and outside of FeedLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a very porous product, since it's about feeds, it's all about moving ideas all over the place. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To subscribe to a feed, just click the checkbox.

No one did, so as often happens, I did it myself. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;FeedLand is not yet released. It is currently being used by about twenty people, since early August. I don't want to add more yet, because this product is about community. We're not ready yet for a lot of new people. We're going slow and deliberately. I remember from past experience how community cultures develop. I want to get this right.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To people who make (and use) feed readers, the lists people create in FeedLand can easily be shared with feed readers that support OPML import. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt; in OPML. It changes as I add and remove feeds from the list via the checkboxes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm writing FeedLand docs today, preparing for some new users. My hope is they'll actually read the docs, but -- well at least I hope they read the Getting Started docs. I try to make the writing interesting, with lots of screen shots and side-stories. Easter eggs where possible. Once I get going I do actually enjoy this kind of writing. I've only been doing it for 35 or so years. Heh. Ooops.</description>

			<title>Imagine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine if journalism really did their jobs, and to be fair this includes Fox News and their kin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a lot less than a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths&quot;&gt;million Americans&lt;/a&gt; would have died from Covid. But even if they had all died, people would know that incompetence of the US government response was largely responsible. That who you choose to run the government very much matters. It could be life and death for you and your family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People would also know about the game the Repubs play with the debt limit, holding the wealth of the US hostage, in return for concessions that make their benefactors richer, and support the empire that Putin is trying to reboot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And on and on. So many huge problems we only begin to deal with when there's a Democratic government, and sometimes they survive the Repubs, but one of these times they won't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't understand the role government plays in our lives. Journalism should be helping them figure it out, instead it only reinforces the errors, telling the people only what they expect to hear. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Where's the feed?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a new news org on the web today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://semafor.com&quot;&gt;semafor.com&lt;/a&gt;. It looks iteresting, but I can't find the feed? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's no meta information in the &lt;a href=&quot;view-source:https://www.semafor.com/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; for the home page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There doesn't seem to be a page saying how to find the feeds.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm beginning to believe there might not be any. Shudder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm enlisting help from people who believe in the open web, to help find and curate links to feeds on interesting sites, old and new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I put this out there, here, on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/18/131751.html?title=wheresTheFeed&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1582362674104455170&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dave.micro.blog/2022/10/18/seamfors-feed.html&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, where ever -- &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Where the *&amp;@!# are semafor's feeds?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm often the only person asking for this. I think it'll work better if more people help push. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Semafor's outline format</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's interesting that &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Semafor&lt;/span&gt; is using an outline format much as Axios is. I love the economy of the form, and the promise it makes to a reader. It forces the publication to include all the info a reader might reasonably expect from a story. So often you read a story and you think you're going to find out (for example) what station the show is on, or where the concert is, but they leave out the one crucial bit of info. Often it's probably not deliberate, they just don't think in terms of an actual human being reading -- actually wanting to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the information you expect to be in their article. By having a rigid checklist of things every story must cover, they are making a promise to a reader, that Semafor won't omit crucial information, that they are thinking of the reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Something kind of sad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Let me say up front -- not everything is roses folks. If I were always going to pretend everything were great, what would be the point of writing, it would all be lies. Anyway.. As I close in on the public release of FeedLand..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just realized something pretty sad. People have raised huge amounts of money to redo the development projects I already did, hired all kinds of product managers, marketing people, and most of them failed, I think because none of them understood what they were working on, or didn't have the skills necessary to move forward, so they just re-did stuff in a different way. If I called something &quot;item&quot; they called it &quot;object&quot; -- each of the elements got new names but did the same things. None of the investment went into  actual new development, moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like to develop, and I have limited patience for the other stuff. So when I finish one project I move on to the next one. So I did a great product last year, spent the whole year doing it, but it's just sitting there, because I've spent the next whole year working on the next one. The two products need each other, they hook into each other. It'll be fantastic. But too few people will use it, if the past is a predictor. To the extent other people use it, I won't hear about it, so none of their experience is filtered back into the product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to say that this way of doing development, as much as it fits me, has mostly been wasted. This could still be made to work, but people would have to want to help instead of replace. After people got the idea you can get rich doing internet projects, the spirit of volunteerism has faded. Because the reality is you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; make a fortune here, it's a one in a million shot, but everyone is still trying. Meanwhile everything goes to shit, everywhere you look!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All I've wanted for the last 30 years or so is to lead a team. I know how to do that, having been the CEO of a tech company before. Only I wouldn't cast myself in that role, because when I wake up in the morning I want to keep pushing forward on my development projects. I thought when the VCs were interested in RSS we were talking about me doing the development. Nope, they hired their own programmers, thinking that what I was doing was menial, fungible, or was finished somehow or their guys would know what to do next. My friend Adam Curry started a company, raised huge money, and like the others, thought that he could save some money by replacing me with other programmers. I'm sure the programmers told them they could do it. Something must not have worked. (Sorry that was sarcasm.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Don't cry for me. I haven't given up yet. But one should also accept reality. Even people I thought of as friends wanted to do my work without me. I want to slap them, don't you know anything about software? Fucking idiots. I could tell you some amazing stories about foolishness and greed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After I finish FeedLand the next thing I want to do is straighten out JavaScript. It's ridiculous how much extra work they make you do because they couldn't manage synchronization in the kernel. We have a good start on that in Drummer, I want to finish the job. I want to stop having to stand on my head to get code to synch up. My pseudo code should be my regular code, if you know what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Let me say up front -- not everything is roses folks. If I were always going to pretend everything were great, what would be the point of writing, it would all be lies.

				<source:outline text="I just realized something pretty sad. People have raised huge amounts of money to redo the development projects I already did, hired all kinds of product managers, marketing people, and most of them failed, I think because none of them understood what they were working on, or didn't have the skills necessary to move forward, so they just re-did stuff in a different way. If I called something &quot;item&quot; they called it &quot;object&quot; -- each of the elements got new names but did the same things. None of the investment went into  actual new development, moving forward." created="Sat, 15 Oct 2022 15:34:57 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/10/15/153451.html?title=somethingKindOfSad#a153457"/>
				<source:outline text="I like to develop, and I have limited patience for the other stuff. So when I finish one project I move on to the next one. So I did a great product last year, spent the whole year doing it, but it's just sitting there, because I've spent the next whole year working on the next one. The two products need each other, they hook into each other. It'll be fantastic. But too few people will use it, if the past is a predictor. To the extent other people use it, I won't hear about it, so none of their experience is filtered back into the product." created="Sat, 15 Oct 2022 22:29:16 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/10/15/153451.html?title=somethingKindOfSad#a222916"/>
				<source:outline text="I have to say that this way of doing development, as much as it fits me, has mostly been wasted. This could still be made to work, but people would have to want to help instead of replace. After people got the idea you can get rich doing internet projects, the spirit of volunteerism has faded. Because the reality is you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; make a fortune here, it's a one in a million shot, but everyone is still trying.

				<source:outline text="All I've wanted for the last 30 years or so is to lead a team. I know how to do that, having been the CEO of a tech company before. Only I wouldn't cast myself in that role, because when I wake up in the morning I want to keep pushing forward on my development projects. I thought when the VCs were interested in RSS we were talking about me doing the development. Nope, they hired their own programmers, thinking that what I was doing was menial, fungible, or was finished somehow or their guys would know what to do next. My friend Adam Curry started a company, raised huge money, and like the others, thought that he could save some money by replacing me with other programmers. I'm sure the programmers told them they could do it. Something must not have worked.

				<source:outline text="Don't cry for me. I haven't given up yet. But one should also accept reality. Even people I thought of as friends wanted to do my work without me. I want to slap them, don't you know anything about software? Fucking idiots.

				<source:outline text="After I finish FeedLand the next thing I want to do is straighten out JavaScript. It's ridiculous how much extra work they make you do because they couldn't manage synchronization in the kernel. We have a good start on that in Drummer, I want to finish the job. I want to stop having to stand on my head to get code to synch up. My pseudo code should be my regular code, if you know what I mean." created="Sat, 15 Oct 2022 16:38:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/10/15/153451.html?title=somethingKindOfSad#a163800"/>

			<title>IndieWeb should love RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am often the only person out there reminding people that it's important to know why podcasting, for example, is so open. No platform vendor controls it. Most people who do podcasting don't know why they can do it without Apple's approval, or Google's or Spotify. Yet RSS gets no credit for it. And that hurts other efforts to create open architecture for the web. People don't see the benefit, but it is there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen where ever you get your podcasts,&quot; that's the key. That's the sign that we won.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is a huge success for lower-case &quot;indie web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the lack of support for RSS is one of the reasons I'm disinclined to embrace the standards they promote. Maybe if I understood why this is the case I'd feel better about seeing myself as part of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with OPML. With the Tools For Thought market getting so much investment now, many millions of dollars, how that market evolves, whether it's a bunch of silos, or an open ecosystem, is up for grabs. I love outliners, been making them all my life, but again, when it comes to promoting open formats and interop, I'm pretty much out there on my own. I've more or less given up on this one, at least for now. But it's a huge deal for the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Did you know developers get brain fog? We do. I used to call it stagnation. It usually comes after a period of intense productivity. I run real hard and fast in a direction, drive it to its conclusion -- sometimes it results in a feature, other times a dead end, with lessons learned and ideas for other branches to take, later. Either way it leaves the well dry, and you have to patiently rebuild (or re-kindle, re-prime) your flow, which often takes days.</description>

			<title>Let's try something different</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I generally  don't write about features in a product that's still in testing, I wait until it's &quot;done&quot; whatever that means. But I've found that has less than optimal results. I ship everything at once, and then hope people see the good stuff before they move on. There's no time to focus attention on the individual pieces, and that's where the real work is in making software nice to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's so many new ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; for example that almost no one knows about. It's one of my biggest regrets about how software development works. When I read about musicians in the 60s and how they all knew each other and went to each others' shows. I wish some of the people I respect were up to date on my stuff, and it were easy for me to stay up on their stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So let's give it a try. This is a report on a new feature that I added to &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/span&gt; today. It's still in development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I saw a user request, they wanted a way to tell the system to check a feed for updates without having to copy the URL of the feed to the clipboard and enter it into a dialog. We already had a command that works that way, but why make them work so hard? Indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I added a button to the &lt;i&gt;Feed Info&lt;/i&gt; page, next to the place where it says how many items we've found in the feed and how many times it has been checked. The button says (Check now). Click the button, and when it's done it refreshes the page according to the result of the check. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/14/feedInfoPageScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Screen shot of new (Check now) button on Feed Info page in FeedLand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The astute observer will note that this page works much like the main viewing page in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;. No accident there. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Substack vs Micro.blog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/13/tinaTurnerBarbie.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I once asked a journalist who uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://substack.com&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; how he felt about their editor. His response surprised me. He said he loved Substack and basically wouldn't say anything critical about it. I said I was asking as a software developer. I was wondering if there was any reason to try to put together a nice editor for Substack users, I wasn't asking a &quot;gotcha&quot; question the way a journalist might. I had no intention of quoting the person. My writing isn't like that. I don't quote people very often, and usually if I do, it's without saying who they are, as in this bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was kind of a hypothetical question anyway, because I &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; write an editor for Substack users, they don't permit it. Writers have to use their editor. It's the only reason I don't use Substack myself. I have my own editor that suits my writing style, and don't plan on switching, ever. And I recognize that it's also a lock-in tactic. They make it hard to publish through Substack something you published elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, written by Manton Reece, who I've written about here &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/08.html#a155342&quot;&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; makes it incredibly easy to publish stuff published elsewhere as part of your blog. I recently decided to learn how it works, again, after playing with it a bit when it first came out. It's an interesting product that I sense started out very simple, but over time got so many features that now it's hard to approach as a newbie. But after a number of sessions being somewhat confused, I think I now understand what the product is at its core. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First it's a simple blogging tool. Posts can have titles. You edit in a plain text editor. The system supports Markdown styling and links. It supports outbound &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, and where it gets interesting is that it supports &lt;i&gt;inbound&lt;/i&gt; RSS too. So I can give it the URL of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fradio3.io%2Fusers%2Fdavewiner%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;linkblog feed&lt;/a&gt; and everything I post there appears as if I wrote it on micro.blog. In fact I did that a long time ago the first time I tried it out, and it must appear to some people as if I've been a regular user all along. People reply to my linkblog posts. I feel bad about that. It seems selfish of me to do that, to push ideas into a system, but to not be there to respond on behalf of those ideas. But I haven't taken the link out, at least not yet. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about it, and the reason I put the two products together in one piece is that micro.blog has the one feature that imho would put Substack over the top, and give it a shot at world domination. On the other hand, wouldn't it be nice if micro.blog added a newsletter feature to put a little pressure on Substack to open themselves up a bit more? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I haven't described all the features of micro.blog. For example, in addition to each user having a blog, each user also has a timeline, like Twitter. You subscribe to other users. Not sure if you can subscribe to external RSS feeds (which would make it a feed reader too). Where the boundaries are is where the confusion is, at least for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I think my presence there makes people uncomfortable, perhaps. While the product is a paragon of openness, the community seems kind of closed, basically part of what I think of as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=gruberville&quot;&gt;GruberVille&lt;/a&gt;. All things that emanate from &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;John Gruber's blog&lt;/a&gt;. I am not part of that world, but I have an account. I am harmless, I have no desire to interfere with micro.blog -- I think it's wonderful that someone is doing what Manton is doing. As I've tried to say a number of times, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt;. I am 67 years old and am aware that every time I start a new product it could be my last. I am not trying to conquer anything, however I am trying to shake at least one part of the web out of the deep sleep it has been in ever since Google Reader took over and then was axed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My grandfather who barely escaped Nazis who were killing millions of Jews told me to shoot and kill people like Kanye West. He was furious at how we were treated, and I share his fury.  Maybe the only way we’ll be respected is if they fear us.</description>

			<description>Multiple-party real estate deals must be a thing. I have a house and want a new house. I want to do the switch in one transaction, rather than risk owning two houses. This is analogous to the arrangement they have in sports. Team A only wants to trade player X if they can also trade out player Y. Similarly, homeowner Judy only wants to buy this house if she can sell her house in the same deal.</description>
