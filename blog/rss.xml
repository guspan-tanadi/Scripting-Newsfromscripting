			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token&quot;&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are easy to understand. It's like buying a work of art to hang in your house. Everyone else can have a print. The print is just as beautiful, but the original can possibly appreciate in value. It's controversial because it uses the blockchain (probably the first time I've used that word on this blog) which uses a lot of energy. Isn't there a way to achieve the same without that cost?</description>

			<description>I'm thinking about selling one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/fridayDave.mp3&quot;&gt;my first podcast&lt;/a&gt;s, the one that got the ball rolling, that started my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt; podcasts, and then inspired a community to develop, which caused more podcasts and on and on. People are dismissive of NFTs, and critical, but there's been no other way for a maker of new media types such as myself to get credit for our creations. Looking back, I certainly would have led the bootstrap of podcasting, even if I didn't get credit for it, someone had to do it, we needed to use the internet for audible expression and no one else seemed able to do it. But I'd like young people to know how these things work, they don't have to start companies to make a significant contribution. They can stay in their art.</description>

			<description>It took a while for me to get how common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; is. If someone says, in a discussion, that you're upset, they're gaslighting. It's wrong because: 1. They have no insight into how you feel. 2. They're changing the subject. Gaslighting is insidious.</description>

			<description>A bit of advice to people who want a vaccine but aren't yet eligable. It pays to hang around places that do vaccinations near closing time, because they're required to get extra vaccines into people's arms, if they don't they're wasted. There are, apparently, lots of cancellations and no-shows in some places, so your chances are  getting better all the time. Just want to be sure everyone knows.</description>

			<title>Virus, Democracy, Climate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our focus should be sharply on these three things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Virus &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Democracy&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Climate&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every other issue is a distant non-priority. Yet of course the news keeps gravitating around things other than the mutating virus and people's refusal to mitigate, how we're going to get our republic back on solid ground, and what are we doing to radically change how we live so we can survive the climate catastrophes that are already here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can find a solution for the problem with Governor Cuomo. Have him wear a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uedata.amazon.com/Smartphone-Powerful-Action-Sports-Camera/dp/B016M99GAW&quot;&gt;head camera&lt;/a&gt; 7 by 24. Every word is recorded, every image, from his point of view. It should be designed like one of those lights coal miners wear, and be streamed live to Facebook and YouTube. Everyone will see and hear everything Cuomo does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we don't need to discuss this any further. Problem solved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Virus, Democracy, Climate. If it doesn't have anything to do with these, it's a distraction. Distractions are necessary so we don't go insane. But understand that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I would say you would do well to develop a Manchin-Sinema rule on getting around the filibuster as it relates to race and civil rights.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“You can’t filibuster the budget. That’s why we have reconciliation rules. We need to have civil and voting rights reconciliation. That should have had reconciliation permission a long, long time ago.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“If the headlines were to read that the John R Lewis Voting Rights Act was filibustered to death it would be catastrophic.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the reasons I love writing for the blog is that I've made the best software for me for editing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't make it for anyone else. I know of one person who has adapted it for his own use, that's it. The software still is far from as good as it could be. It needs the one feature my old outliner in Frontier had, scriptability. I need to get outside the limits of the JavaScript environment in the browser and on the server, while relying on the software I've built so far, to define a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/19/suspensionOfDisbeliefAppli.html&quot;&gt;virtuality&lt;/a&gt; that is perfectly scriptable. To exist at a higher level, both as a writer and a developer. I've been to the top of this mountain before, but this time I'm taking a different path to the top. And maybe it isn't even the same mountain. That's what makes these writing/software explorations so interesing, and risky. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/plague-year-two/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing an expert on pandemics, he exclaimed &quot;Oy oy oy,&quot; almost wearily. Now Chris is nice, as I said, but he’s a total &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy&quot;&gt;goy&lt;/a&gt;, so it was LOL funny to hear him say that phrase. Oy!</description>

			<description>I want to know more about who the listeners are for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I bet they're amazing. I'd start by asking listeners to send in a photo of where they listen to the podcast. We'd publish them (after reviewing to be sure they're safe for work). It'd be quite a conversation starter. They have a Disqus comment section on the blog, and they get some comments.</description>

			<description>Key fact: Every time someone gets infected, the virus has another chance to mutate and thereby get around our vaccines. So it's in all our interests to reduce the number of infections, to slow mutations. Does this make sense? Somewhere in my education, I don't remember where, they taught me to think like this. Two or more processes that interact happening at the same time. It's reality. We're in a contest with the virus. It won for many months, and it's still winning, but now we have a strategy for slowing its growth. We will not eliminate it. These are basic facts most people haven't begun to absorb.</description>

			<description>I don't like the Holier Than Thou BS of the Democratic Party. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-never-trumpers-are-becoming-pro-democracy-republicans.html&quot;&gt;Never Trumpers&lt;/a&gt; form a new party, I might join up. I'd like a party that endorses only two things, 1. the Constitution and 2. a return to majority rule. All other issues, up to the individual to decide.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/05/whatIveLearnedAboutWhereWereAtWithTheVirus.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: What I've learned about where we're at with the virus. When will it be over? Depends on a lot of things, including many that are completely out of anyone's control, and unknowable. All we're doing basically is going with hunches, and trying to see what works. The virus our vaccines were tested against is not the same virus that's out there today. Variants and mutations make the virus a moving target. We need better monitoring, hopefully the Biden Administration is working on that. 15 minutes.</description>

			<description>All of a sudden the opportunities to get vaccinated are exploding here in upstate New York. We are over-supplied, it seems. It's always been true, the United States is the country you want to come help when you have a disaster. We were not prepared for this pandemic, but we could invent, test and manufacture a vaccine, and we are able to distribute it. We're good at this stuff. And we're big and rich enough to do it right. If the pandemic had happened with Biden as president, we'd have cleaned up the virus by now, and also gotten started of ridding ourselves of the insurance industry, which does nothing for us, and takes so much.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html&quot;&gt;One year ago today&lt;/a&gt; I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how the world was about to change and how Americans weren't ready for it. And for a few hours I replaced the contents of the home page of my blog with a simple statement in very &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/urgent/2020/03/05.html&quot;&gt;big letters&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;A deadly virus is taking over the world and the United States doesn't have a government.&quot; A year later, and the virus did take over the world, and thankfully the US now has a government, yet it is very damaged by the traitorous behavior of the ousted president. But we're doing better now.</description>

			<description>In the podcast I said the virus was going to hit us hardest, because we feel invulnerable. Lots of other things, it's worth a listen. I'm glad I did this podcast. It was a transition point, the world changed around March 5, 2020. On the other hand as it turns out I overestimated how bad it was going to be.</description>

			<description>All the water my house uses comes from a well 140 feet underground. The water contains some minerals, not much, because the Catskills are renowned for water quality. The pipes also contribute minerals to the water, esp when the pressure drops to zero as it did the other day when the pump failed. And again when the power went out. When the water comes gushing back after an outage, it dislodges little bits of crap from the walls of the pipe that were loosened when the support of the water suddenly disappeared. There are filters that catch the chunks large enough to cause problems in some of the devices hooked up to the water supply. But not all, some have no filters, and the bits get lodged in bad places, but then given enough time, they disintegrate and things slowly return to normal. I learned all this in the last few days. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>An idea for a social net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea -- a net where no one knows your name or bio. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People listen to what others are saying without an idea of who's talking. All you know is that they were chosen to be part of the group because they're interesting, known to think well/carefully, have respect for other points of view.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are criteria to be accepted, like a university has criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe you have to take a test. I know entrance exams are inevitably skewed to favor white men. Hire a team sociologists to try to overcome that.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Limit to say 10K people. Like a good-sized town. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I live in one, so have an idea how communities this size work online. With good moderation, the communities solve problems, people help each other. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your real world identity is secret. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All you know is that everyone in the community likely has something in common with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your screenname persists, so people get to know you but have no idea who you are in the real world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you reveal your identity, you are kicked off the system. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I was part of such a community a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was called CB Radio and was a service on CompuServe, an ancient and long-gone social media site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>An idea re Andrew Cuomo. Do a full investigation. Invite all accusers to come forward. The allegations are published by a 9/11-style commission. Then have an election, let the voters decide. I explained in some detail how I feel about this situation in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/02/theCuomoProblem.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I recorded yesterday. Summary: No I don't think Cuomo deserves our mercy, I think &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; deserve it. He led us very well during the darkest days of the pandemic, and for all we know even darker days are ahead. We are not out of the woods yet, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972952844/texas-and-mississippi-to-lift-covid-19-mask-mandates-and-business-capacity-limit&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/us/texas-governor-mask-mandate/index.html&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; are acting as if we are. The very things that make Cuomo such an asshole may also make him a great leader in times of trouble. In this way it's totally parallel to the Al Franken cancellation. Also I suggest his daughters, whom we've heard a lot about (too much, although his critiques of their boyfriends were funny, I guess, you may have to be from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; to get the humor), have a talk with him. Sit him down and make him listen. Dad we can possibly save your ass if you listen now. I'm guessing they know how unacceptable his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-209&quot;&gt;non-apology apology&lt;/a&gt; is. But ultimately this is not a decision for the press, or for other politicians, it's for the voters of New York to make. I think that in all but the most egregious emergencies, that's the right answer.</description>

			<description>BTW if you asked me when I was a kid if Queens would someday elect a president, have the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grubstreet.com/bestofnewyork/absolute-best-chinese-restaurants-in-flushing-nyc.html&quot;&gt;Chinese food&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and pretty much every other kind of Asian ethnic food, I would have thought you were out of your mind. On the other hand no one expected the Mets to win the World Series in 1969, so there's that. Queens is a weird place. But it's kind of nice that the world comes to Queens these days, and it emanates from Queens too.</description>

			<description>Yesterday with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/02.html#a171711&quot;&gt;power outage&lt;/a&gt;, I listened to a lot of podcasts, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/opinion/the-argument-congress-filibuster-senate.html&quot;&gt;The Argument&lt;/a&gt; from the NYT. They had a two-sided discussion of the filibuster. One side for getting rid of it, and the the other for preserving it. The latter was argued by a establishment Republican &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JessAnderson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/&quot;&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. I kept thinking, they aren't the other side any longer. They represent possibly 10 percent of the Republican Party which represents maybe 40 percent of the electorate. The real &quot;others&quot; are the nutjobs and fascists. They want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc&quot;&gt;burn the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; down. I doubt if they have anything specific to say about the filibuster. I'd love to hear a debate between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein&lt;/a&gt; faction (smart, thoughtful, polite) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy&quot;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; who runs the US Postal Service or Josh Hawley. I also listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mea-culpa-with-michael-cohen/id1530639447&quot;&gt;Michael Cohen podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He has something. A real radio personality. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lawn%20Guyland&quot;&gt;Lawn Guyland&lt;/a&gt; guy for sure. Surpringly it held my interest.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think some of my friends might enjoy a little thing I put together a while back called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/&quot;&gt;thesaurus.land&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a word &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=navigator&quot;&gt;navigator&lt;/a&gt;. Enter a word in the text box, click the button and you get a list of synonyms. You can then double-click on any of them to see its synonyms, on and on as long as you like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I love words, maybe you do too.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ySSzmaoRzo&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; I did in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sex in the workplace</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was founder and CEO of a small Silicon Valley company in the 1980s. A few dozen people at its peak. I had invested everything in the company, and it was touch and go all the way. If I lost, I would have been totally broke, financially and personally, so I didn't have time to play around. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also had a girlfriend, a long distance relationship, and remember being frustrated that her friends told her no man could be faithful that long, but I was. Maybe I was a fool because I got blamed for it anyway. But that's not the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of women in the company, including execs. I wanted the best people I could get for the job, and I was raised by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/02/26/024939.html&quot;&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt; who was accomplished and smart, so I believed in the idea of gender balance and practiced it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also was propositioned a fair number of times by women who worked for me. Totally inappropriate. I brushed them off, but occasionally had to sit down and say this was something you could get fired for, if it didn't stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was so much sex going on in the company. And there was also gossip about who I was sleeping with (CEOs get gossiped about, no surprise). The whole thing was depressing. Our company was often on the brink of going under, and to some it was just a job, and maybe they felt it was hopeless, but I couldn't afford to. And there was no way to stop the gossip without making the issues even bigger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Eventually we had a hit product, and noticed that when the company was growing the gossip became less important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of the story is that sex in the workplace is complicated. It isn't just about men with power using it to take advantage of lower level employees. I think a lot of people must know this, and are overlooking, deliberately or not, when discussing this topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330&quot;&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; I made a change to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute&quot;&gt;script scheduler&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to get rid of drift, so that the nightly email would go out more or less precisely at midnight. The fix worked. Sometimes it's one second after midnight, but usually it's exact. The important thing is that any difference is not cumulative, it gets back on track on its own the next day. Here's a screen shot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/02/footer.png&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/a&gt; on last night's email.</description>

			<description>The weather. Oy! Very cold very windy and the power has been out, on and off, since yesterday afternoon. I charged up all my devices before the power went out and loaded up lots of podcasts, so I'm very entertained. Made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy82ekHbVpM&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;nice fire&lt;/a&gt;, but the house still got down to about 45 degrees. I was worried about pipes freezing if the outage lasted much longer. But the power is back at about 12:20PM Eastern and I'm feeling pretty good now.</description>

			<description>BTW, if you download Netflix shows to a mobile device, why does the app refuse to open if you don't have a net connection? What was the point of downloading them? I swear it used to work. How did I watch Netflix shows on airplanes?</description>

			<description>DocServer was a Mac app, before there was a web, that let you read the verb docs for the UserLand scripting language. Once we transitioned to the web, DocServer became a web app, managed by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;. I had forgotten it was an app before it was a website. And, btw, it was fully scriptable, as were all the apps we were making at the time. Here's a screen shot.</description>
