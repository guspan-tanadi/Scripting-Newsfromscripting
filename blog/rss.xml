After &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead&quot;&gt;yesterday's ode&lt;/a&gt; to the Beatles, I got three recommendatations for books. I'm reading the first, recommended by Max Sindell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Beatles-Story-Whole-World/dp/0062207652&quot;&gt;Dreaming the Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, it's wonderful. Exactly what I was looking for. It's about how the legend of the Beatles grows over the years, long after the band broke up. What the Beatles (as people) ran away from is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1486178715503579138&quot;&gt;objectification&lt;/a&gt; that I find so fascinating, and disturbing in my own life. Can we have art and without destroying the lives of the artists?  It's a very emotional read for me because the Beatles loom so large, and it's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; was such a revelation because it was about the people, not the legend, something that honestly had never occurred to me, that there was a difference. Fran Azouz recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Buy_Me_Love_(book)&quot;&gt;Can't Buy Me Love&lt;/a&gt; and Fin Keegan offered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Two_Three_Four:_The_Beatles_in_Time&quot;&gt;One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time&lt;/a&gt;. I'll read them both, for sure.</description>

			<description>It's nice to hear that as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt; nears the release of version 6, apparently they have fulfilled the promise of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/16.html#a180941&quot;&gt;not breaking users&lt;/a&gt; of previous versions. It's nice when a developer empathizes with their users, even when there isn't an serious competition. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1486059557407313921&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davegandy/status/1486056856510513154&quot;&gt;Dave Gandy&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO, the best upgrade instructions are: &quot;Heh the best upgrade guide is 'do nothing, it already works.'”</description>

			<description>Starting a little tune-up work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. First couple of changes, both for Scripting News only. 1. Fixed broken links to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/01/20/theSafeFutureOfRadioAndMan.html&quot;&gt;radio.weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt; images. We lost control of the domain when Verisign sold &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. 2. Apply my glossary to the text, so references to special links and images now work, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=%22curly%22&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;curly&lt;/i&gt; image. I also want to fix up references to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tagging&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; feature I implemented which was superceded by Daytona. And a few other things while I'm in there.</description>

			<description>The NYT had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/opinion/biden-independent-voters.html&quot;&gt;focus group&lt;/a&gt; with independent voters. Not surprisingly their opinions of American politics perfectly echo what they say on CNN. We can't get out of this awful loop until we add some new ideas to journalism. Big new ideas.</description>

			<title>I'm a Beatles-head</title>

I've been trying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_The_Biography&quot;&gt;Spitz book&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not very well written. Lots of hyperbole, the characters and their stories are pretty thin. I'd like one that stops and talks about the songs, and how they were written (if it's known) and what they're really about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's looking like 2022 is shaping up to be the year of the Beatles for me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; was really a transformative event. I had very little idea of who the Beatles are/were as people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading the 1970 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnlennon.com/music/interviews/rolling-stone-interview-1970/&quot;&gt;John Lennon interview&lt;/a&gt; in Rolling Stone really brought it home. I know it's obvious, he's just a person, but the Beatle John Lennon was a huge figure in our culture, and in my own life. No one actually is that large. The cultural icon is another story. That's why the individual Beatles talked about &lt;i&gt;The Beatles&lt;/i&gt; so often, as this thing separate from themselves. It was. And I suppose if you want to know why they &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/04/11/357087772.html?pageNumber=20&quot;&gt;broke up in 1970&lt;/a&gt;, that's probably the cause -- to become something approaching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;human-size&lt;/a&gt; again. I think it's fair to say they never achieved it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=dave%20jacobs&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;, who was a Dead-head, he traveled with the band, has all of a sudden become a Beatles-head too, as I have (again). He's listened to all their songs recently, and told me he was blown away by the sheer number of great songs. He said some bands have one or two hits, but the Beatles had hundreds of great songs. I don't think there's much doubt the Beatles are historic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_timeline&quot;&gt;Beatles timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been saying this since long before Obama entered the White House. The president and the citizens should be joined by a social network for governing. The first president that does that well will be as revolutionary as Thomas Jefferson. It's why we govern in fits and starts. As scared as it may make the established journos and politicos, it's the big step we must take. Evolution demands it, nothing less than that.</description>

As scared as it may make the established journos and politicos, it's the big step we must take.

			<description>Another lie that journalism spreads is that individual people are responsible for climate change. We are not. Even if you do everything you can to lower your carbon footprint, it's just symbolic. The truth is the way our civilization works is what destroys the habitat. The advertising says it's up to us, but it's actually the companies running the ads that have the ability to reverse the destruction. It's all about programming our minds to come to the incorrect conclusion, the one that keeps us focused on ourselves as individuals. The one place we could change things is with our votes. That could have immediate impact. So it's not without hope, you just have to stop believing journalists about the inevitability of the Repubs regaining power later this year. It is not inevitable.</description>

It's a catchy title, because it's about the future, as you can tell, but from the point of view of the past? What! Hello. My brain explodes. Anyway what made me think of it is how nice it is to have younger friends, personal friends, who tell me about what's going on in their lives, so I can review their future from the point of view of my own past. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course not everything I've learned in my 66 years applies to the life of a 28 year-old of the opposite gender, but it's actually amazing how much does. Especially if that young person has been studying herself and listening and trying to figure out what's going on through the haze of what the various voices inside her are telling her. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I told my 28-year-old friend, who also happens to be a relative, that I'm still learning from relationships I had when I was roughly her age. For example, being a programmer, my various girlfriends who loved me, no doubt, had generally negative feelings about the time I spent &quot;staring at the computer&quot; (how it must have looked to them). We had the same problem at &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Living%20Videotext&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt;, a software company, whose existence depended on the production of those programmers. The sales people didn't understand that interrupting a programmer in the middle of their day to join to a meeting could destroy their work for the day. But it could. Often did. So much that I eventually opened another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@37.3905039,-122.0809571,3a,75y,282.14h,107.96t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1saRFB17_pQ4PhvzoHfadE8A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DaRFB17_pQ4PhvzoHfadE8A%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D97.63002%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;office&lt;/a&gt;, just for programmers, so they could finish a days' work without interruption from people who had jobs that could endure random interruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it's any better today, roughly 40 years since I was 28. Try to imagine being a writer whose partner didn't like to read, or didn't enjoy their partner's writing. Why torture yourself. Why not hook up with someone who loved reading what you wrote? Similarly, if you're a programmer, why not hook up with someone who loves using your software and thinks it's a miracle that their own wants are reflected in your &quot;staring at the computer&quot; efforts?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of one of the greatest lines in any movie ever.

Why? Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me!&quot; says in a soft voice from off-stage, &quot;Everybody wants that dear. It doesn't exist.&quot; One of the most liberating and at the same time saddest &lt;a href=&quot;https://clip.cafe/as-good-it-gets-1997/why-cant-i-have-a-normal-boyfriend/&quot;&gt;movie lines&lt;/a&gt; ever.

			<description>Why can't doctors use email? Okay I get that they don't think it's secure. My doctor has a portal. Why can't they use the damned portal. Everything has to be on the phone. I almost never answer my phone these days. It's not something many of us do. There was a time when we did.</description>

			<title>Fight against hell</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When people say we're &quot;fighting for democracy&quot; even that isn't strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We must fight so we don't become a fascist country with slavery for Blacks, ovens for Jews and women turned into baby-producing handmaidens. And for a human-habitable planet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think that isn't what's happening, well it is.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This country has never actually revoked slavery. A lot of people are still bitter about the outcome of the Civil War. Blacks are not, according to many Americans, entitled to the full rights of Americans.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anti-semitism is also a foundation, not just of America, but most of the world. We heard Trump say that American Jews are really citizens of Israel, which emphatically is not true.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the last one, women as baby-producing handmaidens, that's what overturning Roe v Wade is for.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And of course it's not just Blacks, Jews and women, there's a hellish place for every non-white non-male  non-Christian American. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And who knows why they don't want to keep the planet habitable for humans. Maybe they think God meant for them (and not us of course) to migrate to other planets. Whatever it is, it's another form of hell. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet journalism still mostly sees it as a partisan horse-race and every step we take into the abyss is bad news for one or two people like Biden or Schumer. Their delusion by now is really a form of insanity. Forget about waking them up, we have to move past them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that unites us is the hell the Trumpists have in mind for all of us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tree Charts and outliners</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in 1986, my then-company Living Videotext shipped a product called MORE. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We called it that because there was so much more in it than the earlier outliner, ThinkTank 512, we didn't have any idea which new feature, if any, would be the one that turned people on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't have the luxury of picking among them because our company was on the verge of going out of business. We needed help from Apple to make it to shipping. They gave us a loan of $400K, and we put our source code in escrow in case the company failed, which looked like a real possibility. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well the product was an instant hit. And now, so many years later, I can tell you for sure which features made the difference -- tree charts and bullet charts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a MORE tree chart looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.userland.com/misc/outliners/images/more11c/treeChart.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'd edit an outline, click a button and boom a colorful tree chart would appear. Go back to the outline and make a change, view it again, and boom, the tree chart changed. Up till then color graphics, which were still very new to computers, was something for a priesthood. This was color graphics for &lt;i&gt;thinkers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We sold a huge number of MOREs that year and in 1987 sold the company for a lot of money and I was able to go back to making software and stop being a CEO which was a good thing for me to do! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's 2022 Dave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK so here we are, it's 2022, an unthinkable number of years later (36) and here we are again. We have a nice powerful outliner. Like MORE it can print (these days that means render as a blog), but where are the beautiful graphics?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here they are. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/treechart/blob/main/README.md&quot;&gt;new Tree Chart viewer&lt;/a&gt; that hooks into Drummer very neatly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; user, go have fun. I'm sure you'll love it. And if you use another kind of outliner, either give Drummer a try, or ask the people who make your outliner to have a look at Tree Chart (it's open source) and either adapt their outliner to work with Tree Chart (the better idea) or adapt Tree Chart to work with their outliner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, these days my product is interop. I made my fortune in the 80s, and I've invested well enough so that I don't need a hit product now. What I want to do is re-kindle the interest in computers used as thinking tools around common formats and protocols so it can grow like the open web, not so much like a silo. We've been down both roads and open is better for the users. And also for the vendors imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We need to change the subject</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The press is stuck in a rut. Everything is about Biden and the various horse races. But that isn't what matters. What matters is that we don't become a fascist country with slavery for Blacks, ovens for Jews and women turned into baby-producing handmaidens. Also a human-habitable planet would be nice. Focus on these things. This is what matters, not that random journalists earn a salary for flushing America down the toilet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Melber&quot;&gt;Ari Melber&lt;/a&gt; last night. The only reason I didn't turn it off is because he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Carville&quot;&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; on. Melber is entertaining and sometimes interesting, but usually just repeats the same bullshit night after night all the while claiming to be a journalist. He's an entertainer. But Carville, while also very entertaining, actually has ideas that you don't hear all the time on cable and in the NYT etc. More Carville please. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Carville says. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Dems are actually doing okay. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They would do better if there were a few more Dems in the Senate, and also in the House. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So the campaign, he says, should be about what they can do for us, workers, families. And they have quite a few things they want to do for us, s&lt;i&gt;o sell those things!&lt;/i&gt; Man, sometimes it's so simple when you get a clear thinker who doesn't have anything in particular to sell and doesn't give a shit if you like him (and we do like him, he's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coonass&quot;&gt;coonass&lt;/a&gt; after all). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Four more Senators and hold the House, and you can have it all. So we can do some very specific things &lt;i&gt;for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's so logical. Get actors, great ones, who look like Democratic voters, and run ads that say what Carville says they should say, and let's have the slogan be something like this. You have the power, for real. Just vote, and we all win. Yeah it could be shorter. Use the last three words. We All Win. Come on, that's what it's about. I would give the max to fund such a campaign and so would a lot of people. The ads sell more ads. And the call to action is: Make a difference and vote. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run the same ad with different faces. Surprise us, have one with Stacey Abrams or Val Demings. Run it over and over. We all win. We all win. Over and over. Buttons, bumper stickers, flags, lawn signs. We all win everywhere all the time. Basketball games. Hockey games. Football, baseball. County fairs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because we all want to feel we can do good. Maybe not all of us, but I suspect a lot of Trump voters while they may be racist (face it, we're a racist country, so you have to work really hard to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be racist) what they really want is this: To make a difference. Trump filled a vacuum, the Democrats while they care about us in the aggregate, never get that we are individuals and we want to make a difference. We all want to know there's something we can do to help us all win. If you want to win, Mr or Ms Democrat, you have to bring the people into your marketing. And then, if you want to keep governing and not be completely obstructed, you have to bring us into governing too. The mistake that Obama made was not bringing the people into his administration. McConnell and his fascist Federalists wouldn't have been able to stand up to him if he had us behind him. No Democrat should ever try to do that again (though Biden is doing it too). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all win. Tatoo that on your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Maybe not all of us, but I suspect a lot of Trump voters while they may be racist (face it, we're a racist country, so you have to work really hard to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be racist) what they really want is this: To make a difference. Trump filled a vacuum, the Democrats while they care about us in the aggregate, never get that we are individuals and we want to make a difference. We all want to know there's something we can do to help us all win. If you want to win, Mr or Ms Democrat, you have to bring the people into your marketing. And then, if you want to keep governing and not be completely obstructed, you have to bring us into governing too. The mistake that Obama made was not bringing the people into his administration. McConnell and his fascist Federalists wouldn't have been able to stand up to him if he had us behind him. No Democrat should ever try to do that again (though Biden is doing it too)." created="Thu, 20 Jan 2022 13:48:58 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/01/20/134146.html?title=weNeedToChangeTheSubject#a134858"/>

			<title>What is Electric Drummer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As we're starting to test the Linux and Windows versions of Electric Drummer there have been some basic questions. I thought I should respond publicly so people understand what we're doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; or E/D for short, is an app that runs on the desktop, hosted by its operating system.  Like a word processor or a graphics program. It's most like &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/building-hybrid-applications-with-electron/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; editor, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=drummer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-tab outliner for note-taking, organizing and publishing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It runs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful environment that makes cross-platform apps easier to create and manage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D saves files on your local file system as any desktop app does. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It can also hook up to your web Drummer account for outlines that you want to make public. It's how I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. The outline that I edit is on my local system,. It's also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/blog.opml&quot;&gt;public file&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be accessed by the CMS when I ask it to render my blog from the outline. The public file is stored in my web Drummer account. It's a nice combination.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D is a scripting system, like web Drummer is. It will be able to access the local file system, and also will be able to run a server, none of which are possible from the web app. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is already a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of E/D that has been available since October 10, when Drummer shipped. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same as web Drummer, a few commands work differently because it runs in a different place, but it's the same code, same outliner, same UI, same bugs (!), etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I've decided to make the Mac work like Windows and Ubuntu, swapping the Ctrl and Cmd keys, but for some reason my Bluetooth keyboard is not showing up in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/17/modifierKeyboardDialog.png&quot;&gt;list of keyboards&lt;/a&gt; whose modifier keys you can change. The list is empty. I tried disconnecting the keyboard and reconnecting, no luck. I guess I should try rebooting the machine.

			<description>I can tell today is going to be &lt;i&gt;one of those&lt;/i&gt; days. My power went out overnight, but luckily I have a generator this winter (newly installed in the summer) and it automatically kicked in. But there are no outages listed on the Central Hudson outage map. Oy. I'll make the best of it.</description>

			<title>Political marketing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do I have anyone following me who is a political marketer? Is there such a thing. We need them now.  The way you fight this, and it's getting late, is by demonstrating the opposite.   Famous people of different races visibly doing things to help each other. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MU4F79oyfT&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to do.  We should be wearing buttons, small ones, with MLK's image on it. People of all colors. Americans. Showing support for all of us, esp people whose ancestors were slaves.   We have to urgently heal this huge wound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to do, we need to show each other that we are here, in great numbers.   I don't like huge national marches, what I'd love more than anything is people showing their passion for voting. Not just in November, but every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's meet up at our polling places for coffee and a sandwich and good old political talk. Talk about what we want. Yes there will be trolls there. But let's hope we outnumber them. I think we will always outnumber them, but can we get out there and show it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we need to use online advertising.   Campaigns should NEVER GO OFF THE AIR.  This a vestige of TV-based media, last generation.  And they should raise money and pay for themselves.  And speak with power, not powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've lost the marketing war, with a Baby Huey type character as the other side's spokesperson. We have much better people, but we lack the political organization and understanding of how little time is left.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
