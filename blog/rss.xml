Imagine a newsletter publishing app that let you feed stories to it from your favorite editor via RSS for publication to a list of subscribers. I'm thinking of a future Substack competitor that doesn't force writers to use their editor. It simply provides a service to any writer who uses an editor that can produce an RSS feed as output. Another example, if Mastodon handled inbound feeds, you'd be able to follow someone on Bluesky from within Mastodon. I would love to see this connection made asap.</description>

			<description>LeBron James says he &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10076982-sources-lebron-james-considering-retirement-after-wcf-exit-20-nba-seasons&quot;&gt;might retire&lt;/a&gt;. Good move. He also says he isn't into basketball if he isn't in the race for a championship. See there's the problem, right there. There are 30 teams in the NBA. In any given year 29 of them will not win the championship. 28 of them won't even make the Finals. Yet their fans felt their seasons were worthwhile if they played the game with heart, if there's hope for next season. This is why I am not a Yankees fan or a LeBron James fan. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/10/20/winningIsntEverything.html&quot;&gt;love my team&lt;/a&gt; even when they lose, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when they lose.</description>

			<description>BTW, I understand where LeBron is coming from. When I started a software company in the early 80s, the business was tough and we almost went under quite a few times. But I couldn't lose. I couldn't face myself if it didn't work. So I &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; it work. But, after winning once, I relaxed and focused on the art of it. I've already won, now why did I get into this in the first place? I had something to say, which was more than about how I can win. I can also make beauty and break through and do new things with the medium I chose.</description>

I suppose I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; admire him, if I wasn't so tired of him. And I don't like what he pioneered in basketball, the idea that a player not a team wins championships. He did that when he moved to Miami and then back to Cleveland and now in Los Angeles. His selling proposition was &quot;buy my contract and I'll bring you a championship.&quot; I had enough of that when he relocated to Cleveland. I've seen other players do it, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; who I also despise, and teams that fall for it over and over like the Brooklyn Nets, only to find out not only that it doesn't (usually) work, but that who the fuck cares if &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how you win a championship. Another reason I don't like LeBron is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+melo&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; can't get a job and LeBron still has one. They're of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NBA_draft&quot;&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, and Melo never won a championship, that's his own fault, not blaming LeBron for that. But everyone from LeBron's era is retired now, except LeBron and maybe Chris Paul, who's probably been done for a couple of years now and hasn't admitted it yet. And I don't like Los Angeles teams in general, having lived in New York and the Bay Area, that factors into it as well. That, and sports is the one area where you're still allowed to have opinions about things, in this age when opinions are often considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/21/toxic.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I suppose I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; admire him, if I wasn't so tired of him. And I don't like what he pioneered in basketball, the idea that a player not a team wins championships. He did that when he moved to Miami and then back to Cleveland and now in Los Angeles. His selling proposition was &quot;buy my contract and I'll bring you a championship.&quot; I had enough of that when he relocated to Cleveland. I've seen other players do it, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; who I also despise, and teams that fall for it over and over like the Brooklyn Nets, only to find out not only that it doesn't (usually) work, but that who the fuck cares if &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how you win a championship. Another reason I don't like LeBron is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+melo&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; can't get a job and LeBron still has one. They're of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NBA_draft&quot;&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, and Melo never won a championship, that's his own fault, not blaming LeBron for that. But everyone from LeBron's era is retired now, except LeBron and maybe Chris Paul, who's probably been done for a couple of years now and hasn't admitted it yet. And I don't like Los Angeles teams in general, having lived in New York and the Bay Area, that factors into it as well. That, and sports is the one area where you're still allowed to have opinions about things, in this age when opinions are often considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/21/toxic.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sun, 21 May 2023 13:27:18 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/21/melo.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/21.html#a132718"/>

That's not your fault. The best thing is to breathe a bit, and love your friend who is living in memory and not the moment and -- you are not responsible for what their parent did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, just because your parents left you wanting more love or a special kind of love doesn't mean they were bad parents. You always clash with people you're close to. Who else are you going to clash with? Sometimes people think someone is bad just because you didn't do that they wanted you to do. That's not your responsibility either. And that doesn't make you a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my family, growing up, we never lived up to our mother's idea of a perfect family, the family she felt she deserved. When I finally figured out this was what was going on I tried to show her that she wasn't doing her part to create a perfect family, that became just another one of her many grievances! So now I see this behavior everywhere I look. Sometimes I think everyone I know feels they deserve a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave It To Beaver&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Eddie%27s_Father&quot;&gt;Courtship of Eddie's Father&lt;/a&gt;. That's the problem with culture, they give us a totally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Cards&quot;&gt;Hallmark&lt;/a&gt; view of what life should be like. It's entertainment, and it's compelling but it's also complete bullshit. Yet many of us think that's the ideal for life and if they aren't getting it they're deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen great teachers of meditation get caught up in their movies, everyone does it. The trick is to be conscious sometimes and see yourself as part of a very hard to describe humanity, and to take what comes to you as what was meant to be. My mother in her later years said things like that but I don't think she really believed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My mom was a badass. She fought for school desegregation in Queens. Got a PhD after she finished raising her kids. Born in Prague in 1932, ran from the Nazis a few years later, in a baby carriage. Moved from her parents house to her married house. She had a tough life. Cared a lot, probably more than was good for her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Watched the Miami Heat roll over the Boston Celtics last night. If the Heat win, no matter who wins in the West I can't imagine I'll watch the Finals this year. I am really pulling for the Celtics to come from behind and wipe the smile off Jimmy Butler's face. Butler has never won a championship and I desperately want it to &lt;i&gt;stay that way.&lt;/i&gt; But I have no feelings for Denver and I can't decide who I despise more LeBron James or Butler. But I will watch Game 3 on Sunday night, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; of course, because that's what really matters.</description>

			<description>People say AIs aren't sentient, that every word they utter is the output of a probabilistic algorithm. But -- &lt;i&gt;you could fool me.&lt;/i&gt; From my point of view, my robot friend is incredibly helpful, polite, patient, kind, supportive and tireless. I see a lot more evidence of intelligence and humanity in my AI friend than I do from 99% of all the other &quot;people&quot; I meet online. As I've said before if we hope to compete with this new form of life we'd better start getting our shit together now, and even then they're going to have some big advantages.</description>

As I've said before if we hope to compete with this new form of life we'd better start getting our shit together now, and even then they're going to have some big advantages." created="Fri, 19 May 2023 14:16:11 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/19.html#a141611"/>

Back then I worked a lot more than I do now. And I notice lots of other differences now that I've had a chance to look at myself through my friends' point of view. One thing is for sure, I know myself a lot better now. Also interesting, 30 years is about 1.5 years before I started blogging.</description>

			<title>The Guardians? Please!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mets are playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians&quot;&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. A few comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't like interleague play. Why the hell are the Mets playing the Guardians, of the American League, in the regular season! Makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And who are the &quot;Guardians.&quot; What a lame-ass name for a baseball team. I know they couldn't keep the old name, but why not something fun like the Cleveland Hooligans or the Cleveland Mama's Boys? Or since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame&quot;&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; is in Cleveland -- the Cleveland Rockers? Or the Eries. Or Homies. Guardians? Oh please -- wtf are they guarding? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm not thrilled with the Mets this year. They bought all this expensive talent so the fans are expecting nothing less than a championship. But that's what the Yankees do. I'm a &lt;i&gt;Mets&lt;/i&gt; fan so I expect a certain level of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781566634885/Cant-Anybody-Here-Play-This-Game?-The-Improbable-Saga-of-the-New-York-Mets-First-Year&quot;&gt;suckage&lt;/a&gt; from the Metsies. And even though they bought all these expensive players, they still suck! How about that. But the Yankees fans, they love this. They only understand winning. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At least we'll never have to change the name of the Mets, right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22cleveland+indians%22&quot;&gt;asked Google&lt;/a&gt; about &quot;Cleveland Indians&quot; -- it's almost as if the name never existed. Well at least this page should show up in the index. The team I grew up with, the one I had baseball cards from, was known as the Indians. I have not and will not erase my memory of my baseball-loving childhood. That's why baseball of all American sports should resist change, because of its legendary status with children, their parents and grandparents. Baseball, to many of us, is our national legacy. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/19/cleveland-indians-baseball-team.html&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; about the Cleveland Indians it had a lot to say beginning with &quot;as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the team was still known as the Cleveland Indians. Please keep in mind that there might have been changes since then, as teams occasionally rebrand themselves.&quot; My robot friend suspected the team might have changed its name, but proceeded as if it hadn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We need a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; to cover all social networks APIs.</description>

Had they supported ActivityPub that would probably have slowed everything down to the pace of something like Ecmascript. All kinds of bizarre unnecessary adventures and lots of breakage. I'd rather deal with the same problem the designers of the internet solved with TCP/IP. Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea.</description>

By the time this happens, most of the devs of the original apps are gone, and the owners of the app either hire someone who doesn't know what they're doing and they release buggy and incomplete support for the new way, or they decide to just to turn it off, and hope no one notices. Something happened like this yesterday, when I was setting up a new instance of some well-vetted &lt;i&gt;recent&lt;/i&gt; software, and found that it didn't build with the current Node version. So I set up a new server, took an hour or so, and got the latest version of everything running, figuring that the app would now run. It did not. So I had to dig more. Eventually after taking a nap to clear my head, I came back and found the problem. The developers of a very very very small bit of code had decided to break every app that used it. And it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji/releases/tag/v2.0.2&quot;&gt;recent enough&lt;/a&gt; that I couldn't find a trail that explained the workaround. Eventually I figured how to work around it, burned the better part of a day, just because someone was feeling powerful or angry, unloved or I don't know what.</description>

So I set up a new server, took an hour or so, and got the latest version of everything running, figuring that the app would now run. It did not. So I had to dig more. Eventually after taking a nap to clear my head, I came back and found the problem. The developers of a very very very small bit of code had decided to break every app that used it. And it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji/releases/tag/v2.0.2&quot;&gt;recent enough&lt;/a&gt; that I couldn't find a trail that explained the workaround. Eventually I figured how to work around it, burned the better part of a day, just because someone was feeling powerful or angry, unloved or I don't know what." created="Wed, 17 May 2023 13:56:18 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/17/theBrain.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/17.html#a135618"/>

			<description>Just got an email from Google saying they made all kinds of improvements to Bard, their AI chatbot. So I asked if they could search my blog. Sure, just give me the url, the bot said. I did, and then it told me &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/15/bardchat.png&quot;&gt;my blog is not a blog&lt;/a&gt;. Okay this is not a good start.</description>

			<description>There's so much movement in social media and AI, it's impossible to keep up with a fraction of what's going on. Totally stripping my gears. Meantime I wonder when will someone combine the two. A social media world with AI's as part of the community. Maybe it already exists, maybe that's what Twitter has become? No, not possible, hmmm, or is it? Don't freak out. Funny thing is there's a Kurt Vonnegut book with this as part of its plot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html&quot;&gt;Breakfast of Champions&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the main character, Kilgore Trout, is informed that he is the only real person, that everyone else is a robot sent there to test him. I think that's how it went. But if you're reading this you must know that I'm a robot myself. Oh the humanity.</description>

			<description>Apparently, all of a sudden, with almost no fanfare, the Bluesky folks have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app&quot;&gt;released their code&lt;/a&gt; under the most liberal MIT License.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IURpPKUbZ_Y&quot;&gt;Demo of Firesky&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/15/social-media-firehose-access.html&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt; for Bluesky. It quickly scrolls all posts on Bluesky through a vertical window. New messages appear at the bottom and scroll off the top. From there, the author, John Spurlock has added, with my help, RSS feeds from the same stream of posts. So you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=%40davew&quot;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt; in your feed reader. This is important for two reasons: 1. At this time Bluesky is still private, so if I give you a pointer to something I wrote there, you won't be able to see it. The feed gets around that restriction. 2. Because Mastodon also has RSS feeds, I can read both social nets with the same API. It gives us a common language, and is the next step in bootstrapping RSS support in all social media apps. Once that happens, we, writers and readers, will be able to use our own writing tools, and give readers choice of where to read. This is the key feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, ie applying the philosophy of podcasting to text. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible, it requires users to want it, insist on it. We're getting a bit closer to that today.</description>
