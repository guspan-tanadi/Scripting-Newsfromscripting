			<title>How my apps do storage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a technical post, written in response to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1414472093589114880&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Logseq. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/api.js&quot;&gt;the API&lt;/a&gt; I use to access my storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The names begin with &quot;tw&quot; because I use Twitter for identity, so initially thought of these as twitter ops.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you scroll to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/api.js#L1195&quot;&gt;bottom of the file&lt;/a&gt; you'll see a &lt;i&gt;nodeStorageApp&lt;/i&gt; function which is how my apps are organized to access the storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first implementation was in 2014, it was an NPM package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I came up with a smaller, more streamlined package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;daveAppServer&lt;/a&gt; that I've been using for all my latest projects. Key point -- it supports the same API as nodeStorage. I like to do things that way. It's also a proof of concept that it's possible to put another server behind the API. This will probably be necessary at some point to augment or replace Twitter as the identity system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm very much thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/07/09/142855.html?title=drummerForPoets&quot;&gt;Drummer for Poets&lt;/a&gt; where not-very-technical users can run their own servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted you to know how I do storage. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The US can print as much money as we like, and the world will send us real products and services. So stop complaining about how much money Jeff Bezos has. We have orders of magnitude more. Get our shit together and win more elections, soon, we can do anything.</description>

			<title>The Oatmeal and RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This piece started as a Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1413871847238782990&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Oatmeal&quot;&gt;Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; person &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Oatmeal/status/1412854719475712002&quot;&gt;lamented&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was not a wave anymore. It's more like a big lake not a roiling ocean.   People go boating, have a picnic, swim in RSS-land, but it isn't like a moon mission or even a Sting concert. :-) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1412856765083947019&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; that RSS could be fun again if people would work with each other. Instead of being in it for their own glory, only -- people have to see the benefit of other people and products winning alongside them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is not the way tech thinks, or news. They all build self-contained castles. And very rarely do people work together. And that's why RSS stays where it is. Its growth feeds off collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People don't know this, but RSS got its initial wave, the one you all remember so fondly, from a collaboration between UserLand Software and the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're still coasting off the energy unleashed in that combo. That's how stuff like this happens.   People still have the myth of The Great Visionary who sees the right path and leads us out of the wilderness. But that's not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead, two parties with enough power and influence decide, consciously and deliberately, to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to win big, put aside self-glorification and getting ahead for a brief moment, and focus on how you and someone else can break through, creating something that could never exist otherwise. For everyone, not just yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if someone offers to work with you, think of reasons to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I found it impossible to get excited about last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/9/22569878/nba-finals-suns-bucks-chris-paul-devin-booker&quot;&gt;NBA finals game&lt;/a&gt; between the Suns and Bucks. Two teams I spend no mental energy on. I know the Suns are great. I watch their teamwork, amazing stuff. That's what I love about sports, you see hugely talented people who spend their lives preparing to compete and, esp in basketball, it still matters how the least talented person on the team is doing. You don't see them complaining about each others' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltWN98PTJY&quot;&gt;manners&lt;/a&gt;. They get on with it. They have a goal. Another reason this year's playoffs are interesting, no matter who wins, the players on the winning team will be champions for the first time. So they're playing for something that's real to them. Next year, if they make it back to the finals as the Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Cavaliers, etc have in recent years, you wonder how they get motivated. Another trophy, big eff'in deal. Anyway even with all the drama, I just don't care who wins. Maybe as the series progresses I will, but I doubt it -- it might be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/nba-finals-bucks-suns-one-gambler-made-an-11000-bet-that-this-will-happen&quot;&gt;sweep&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Every time I switch my iPhone to a different computer, I have to start over with music. Why. After 15 years or so, couldn't they offer a way to back it up and then restore it? This must be some kind of copyright thing. I wish I had a phone that was rationally designed with the user in mind. I also have an Android phone, but as far as I can tell they broke the only way to copy music onto the device from a Mac. Not sure if a Windows machine is any better. Same reason I'd love to move my desktop act to Linux, but I can't do it without Frontier. Which is, btw, why I had to buy a new Mac. I mistakenly updated my iPhone and it wouldn't work with the Mac I keep un-updated so I can continue to run Frontier. All I have to say is this: Oy. What a mess.</description>

			<title>Drummer for poets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about how people will host their own Drummers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to run the only server, I might not even want to run the main server. I do want to continue developing the software. This is different from how Facebook and Twitter run, I'm not trying to create another walled garden. It's not the kind of work I like, or am particularly good at. It's much more like how WordPress works. Only I think Drummer can be even easier to set up and manage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to create networks of outliner users. I call this &quot;Communication with a big C.&quot; Not the wires, but the ideas that go over the wires. Nodes in my network are human minds, not computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world I imagine is something like 1980s software model with a much more efficient distribution system. And the product, unlike the one from the 80s, is built around networking, where the networking features of MORE and ThinkTank were barely a twinkle in the eye. There was no software to back it up &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One of the reasons I wanted Symantec to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/symantec_acquires_think_technologies&quot;&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; Think Technologies: they had one of the leading Mac email packages at the time, a product called InBox. There were two others, and I was friends with them too. I wanted desperately to get real networking support into MORE. Never happened, unfortunately, that had to wait for Frontier. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to put the pieces together. One of them is to get the hosting working on systems like AWS, Digital Ocean and Glitch. So a user can just launch a server from a repo, have it mostly configure itself, have a Drummer server running in minutes. That's the goal. We have some experience with this, the various &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22for+poets%22&quot;&gt;For Poets&lt;/a&gt; projects we've done here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/216&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions or suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: For programmers, the key piece of software has a funny name. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;. It's an application server, perfectly set up to host Drummer, because in fact it is what I use to host Drummer. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>People, drugs and feelings</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I once had a girlfriend named Kim. We spent a lot of time together. I really loved her, but she also totally frustrated me. One day I was taking a walk with my friend Bodie, a massage therapist, and I kept complaining about Kim. Oh if only Kim would do this. If only Kim would be like that. I hate it when Kim is this way or some other way. Every time I did that, Bodie would say &quot;Why do you feel that way about yourself.&quot; I started getting mad, but she kept doing it. Finally, as she said she knew I would, I realized I was projecting all over Kim. None of this had anything to do with her, I was using her to examine my feelings about myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like everyone, I like drugs. Alcohol, weed. I like opiates, I was given huge amounts of them when I had my surgery in 2002. I could have gotten addicted, I probably did to some extent, but luckily it was easy for me to stop. I was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15799595/&quot;&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; fiend for over 30 years. And I like sex, and in a way sex is one or more people sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/news/20131125/how-the-love-hormone-works-its-magic&quot;&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;. You feel love because your body bathes you in great drugs! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about drugs, I learned, is there is no such thing as a drug you enjoy that your body doesn't already produce on its own. Feelings work like that too. If someone's anger or fear upsets you, it's only possible because you already had the anger or fear yourself. It's also why people sometimes completely miss how other people feel, they mistake their own feelings for the other person's feelings. If someone does X that evokes my fear, I assume they caused the fear, and therefore are somehow to blame for it. It's usually not the experience the other person has. If you ask them &quot;Are you scared or angry?&quot; in a non-judgemental way (very hard to do I know) you might find they are not. Or if they were, it has passed. Do you remember how, as a child your emotions would flow so easily, one second a baby is smiling and happy, and two seconds later the baby screaming in apparent agony. Inside you're still doing that, even if you pretend not to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think in some sense we all want to go back to the womb, to find the perfect container, where everything you need is provided: warmth, shelter, food, and probably some very good drugs too. But no matter how much you love someone, how much you expect from them, they can't take you there. It's not the way it works. We're all on solo trips, fending for ourselves, and beneath it, not too happy about it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is one important caveat. Fear and anger are useful feelings when you're really in danger. If a bear is attacking you, fear is correct! It doesn't matter if you had the feelings before, you're not projecting, you have to decide right now in real time to fight or run. And your brain is flooding your system with drugs that increase your chance of surviving the attack. But, if you mistakenly feel fear, ie there is no real threat, your body still releases the drugs. It's why we accumulate tension in the neck, because it's part of the fight or flight response. If you're in constant fear, your neck never relaxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We're all on solo trips, fending for ourselves, and beneath it, not too happy about it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:40:55 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/07/08/143505.html?title=peopleDrugsAndFeelings#a144055"/>
				<source:outline text="There is one important caveat. Fear and anger are useful feelings when you're really in danger. If a bear is attacking you, fear is correct! It doesn't matter if you had the feelings before, you're not projecting, you have to decide right now in real time to fight or run. And your brain is flooding your system with drugs that increase your chance of surviving the attack. But, if you mistakenly feel fear, ie there is no real threat, your body still releases the drugs. It's why we accumulate tension in the neck, because it's part of the fight or flight response. If you're in constant fear, your neck never relaxes." created="Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:54:10 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/07/08/143505.html?title=peopleDrugsAndFeelings#a145410"/>

			<description>Web devs -- if you work in JavaScript and sometimes think of adding a feature that uses OPML but think it's too much trouble, I've put together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;toolkit&lt;/a&gt; in the form of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/opml&quot;&gt;NPM package&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/client/opml.js&quot;&gt;browser-based code&lt;/a&gt; that makes supporting OPML as simple as JSON. There's a new explosion of interest in outliners, so now is a great time to start wiring these things together to create truly world wide applications. We're on the cusp of greatness, again. Imho, ymmv, mmlm. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

That's just a symptom. The bigger problem is the US has a genetic defect that makes it impossible for it to be united. Slavery. Everyone has a position on that. Either for or against. Not too many people in the middle. And the division in the country, to me, appears to be right along that line. People may be pro-slavery without putting it that way.</description>

			<description>It's really weird &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190815000000*/https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;how they do&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;. They're sampling it every day, as many as 17 times a day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/05/rss2archiveorgsampling.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Do the Bucks need Giannis?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;NBA fans, what's the best NBA podcast? Not too many ads, esp up front. Not too much bullshit about the people talking. Truly interesting ideas about what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Bucks did so well with Lopez playing a role similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo&quot;&gt;Giannis&lt;/a&gt; in game 5, but in game 6 he's back to (mostly) shooting corner 3's? Why? I have a hunch. Giannis is kind of like Melo was when things worked without him at the Knicks in 2012. Nothing cool could happen on the Knicks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clutchpoints.com/carmelo-anthony-jeremy-lin-story-did-melo-force-linsanity-out-of-new-york/&quot;&gt;said Melo&lt;/a&gt; (in my imagination) without it going through me, said Melo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think Giannis is a liability, in that the Bucks play better without him because his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yH5w7INbDA&quot;&gt;foul shots&lt;/a&gt; break up any energy the Bucks build. It's a free timeout for their opponent. If Lopez can do what Giannis does, without the foul shot liability, who needs Giannis?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>America is not great</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was taught as a youngster that the US was the greatest country ever, both at home and in school. I imagine this is the same education kids in every terrible country ever got. And my parents were biased, they were immigrants who would have died for sure in Europe during WW II if the US hadn't taken them in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over time they came to see the reality that the US is a seriously flawed country. But nothing would have prepared them for what we've seen in the last five years. My mom died in February 2018, so she did live to see Trump elected, but did not see the January 6 insurrection, and all the looney tunes that followed. She also missed out on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html&quot;&gt;1619 Project&lt;/a&gt; which was, for me a real head-turner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I knew slavery was part of our legacy, but I didn't know that it was pretty much our &lt;i&gt;whole&lt;/i&gt; legacy. We fought and won a Civil War to purge ourselves of slavery, but that wasn't enough, Jim Crow undid a lot of the good that was done in post-Civil War America. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965&quot;&gt;Voting Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;, passed in 1965 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060727-1.html&quot;&gt;re-authorized&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, has now been gutted by the Supreme Court. And the Republican-run states are rapidly moving to deprive citizens of color their voting rights. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact is the US is an awful fucked up country. It doesn't live up to the promise of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution for a huge portion of the population, and that means it doesn't mean shit for the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am an American, nothing is going to change that, but if you asked me do I feel this is the greatest country ever, I'd say that's an idea we have to purge from our minds, the US is the opposite, it's a fat, lazy, spoiled, ridiculous excuse for a country. If we want to amount to anything we need to take a 180 degree turn now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;White trash riot on behalf of rich slave owners.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Andrew Shell has put together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/20&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; for installing PagePark on Glitch. It's pretty straightforward. Getting PagePark to run on your own server is something that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; will be able to connect to for storage. It's really important that people who want complete independence can have it. No silos here. We want to do the same for Digital Ocean and AWS. If you're the kind of person who likes to run their own server, please pitch in, and provide feedback. I did it myself, it takes about ten minutes. And we may be able to make it even simpler, depending on how this experiment goes. Thanks! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>When I was planning the third &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;, I realized at one point that I could, if I wanted, have every &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;discussion leader&lt;/a&gt; of every session be a woman. I didn't go for it, felt like a stunt. Discussion leaders are like editors or teachers. They choose people to speak. We tried to discourage people from raising their hands (hard to enforce). The discussion leader is also empowered to move the mike to another person via a monitor (a human being, usually a student), who &quot;owned&quot; the mike. That's why things kept moving. I didn't choose DLs based on their fame, though I admit sometimes I gave into that, I chose people who could think on their feet in a classroom setting. So I often went with teachers, if one was available. There was a rule that vendors couldn't talk about their product. That became an issue at BloggerCon III at Stanford because Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurs will whore their product no matter what you say. BloggerCon was a users conference. We need to get back to that. Not just marketing events, but where users get together to talk about what they're doing and what they want.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment#Season_4&quot;&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt; of In Treatment became unwatchable. I skipped the last two episodes with Colin. I came close to skipping the other patients, and the two episodes about the therapist and her boyfriend and drinking were most unwatchable, but since one of them was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvline.com/2021/06/28/in-treatment-recap-season-4-finale-brooke-eladio-colin-laila/&quot;&gt;finale&lt;/a&gt;, I watched it, and hated it. The season started off so good and the actors, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzo_Aduba&quot;&gt;Uzo Aduba&lt;/a&gt; are fantastic. I don't know who the writers are, but the characters they created are just foils for speeches on social issues. I don't mind, if there's some art to it. Something to think about. But they're at the level of decade-old Twitter rants, I've heard it all so many times before. At least with Twitter I have a mute button. The concept of the show is very good when there's suspension of disbelief. While this season started out great, in the end the story was bleh, and the telling of it cringe-worthy.</description>

			<description>I haven't been to NYC in two years, even though I live just two hours north of the city by car. The last couple of days my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sanforddickert.com/&quot;&gt;Sanford Dickert&lt;/a&gt;, who now lives in London, has been walking around the city with his iPhone on a stick, broadcasting his travels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sanford/videos/975431809884849&quot;&gt;over Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, conversing with people who speak to him in the comments. I tune in when I can when he does it in London, but this week I've been feeling homesick for NYC. It's still there, but also quite empty. I hadn't counted on that. Those streets are just begging for me to ride on them by bike. Hotel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kayak.com/hotels/New-York,NY-c15830/2021-07-07/2021-07-10/1adults?sort=rank_a;map&quot;&gt;rooms&lt;/a&gt; are still pretty cheap, a nice hotel goes for about $150 a night. I probably should go down for a few days before the summer is over. I do miss the city, which is surprising to me. I no longer have family there, maybe that's why I'm staying away?</description>

			<title>A sustainable web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see my former colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain&quot;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; about making the web future-safe. I'd love to work on this with him and others. I don't think the way we're going about it has much of a chance of working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we'll get better results sooner if we go for a sustainable web. That will require new financial structures and organizations that have longevity built into their models, for example, universities like Harvard. Insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say I want to give someone $10K to keep some of the domains I've registered going for say 100 years. And I give them say 10GB of static content. Add another $10K.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Set up systems to keep the archive of the static content up to date. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let it be cloneable so many vendors can provide this service for a fee, and let app devs create automatic flows on behalf of users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems it should be possible from there, if enough people and organizations pay money for longevity, at least it's a start.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
