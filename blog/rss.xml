			<description>I heard that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/hey-email&quot;&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt; doesn't support standard email protocols and is not file format compatible with GMail. Is this true? What is their protocol like? How do you get your data out if you decide to switch? Can you?</description>

			<description>Every once in a while, Siri in my back pocket says &quot;Sorry I couldn't hear what you said.&quot; I didn't say anything. Or my Alexa says it doesn't recognize my voice, would I like to register. It was Andrew Cuomo talking in a YouTube video. Little unforseen consequences. It's like being in an episode of Westworld. I'm sure it's already happened that the two have had conversations, being confused about what the other said.</description>

			<description>In the piece below I mention the two local papers in Madison in the 70s. I remember their names as the Crap Times and the Wisconsin State-Urinal. One of my roommates put that in my head.</description>

			<description>I'd love to get a picture of Neil Katyal's study as he appeared yesterday on Ari Melber. It looks like the room of someone who spends all his time online and in his mind. I recognize it, I've existed in such a space as long as it's been possible. Also the interview with Fauci with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday which by luck I watched live. They've known each other a long time, clearly are friends. Blitzer asked him a personal question, Fauci answered. He said he spends all his time writing emails. He puts so much in, and he must have so much frustration, given how badly we're doing, and how he's prevented from speaking. I keep wondering if we, online media tech makers, couldn't do more to help him communicate, given the limits of TV.</description>

			<title>News has been unbundled</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a grad student, I'd grab a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://madison.com/ct/&quot;&gt;Capitol Times&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://madison.com/wsj/&quot;&gt;Wisconsin State-Journal&lt;/a&gt; and hang out at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/&quot;&gt;Memorial Union&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on the news, do the crossword or read the cartoons. The good old days in the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd still want to hang out at the Union but I'd get out my laptop or iPad and read the news via Twitter and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/river/&quot;&gt;RSS river&lt;/a&gt;. Key difference: Today  no single publication delivers the full news experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Union &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60859-d4480969-Reviews-Memorial_Union_Terrace-Madison_Wisconsin.html&quot;&gt;terrace&lt;/a&gt; is where people meet in Madison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, they could have seen this happening, and done more to bind themselves to Twitter or RSS, or even produced their own hybrid and add their expertise as users of news. And if they had let it evolve it might have been, by now, a fantastic news reading and interacting experience, far better than what we use today. They didn't so this is where it's at now, an unbundled, à la carte reading experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But today the news industry is still set up as a business as if I'm going to get my news the way I did in the 70s. And how are they going to convince me to do this? A paywall. The price for reading the article that's caught my eye is to give them my credit card and the right to charge me $10 per month for perpetuity. No. The answer is no. Always no. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many subscriptions the CEO of the Atlantic and Mother Jones have bought this way? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see a bar graph with online subscription revenue for the top 15 pubs. I imagine it looks something like this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imaginary subscription revenue for top 15 pubs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a person who thinks about business models of news, ask yourself, how many subscriptions can one reader afford? Feel good about? Feel like they aren't being ripped off by? For me the answers to the three questions are: 3, 0 and 0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm paying about $30 per month for this, and am not happy about it. In contrast I pay &lt;i&gt;$200&lt;/i&gt; per month for TV. And I'm ready to spend more. But, get this, I spend a lot more time every day reading on the net. And I know the news orgs don't think very much of us readers, but I'm not reading crap, I'm learning, getting information about a lot of local stuff (despite the belief there is no local news, there is). And I can afford to pay much more than I am, I'm just waiting for some part of the news industry to wake up and realize it's not the 1970s anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I spend a lot more money on that might be closer to news is political campaigns. As Election Day approaches, I'm giving out $100 gifts to candidates to help save the world, the same way I would like to throw money at news orgs who help to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Subscriptions? I don't think so. I don't commit to vote for the governor or mayor beyond the next election. It sounds stupid to even put it that way. I'm sure the politicians would like that. And there are good arguments for it. But we get to choose again and again. And that's how I like it. It keeps them interested in communicating with me, maybe even slightly, to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've read so many stories about how news orgs feel about their role, maybe it's time for the news orgs to try to find out how their readers see their roles? Basic business. Know the people who pay your bills and do things that delight them. Not much of that going on with news. Too much talking to be heard by other news people. I visualize it as two barbers passing the time cutting each others hair. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the news experience I want back in May.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I missed the anniversary again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#When:7:55:32AM&quot;&gt;18 years ago yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I quit smoking. The number of cigarettes I've had since, zero. Not one. Yet I still sometimes dream that I'm a smoker, buying packs of Marlboro Lights on the sly, feeling guilty that I'm lying to my friends when secretly I'm still a smoker. I quit smoking because the arteries on my heart were so clogged that they didn't work anymore. I had to get blood vessels from my legs and chest transplanted to bypass the blockages. These continue to work to this day, keeping me alive, riding my bike, writing software and blog posts that seem to make some people happy and piss other people off but are ignored by almost everyone. Makes sense. Anyway, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#smoking&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; on my blog a few days after I quit. &quot;I figured something out in the hospital. I'm the kind of person who likes to solve problems by smoking. How do I know this? Because every time my mind encounters a problem it says &quot;OK, I'll just have a cigarette then.&quot; I bet a lot of other cigarette smokers deal with problems the same way. Now that I don't smoke, I still have the idea that smoking will help me deal with problems. It's funny, one part of my brain has figured out that this is wrong (in fact smoking causes more problems than it solves) but a deeper part of my brain still believes it. This leads to some funny arguments inside my brain. But so far so good. I got to go through the worst of the withdrawal in a hospital where there was no possibility of smoking, and now the craving seems manageable. No doubt other people have smoking stories to tell. I was one of the lucky ones, I survived to tell my story. So far so good.&quot;</description>

I'm the kind of person who likes to solve problems by smoking. How do I know this? Because every time my mind encounters a problem it says &quot;OK, I'll just have a cigarette then.&quot; I bet a lot of other cigarette smokers deal with problems the same way. Now that I don't smoke, I still have the idea that smoking will help me deal with problems. It's funny, one part of my brain has figured out that this is wrong (in fact smoking causes more problems than it solves) but a deeper part of my brain still believes it. This leads to some funny arguments inside my brain. But so far so good. I got to go through the worst of the withdrawal in a hospital where there was no possibility of smoking, and now the craving seems manageable. No doubt other people have smoking stories to tell. I was one of the lucky ones, I survived to tell my story. So far so good.&quot;" created="Mon, 15 Jun 2020 18:02:45 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/15/marlboroLights.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/15.html#a180245"/>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/15/foreverAndPagepark.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about how I merged &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever-monitor&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt;. A few weeks ago I did a podcast where I explained how the pieces &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/01.html#a204659&quot;&gt;came together&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier in the late 80s and early 90s. I was thinking about that then because a similar thing was happening with PagePark and Forever. I was putting the two together and had an aha moment where the pieces snapped together. PagePark has a very simple idea of what a website is, it's a sub-folder of the &lt;i&gt;domains&lt;/i&gt; folder. The name of the sub-folder is the domain that maps to that content. The aha was realizing that you could also put a Node app, to be managed by Forever, which is a package you can integrate into an app, in one of those folders too. Not only did it work at a technical level, but it also provides Frontier-like integration. It's very nice. I've been managing apps in this little world for a couple of weeks now.</description>

This is what a table for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/tree/master/cli&quot;&gt;command line tool&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for PagePark displays. It's equivalent to the table that Forever displays at the command line.</description>

			<description>I read that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is going to get rid of the concept of master for repositories because it's a reference to slavery. According to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;By default your repository has one branch named &lt;i&gt;master&lt;/i&gt; which is considered to be the definitive branch.&quot; A search of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+master&quot;&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt; finds a lot of uses of the word master. And in the rest of the world, there are master bedrooms and master's degrees. Courts appoint special masters. There are a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=master&quot;&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt; in the thesaurus.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/177&quot;&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; from yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/14/144017.html?title=javascriptPromisesVsCallbacks&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; is that adding promises to JavaScript wasn't much of a gain. Some people find promises more readable. There are some problems that are unwieldy with callbacks that are simpler with promises. There are already packages that have cast aside callbacks and only use promises in their APIs. If I need to use those packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/177#issuecomment-643828855&quot;&gt;I will use&lt;/a&gt; their promises-based API. No choice. My two cents. I wouldn't have supported this addition to the language. I much prefer tech that adds functionality in a clear understandable way. I would prefer if we could put our effort into (for example) making Dropbox work on Linux. Everywhere you look systems we depend on are in disrepair. It's like the way NYC worked when I was in high school. Burned out neighborhoods that people still live in. At some point you have to start thinking about the size and shape of the community you're serving and focus on making the language work better, not making it more complex. I still think there should be a JavaScript option to bury the synchronization functionality in the runtime, and let people write code in the natural way they do in pretty much every other language. Why JavaScript is different is something I've never heard a good answer to.</description>

			<title>Why this is the week Trump crashes and burns</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Three things are going to happen this week. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The rate of hospitalization will explode in red states. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The stock market continues to crash.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trump's rally in Tulsa is cancelled, or worse is a washout. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He threw a ridiculous and unnecessary &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass&quot;&gt;Hail Mary pass&lt;/a&gt; that could only have worked if the virus was done with us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's going to sink in with many more people, even some MAGAs, that we're going to hit this wall again and again until we hunker down and wait for the vaccine. Eventually everyone will understand this. And the market will crash more. A new lifestyle will take over the US as we transition into something less than a First World country.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And by the end of this week there will be a consensus that Trump is no longer our biggest problem. We're already well on the way there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

We're going to hit this wall many times before we're ready for the long haul. Even MAGAs will get the message.</description>

			<description>Health care is a #BLM issue.

			<title>JavaScript: Promises vs callbacks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, what do promises make possible that callbacks don't?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i've been writing large pieces of code in JavaScript for about seven years, all flow is via callbacks because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That's all that existed when I started.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like them, I think in terms of them.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My editor is proficient at managing them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All this proficiency didn't come cheaply. A lot of time went into it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm a big believer in this: one way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is. Why? Because I'm going to end up supporting both.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/177&quot;&gt;Here's some space&lt;/a&gt;, please help me understand why you think promises is a game-changer. The more succinct the better. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think the #BLM protests will become more substantial as the hardships of the virus get deeper. In the US, for example, the rent moratoria are expiring. Unemployment subsidies as well. Hunger and homelessness will explode as unemployment did in March and April.</description>

			<description>I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22the+correspondent%22+site%3Ascripting.com&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;The Correspondent&lt;/a&gt; this morning, the first communication since they disappeared. I contributed $25 so I could find out what contributors got. Did it ever amount to anything? TheC didn't make sense, didn't come close to earning the universal acclaim it got, or the money they raised from the people. They claimed they would open a new kind of news org in America, and when they met their money-raising goal said that was never their intention. The problem with snake oil pitches like The Correspondent, aside from the fact that they're dishonest, is that they suck resources away from ideas that might actually make news work better. This happened repeatedly in tech. A famous successful tech entrepreneur claims to have found a breakthrough, and the press gets all excited. It sucks up all the money and attention that might have gone to products that could really have helped, and then they do it again and again. People should be suspicious of grand claims, no matter who is making them. And if you, an analyst, really think you've found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUN1ClT9i9w&quot;&gt;The One&lt;/a&gt;, you should get opinions from friends before you stake your rep on it.</description>

			<description>The other day I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a135058&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a short definition of blogging, including a word I suspect not a lot of bloggers would use -- fluid. To me the process of writing on your blog, if it isn't fluid, it isn't doing its job. By fluid I mean this. I have an idea. Count the steps before the idea appears on your blog and how complex the steps are. The more steps the more likely you'll lose your way, and find it hard to get back to what you were doing. You respond by skipping it altogether next time, the idea is lost. You can engineer fluidity, the same way you can optimize for other attributes. But most blogging software doesn't imho even try.</description>

			<description>On Twitter, a question. Name something that your mother cooked that was your favorite. At first I was going to reply my mother wasn't a very great cook, but then I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1271192726671962112&quot;&gt;remembered&lt;/a&gt;. She sent us, my brother and I, cookies at summer camp. They were the best things ever.</description>

			<description>I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polywood.com/chaise-with-arms.html&quot;&gt;patio lounge chairs&lt;/a&gt; I want. Reasonably priced. Sturdy. Attractive. Only problem is they take a long time to get here. 8 weeks. By that time summer will almost be over. (Update: My friend Peter Politi found the chairs on the Lowe's website at a good price for delivery in 8 days. Problem solved.)</description>

			<title>Defensive driving in code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing the example from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/07/140541.html?title=aCaseStudyInReadableCode&quot;&gt;previous case study&lt;/a&gt;. The routine, pad, takes three parameters, a string or something that can be coerced to a string, a character to pad with, and the number of places to pad to. So &lt;i&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4)&lt;/i&gt; returns a string whose value is 0008. It's useful for neat tabular displays.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In an app I'm working on, I call pad a lot. Then, while testing it in a new environment, I got an error message from the JavaScript runtime:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the stack, the error was in the first line of pad.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I conclude that val is undefined in one of the many calls. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The question -- should I find the place I called it with undefined and add logic to not call pad in that case, or should I add the test in pad, and return something reasonable when val is undefined?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the point of this case study.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Changing a core routine like pad is tricky. If you change its functionality, you potentially break code that calls it. If it's been around a while, who knows all the places it has been called. However in this case, that's not an issue, because any call that has undefined as the value of the first parameter is going to fail. So it's already broken, therefore you can't break it and therefore it's okay to fix it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the question is if it's &lt;i&gt;desirable&lt;/i&gt; to fix it in pad, or in the place that calls it that causes the app to fail. For me that's a no-brainer. It would clutter up every call if we don't put it in the function. The whole point of factoring like this is to trade off a tiny bit of time for space and reduced complexity. Factoring is a good thing, and you should do it whenever it's responsible. Remember what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; said. Basically factoring is good, but don't do too much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I call this coding technique &lt;i&gt;defensive driving. &lt;/i&gt;It's something you do in case the other driver (the caller) screws up. You want to prevent the accident. Most of the time it won't accomplish anything, but when it does, it saves you from a crash. One less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the new version of pad, with the defensive driving code added:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = (val === undefined) ? &quot;&quot; : val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while (s.length &lt; ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;s = withchar + s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (s);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It makes &lt;i&gt;pad&lt;/i&gt; a little more complicated -- a fact of life. Production code is rarely as simple as demo code because it has to deal with all the crap that gets thrown at it. Defensive driving is how you deal with that, the same as in driving a car or riding a bike in traffic. You never know what the other idiot is going to do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I still want an automatic blog indexer web app. I would pay you $50 a year to do this for my blog. Create a website that's organized like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/10/index.png&quot;&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; in the back of a book. It digests my new stuff every day (or hourly, even better), and adds each item under topics in the index.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I'd like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs. But not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend hours reading a book via its index. A bootstrap. I'd love to help drive such a project. We need this.</description>

It digests my new stuff every day (or hourly, even better), and adds each item under topics in the index.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I'd like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs. But not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend hours reading a book via its index. A bootstrap. I'd love to help drive such a project. We need this." created="Wed, 10 Jun 2020 13:54:56 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/03/alice.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/10.html#a135456"/>

			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a135424&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; something like this. Yesterday at the supermarket, I glanced behind in the checkout line, saw a woman who had pulled her mask down. She seemed very naked, as if she had pulled her pants down and you could see everything. Sexual. Very forbidden. A month ago, it wouldn't have been a thing at all.</description>

			<description>Oy. I’ve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649&quot;&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; DuckDuckGo in my blog archive, thinking it’ll hold up better over time than Google searches, but I overlooked this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/08/apple-acquire-duckduckgo-analyst/&quot;&gt;Apple could buy them&lt;/a&gt;, and I tend not to trust their links over the long haul.</description>
