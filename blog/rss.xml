			<description>I hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/politics/democrats-virginia-mcauliffe-governor/index.html&quot;&gt;Dems might lose&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia because of voter apathy. Right now the big issues are abortion, COVID, climate and fascism. That’s a pretty good set of issues. Run some freaking ads on social media. Never stop campaigning, every day of every year.</description>

			<description>I was pretty sure the Dodgers would crush the Braves, but wow, the Braves are up 2-0. Gotta love it. I'm sorry if you're a Dodgers fan, but I was born in Brooklyn and people such as myself don't forget. I also remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mlb-overturns-utley-supension-breaking-tejada-leg-article-1.2554514&quot;&gt;Chase Utley broke the leg&lt;/a&gt; of the Mets shortstop during the 2015 playoffs. I also remember when I sat in scalped seats during the World Series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_World_Series&quot;&gt;in 1988&lt;/a&gt;, in the Dodgers wives' section and they tried to get us thrown out for rooting for the A's who won, btw. I really feel justified in hating the Dodgers, but honestly even if I wasn't, I would still hate them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I will be rooting for the Bucks. Superteams suck.</description>

			<title>Micro.blog and Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just before Drummer shipped I sent an email to Manton Reece, the developer and runner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, asking if he was interested in being the first blogging system to hook up with Drummer via the OPML bridge. The same interface we use in Drummer to connect to Old School. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2021/10/18/drummer-and-microblog.html&quot;&gt;Well here it is&lt;/a&gt;. He works fast. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just watched the video -- I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; how he did it. Beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Colin Powell lied for war</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing how people are kvelling over Colin Powell.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His speech at the UN was chilling, implying but not directly saying that Iraq had nuclear weapons and was getting ready to use them, and we had no choice but to go to war with him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No one would have believed Cheney, Rumsfeld or Rice. They got the only person in the Bush administration who had credibility. If Powell was willing to say this, it must be true, we had to act. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a lie. A way to transfer wealth from the US Treasury to the war industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people act naive as they do horrific things, seriously -- he knew what he was doing. Powell wasn't a tool, we were the tools. He abused our trust. And in death he doesn't deserve the acclaim he's getting. Too many people died because of his lie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think you have to be very young and very healthy to be medication-averse. There are some people who make it to old age without needing medical care. My mother was one of those people, she didn't get sick until she was in her 80s. Me, on the other hand, I would have died before I was 10 if it wasn't for health care and antibiotics. I had a ruptured appendix, mis-diagnosed by a doctor as a stomach ache. Okay so medicine fucks up, a lot. I have limited vision because two eye doctors gave me bad advice and did surgery, the first fucked my left eye and the second made it worse. My hearing is blown in my left ear, because a doctor used a device to clear out earwax that damaged my eardrum. So now loud noise, including loud music, makes my head vibrate in an unpleasant way. Too bad, I used to love loud music. &lt;i&gt;But I am alive. &lt;/i&gt;My life having been saved twice by medicine now. So when medicine says &quot;take this vaccine it'll make you safer against a horrible disease&quot; -- I take it. Gladly. Why? Because I get how medicine works to an extent and am appreciative for the life I would not have had were it not for medicine.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; is really going. I'm trying to scope out in my mind now where I want it to go.

			<description>In the back of my mind is the question of could we get a Linux version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; going. That would send this project into the stratosphere, imho. Even after a year's work, Drummer is still a shadow of Frontier, which I use as my development platform for all of this. That's how I'm so productive. Invest as much time in tools as you do in product, and some years, invest all your time in tools. BTW, when I say a Linux version -- I mean an exact clone. The benchmark is whether it runs my software, not that it's a cool project. With these things it's the base of apps that matters. I think the language designers at big companies have lost the tune. The apps are what matters. That's why I program in JavaScript -- it's where all the code is. And that's why projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logrocket.com/what-is-deno/&quot;&gt;Deno&lt;/a&gt; (A different arrangement of N O D and E) are such a bad idea. And deprecating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; verb? Only the most commonly called function the whole fricking language. Deprecated!! Someone has lost their sense of what matters. It's as if one day they decided the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tappan_Zee_Bridge_(2017%E2%80%93present)&quot;&gt;Tappan Zee Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is too cool to drive cars over, so we'll require people to convert their cars so that the wheels are inside and the seats are outside. Always going backward is a good way to never get anywhere. BTW the Tappan Zee Bridge Is a beautiful bridge. It carries exactly the same traffic the old one did.</description>

			<description>Car drivers suck. I usually ride my bike on the right edge of the road, making it easy for cars to pass. But if I have to make a left, I move left, and if a car approaches behind me, they have to momentarily slow. They always honk. I never carry a gun, but sometimes I wish I did (not really).</description>

			<description>I have a thing. If they're &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/16/weather.png&quot;&gt;forecasting rain&lt;/a&gt;, showers or even a thunderstorm, and it's not raining when I want to go out for a ride, I go out anyway. Worst that can happen is I get soaked, I reason. And I usually make it home in time. And often as soon as I walk in the door it starts to pour. That's exactly what happened today. I'm feeling very oxygenated and strong, writing this post in my bike clothes, and outside it's pouring cats and dogs. Amazing.</description>

			<description>We know what we have to do -- we should be campaigning like everything is at stake (it is) instead we're hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhilArballo/status/1449427514397442048&quot;&gt;weak statements&lt;/a&gt; like this. It's not his fault, btw -- the national Democrats are looking in the wrong direction. I don't know how they can do it, but they are. Where is the Lincoln Project, why aren't they turning out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlJqf_9YYj0&quot;&gt;ads like this&lt;/a&gt;, every day, about abortion rights? This is the big problem that the Democrats keep making. To them campaigns are about elections, but they're really about everything, 365 days a year. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops.

			<description>The Giants lost. I'm so sorry. I knew however that it would end in an awful way when the batter, with two out in the bottom of the 9th with a runner on first, the &lt;i&gt;Dodgers&lt;/i&gt; leading by one in what was the last game of the season for one of these teams, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Flores&quot;&gt;Wilmer Flores&lt;/a&gt;. Mets fans remember him and love him like a son, because the Mets broke his heart and he didn't hide his feelings. So they didn't trade him in 2015 when the Mets went on to win the National League pennant, Flores was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/sports/baseball/wilmer-flores-swaps-tears-for-cheers-with-walk-off-home-run.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbcrohkQFUbAibORd89sgbBj_HUzbY1gnu5MymRTDtYiuoRBJKN4ALWeqN7fJ4v0j2BX5pPN6VqT_x_w_VEelNsVwntvZKAm9ECLStwqYW2UyYswpSLXaw99XWiSFiFH9pF5e_1uQOaYn_3COeZiSd_cBBhqZVgfQyvimgCk6rHDuJ0itBhjqgjVoR5FW0LbCCAt_bjAkluKZ7ROEGnnwo3W-xeXzrUjITcv-pGKFMOfAqAGHBv4m886MdfOccUOMv8Kx0nfcn5iNYBGzAibdfpV9BqGd-ix_g9uqXNqBeP1MK02_49ca1Tt7_CuWqwX009Qbv6r_islZBt2LGYmSKLPw&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;team mascot&lt;/a&gt;, but they eventually did let him go, and he was on the forever to be remembered as the ill-fated Giants of 2021.

			<description>A friend asked if it was true that Spotify now owns podcasting. They read something in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/03/wiredWebIsDeadFreeGift.png&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; that said they did. They're idiots. Or trying to get clicks. Or maybe they're idiots &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; they're trying to get clicks. Anyway -- no, Spotify does not own podcasting. As long as people say &quot;subscribe where ever you get your podcasts&quot; at the end of their podcast you have nothing to worry about. I'm not even going to link to the Wired article.</description>

			<title>The mobile app I want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An iOS and Android app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It can manage multiple notes. They are simple things, simple styling, multiple paragraphs per item. Of course Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It stays in sync with something that's accessible over the web, kind of like an RSS feed just for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I tell Drummer, Roam, whatever -- where to hook into it. And it appears in my writing world as a flat outline. I can edit in both places. So I can put a note from my desktop into this mobile world, and write something while I'm out and about that hooks into my larger writing world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Super important: Not part of Apple or Dropbox or whatever's world. Then I would have to go through them to get my own writing, and eventually they will break me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's amazing how broken this shit is now. I'm almost broken in Apple's world. And Dropbox blew up what we were doing a few years back. We're about to get evicted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. But Linux, RSS, OPML and Markdown keep chugging along. And Twitter too btw. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity&quot;&gt;They've&lt;/a&gt; actually been very good, even though the hype says otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was talking with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+dave+jacobs&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; last night and we got around to what should be done with &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;. The only thing to do when a tech company gets too big, is to force them to unbundle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling&quot;&gt;Bundling&lt;/a&gt; is how their size becomes a problem for us. So, for example, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; owning the dominant search engine and the dominant browser means they're inevitably going to turn the web into a perfect way to continue to own search. That's all that's going to matter to them. But the web has more to do. Google doesn't care. Facebook has also been successful at strangling the open web, forcing all writing on the net to flow through them. Or at least keeping it from flowing outside of them. If Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/18/1269.html&quot;&gt;fat ass&lt;/a&gt; wasn't squatting over the web, there would be a lot more movement. That might not solve the problem of Nazis ruining the world, but at least it gives the rest of us a chance to organize and solve the other vexing problems we have to deal with. RIght now all we're tasked with doing is making Zuck even richer, and even Zuck must be bored with that by now. The task for FB is to make it easy for the rest of us to run our own FB's and stay in touch with the people who use his FB. That's what happens when you get as big as they are. And it's far from an unsolvable problem. In fact they already have all the software written.</description>

			<description>One of the saddest things I've ever heard is Jeremy Lin saying &quot;I think the NBA has given up on me.&quot; I would say to him, they had reasons to give up on you when you were 18 and every year since then.

			<title>All those windows on the 4 train</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An asshole NYT columnist once asked if I was too old to understand the latest technology. I was so offended, I didn't think to just answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The answer is unknowable. I think I understand a lot about tech, because I've spent my entire professional life trying to. I also have created some of the technology that young people feel so proud of understanding better than older people. I think I understand podcasting, for example, as well as any young-un.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once when I was a kid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/The+Bronx+High+School+of+Science,+75+W+205th+St,+Bronx,+NY+10468/@40.8102893,-73.9598169,12z/data=!4m17!4m16!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f39fba19f047:0x456fa7ab9f9bae18!2m2!1d-73.8914555!2d40.8779882!2m1!5e1!3e3!5i1&quot;&gt;commuting&lt;/a&gt; to high school in the Bronx from Queens, I was struck by all the apartment houses whose windows faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;the 4 train&lt;/a&gt;. Mile after mile. Countless windows facing the train. And behind them more buildings and more windows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Behind every window was a family, with all their challenges, accomplishments, pride, love, beliefs, bad habits, histories, everything. It gave me an idea, how could you possibly think you understand all that's going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, 50 years later, I think the thing is to be open to learning from other people's experiences, and don't presume you understand anything better than anyone else, because when you do that, you close yourself off to learning from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would say to that NYT asshole that it's the disease of your profession to think you don't have to listen anymore. It's also the disease of programmers, doctors, professors, everyone who gets somewhere in life, to think they've arrived at the top and they have a full understanding of everything they need to understand. That asshole could learn a lot from an asshole like me. All those years, he didn't. And that's not just his problem, because so many people listen to him, it's our problem too. Because he's not as informed imho as he could be. .&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why we use Twitter identity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email last night that said the person felt I had been hypocritical in using Twitter for identity for Drummer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I don't think I was hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use Twitter for identity because they have a nice API that scales, and they have kept it open for this kind of use for many years. In all that time, they didn't change their mind because of new management, didn't deprecate anything, it just keeps running reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are you sharing some information with Twitter? Yes, a little, but not as much as you might think. They certainly never see your outlines. They don't know how many times you log in, that information doesn't pass through to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We don't keep any information on that ourselves. I don't care. I'm not in any business at all, and certainly not in the business of knowing how much you do whatever you do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They don't know your location, btw -- if they know a location, it's the location of the server, which is at Digital Ocean. I'm not even sure where they keep their servers. That information it seems to me is of no value.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want them to know &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; about you -- just create a fake account for this purpose.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I want to build features around Twitter. It's a fact of life. It's there. It ain't going anywhere. If I chose not to use it for identity it wouldn't hurt them one bit. I'd have to write an identity server myself and I already have plenty of things to do trying to keep Drummer users happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Net-net -- I don't see a problem here. 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/12/quote.png&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of what I wrote for The Future of Text, kind of says it all, everything I've discovered and built on in my career. I guess it's the answer to the question: &quot;What's possible with computers that most people don't know about.&quot; They posted this in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheFutureofText/status/1447969903571505161/photo/3&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; at the same time I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1447971032053293066&quot;&gt;posting one&lt;/a&gt; about how we fixed the big problem with JavaScript in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I love JavaScript because it's the closest thing we have to a universal language. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; to thank for that (no sarcasm!). But there's no reason JS has to be hobbled by &lt;a href=&quot;http://callbackhell.com/&quot;&gt;callback hell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsmanifest.com/promises-in-javascript/&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/async-await&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever new hack they think up next. It's not hard to factor all that out. Every other language does it. There is absolutely no reason JavaScript has to leave all that mess visible to the programmer who wants it hidden. We proved that in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt;. Now our implementation may not be fully baked, and at least one JS guru thinks it may be too slow, all that can be fixed. I want to write straight-line code and let the runtime handle the synchronization. That's worth trading off some speed for, but I don't see why it should require that. And it's the way comptuers are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to work, imho. If I didn't say anything most devs probably wouldn't even notice it's there, they still might not, that's how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation&quot;&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; it feels. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

But there's no reason JS has to be hobbled by &lt;a href=&quot;http://callbackhell.com/&quot;&gt;callback hell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsmanifest.com/promises-in-javascript/&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/async-await&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever new hack they think up next. It's not hard to factor all that out. Every other language does it. There is absolutely no reason JavaScript has to leave all that mess visible to the programmer who wants it hidden. We proved that in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt;. Now our implementation may not be fully baked, and at least one JS guru thinks it may be too slow, all that can be fixed. I want to write straight-line code and let the runtime handle the synchronization. That's worth trading off some speed for, but I don't see why it should require that. And it's the way comptuers are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to work, imho. If I didn't say anything most devs probably wouldn't even notice it's there, they still might not, that's how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation&quot;&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; it feels. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 12 Oct 2021 17:06:01 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/11/klaesAshford.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/12.html#a170601"/>

			<description>A frequently asked question -- where is &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and how much does it cost? Hopefully the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; answers the first question. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; answers the second. &quot;You can use Drummer at no cost.&quot; Further: &quot;Much of the software is open source.&quot; Why is it so inexpensive and will it always be that way? I don't have big plans to take over the universe. I just want to make sure that outlining, web scripting and easy, fluid blogging are not lost arts. I have been very lucky in my career, so at this point, money, at least the kind of money it takes to operate Drummer, is not an issue. So let's have fun and see where it takes us! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

That link opens in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt;, even if you're not logged in, and updates when there are new features or fixes. I would be honored if you leave that outline open in Drummer while you do your work, that way I can instantly inform you of new stuff. The file's icon will turn to green when there's news. It's the best channel I've had as a developer to users of my product. We've been using it in the Drummer test community. It really works. Instantly updating outlines are called &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml&quot;&gt;instant outlines&lt;/a&gt;, btw.</description>

			<description>And now, we can start talking about Drummer in concrete terms. Finally. The first thing you should try in Drummer is to write a few blog posts. Follow the first part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;Blogging howto&lt;/a&gt;, do the Hello World post. Then write some more, about whatever you like. Learn how to write publicly in Drummer first, in other words. It's the best demo we have right now, today, in Oct 2021, of the power of outlines for public writing.</description>

			<description>Another note and then I'll wait till tomorrow. In this case the Docs are a big part of the product. Back in February, I decided this time, rather than leave the docs as an afterthought, or hire someone else to write them, I would do it myself. For a couple of reasons. This could be the last big product ship I do in my career. Docs were always treated as an afterthought. I want to try, just once, making it not an afterthought. To let the docs have enough time to become something I'm proud of, and something I can invest more time in, like the software, after we ship. Instead of staying away from them, I wanted to reach in, and do it up. As a result I've done enough writing for a book this year, you'll see it not only in the docs linked into the sidebar of the docs pages, but also in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.readUrl&quot;&gt;DocServer pages&lt;/a&gt; for each of the built-in scripting verbs. Lots and lots more to say.</description>

			<description>I'm shopping for a refrigerator. I've spent some time with various web interfaces, on Home Depot, Consumer Reports, Loew's, Best Buy, Amazon. They're all pretty bad, and could make a simple improvement that would completely eclipse the others. Here's the idea. I have a fixed space to put a fridge, and it's unusually narrow. I wish the designer of the house had left more space but it is what it is. Now, they make fridges in this shape, but they don't always have them in stock, esp now, when the supply chain is so disrupted. Here's the feature, it's a very Doc Searls-like thing, btw. I want to say hey Home Depot, this is the space I have. Let me know when you have a fridge I can buy that can be delivered within a couple of weeks. Instead they send me links to their website for refrigerators (at least they remembered that I'm shopping for one, so has Amazon) but they make me start over from scratch every time. That really sucks. Esp if they, at the moment, have a fridge that fits my very easy requirements. It would also be good for energy savings, because my current fridge is not running efficiently at all.</description>

			<title>The other side of Agile</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend and sometime collaborator Andrew Shell is part of a program to write 30 posts in 30 days. Yesterday he wrote a piece about his career, and I got an idea for him, that I initially posted in a comment on Facebook, but wanted to include here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Andrew -- i had an idea for you. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First imho it would be a shame to ignore all the experience you have with software, both as a developer and a user.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You could do something great by focusing on the interface between users and developers. A lot has been done about how programmers can be more effective when they listen to users (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt;), but as far as I know nothing about the other direction -- how users can learn to communicate more effectively with devs to get what they want and to influence the future.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a branch off what I keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1447084856962424832&quot;&gt;coming back to&lt;/a&gt; -- we don't teach how to write great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bug+reports&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;. It can be an incredible literary form, different from any other and they can be very human, because imho it's all about empathy. The user wants the dev to be empathetic with them, and the devs want empathy too, not just because it's more economical, but because it's because programmers are people too! A fact sometimes overlooked, perhaps. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, best of luck with your exploration Andrew.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, as far as I know Andrew is posting these ideas on FB and Twitter, as screen shots, but I don't see where they're posted on the web. If they are, I'll add a link here. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maybe other devs can make software without users, but not me. I need the feedback. I imagine it's like being a musician playing on a stage with no audience. Two users, in particular, have made the greatest contribution, Anton Zuiker and Ken Smith. Neither are devs. Anton works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://antonzuiker.com/&quot;&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; as a research communication specialist. Ken is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html&quot;&gt;English professor&lt;/a&gt; at Indiana University. Both are bloggers, both are intelligent, persevere, and put up with my demands (ahem). I need good bug reports, and they are learning, and the bugs are being fixed, and some have been quite vexing, as I've rewritten major parts of Drummer. I know it's been frustrating at times for them. I hope this is just the start of a wonderful new community. I know a bunch of other people are using Drummer, but Ken and Anton have been most actively helping the developer and that's very much appreciated.</description>
