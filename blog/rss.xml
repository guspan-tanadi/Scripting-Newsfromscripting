			<description>As Trump's long fade-away proceeds, a sad thought, going back to 2018 and 2019 when it seemed we might get past Trump without an international catastrophe like 9/11, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the financial meltdown of 2008, the Iran Hostage Crisis, because of course he couldn't handle it. It seemed every presidency had one or two of these, but it was looking like we might not pay the big price for having a child-man with a bad temper in the White House. Well, it's almost hindsight now and worth observing that we did not get away with it. The pandemic is still building, could still explode, and Trump is still playing Pretend President. We're not out of the woods yet.</description>

			<description>Why are we paying taxes to the US Treasury when the government won't protect us from a deadly virus? Why are we funding a military when we can't get vaccine into the arms of Americans? This is a war where, if we chose to fight it, we could win in 3 weeks. What's the purpose of such an expensive military beyond protecting Americans?</description>

			<description>I like when news gives us lifesaving clues. For example, there’s a new more communicable form of the virus. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/30/health/colorado-uk-coronavirus-variant/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, of course. This was inevitable, I learned from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a160302&quot;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Question: Does this invalidate current practice? Can I still go food shopping on my own? Gas up my car? Of course no one knows yet. But the question hasn’t even been raised as far as I know.</description>

			<description>On MSNBC last night I heard that white privilege means you know if you’re descended from royalty. I knew my grandparents, all lived into my young adulthood. I have pictures from my father, of relatives going back one or two more generations, but don’t know anything about them. That’s it. There is no doubt there is privilege in being white. I see it in my own attitudes, inside me. But knowing your ancestors, well that's a very particular kind of privilege that very few people have, imho.</description>

			<description>I've never been to Seoul, but thanks to modern tech, a dramatic moment of my life happened in the Seoul airport, earlier this year. NakedJen had gone on vacation to Bali, just as the virus was becoming a world catastrophe. I talked with her over Facetime in Bali and said Jen it's time to come home. She said I know I know. We talked at every step of the trip, from Bali to Seoul to Seattle to Salt Lake. At every stop, there was serious doubt as to whether there would be a flight home. Like Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. In Seoul, she made a wise decision. She'd defer and let Delta Airlines decide if she stayed there to wait out the pandemic or returned home. If there was a flight she'd get on it, if not she'd stay. Last night I had a dream that I was stuck in Seoul, trying to get home. I'd wait in a line, only to find I was no longer in the airport. Seoul was, in my dream, an ideal place full of happy playing children and huge pristine swimming pools. An enormous arcade of pinball machines. Why are there so many? Promenades with people in formal attire, out for a walk on a spring afternoon, with umbrellas, or reading old-style newspapers. All surrounding the airport. In the airport were people I knew in Silicon Valley in the 80s and 90s, familiar and friendly, as if we had been friends ever since. I don't usually write about dreams on my blog, but this one was so vivid, such a throwback to a tense moment from earlier this year, so what the f. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Just finished the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;audiobook biography&lt;/a&gt; of President-elect Biden by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Osnos&quot;&gt;Evan Osnos&lt;/a&gt;. He has a simple and clear delivery style that reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=John+Dickerson&amp;i=audible&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss&quot;&gt;John Dickerson&lt;/a&gt; who did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/podcasts/whistlestop&quot;&gt;Whistlestop podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which I listened to regularly before Trump and the romance of past presidents was gone for me. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Osnos bio&lt;/a&gt; is short, and good reading as the Biden presidency is about to begin.</description>

			<description>If you grew up with parents who acted crazy, having Trump as president seems somewhat familiar, even comforting. It could be worse, you think. It's a dysfunctional feeling, one you can spend years in therapy to uncover, because you bury it so well, as a child. You come to see things from the parent's point of view. You're a bad kid for thinking that your parents are wrong. Even when they were most definitely wrong.</description>

			<description>A fallout is that if Biden wants to gain our confidence, he has to first deal with the fact that a substantial number of people, even those who voted for him, are unfamiliar with the idea of a family that is based on love and a feeling that justice is normal or even possible. We may &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; we feel this way, but that's intellectual, at a subconscious level, it just doesn't seem normal, like something you can trust. It'll be as if we're saying to the president, &quot;Look that's very nice, but no one believes you're actually trying to help us. That's just hype. We weren't born yesterday.&quot; It seems as if Biden may actually be someone who isn't totally corrupt. If so, how's he going to get anyone to believe that. A frontal assault is not likely to work. This may be why I'm reluctant to write about Biden, or even listen to him. It was okay when he was just one candidate, or just one senator, or even the vice president. &lt;i&gt;But it's hard to see him as president.  &lt;/i&gt;It's hard to trust that.</description>

			<description>I've been hearing Serious Things about my writing here, and that's a bit intimidating. Now when I read over what I've published, I see all the mis-capitalized proper nouns, missing words, chopped out accidentally in rushed edits. Please note the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/evenWorse.png&quot;&gt;caveat&lt;/a&gt; at the top of every page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;: It's even worse than it appears. That means what it appears to mean. However it is lovely to hear from people who read this stuff. I esp like to hear what time you read it. In Europe they read it with their breakfast it seems and in California, before retiring for the night. I tend to read it in the middle of the night, around 2AM or so. Yes, weird as it seems, I do read my own blog. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>What's the difference between a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/world/asia/china-Zhang-Zhan-covid-convicted.html&quot;&gt;citizen journalist&lt;/a&gt; and a journalist? It's not a useful term. A distinction without a difference. Are journalists who work for AP or the Washington Post not citizens? I like to walk. That doesn't make me a citizen walker. Putting an adjective in front of it is a priesthood thing. Condescending. Do they think somehow it's acceptable for the Chinese government to jail a citizen journalist, but it would be a problem if they jailed a real journalist?</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/metadatademo/&quot;&gt;Somewhat editable tweets&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1343192656470568961&quot;&gt;Alec Moffat&lt;/a&gt;. As you may know, you can put metadata in a web page that Twitter will display when you link to it in Twitter. For example, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/metadatademo/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/htmlScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;obvious spelling error&lt;/a&gt; in the metadata. And here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1343581454186459138&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; that links to the page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/28/tweetScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;). If I correct the spelling error in the metadata, and eventually Twitter will notice, and the tweet will include the changed version. Voila. I've corrected a spelling error in a tweet. It's a really roundabout way to do it, but it works. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>I won't add new Spectrum services</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was determined a few nights ago to find a way to watch the Knicks, but I didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.net/&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; now has a streaming option, with no set top box. I remember before I cut the cable, they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt;, which is the broadcast network for the Knicks. So I thought there was a decent chance they had it on their streaming app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course they make you sign up to find out what the channels are. I was stupidly impulsive. I clicked the button. A minute later I was looking through their channel guide. MSG is not included. So now I figured I'd just go click another button to kill the 7-day free trial. Nowhere to be found. Typical. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I ended up on hold for an hour, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1343601622975475712&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, where they were polite but couldn't help. There was no other way to cancel the trial without calling. The operator was a jerk, raised her voice, tried to upsell, asked me to explain myself, I said I just don't want it, which is a legal reason for cancelling a free trial imho. All of it, the wait, the bad manners must be scientifically proven to drive people to keeping their subscription and even buying more, when they called to cancel. But I wouldn't discuss it. I called to cancel and that's it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This approach is no longer competitive. Hulu, Disney, HBO, YouTube -- they all make it one click to unsub. Maybe with a confirmation, but that's all. They get that if it's not easy to unsub no one is going to sign up because we understand how this bullshit works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will remember hopefully never to sign up for anything with Spectrum again. Let me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ranzey.com/generators/bart/index.html&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it a few times to let it sink in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I won't add new Spectrum services.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When you write an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; on paper, if you feel the need to reorganize, you have to write the whole thing over. This makes the initial structure something you resist deciding on, so you never get started. Doing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outline on a computer&lt;/a&gt; is different. Since you have commands to reorganize the outline, you can use any structure that supports your list-making. Because you can always regroup things, or ungroup them., Whatever works for you, over time.</description>

			<description>I saw Soul. I say meh. What a mess. I paid close attention because Pixar produces good movies. But this one was not good. I know lots of other people say they love it, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/movies/soul-review-pixar.html&quot;&gt;AO Scott&lt;/a&gt; at the NYT. It got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/soul&quot;&gt;85 on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, very high must-see.  One thing I did like is how they portrayed NYC. That was a technical achievement. Maybe they should do movies like that. Star a real-life place. Have normal people just doing stuff there. More mundane. Boy meets girl, perhaps. Pixar movies these days seem to have to bite off so much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story&quot;&gt;Toy Story&lt;/a&gt; was nice. I liked the story of the old man, a kid, a dog and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)&quot;&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;, and the one about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E&quot;&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; who has to deal with post-apocalyptic Earth. Those are simpler themes. Trying to make a story about the before-life and after-life? Hmm. That requires a bit less Hallmark and more math, imho.</description>

			<description>One thing worth mentioning is we may have entered a new era of movie-watching. A major Pixar movie, a Christmas movie, opened without theaters being an important consideration. If you had predicted that just a year ago, people would have thought you're crazy. Things are changing quickly now.</description>

			<description>I turned on &lt;a href=&quot;https://watch.nba.com/streaming-subscriptions?cid=nba:leaguepass:institutional:nbacom:domsites:nbatv:rd&quot;&gt;NBA TV&lt;/a&gt; last night and watched a bit of the Knicks v 76ers. A message appeared after a while saying that the game was blacked out where I live. Presumably because they want me to pay for something that provides a way to watch the game on local TV. Except since i cut the cord with Spectrum earlier this year, and went with YouTube TV for local stations, I can't get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msg.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt; which broadcasts the Knicks locally. I can swith to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fubo.tv/lp/preview/?page_slug=msg&amp;title=Is%20this%20service%20worth%20$65%20a%20month%20just%20to%20watch%20the%20Knicks%20lose?&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt;, which has MSG, but it's the same price as YouTube TV, and I have no idea what it is. So where I'm at now is paying $65 a month for YTTV and only watching MSNBC and CNN there. Seems pretty steep. Also if I get NBA League Pass, which I'm considering, I'm pretty sure they'd black out access for me for Knicks games too, even though I'd be paying $200 for the season. I remember when watching local sports was free, Not that long ago. What might be the smartest move, pay Spectrum, become a wire-splicer. What a mess.</description>

			<description>Two online acquaintances who share many of my values who I consider friends say something horribly negative about the US, a feature of Republican depravity, which I vote against every chance I get. I feel we’re on the same side, but I don’t like them making such sweeping statements about my country, which due to poor Constitutional design, has these awful features such as inadequate health care, or unregulated gun violence. One of these fellows is British and the other is an American expat living in Germany. I could respond by blaming the British fellow for Rupert Murdoch, who is enforcing Republican lunacy in the US and elsewhere. I suppose technically he’s Australian, but who cares. Or remind my German friend that Germany is where the Nazis came from, the same ones who menace my country now. He might say he’s really American so it’s not his fault. i won’t do it. But i liked saying it out loud just for a moment. 🤪🇺🇸❤️</description>

			<description>I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/sports/basketball/amare-stoudemire-brooklyn-nets.html&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; from Lew Perin to a NYT article about how the Nets have Mike D'Antoni and Amar'e Stoudemeyer on their coaching staff this year, supporting Steve Nash. I do have respect for Mike D, and of course Amar'e. But I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a175501&quot;&gt;feeling&lt;/a&gt; about the NBA this year that isn't too good. It isn't just the Nets, it's also the Lakers, who went from nowhere to champions. The Clippers. Harden. Etc. And Kyrie Irving who was too good to play for the Celtics, I guess. Basketball is a team sport, that's what's beautiful about it to me, but we aren't rooting for teams anymore, the franchises are the players. That's fine, I guess -- good for them, but the only player I've felt loyalty to in the NBA recently is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/jeremy-lin-signing-with-warriors-g-league-team/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt;, and he's playing in the G league for Golden State this year. And at this point there isn't much left there, anyway -- other than the bitterness at how the Knicks screwed it up. Maybe something will happen, no one saw Linsanity coming, so there's always hope. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Also I feel loyalty to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt;. I thought he was a bad choice for the Knicks, all through his career in NY, but how can you not feel affection for a man who keeps coming back, presumably because he loves playing. I hope that's it. I wish he had the humility back then that he has now. He might not have objected to Lin, who anyone would have to admit was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/13/jeremyLinWasACoralReef.html&quot;&gt;good for a team&lt;/a&gt; that was going nowhere, both before and after.</description>

All the snow from last week's storm has melted and all that water is flowing downhill. And then it's going to get cold and snow tonight. Trees are down. Power and internet went out overnight. It's a wet, soggy, grey Christmas. Of course it is. This is 2020.</description>

			<description>I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1342115217694728192&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; of how we could reconstitute tech so it's not all driven by bankers and techies with the principles and motivations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller&quot;&gt;oil barons&lt;/a&gt;. I remember during the 90s, being at odds, publicly, with Microsoft. Bill Gates was still CEO. The company had risen to dominance in tech with Windows. Apple was on the edge of going under, or getting acquired and devoured for parts. The web was a source of great potential and optimism, but Microsoft was acting as predator. The web had no defenses. He had billions, and his software was the OS on all the world's computers, except for a few on the web (Mac and Unix machines were more common there early-on). He was going to encircle the web and cut off its air supply. You can read all about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/index.html#y1996&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. All the while Gates says he's going to retire soon and spend the rest of his life giving away his money. Something seemed terribly out of balance. Why not start caring for the world now, why wait until the damage is done? So much more leverage now. Why not think bigger than creating a company, how about building a technical foundation that encapsulates all the good stuff we've figured out in the 80s (there was a lot of that) and not charge rent for it. Or at least don't interfere with the rest of us trying to do that. Nope, he persisted, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.&quot;&gt;case and a consent decree&lt;/a&gt;, and a new generation of tech monsters grew up in Microsoft's aftermath, and we're still living in a poisoned ghetto, only it's a lot bigger now. My plea is that once you're worth a billion, there's no value to making more money. Think bigger. There's so much potential, because so many of these avenues haven't been explored, yet.</description>

I remember during the 90s, being at odds, publicly, with Microsoft. Bill Gates was still CEO. The company had risen to dominance in tech with Windows. Apple was on the edge of going under, or getting acquired and devoured for parts. The web was a source of great potential and optimism, but Microsoft was acting as predator. The web had no defenses. He had billions, and his software was the OS on all the world's computers, except for a few on the web (Mac and Unix machines were more common there early-on). He was going to encircle the web and cut off its air supply. You can read all about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/index.html#y1996&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog.

			<description>I don't want to pick a fight with the EFF or W3C but there isn't a non-profit I can give money to that cares about a free network without giving money to support the ambitions of the largest tech companies. If anything I want to donate to &lt;i&gt;oppose&lt;/i&gt; them.</description>

			<description>It would be great to have a simple page somewhere that listed the changes on the major streaming services in reverse chronologic order. Even better if there was a preference where you could say which services you care about.</description>

He wonders why the US government is doing nothing to restrict air traffic from the UK. Made me think what Cuomo will do, as a Democrat, when the president is a Democrat on the 20th of next month. Also, I wonder if Biden offered him a position in the government. He's been an incredible crisis leader for New York State.</description>

			<description>If we’re disbanding Silicon Valley that’s a good thing imho. Where ever it reassembles, if it does, hopefully tech will be motivated by more than money. In California, money has dominated everything. I found that intolerable.</description>
