I work fast. My outlines are snapshots of what I'm doing in projects on a day by day basis.  Others are about communicating with others (reviewers, testers).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up the ladder are blog posts. Those are indexed by my outline indexer, daytona. And of course google et al, which care less and less about my public writing, so fuck em.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally is the book I've never written which will be a concordance of all the blog writing, w the most intelligent and witty parts up front. If you come up with software for that, I'm a customer. And I don't say that sarcastically, I bet google could do it, if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I forgot to mention twitter which is for public communication of early drafts of stuff that will go on my blog after i've written it here 5 or 10 times. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I've given up on posting serious shit on FB. Friends I care about post snarky jokes on serious stuff, and that's not fun. FB is for fun only not thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The problem with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization&quot;&gt;Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; is that while the Constitution doesn’t specifically name abortion as a right, in order to implement a ban on abortion a state will have to violate all kinds of other rights that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; specifically mentioned in the US Constitution and probably the state constitution as well.</description>

We're at those one of those moments when things change radically and those are the best times to check in with some ideas of what needs changing, because &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can change things too when the world is falling apart if you keep your head from exploding. I tell you why and I even tell you what to change! 1. Shut down the Supreme Court. 2. Do away with the fillibuster, the Electoral College and the Senate. 3. Then reinstate the court with more justices and term limits of say 10 years. At that point we will actually have representative government and fewer stale old hacks on the court nursing their grievances and taking it out on us.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1542798905661956097&quot;&gt;Will we&lt;/a&gt; come to despise Christianity in the US? I ask this question because up to this last week I felt that Christianity was other people’s problem, not mine. But they’ve captured the Supreme Court, and they’re using it to force their religion on the rest of us. So it’s no longer something that I can be neutral about. It seems that eventually, maybe very soon, we will come to hate Christianity.</description>

			<title>Joe Biden's failure</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's what &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1521551422931845123&quot;&gt;Joe Biden said&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet on May 3, the day after the Dobbs decision leaked in advance of its release this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We will be ready when any ruling is issued.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They had 58 days to stop the attack. To have a powow with the court, and ask if they really planned to issue such a decision and when they said yes, shut it down before they had the chance to make it official. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't react to an attack on Pearl Harbor. If you know it's coming, you stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look what happened instead. They got to announce that ruling and a half-dozen others, all that are head shots to American democracy. Now Biden, as president, is occupying an office with no power.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1543051727569657861&quot;&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt;, Clinton and now Biden have stood by and watched while the Repubs went deeper and deeper, cutting every artery of our system, and they still act as if this all is business as usual. Could they be that stupid or cowardly or are they just actors. My guess is that we're the ones who have been duped, and after all they are just actors and know exactly what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
