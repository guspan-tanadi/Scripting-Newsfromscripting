			<description>JavaScript, which I love in the way a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Hearst&quot;&gt;hostage&lt;/a&gt; loves his or her hostage-taker,  fails the test of &quot;Does the code look like what it does.&quot; It requires you to stand on your head with every finger in some random orifice to get simple stuff done if it involves any waiting. On the other hand if no waiting is involved, the code is perfectly understandable. If they invented JavaScript in the 70s, in the 80s we'd invent a language the fixes this colossal design error.

			<description>Can we have a rebellion in journalism? Secede from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1293220403364732932&quot;&gt;Trump's reality&lt;/a&gt;, chart a new course for the rest of us. His course doesn't end well as we now know. Waiting for journalism to discover it has this power, they're inching toward it, but too slowly.</description>

			<title>Who will do journalism?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the people my age when we were in school never imagined computers would be used by normal people to communicate. They resisted the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what are most of us missing today? I think it has to do with who will be doing our daily journalism. Imho, we all will. Why? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A void is being left as professional journalists focus on fewer stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Weâ€™re learning how to do it with blogging and social media.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We need and want journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s like jury duty, itâ€™s uplifting, gives our life purpose and meaning. Itâ€™s its own reward.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's a wicked idea.  Let Trump put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/10/politics/donald-trump-mt-rushmore-kristi-noem/index.html&quot;&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt; on Mt Rushmore. Hopefully to be announced before the election, hopefully with great fanfare. That would get all the Democrats to turn out, and quite a few Republicans, now they can clearly see where Trump is going.</description>

			<description>I need a backlit keyboard because I write at night and the room where I work is pretty dark. I like it that way. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075H32ZFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Logitech keyboard&lt;/a&gt; which I like, but the keys are getting sticky, and it's blowing my concentration. I spend so much time at the keyboard. The keyboard should be transparent, I should never have to think about it while writing. As I look &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s?k=backlit+keyboard&amp;crid=1CCAK8VV2F5JV&amp;sprefix=backlit+%2Caps%2C164&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_8&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; there aren't many keyboards that are illuminated, at least from companies I've heard of, and the prices are suspiciously low. I would buy one from Apple if they had one. The model that I have now has been discontinued, it seems.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1300841583456577?comment_id=1300853373455398&amp;reply_comment_id=1301136613427074&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My two cents on Kamala Harris and baggage.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;She has the worst kind of baggage. She's already tried to humiliate Biden, unfairly, in public. It didn't work. My experience in life is if you let something like that go, they do it again and again. The relationship is over. She took a calculated risk and it didn't work. That's the way business and politics work. You don't often get do-overs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;She can run for president again, maybe she'll win, but it would be a sign of weakness and ignorance, even naivetÃ© for Biden to choose her. There are so many other possibilities. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He may just have to weather the nonsense from Harris supporters, and there are many and they are vocal, and pushy (not her, her supporters, some of whom I consider friends), and then we can tell the people who are trying to raise hell that they're playing with our lives and their own lives, and they should just let it rest. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That said, she's also from California, which won't get you a lot of votes in Iowa or Wisconsin.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A day after buying the Pixel 4a, I drop my iPhone XS/Max, which is usually OK because it's in a case, but this time the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/09/crackedIphone.png&quot;&gt;display cracked&lt;/a&gt;. I can't be without a phone, and the 4a won't get here until the end of the month, so I bought a new iPhone SE. I'll be comparing the two low-end products from Google and Apple. Weird timing, eh.</description>

			<description>A friend writes: &quot;A Pixel 4a? Wow! I thought you were a big iPhone fan!&quot; To which I respond: &quot;I'm not particularly wed to either iPhone or Android. I have pretty much always have had both. In the last couple of years I have not had an Android because they didn't make a phone that interested me, considering the price, but the 4a is a new product, it seems sweet and it's a nice price.&quot; Note I bought it on pre-order like everyone else. I never have liked the iPhone as a product, I think Apple blew it. I couldn't make my beautiful scripting system work on it. They wouldn't allow it. I'm just a user. I think it's kind of a bleh product, honestly. As is Android, btw.</description>

			<description>As I work my way through &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/03.html#a155126&quot;&gt;Schitt's Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the characters are so fascinating and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira_Rose&quot;&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; may be the most, since we already knew the actor as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/in-defense-of-beetlejuices-delia-deetz&quot;&gt;Delia Deetz&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice&quot;&gt;Beetlejuice&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard for me to see the connection between the two. In one episode in Season 2 Moira is frantically looking for nude pictures of herself taken when she was younger. For most of the show you think she wants to find them so she can take them down, but no. She wants to be sure they're there. She wants to still be, in some sense, the actress we knew as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=delia+deetz&amp;t=hx&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&quot;&gt;Delia Deetz&lt;/a&gt; (Moira plays a former actress, btw). Her advice to Stevie, a super cute young supporting character, is to make sure to take lots of pictures of herself now when she's young. No matter how you think you're not very beautiful, when you're older you will see all the beauty you can't see now. I'm about the same age as Catherine O'Hara, the actress, and I want to say I totally concur. I can't believe how beautiful I was when I was younger, but of course I didn't see it then.</description>

			<description>Briefly discussed WordPress on Twitter last night with Don Park, long-time friend, ex-Automattician. I said I don't think they understand blogging there. Don says &quot;members of WordPress community and employees of the company behind it use blogs all the time.&quot; I don't doubt it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1291868787218710528&quot;&gt;yet I could never do&lt;/a&gt; what I do with Wordpress. Far too clumsy. Not fluid. Not designed for writers. Really weak product.</description>

			<description>I heard yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; that people stopped reading my blog because of RSS. Interesting story. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/12/thingsAreCrystallizing.html&quot;&gt;subscribed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22google+reader%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Stopped reading on the web. Then they shut down Google Reader. The people who were reading my blog and others before RSS, lost track of the feeds they were reading in Google Reader. There were other choices, but that doesn't change what happened. We are rebuilding slowly, because blogging is still a useful form of communication. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; is the best way to get it, probably always was, even in the heyday of RSS. I have to admit reading &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; blog in RSS was never a great deal. I write one day at a time. I'd prefer if you read what was on the home page at midnight. That's how I write it. Since RSS is something I'm well-known for developing, I didn't want to say this too loudly. But RSS should have had a chance to grow, and it didn't. So it got stuck. Not really a surprise.</description>

			<description>If I were running an American news org, and I saw the CDC being silenced by the government, I'd boot up the equivalent of the CDC as part of my news org. I'd hire former CDC officials and tell them to say what they'd say if they were still at the CDC.

			<title>Schools are like nursing homes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Schools are like nursing homes only worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A virus's success at infecting targets depends on a lot of factors, one of which is what it does to most of the people it infects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it quickly incapacitates or kills most of them, they can't easily pass on the infection, so the virus grows slowly. Ebola is like that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it kills none of them, and if they don't get symptoms, they just go on as normal, everyone gets infected and the virus dies quickly, running out of targets to infect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The worst case is if the virus, when it infects people, has few symptoms at first, and a relatively long incubation, like Covid-19. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The more people the infected people come in contact with, and the more transmissible the virus, the faster it grows. Schools, like nursing homes are excellent distribution centers. Indoors, crowded, proper distancing is impossible. Even worse if they're not wearing masks, as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/07/us/georgia-teen-photo-crowded-school-hallway-trnd/&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In nursing homes most of the targets are old or sick or they wouldn't be in a nursing home. The workers come and go so they distribute the virus out of the home. Just like a school. In a school &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; goes in and out. And a lot of them don't get sick, so they are excellent distributors, unlike the sick and old people in nursing homes who don't move around much. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's basically math at that point. The more infected people there are in the population, moving around, doing stuff, the more people will become infected. Not just their parents and grandparents as they say on CNN. Everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've been so careful to keep kids from congregating, but that's over now. We might as well open the bars 24 hours a day, because compared to what the schools will do, people should be allowed one final bender before this wall of virus hits us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People act as if it's only the people in schools and their immediate families that will be hurt by this. Wrong. Everyone will be hurt. Even going to the supermarket with the kind of density we'll be seeing will be chancy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Money for news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1291061013228421120&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday, one more time practically begging news orgs to support what I call an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/12/1004.html&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/23/115824.html?title=anEzpassForNews&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;. Not much response, but a handful of people did give the usual response, the one The Atlantic and other pubs want to hear -- that they bought a subscription to show support for journalism. I don't think this helps journalism, it just gives them false hope that there is a future for viewing journalism as a cause rather than as a product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If journalism is to thrive, the paywalls have to go away. It's the wrong user experience. It forces a question at a time when it's virtually impossible that the user is going to buy your pitch. Much better to get the money incrementally, then when someone is spending too much per month, upsell them a subscription as a way of saving money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The TV world is about to discover this. All of a sudden there are a dozen different Netflix-alikes. There isn't room for that many, yet more are coming. They're going to have to find a way of doing an EZ-Pass.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to repeat all I've written here before. It's really very simple. If I use a freeway here in the eastern US, I don't have to stop to pay a toll. I just drive through what used to be a toll plaza, and an electronic device reads the chip behind my rear-view mirror, and deducts the money from my account, which it replenishes from credit card as-needed. Not that there was ever a whole lot of pain associated with this, but it's nice that the transaction is smoother now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;News needs that much more than freeways do. The world has changed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;it isn't the 80s&lt;/a&gt;, the last time it made sense to buy news via subscription, and even then you could buy a single issue without entering into a long-term relationship with the pub. It's all been unbundled, and like it or not news orgs are competing on a somewhat level playing field. The Atlantic is doing well, I observed, at making me want to read their articles. But not enough to get me to subscribe. As I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled#a134117&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; before, I don't even like subscribing to the pubs I subscribe to now, and I consider them essential, but I consider the deal they offer a ripoff, that some of that money should go to almost-equally deserving pubs. The Atlantic is good enough to serve as an example for why the paywall doesn't work for readers. And they were visionary enough and entrepreneurial enough to join up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/02/17/150159.html?title=whatIsScroll&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. So in some part they buy into the paywall-less version of news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1291061013228421120&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday, one more time practically begging news orgs to support what I call an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/12/1004.html&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/23/115824.html?title=anEzpassForNews&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;. Not much response, but a handful of people did give the usual response, the one The Atlantic and other pubs want to hear -- that they bought a subscription to show support for journalism. I don't think this helps journalism, it just gives them false hope that there is a future for viewing journalism as a cause rather than as a product." created="Thu, 06 Aug 2020 13:36:23 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2012/10/01/tenTons.gif" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews#a133623"/>
				<source:outline text="If journalism is to thrive, the paywalls have to go away. It's the wrong user experience. It forces a question at a time when it's virtually impossible that the user is going to buy your pitch. Much better to get the money incrementally, then when someone is spending too much per month, upsell them a subscription as a way of saving money." created="Thu, 06 Aug 2020 13:41:02 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews#a134102"/>

				<source:outline text="I don't want to repeat all I've written here before. It's really very simple. If I use a freeway here in the eastern US, I don't have to stop to pay a toll. I just drive through what used to be a toll plaza, and an electronic device reads the chip behind my rear-view mirror, and deducts the money from my account, which it replenishes from credit card as-needed.

			<description>Schools should not be open anywhere in the US. Any person with any math, science or medicine background knows this. Step back and think. Politics gets you to the wrong answer if it says to you that schools should open. Save lives. Be a good human.</description>

I remember as a kid being really pissed off that so much of my youth was wasted sitting in rooms with my hands foldeed, with my mind anywhere but in school, learning nothing and being bored out of my mind. I thought of school as very lazy, unimaginative, typical of adults. It wasn't really until grad school that school started working for me.</description>
