			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=damage+Facebook+is+doing+to+our+political+system&quot;&gt;We hear a lot&lt;/a&gt; about the damage Facebook is doing to our political system, but why are we so complacent and accepting of the damage Fox does? We could bring political and economic power to bear. They may have a right to speak, but we should be able to get news, pay for news, without paying for Fox. I don't accept that we can't do anything about it which seems to be the consensus.</description>

			<description>All of a sudden Twitter doesn't work in Safari on my iPad. Neither does GMail. Everything else works fine. I thought it had to do with the East Coast outage a lot of services had the other day, but this problem persists. I much prefer to use them in the browser, there are all kinds of unnecessary barriers in their iPad apps (they try to keep you in the apps, I prefer to work in the web). Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/27/twitterInSafariOnIpad.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of what I see on Twitter in Safari. And this is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/27/gmailSafariIpad.png&quot;&gt;GMail looks like&lt;/a&gt; in Safari on the iPad.</description>

			<description>Two Daily podcasts in the last two days, totally worth the time.

			<description>If you live in the US and subscribe to cable TV it's almost certain that you are finanically supporting Fox News which is primarily responsible for the rise of Trump and downfall of democracy in the US. If I were you (and I am) I would want to do something about this, like demand that your cable company stop giving your money to Fox. How can I get your attention, and get you to tell other people. This is really important, simple, and something we can do to make things better.</description>

			<description>So if impeachment were taken off the table for Trump, every time an incumbent president was not re-elected, they would automatically attempt to overthrow and assassinate Congress. Why not? It might work, and there’s no penalty for trying.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90597411/mozilla-firefox-no-ssb-pwa-support&quot;&gt;A browser feature&lt;/a&gt; I did not know about. In Chrome, you can make, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; a web app in its own window. In the ... menu in the upper right corner of the menubar, choose More Tools and then Create Shortcut. Click the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/27/createShortcut.png&quot;&gt;checkbox&lt;/a&gt; that says &quot;Open as window.&quot; Click OK and there it is in its own window and no toolbar, and a reminder that it's &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;NOT SECURE&lt;/font&gt; (thanks Google!). More important it opens a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/27/chromeApps.png&quot;&gt;Finder window&lt;/a&gt; that's a sub-folder of your Applications folder, with your new app in it. Presumably you can move that where ever you like, and my blog is like an app. You could use it for LO2 or Radio3, or any other single-page web app. Presumably these &quot;apps&quot; are still sandboxed and can't access your local files, so there's still a use for Electron apps.</description>

			<description>Today's song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DFhuE_XeT8&quot;&gt;Georgia on my Mind&lt;/a&gt;. In the mess of January 6, we didn't get enough time to savor the wonder of Georgia. Two Repubs gone, two Dems take their place. This can be replicated all over the country, where ever there are Repubs in charge of states with large African-American populations. The power of the ballot. It's something, as long as democracy rules. And I suspect it wasn't a coincidence that the white racists got violent the day after Georgia.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;It took 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/gratefuldead/posts/10157877331176659&quot;&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that their music played a vital role in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; of podcasting. I needed MP3 files to test the publishing and podcasting system I had built. I remembered that the Dead, uniquely, let their fans do whatever they wanted with their music. In the days just after Napster, this meant a lot to me. So the very &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;first podcast feed&lt;/a&gt; ever was casting old Grateful Dead tunes like Truckin and The US Blues.</description>

			<description>Instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/twitter-newsletter-publishing-revue-8a74f20d-61c9-4095-9b3c-202c3b3fe77c.html&quot;&gt;buying an email newsletter&lt;/a&gt; company I wish Twitter would allow long form enclosures that are text, not just images and video. Twitter is a better delivery system potentially than email. Email is what it is, but because Twitter is controlled by one company, it can still move. They have a good API, it performs well, and it covers a lot of the functionality.</description>

			<description>Today I am in agreement with NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Yang about the Knicks and Jeremy Lin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bflats2020/status/1354055404393811969&quot;&gt;He says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the Knicks dumped Jeremy Lin that was the last straw for me. This is the franchise that gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/5-worst-contracts-handed-out-in-nba-history/2&quot;&gt;Jerome James&lt;/a&gt; $30 million. You let the most beloved Knicks figure in years who lit the Garden and City up walk over money?  Come on.&quot; Amen. Under his note are a mix of comments including the usual that Lin wasn't that good, but who knows. If the Knicks had loved him maybe he would have continued to be an inspiration to the team and to New Yorkers. Instead, the Knicks stuck with Melo, who clearly was jealous of the attention &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html&quot;&gt;Lin&lt;/a&gt; was getting. Lin might have done great if they had kept coach &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni&quot;&gt;Mike D'Antoni&lt;/a&gt;, but they let him go too. Who knows. But nothing was known at the moment the Knicks said goodbye to Linsanity. And for all the Asian-Americans who live in the city, a cause of celebration disappeared. I think I may have loved the whole thing mostly because of the way it made them light up in civic pride. And I couldn't help but feel that the NBA was being a bit racist in their treatment of Lin. My suggestion to the mayoral candidate, Mr Yang, is that he campaign on giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;James Dolan&lt;/a&gt; the boot. Find a new owner for the Knicks. I also agree with commenters who said you can't decide to leave a team. Once a Knick fan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/02/punchingGlassInALockerRoom.html&quot;&gt;sadly&lt;/a&gt;, always a Knicks fan.</description>

			<description>Followup on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/21.html#a140859&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; about why &lt;i&gt;neo&lt;/i&gt;-Nazi instead of plain old Nazi and there is an answer. The original Nazis came with a lot of stuff the new ones don't. They had uniforms, a symbol, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nazi_Germany&quot;&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt;, a leader and his manifesto. The new Nazis don't have any of that. In Germany the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_memorabilia&quot;&gt;paraphernalia&lt;/a&gt; of the old Nazis are illegal. In the US that would be too offensive. There is still a memory of WW II, we remember who the enemy was then. If they walked around with swastika armbands people would know for sure they're the enemy. Maybe at some point they will decloak, but that hasn't happened yet. I thought of putting a swastika in the right margin, but felt that would be too shocking. That's the point. So there is a difference. I got emails from several readers. Thanks!</description>

			<description>I also have a definitive answer on what the difference is between rain and showers, a question that has come up here before. When they call for rain in the forecast, they mean water is going to be coming out of the sky uniformly, both in terms of geography and time. If you go out when it's raining, you will get wet. However if they call for showers that means it will rain on and off, and it might be raining in one town and not in the other. It's more intermittent. You can risk it, you might not get wet if you don't bring an umbrella.</description>

			<description>While we're at it, my first real car (not counting a Renault junker I bought hoping it would magically work, it just barely made it home) was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/tag/datsun-b210/&quot;&gt;Datsun B210&lt;/a&gt;. I think I paid $3300 new. Those were the days. It was a very reliable little car. I called it the Lawn Mower because that's about how powerful the engine was (slight exaggeration). Back in those days, the mid-70s, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.cfm&quot;&gt;Interstate Highway System&lt;/a&gt; wasn't finished, and I drove it all around the country, and a lot of it was on two-lane highways with heavy truck traffic. My poor little lawn mower (with me inside!) would get blown around a lot. But it was very reliable. Only broke down once, and that was due to operator error. I ended up trading it in for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/25/voyager.png&quot;&gt;hippie van&lt;/a&gt;, a high mileage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsqWuR9JI54&quot;&gt;1974 Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, which I also drove all over the country. The van ended up dead in a ditch in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemeketa_Park,_California&quot;&gt;Chemaketa Park, California&lt;/a&gt;, a little community I lived in off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/CA-17,+California/Comanche+Trail,+Lexington+Hills,+CA+95033/@37.1575867,-121.9911122,15z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e37e7e8678013:0x54ed81a461ad50b9!2m2!1d-121.9879274!2d37.1479208!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e37c36d2bf239:0x11177495e7605172!2m2!1d-121.9794407!2d37.1614182!3e0!5i1&quot;&gt;Highway 17&lt;/a&gt; between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz.

			<title>What's the alternative to piracy?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think ultimately the only way TV can work in the future is completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_la_carte&quot;&gt;a la carte&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have subscribed to FUBO and YouTube TV, each for just one channel, both costing about $65 a month. But the money isn't going to the one channel each, it's being spread over hundreds of channels, and some of my money is going to Fox News and I totally object to that. I might cancel both just to avoid paying any money at all to Fox. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile when something comes out on HBO, Apple TV or Disney that I'm interested in, there's no way for me to pay to watch it without buying into everything they sell. (I'm only subscribed to Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what alternative is there to piracy? They've created such a convoluted system, that costs so much money for so little, they've completely destroyed their own business. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the only thing that can make money in the new system are live sports shows. Or ceremonies like the inaugural, that you want to watch as they're happening. And this is all rent. The technology was paid for a long time ago. The system is screwed up beyond recognition. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the really nice things about Facebook is that every morning after breakfast they show me my posts from the past. So right now I'm re-living the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March&quot;&gt;Women's March&lt;/a&gt; after the Trump inauguration. And this makes me wonder -- why aren't we in the streets marching now? In 2017 it was mostly symbolic, a cry of pain that we all heard, ourselves, but it didn't help make the government better. Today if we were all in the streets the Repubs might not be so bold in Congress. They all saw what happened in Georgia. Show them it could happen in Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, North Carolina and Florida too. Make sure they know what we demand. They're scared and confused now. It's a good time to apply pressure. And to the Democrats, why aren't you organizing us! What are you waiting for? How many more chances to save American democracy do you think we're going to get?</description>

			<description>Yes I know these rants don't accomplish anything. At some point it has to stop. When I ran a startup in the 80s I remember trying to visualize the last day there, but I couldn't. Then one day I realized I had left, and I didn't even remember the last day. Like the last time I saw my mother, or an old girlfriend -- I don't remember most of those days either. But I do remember the day Trump took office. And I remember marching, and wondering if it would do any good. Like the rants I write today. Anyway one thing is for sure, we won't get many more chances to fix the country. I believe I know the answer -- look to the left and right not up or down. We don't have to unite with the miscreant Republicans in Congress. Most of them work for Moscow. We have to connect with other Americans who vote against democracy. This is not optional. So it's important to remember that and think of things we can do to shake ourselves out of our ruts and get out in the streets, figuratively and literally.</description>

When I ran a startup in the 80s I remember trying to visualize the last day there, but I couldn't. Then one day I realized I had left, and I didn't even remember the last day. Like the last time I saw my mother, or an old girlfriend -- I don't remember most of those days either. But I do remember the day Trump took office. And I remember marching, and wondering if it would do any good. Like the rants I write today. Anyway one thing is for sure, we won't get many more chances to fix the country. I believe I know the answer -- look to the left and right not up or down. We don't have to unite with the miscreant Republicans in Congress. Most of them work for Moscow. We have to connect with other Americans who vote against democracy. This is not optional. So it's important to remember that and think of things we can do to shake ourselves out of our ruts and get out in the streets, figuratively and literally." created="Sun, 24 Jan 2021 14:32:45 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/24.html#a143245"/>

What will be 'normal' five years from now?&quot; I commented: It's a good thing we stopped doing that. I only took one plane trip myself in the couple of years leading up to 2020. it was shocking, after being away for so long, how much carbon was burned for so little reason. we have to stop having this &quot;carbon party&quot; -- and the virus gave us a new perspective for that. It's a total silver lining. BTW I was already living in the country when I took the trip. I was going to Austin, and flew through Albany NY, which is a very small airport compared to the bay area or NY. But I had to make a connection in O'Hare, and that's when it hit me how ridiculous this was. I was going to a conference that could just as easily have been held online. It will be held online from now on, I expect (and hope). I guess what this means is that where you park your ass makes a much bigger difference now than it used to. The people you have personal contact with will be the ones who live where you do. Everyone else will be virtual. Long distance travel will be a luxury.</description>

			<description>As you may know, I got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/20.html#a210604&quot;&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; on the 20th. Only side-effect: a shoulder-ache at the injection site. I wonder why there isn't a database I'm registered in, so data can be gathered on the effectiveness of the vaccine over time and geography, so it can be added to other data to learn more about the virus. I registered for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Kinsa%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Kinsa&lt;/a&gt; groupware thermometer for that purpose. Millions of people have been vaccinated all over America, but as with everything it's fairly disorganized. I do have an official-looking CDC identification card, but no corresponding web registration.</description>

			<description>I read in the comments of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10157399193110947&amp;id=109161715946&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook how particular people in Vermont are about people who come from other places. The places I like best are where people don’t have any weird ideas about how they’re better than people who were born elsewhere. I’m a first gen American, child of people who ran for their lives, and were welcomed to this great country. They had no other place to go. What if America hadn't welcomed us? I've been to places where they hate outsiders, and many more places where they welcome them. I had a warm feeling walking around a small city in Italy, where I didn't speak the language and almost no one spoke English, but people were patient and smiled a lot and were gentle with the tourist from America. I got lost on the train, hundreds of miles out of my way, and the workers on the train spoiled me, passing me off to the next one to get me to my destination. Maybe they laughed, but I never saw it. The note they gave me explained my predicament in Italian, very respectfully (it was translated for me by my host when I arrived in Trieste). So I try to go out of my way to welcome visitors. Because it's a generous thing to do, but also because I know that I have benefited from this kind of generosity myself. And I always try to remember that I'm no better than anyone else, even if they were born in Vermont. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>On Facebook, a friend, a doctor who cares for very sick people, says he loves his job. I said: I understand. A little over ten years ago, my father had an accident and it put him into a coma that lasted a month. He was intubated, and put in a ward where they parked people who were in various stages of vegetativeness. I spent a lot of time there, reading to him, watching out for him, and I got to know various people on staff in the hospital. I had thought these were some of the worst jobs in the world, but I got an impression that it was quite the opposite, so I checked it out, and they all said they loved their jobs. I had plenty of time to think, and I realized that in many jobs, esp the ones I have done, the way you help people can be kind of abstract, hard to visualize. But people who care for others as their job, see the result of their work every day, all the time.</description>

			<description>A bunch of museums have made digital scans of their art available for re-use, but they always seem to make you download one image at a time. Sigh. This makes it very labor intensive to create applications that offer new ways to browse art collections. I want to make a nice screen saver, and display it on the big screen in my living room, for me and my guests (when we start having guests again). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2021/01/21/over-700000-paintings-from-the-rijksmuseum-online-copyright-free/&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; to do this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en&quot;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam. So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1352321597370101760&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter if anyone had downloaded a large number of the paintings, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoodBrain/status/1352352014315909120&quot;&gt;turns out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/10/19/the-rijksmuseum-as-bittorrent.html&quot;&gt;someone has&lt;/a&gt;!

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2021/01/21/over-700000-paintings-from-the-rijksmuseum-online-copyright-free/&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; to do this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en&quot;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam. So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1352321597370101760&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter if anyone had downloaded a large number of the paintings, and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoodBrain/status/1352352014315909120&quot;&gt;turns out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/10/19/the-rijksmuseum-as-bittorrent.html&quot;&gt;someone has&lt;/a&gt;! Thank goodness. Will report." created="Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:29:08 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/22/dutchMasters.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/22.html#a142908"/>

			<description>I spend an awful lot of money on video entertainment and receive very little in return. There were many months I paid for HBO but didn't watch a single thing on it. I paid for Showtime, but I think there were whole &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; that I never watched anything there. I'd love to re-watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-knick&quot;&gt;an HBO show&lt;/a&gt; that I recommended to a friend (and am hereby recommend to you) but I'd have to re-sub to watch it legally. Couldn't I just use one of those months in the past where I watched nothing but paid anyway? Okay so they need so much money for the lavish productions of new stuff. Maybe they could price their archives separately? How about that. Anything more than 10 years old say, you can have for $1 a month, and do a bundling deal where I can get everything that's 10 years or older from any of the majors for $10 a month. Problem is they'd find they have a glut of good stuff. We don't really need that much more. The whole thing is grossly out of whack. BTW, I did sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/19.html#a125040&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt;, only to find out they don't have an app for my LG TV, which is a whole other rant, why exactly do there have to be special apps for every TV. (Yes I know the answer, but I'm asking at a deeper level. Thank you.) I thought I might watch the Knicks, but there was an inauguration, and I had my Covid vaccine, and it made me tired, I think, so instead I just went to bed.</description>

			<title>Twenty years ago in podcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ericnuzum&quot;&gt;Eric Nuzum&lt;/a&gt; for writing this &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/first-podcast-feed-history&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;first podcast feed&lt;/a&gt;, about the project I did in January 2001, twenty years ago. The feed he writes about was used to test software I had developed that reads podcast feeds, otherwise known as a podcatcher. The feed was a small effort compared to the software that reads podcast feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few people on Twitter have criticized Eric's story, they say it was wrong, but actually &lt;i&gt;he got it right.&lt;/i&gt; That's why it's always a good idea to hedge a bit when you say someone is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay first, a nit -- the idea that Chris Lydon had the first real podcast is not true. There were a couple of others that predate his Radio Open Source -- Doug Kaye's IT Conversations and Steve Gillmor's Gillmor Gang. They were doing MP3-based radio when we came out with the podcast format, and they quickly adopted it. I've written about them here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt;. Lydon's podcast was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/21/cbcsOriginStoryOfPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; I had a role in producing. I've shrugged off the distinction a few times, because Chris was the first who showed up to play in my sandbox, and that, to me, was worth a lot. I learned from his experience, a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My UserLand on the Desktop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's where Nuzum got it right and his critics are wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In early 2001, after meeting with Adam in New York, which Nuzum documents, I produced a daily feed of Grateful Dead songs. I don't think the RIAA would have had a problem with it (as Nuzum jokingly says) because the Dead had a culture of letting their users do what they like with their music. I thought it was completely appropriate that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=320&amp;v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&quot;&gt;Heart of Gold Band&lt;/a&gt; would play a role in bootstrapping the new medium. I created the feed to test my new podcatcher. Here's the story of that software, whcih is also documented in the archive of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, at UserLand, we created a product called My UserLand, to compete with Netscape's My Netscape. Both were server-based RSS reader apps. This was the very beginning of RSS being used as a news publishing format. Then a we created a desktop version of My UserLand called, unimaginatively, My UserLand On The Desktop or MUOTD for short. It did what the server-based product did, but it ran as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;app on a user's desktop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Grateful Dead podcast feed was there to test the podcatcher functionality in MUOTD.&lt;/i&gt; That predated Adam's iPodder by over three years. Adam used it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;MUOTD was later merged with Radio UserLand, a desktop blogging tool, creating something that has yet to be matched by anyone -- a desktop blogging and reading app, all in one. It was pretty cool. I'm pretty sure the guys who later formed Twitter used it. It was more or less Twitter on the desktop, based on RSS, five years before Twitter. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was all part of an idea I loved that I called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers&lt;/a&gt;. MUOTD and Radio UserLand were full powered web servers that ran on the user's machine. Most probably weren't even aware they were running a server, because the user interface was so smooth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News for January 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of MUOTD from 1/11/2001.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351992214344388610&quot;&gt;got&lt;/a&gt; my Covid vaccine today. I was really lucky, I had signed up to be notified from a local pharmacy, and I got their email last night a few minutes after they sent it. Signed up right away and at 3PM today I got my first dose of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/19/a-side-by-side-comparison-of-the-pfizer-biontech-and-moderna-vaccines/&quot;&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. So far no side-effects. Two life-changing events in one day. Not bad! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
