			<description>This is how I often &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/14/twitterAsPostEditor.png&quot;&gt;write blog posts&lt;/a&gt; these days. In Twitter. I so totally wish I could just click the &lt;i&gt;Post&lt;/i&gt; button and have it do the rest. Their API is good enough that I can suck it into my outliner automatically, no manual work. I could really see discourse on the net exploding in useful ways if Twitter let go of the 280-char limit.</description>

			<title>Not breaking the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My email conversation with Allen Wirfs-Brock took an interesting turn. I had written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript&quot;&gt;Really Simple JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that the language would benefit from removing features. A path well-explored &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2&quot;&gt;AWB pointed out&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my last post I talked about various &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3&quot;&gt;programming mottos&lt;/a&gt; that help with the design issues JavaScript has encountered. Then AWB commented about the design slogans that guide the evolution of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWB on design slogans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm big fan of design slogans. The one we used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; about not breaking things was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break the web!‚Äù  It‚Äôs a preservationist perspective.  Much of the human digital heritage of the last 30 years and for the foreseeable future is stored as unmaintained web documents. Every breaking change to a web technology (JS, HTML, etc.) is likely to make part of our heritage permanently inaccessible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another slogan we used frequently while I was active in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; was  ‚Äúconsider the complexity budget.‚Äù  The idea is that there are  limits (whose bounds we don‚Äôt know) to the complexity that a programming language can accommodate and still remain useable, learnable, comprehensible, fun, etc.  Every time a feature is added or a inconsistency is introduced we use up some of the complexity budget and it can never be recovered. So any such addition limits what do to the language in the future. Each proposed feature needs to be evaluated not just concerning its utility but also whether that utility is worth limiting future language design flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is something that I worry may have faded as TC39 has grown much larger and participants somewhat more transient.  A person who is representing a company in a standards group is most likely to see a positive effect in their performance reviews if they get things added to the standard rather than for helping control complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course, committee-made decisions are always going to involve disagreements and compromises.  In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3386327&quot;&gt;JavaScript history paper&lt;/a&gt;. I have a short section (21.3.5) where I cover the deliberations that resulted in the inclusion of arrow functions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DW on not breaking the web&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't break the web. That's a big one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That might be the biggest rule of all. For me, all my work really for my whole career has been directed at the web. Not breaking it is the one hope that the work won't have been for naught, as well as the work of millions of other people (of course my work is the most important heh).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As you know, Google et al are hell-bent on breaking the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if some of the people on your design committee come from companies who agree with Google on breaking the web. So maybe it would be good to have a bigger dialog on what &quot;Don't break the web&quot; really means. Of course the people at Google et al have never responded to anything I've written about that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AWB on not breaking the web&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Most  individuals (even those representing BigCos)  who participant in web standards groups generally buy into &quot;don't break the web.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But to some, and in particular some big companies, it means don't break the 100 (or 1000) top web sites rather than don't break web legacy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also some have higher or lower bars for exceptions to that rule.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DW on the behavior of guests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks Allen for the clarity. I fully agree with all of it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have another &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt; that I'd love for the standards designers of today to contemplate. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;BigCo is a guest on the web, as we all are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guests don't make the rules.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That imho is the single most important thing about the web. It's a platform with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/04/fourYearsOfXmlrpc.html&quot;&gt;no platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who proposes to work at the center of the tech that implements the web in whatever decade it is should behave as an archeologist, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/87459/when-we-go-mars-how-will-we-protect-martian-life-us&quot;&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. You have to wear an attitude of non-contamination. The software version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazmat_suit&quot;&gt;hazmat suit&lt;/a&gt;. Any little change could have huge unforseen consequences. The web today is so large and diverse, no one can understand all that it does. Whatever new feature is enabled by what you propose to add is worth a small fraction of what has been built on technology you've never seen or understood, or if you do, would consider arcane. You're free to innovate, but you have to do it in a sandbox you create, with rules you define. The web already has a rule.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just gave $100 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincolnproject.us/&quot;&gt;Project Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;By this point in 2016 I had already given the max to HRC, but her ads always disappointed me. No inspiration. Seemed machine-designed to hit the demographics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Project Lincoln so far has been great entertainment. Good for base-rallying. They can't really get into inspiring visions, given that they are Republicans and won't be in power if the ads work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will have a government problem when Biden wins. His vision will largely be undetermined, it seems to me. And I expect it'll drift. And they've done nothing to organize the post-inauguration campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far no political campaign has managed to retain power by keeping the flow of ideas going out 365 days a year, every year, not just once every four. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Closest has been Trump, but he just has the Twitter account, and there's no imagination to what he says, no inspiration, no ideas, other than pointing to what he's going to destroy next. Talking points from Moscow. I'm not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a vacuum here, still. An online organizing system that wasn't just about raising money, rather building support and keeping it organized all the time&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I think they should change their name to Project Lincoln. Because that's their Twitter handle that's how my mind thinks of them at a sub-conscious level. When I see them say it the other way around on their website it burns some braincells. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We may be at the point in the unraveling of America when our favorite diners shut down. For me it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/food/odessa-restaurant-late-night-east-village-oasis-close&quot;&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7263911,-73.9833187,3a,75y,301.34h,92.34t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sjZYPzLkIfakUz6jzf8gGnw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DjZYPzLkIfakUz6jzf8gGnw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D36.482285%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Avenue A&lt;/a&gt;, across from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tompkins-square-park&quot;&gt;Tompkins Square Park&lt;/a&gt;, in the East Village. I used to meet my &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/momorderingfromodessa&quot;&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and grandfather there in the 80s. My uncle lived nearby in the hippie days, the late 60s and 70s. When I lived in NYC in the last decade, the teens, I'd &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2010/june/odessa&quot;&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; an out-of-town visiting friend maybe once a year.

The links to the old generation are disappearing, no surprise because the generation itself is gone. Not surprising that a place like Odessa can't survive just on takeout, when there are so many other great choices in the Village.</description>

			<description>This is why you take pictures of your food. A picture of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.scripting.com/2011/march/odessadinner&quot;&gt;dinner at Odessa&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know what all of it is. The sausage is probably a kielbasa. And the dumplings are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi&quot;&gt;pierogi&lt;/a&gt;, and come with fillings like sauerkraut, mushrooms, potatos and various meats. The pancake on top doesn't look familiar. I think that might be stuffed cabbage on the right at 2 o'clock. There's some kind of soup at the upper right.</description>

			<title>Re-open schools? Not yet</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sraDVyksYMs&quot;&gt;great scene&lt;/a&gt; in the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq70brIQP40&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; where the lead character interviews for a job in a local bank. She's had a hard life, no job history or r√©sum√©. The bank officer explains: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When the beach party is over you don't get to say, you know what, I think now I'd like to have what everyone else has worked their entire life for. It doesn't work that way.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the speech the virus is giving to the Republican governors of Texas, Florida, Arizona and all the other states that are collapsing under the weight of the virus after re-opening before they did the hard work of getting the virus under control. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The predictable thing happened. The pandemic exploded. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The analogy to the main character of Monster is pretty close to perfect. The governors may have been  na√Øve, as she was, but life doesn't care about that. You have to pay the price before you get the prize.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Charlize Theron in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_(2003_film)&quot;&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First there's no question &lt;i&gt;the schools will not open in the fall. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should stop discussing it. It's out of the question. What may happen is they will try to open the schools in a few of the Republican states, and close them within a few days as the rate of infection goes even higher. Cause and effect. You do something stupid and a week later the infections go up, two weeks later the hospitalizations go up and two weeks after that, the death rate goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this dimension the virus is totally predictable. Opening the schools in a month, with such a high density of infections, is suicidal on both the individual and societal level. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;New Covid cases per million. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the plan we would be executing now if we had competent management. I'm not inventing this, it's the protocol they used in China, Vietnam, Singapore, New York, basically everywhere, to defeat the virus. This was a known method back in March. I first heard about it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nationwide lockdown until the rate of new cases is flat and near the baseline.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile stand up national testing and contact tracing. Open source the data so the public can help analyze it. Also useful for teaching the kids, at home, what's going on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Create a network of places to isolate newly infected Americans.

Help them study the math and science of viral infections. And study the history, as it's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On NPR this morning a question that has a simple answer, but no one can seem to find it. How did the flower children of the 60s become the Boomers of the 90s and 00s? Not a good question, because that isn't what happened. Hippies were a very small part of the Boomer generation. George W. Bush is a Boomer, but not a hippie, then or now. And sure, some hippies didn't drop out, but then a bunch of them did. My uncle, for example. He really did live the dream of the hippies. As I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me&quot;&gt;Lies&lt;/a&gt; book, I come to appreciate that there are people applying the scientific method to history, and not accepting the simple and wrong stories of heroes and villains, weak and strong, the savages and the civilized. BTW, some of the hippies became programmers. That's a whole other thread to pick up. That's why the freedoms of the net and the web &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;persist&lt;/a&gt; to this day. A fair number of people believe in them, still, and follow the grain, instead of trying to build forts.</description>

			<description>One more thing, my disappointment with the EFF, as I discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/10/225547.html?title=anEffToWatchTheEff&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, is that they started off with the hippie ideal, the three founders were immersed in it, but as the EFF grew, they let billionaire monopolists set the agenda. I wanted them to tell the story of podcasting as it was created, by following the grain of the web, not by throwing huge money and installed base at the idea. Sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction&quot;&gt;soft power&lt;/a&gt; is the way to get something done. They wouldn't even listen, that's how little respect they have for the individual. Why should they, the most I can contribute is a few thousand, Google can contribute millions. Imagine what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69w_CXFR7tE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8&quot;&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; would say.

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript, day 3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First thanks to Allen Wirfs-Brock for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution process for JavaScript. I wanted to let his ideas settle in for a couple of days before responding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I applaud the rule of &quot;don't break existing code.&quot; We had the same rule in the RSS world. It was very controversial with some. They wanted to break it. That's what the big debate was about. On one side, mine, trying to maintain continuity, because I and others were developing and deploying software to users that built on RSS. We couldn't afford to change things just for the sake of change. And we had a lot at stake in preserving simplicity, because that kept the barrier to entry low. The more different ways there were to do something, the harder it would be to enter the market, and the leaders could become complacent. We've all seen how markets stagnate when the leaders are protected. I didn't want to see that happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We had the same rule in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; world . We called it Rule 1, and it was simply this: Don't Break Users. As a joke Rule #1a was: Don't Break Dave. That was meant to tell the team this was personal. If my code was broken, I would probably raise my voice. The rule came about because the guy who was working on the core code would routinely break the upper-level code. To him, the core was never finished, and all the work we were doing at upper levels was just to test his stuff. So he didn't really feel it. I think that's true of many other developers. They don't get that the people who build on their tech are skilled in ways they can't comprehend (and of course vice versa). That's the power of layering tech. It becomes virtually impossible without the No Breakage rule. And you can see it in the market. Good ideas from previous generations are nowhere to be found in today's systems. Because someone wiped the slate clean without any idea how much had been built on it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW there's a great story about this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine&quot;&gt;Soul of a New Machine&lt;/a&gt;. They were shocked when they saw real people using their product. They had never imagined it, and it felt wrong to them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have another rule -- &quot;One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot; This is a variant of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/927/&quot;&gt;XKCD cartoon&lt;/a&gt;, and of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle&quot;&gt;Postel's robustness principle&lt;/a&gt;. Postel says be conservative in what you send. I say one way is better than two. Applied to JavaScript, adding the arrow syntax was a mistake. It didn't add any new expressive power to the language, and it meant anyone who needs to read code (i.e. everyone who develops) now has to understand two ways of doing the same thing. Even worse, newbies now have to learn two ways, and they have to learn when to use which way, and all the explaining avoids the truth -- it really doesn't make a difference. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;One way is better than two&quot; is another instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;. Stop trying to make it better. Because that just makes it worse.

				<source:outline text="First thanks to Allen Wirfs-Brock for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/09/161916.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay2&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution process for JavaScript.

					<source:outline text="I applaud the rule of &quot;don't break existing code.&quot; We had the same rule in the RSS world. It was very controversial with some. They wanted to break it. That's what the big debate was about. On one side, mine, trying to maintain continuity, because I and others were developing and deploying software to users that built on RSS. We couldn't afford to change things just for the sake of change. And we had a lot at stake in preserving simplicity, because that kept the barrier to entry low. The more different ways there were to do something, the harder it would be to enter the market, and the leaders could become complacent. We've all seen how markets stagnate when the leaders are protected. I didn't want to see that happen." created="Sat, 11 Jul 2020 15:25:12 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3#a152512"/>
					<source:outline text="We had the same rule in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; world . We called it Rule 1, and it was simply this: Don't Break Users. As a joke Rule #1a was: Don't Break Dave. That was meant to tell the team this was personal. If my code was broken, I would probably raise my voice. The rule came about because the guy who was working on the core code would routinely break the upper-level code. To him, the core was never finished, and all the work we were doing at upper levels was just to test his stuff. So he didn't really feel it. I think that's true of many other developers. They don't get that the people who build on their tech are skilled in ways they can't comprehend (and of course vice versa). That's the power of layering tech. It becomes virtually impossible without the No Breakage rule. And you can see it in the market. Good ideas from previous generations are nowhere to be found in today's systems. Because someone wiped the slate clean without any idea how much had been built on it." created="Sat, 11 Jul 2020 15:32:45 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3#a153245">

					<source:outline text="I have another rule -- &quot;One way of doing something is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot; This is a variant of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/927/&quot;&gt;XKCD cartoon&lt;/a&gt;, and of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle&quot;&gt;Postel's robustness principle&lt;/a&gt;. Postel says be conservative in what you send. I say one way is better than two. Applied to JavaScript, adding the arrow syntax was a mistake. It didn't add any new expressive power to the language, and it meant anyone who needs to read code (i.e. everyone who develops) now has to understand two ways of doing the same thing. Even worse, newbies now have to learn two ways, and they have to learn when to use which way, and all the explaining avoids the truth -- it really doesn't make a difference." created="Sat, 11 Jul 2020 15:27:50 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3#a152750"/>

Can you imagine if we have to purge this from our tech vocabulary? The economics of such changes are mind-boggling. And the breakage. What if we used such a term in one of our standards? A frozen one? An ancient one? What then?</description>

			<description>The problem with journalism exposed in the age of Trump is they don't do anything. You say oh they're not supposed to. Voice from nowhere, etc. But they rarely carry stories of people who do things. Mostly Trump. Occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt; or but just for a while. That's it. Why does it matter now? Because we've been needing to do things since November 2016. We figure it out when it's too late. It's a repeating pattern. Maybe we need national activism more than we need journalism? We need something different or else we're hosed.</description>

			<title>An EFF to watch the EFF?</title>

			<description>Watching Biden give a speech via teleprompter and wondering why in 2020 we don't have a better way of doing this, so he can move his head where ever he likes and still have the text right in front of his eyes. He shouldn't have to turn his head to read.</description>

			<description>I discovered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/09/featureInGitHub.png&quot;&gt;new feature&lt;/a&gt; in GitHub. If you create a public repository with the same name as your account, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/scripting/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;readme.md&lt;/a&gt; file in that repo is displayed on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting&quot;&gt;GitHub home page&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it's Markdown. Might be interesting to integrate some of the status-editing features I'm working on into this. It supports basic web stuff, as you would expect from a techies site like GitHub. Okay this might be fun. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üéà&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Last night at the beginning of Maddow they had a tour of the Covid ward at a Houston hospital similar to the ones they did in NYC hospitals a couple of months ago. First we watched a woman die. She was infected at the funeral she held for her husband who also died of Covid. Then they interviewed a patient who explained she was being careful, yet caught the virus anyway. This is how it works when the density of infection goes up, you encounter more virus as you move around, and with more density the chance of you getting infected goes up. That's what they're dealing with in Houston. It was excellent, but they were all Democrats. It would be helpful if they interviewed a banker type, in trouble, in a ward, worrying about the horrible death looming in front of him. Let them see a Republican dealing with an unavoidable awful reality. Might scare them into wearing masks and thereby decrease the density of the virus and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Senators, go to Jacksonville!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-national-convention-rnc-coronavirus-gop-senators-jacksonville/&quot;&gt;Republican senators&lt;/a&gt; are apparently &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to Trump's convention in Jacksonville. Why not? Scared of the virus? Trump says it won't get you. Or does he?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also hope their children and grandchildren will be going back to school in the fall. Kids don't get sick they say, and if they do they don't die, and if they die they were going to die anyway. This is the position of the Trump government. If it's good for Republicans then it's good for their representatives, right??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/decision-2020/trump-to-hold-outdoor-rally-in-portsmouth-nh-this-week/2154220/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday in New Hampshire. &lt;i&gt;They should  go! Don't miss it. &lt;/i&gt;No masks, social distancing, lots of ways to get sick. Very sick. Hey if it's good for Americans, why not the senators? And of course their families. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about striving for simplicity in using JavaScript, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs&quot;&gt;Allen Wirfs-Brock&lt;/a&gt;, who has been involved in JavaScript language design for many years, and was editor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/&quot;&gt;ES6 spec&lt;/a&gt;, responded thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Because of JavaScript‚Äôs &quot;don‚Äôt break existing code&quot; policy, often the only way to fix an existing problematic features is to leave it alone and add a better alternative. This inevitably leads to profiles that include the better features and leaves out the deprecated ones.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You probably don‚Äôt use &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt; , but most commercial JS devs seem to. There are probably thousands of configuration profiles for it that enforce various style guides and and subset preferences. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardjs.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Standard Style&lt;/a&gt; is popular but controversial both because of its self-assumed name and because of the positions it takes on semicolon usage and other conventions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Regarding choice of function forms, my preference is to use the &lt;code&gt;function hello () {}&lt;/code&gt; form in most situations where I wanted to define a named function, both global and local.  I‚Äôd generally reserve arrow functions for cases where I‚Äôm passing an anonymous function as an argument or otherwise using it as a first class value.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôd probably only use &lt;code&gt;const hello= () =&gt; {};&lt;/code&gt; in situations where I need to name a function that needs to reference the this binding of its surrounding environment.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; works in a place where people must wear a mask, so she gives out a lot of masks every day. She's going to make custom masks that have a message. That's the first part of this story. Second part, we both started a campaign called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt;, where we promote stories and ideas that save people's lives in this age where lives have all of a sudden become cheap, something our government is promoting (the cheapness, not the saving). So Jen has designed a mask that has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt; message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;#blacklivesmatter&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?</description>

So Jen has designed a mask that has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt; message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;#blacklivesmatter&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?" created="Wed, 08 Jul 2020 12:31:59 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/08/saveMyLifeMask.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/08.html#a123159"/>

			<description>Yesterday, I was at a store, did my shopping, but when I took the mask off in the car one of the straps broke. I went back to the store and asked if they had an extra. They gave me one, with a smile. No reason that mask shouldn't have had a message on it.</description>
