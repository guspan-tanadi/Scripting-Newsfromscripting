I don't know how to say this without pissing a bunch of people off, but I have to say it anyway. It's not ActivityPub that's booming now, it's Mastodon, which happens to use ActivityPub. The problem with ActivityPub is that it is basically incomprehensible. I don't know why it is that way. I could clear my schedule for the next three months and then at the end, I'd be able to tell you why it is that way. But I can't do that, because I have stuff to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and I want to get back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; soon. I have users and I want to do stuff for them. As curious as I am to find out what's there, someone else will have to do that work. What we need is this. A simple package for Node, a lot simpler than the ones that are out there, that covers the basic functionality of things users do in Mastodon interactively, without using Mastodon, just ActivityPub. Create a new post, edit an existing post, boost a post, like one. Follow someone. Etc. Over on Mastodon a few people are talking about Bear Hugs. I didn't remember, but that's a term &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/15/the-bearhug/&quot;&gt;Steve Gillmor coined&lt;/a&gt; (I believe) for what I did with RSS. I basically kept building stuff with it, and getting content people on board until RSS on its own meant something. Then I let it go. We need that for ActivityPub. The people who won't like this are the members of the W3C. I'm afraid they think AP is done. Mastodon is already doing things outside of AP. I don't blame them. I would do the same thing. They have an API, they are using RSS, both of which are comprehensible. I think AP deserves to be comrepehensified, it deserves a bear hug. BTW, Steve Gillmor is to tech as Steve Bannon is to MAGA. Very much the same concept, imho.</description>

			<description>It's probably very good for the world that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Butterfield&quot;&gt;Stewart Butterfield&lt;/a&gt; is leaving Salesforce. After he gets time to rest and recharge, something brilliant and open is probably going to come from his mind. A very capable and creative person, Slack is an amazing product and he evolved it well.</description>

I'm not listening to them in any particular order. I felt kind of bad about it, but I got over it. One idea he talks about was there was an idea of white drugs and black drugs. I can vouch for that. I was blown away a few years ago to find out &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; smokes weed. I thought it was just a white boomer thing. Everyone does it. The sound of eyes opening. I asked Alexa to play me some Hendrix music. First she played Hey Joe which I'd been bingeing on. Then came his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TgbWOy6Buk&quot;&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; at Woodstock. And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY&quot;&gt;All Along the Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. It was really emotional for me. It's already been a heavy duty emotional day. Let's go deeper! After that he asks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZHGJxv3qQ&quot;&gt;Are You Experienced?&lt;/a&gt; Hey for such a young man, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix#Death,_post-mortem,_and_burial&quot;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; at 27, he was very self-aware and surroundings-aware.</description>

All of a sudden I can read everything. No more mysteries or relying on memory. Another interesting weirdness, as I've been working on software this week I can now see that I have been mis-spelling the names of things all over the place. I have a practice of copying and pasting names when I want to refer to a value or call a function, so as the mis-spellings propagate, my code still runs without errors. I really have been transformed into an able-eyed person in just one little operation. My dreams, also amazingly, have become more vivid and memorable and also gratifying (no more information forthcoming in re this). I think perhaps when one's vision improves it improves in many dimensions. Did I mention that the screens in my life reveal details heretofore unappreciated! The retina display I'm typing this into has many subtleties. Amazing.</description>

Good example code to get started with the Mastodon API. Also illustrates how easy feeds (RSS, Atom, RDF) can be incorporated into any Node app with the reallySimple package. Finally, I hope to start building a rep in the Mastodon development community with this package. I hope to make quite a few contributions in the future.

Or you find out some app is running in Google's cloud and Google is destroying the web. I have another one. I use Digital Ocean for hosting and S3 for storage. You might want to check out who owns those services and decide if you still like me. (I use DO because they have great docs and good prices. I use S3 because it was a breakthrough product when it came out and I totally needed what they offered and I loved what they were doing, and now I'm pretty well locked-in.) And I chose Twitter for identity in 2014 because identity is a human-intensive bitch and they were offering to let me use theirs for $0. I solved the problem long ago and baked it into my system. I could bake something else in, and I would, quickly if they broke us. But so far I've been able to spend my time on more productive and fun development work. Maybe I'm giving something up. Yeah, there are a lot of choices in life. You never know what was down the road you didn't take.</description>

			<description>For my friends Geraldine and Peter, this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;chat system&lt;/a&gt; where you ask an AI that really is amazing to write stories for you, or answer questions, or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/sqlcode.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;develop software&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone, including me, is smitten by this invention. I asked it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/trumpstory.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;write a story&lt;/a&gt; about Donald Trump admitting he is a troll and tells everyone to just ignore him, and it'll be good for everyone including him.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1598839749740855296&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is how users advocate in their own interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon adds a feature that users value, demonstrably, by RTing the call to action and subscribing to the feeds in their favorite feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we find out which readers do it well and which do not. The ones who don't will be motivated to catch up. Once users make it an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And other social platforms will be motivated to follow Mastodon's lead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when Mastodon supports RSS, and there's demonstrated user support, Twitter must add the feature. It's a fundamental law of tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once Twitter has a competitor, all kinds of things are possible that weren't before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Let's say I buy a Metrocard to ride the NYC subway. Every time I slide the card through a turnstile, what is that called? Is it a micropayment? Or I have an EZ-Pass responder on my car, so I drive through where the toll booths used to be without even slowing down. I don't know how much that costs, but I assure you there's nothing &lt;i&gt;micro&lt;/i&gt; about it! One of the reasons business people at pubs must be tired of this discussion is it's their job to get MACRO payments for their employer, not teeny little micros. As I envision it, I would probably spend $100 a month on various pubs, and maybe more and more over time. When fluidity is added to the economics, how can you help but pay more. It's only because of the attitude about this at publishers that we can't have more news (and they get more money). Right now I only pay three pubs -- NYT, WP and Consumer Reports. My money should be spread around a lot better than that.</description>

			<description>My parents were children in Europe as the Holocaust was brewing. Their parents, my grandparents, got them out in time so that they could meet in Brooklyn, get married and have children, including me of course. My paternal &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/baruchWiner.gif&quot;&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt; told me, when I was a little kid, in his heavy Russian accent &quot;Daveeed, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you get a gun and go on the roof and you shoot them!&quot; My parents were horrified. I thought he was just a crazy old man. But he was a lot smarter and wiser than we gave him credit for.</description>

			<title>Feeds in the Fediverse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;These are the goals for the software I am about to release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The network of RSS publishers and readers should be part of the Fediverse. This software enables the flow of RSS content into the Fediverse.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To provide good simple working code for the Mastodon API. I had to do too much work to figure out how to get what amounts to a &lt;i&gt;Hello World&lt;/i&gt; script up and running. Now you don't have to do all that work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You should be able to build feed-based utilities without giving any thought to reading feeds. Reading a feed should be as easy as reading a JSON file. This app illustrates how that works, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to get some code out there into the Mastoverse, to start building a rep in the community.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The scope of the Fediverse, 2022</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://axbom.com/fediverse/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; is very informative.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@oblomov@sociale.network/109437619944925429&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on my Mastodon account what apps other than Mastodon and micro.blog are on the ActivityPub network. I had heard of many of these, but in the newbie fog, I hadn't retained the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't see any feed readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to fix that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
