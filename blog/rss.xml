			<description>Same way I want news to be unbundled, I dont care which service a show or series is on. I pay a lot for the services I subscribe to, but there are still shows I want to see that I canâ€™t and some services I pay for that I almost never watch shows on.</description>

			<description>Programming is rough when you were prepared to work on hooking up the sound system in the penthouse on the 173rd floor, and instead you have to work in the basement where the boiler is spewing all kinds of crap, but you're not clear if it was always doing this and you're just seeing it now because now you're listening.</description>

			<description>In my first job out of college I was in a similar situation and I thought to myself they shouldn't put programmers in offices on the 39th floor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building&quot;&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigapplewindowcleaning.com/this-is-how-the-empire-state-buildings-windows-were-once-cleaned/&quot;&gt;windows&lt;/a&gt; that open. I found that thought both disturbing and comforting. I guess I figured out the problem, because I'm still here 47 years later. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Likes considered harmful?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrodivergent.com/2023/01/07/the-problem-with.html&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; about whether Likes are harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of my observations from the thread, all in favor of Likes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Like button on various systems is a way of acknowledging that you saw something and thought it was noteworthy. Since micro.blog doesn't have a Like button, what's the proper way of saying that? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a person who writes posts that get zero response here (and not on other systems) I wish people had a less-committed way of saying they saw something I wrote. That would be a little bit of feedback where currently I get none.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I see something on Micro.blog that I would Like on another system, I don't comment, I just do nothing, not because I'm bashful or overly quiet, rather because this is a language, and a comment has different meaning from a Like. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In real life there's all kinds of non-verbal communication. you can nod your head, smile. We've come up with a similar language online, I don't think there's any more meaning in this. We're being human. Not a huge surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a parallel. My TV doesn't have a brightness control. It's an expensive screen, and I imagine that the designers of the system figured &quot;we have a computer in this that knows how to automatically adjust brightness based on room light.&quot; But it doesn't work properly, I don't know what the problem is, but there are times the TV is useless because you just can't see what's on the screen, because the lack of a brightness control. Maybe if TVs never had brightness controls I wouldn't miss it, but they do in my mind, require one. Same thing here. &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; is something that's part of the language of social media. To try to deny that at this stage is kind of pointless imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been in this position myself in the past, trying to buck a larger trend, and the pressure really does get you to support the common way, the sooner you do it, the sooner the pain goes away. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &quot;considered harmful&quot; is borrowed from a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra&quot;&gt;Edsger Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;goto statement considered harmful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I need it because I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of my development process, all my build scripts run in Frontier, and while they could be converted to JavaScript, they'd be more complicated and it's a lot of work, and it's worth spending $600 to save all that work. Someday I want to do it because I'd like to use Drummer and its built-in scripting language for the same purpose. I learned a lot about why people choose older Macs. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(company)#Sale_to_CBS&quot;&gt;pre-CBS&lt;/a&gt; Fender guitars, which still sell at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Pre-cbs%20Fender%20Guitars&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-153677-346401-4&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=102&amp;keyword=&amp;crlp=632052376936_&amp;MT_ID=&amp;geo_id=&amp;rlsatarget=dsa-1456167871416&amp;adpos=&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=&amp;loc=1023511&amp;poi=&amp;abcId=&amp;cmpgn=18786426719&amp;sitelnk=&amp;adgroupid=144636292002&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr403s3aqhTbcuAgTH_yfHqEEFmps2tzdZFrHidJRllPpY8VuLIH0mcYRoCf2IQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt;, even though Fender sold to CBS in 1965. Maybe Macs peaked? Anyway -- I should get the &quot;new&quot; computer next week, and I'll let you know how it goes. BTW, my main desktop, the one I'm writing this post on, is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/08/macAboutScreen.png&quot;&gt;2017 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I love the machine.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/246&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I've got a problem with an app that uses the MySql package in Node running on a Mac. I'm getting a &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17px&quot;&gt;ER_CON_COUNT_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; pretty close to startup. I'm taking the message at face value but it's hard for me to believe it's true that my app is making too many connections because I just doubled the max connections from 100 to 200 and still got the error on the very first query it tried to make. The problem goes away when I reboot the machine, but only for a little while, eventually it starts doing this again. This is in an app that has been running without these kinds of errors for months. I haven't tried running the app yet on another machine, but I'm beginning to think this is a not-resolvable issue. I thought I'd pass it by the SQL gurus that read this blog on how to debug this.</description>

			<title>Ads on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The ads on Twitter are better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Already today I've considered buying something an ad was selling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I saw an HBO ad for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/05.html#a175850&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; I just watched and loved, it reminded me that I loved it. Excellent brand advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And one taught me something I won't forget.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/11/13/onlineAdvertisingIsNowDead.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;: Perfectly targeted advertising is just information.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Winning Time</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Time:_The_Rise_of_the_Lakers_Dynasty&quot;&gt;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Almost finished with the ten episodes of Season 1 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/winning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty&quot;&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like it for a bunch of reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly&quot;&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt; who plays &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Buss&quot;&gt;Jerry Buss&lt;/a&gt; the new owner of the Lakers when the season starts. He also btw is really good at audiobooks. I'd listen to any book he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=John+C.+Reilly&quot;&gt;narrates&lt;/a&gt;. He's Mr Affability. And perfectly cast for the role of Buss.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like the style, it's a little weird at first, but it's clever, and they break the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall&quot;&gt;fourth wall&lt;/a&gt; a few times, to good effect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that the style reminds me of one of my favorite movies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rFx6OFooCs&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, also a sports movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like sports movies/shows. And I especially like basketball. It's my favorite sport.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like the story how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley&quot;&gt;Pat Reilly&lt;/a&gt; became the coach of the Lakers and led them to dynasty. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like how Kareem became friends with Magic. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that the guy who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Haywood&quot;&gt;Spencer Haywood&lt;/a&gt; is the same actor who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_Barksdale&quot;&gt;Avon Barksdale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Field&quot;&gt;Sally Field&lt;/a&gt; plays Jerry Buss's mother! She's awesome as always.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like all the actors and roles. That's unusual. With such a huge cast you'd think there would be one impossible to watch character, but no, they're all interesting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that they will have lots of potential seasons, next up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson&quot;&gt;Phil Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and how he became the next dynastic coach of the Lakers. And don't forget &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant&quot;&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal&quot;&gt;Shaq&lt;/a&gt; who probably won't show up until Season 3 or 4. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave it the highest rating &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fwinning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty&quot;&gt;on Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. It didn't get great reviews. When I finish it, I'll read some of them to see what I missed. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wasn't very entertained with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-menu&quot;&gt;The Menu&lt;/a&gt; on HBO but now I find myself thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film)&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; a lot, not deliberately. Weird. So I watched it again, and on the second viewing it came together.

			<description>It might be time for a new political party to form in the House. I'm pretty sure a majority of voters love watching the Repubs fight this way. I sure do. It's an actual bonafide horse race. They should keep doing this until the Republican Party explodes.</description>

			<description>I introduced a problem in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/changenotes/2022/12/28/162013.html&quot;&gt;keyboard navigation&lt;/a&gt; in the Feed List feature was added. Basically, if you had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;Feed List&lt;/a&gt; displayed, an &quot;ask dialog&quot; wouldn't receive your keystrokes, or it would appear to freeze. This dialog appears whenever FL asks for a string, for example to enter a string to search for, or to enter the URL of a feed to subscribe to. I believe I found the problem and fixed it. It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/163&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

I was thinking about the way she talks about Thomas Jefferson. It's good. It says to me, a person who got a fairly standard education in American History from New York public schools, that these founders that we all iconify and think were so great, actually were people, and some of them were not beyond reproach, like Jefferson. That's the source of my use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+sassy&quot;&gt;term&lt;/a&gt; in yesterday's post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>TV relationships</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/02/thePetries.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been bingeing some highly rated but very mediocre TV series. What makes them so bad is how they present human relations. For example, it's very common for one character to approach another and ask &quot;Are you OK?&quot; with the clear implication that they are not. The person who is supposedly hurting, or sad, confused, troubled, about to die, grieving some horrific event (that we might know about) puts on a happy face and says &quot;No everything's fine, what makes you think I'm hurting, sad, confused etc?&quot; We know it's fake and so does the accuser. I imagine that a lot of people watching it think this kind of interaction is okay, but it's actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; which is a terrible thing to do to another person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is how they portray romantic relationships. A wife is dancing wildly at a party. The husband grabs her and takes her home, and on the way back explains how embarrassing her behavior was to him. I want to yell at him -- hey who cares if you're embarrased. It has nothing to do with you. And she was having fun. I can imagine being married to you is pretty stressful. Etc etc. Or a young dude once gets to have sex with an older woman and is therefore obsessed with her for his whole life, even after he's married to a very nice age-appropriate woman. The way he describes his feelings might be the way an infant would describe their relationship with a caregiver. &quot;Without you I can't live,&quot; he says. Sorry but that's bullshit. The baby is dependent. No matter how you feel, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; live without your age-inappropriate GF. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think about all the great shows I've binged many times and wish there were more out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my Bingeworthy ratings&lt;/a&gt; for shows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you see something that you think I would love, feel free to drop me an email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In tech we talk a lot about interop in software, but there is no interop in software without lots of interop between people, so start there. Open an invite to anyone you want to interop with, no matter what the history, let's work together to remove barriers to interop.</description>

			<description>My wish for us, in the blogging world, for the new year. We'll know it's working if most people feel their best place to write is their blog, where the editing tools work just as they like them to, and there are no boundaries to where those ideas can be published.</description>

			<description>My blogger of the year is &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/january-1-2023&quot;&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/a&gt;. Every day she teaches us something about what's happening, in a historic context. This is blogging at its best. If she has a business model it isn't in your face. She has something to add and she does it generously and with great expertise and sass. A role model for us all, and a perfect example of the blogging ethos and a perfect choice for my 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty&quot;&gt;BOTY&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
