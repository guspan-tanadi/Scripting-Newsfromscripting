			<description>When you start a war, you better be prepared to win it. If you can't win, getting out is going to be ugly, no matter what. Because US journalism is pretending there's another way to get out, they make it necessary for the US to bend over and make more concessions to the Taliban</description>

			<description>You know where &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt; asks &quot;What's happening?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/20/noOneCaresWhatYouThink.png&quot;&gt;This might work better&lt;/a&gt;. It's in the spirit of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTGfLObZYfU&quot;&gt;Progressive commercials&lt;/a&gt; where they teach people not to be their parents. &quot;The waiter does not need to know your name.&quot; Yet there are exceptions. There are a few people who write on Facebook who, when they write, I always stop and read. Because they have a track record of finding interesting things for me to think about. They write well too.</description>

			<title>Catching up on the news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I caught up on the news last night, and was surprised to hear that somehow what's going on in Afghanistan is dooming the Biden presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the reporters, esp Wolf Blitzer, are spinning it that way through the words they use to characterize events. And as a result, everyone has to tiptoe in this space. It's a dangerous time. The whole thing could explode at any time. Beating the drum for war, as they are, is a crazy crazy thing to do, as destructive as invading the Capitol on January 6.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they felt so strongly about Afghanistan (they didn't) why didn't they say something before? They had 20 years to speak up. No one ever did. Better to leave it to fester. Let's live this lie, everyone seemed to agree. Now all of a sudden, Afghanistan is more important as everything else.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, this all is fake news. It's worse than the lies on Facebook because they use brands like CNN and the NYT to lie this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Silos vs open</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love this quote about &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard&quot;&gt;Vox piece&lt;/a&gt; about Apple and other bigco's trying to take over podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“The beauty of RSS was just publish it and it goes everywhere — it’s just there, and it’s available.” &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It says clearly what the faceoff is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's easy to be part of a silo, impossible to be part of all of them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the open world, it's easy to be part of all of podcast players, but it's  harder to get started, you have to do more for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blogging went through the same thing that &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/span&gt; is going through now, it was taken apart by Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader, Medium and lately Substack. You couldn't write in one place and have your writing flow to all of them, the way podcasting works today. They don't agree on what a post is, so no matter what, you'd have to write at least two or three versions of a post. In the end, you just blow them all off, because it isn't worth the trouble and the resulting format is taking the fun out of your thinking and writing process. You aren't getting anything out of it. Not money, not exploration of ideas, not getting other people excited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is a sweet spot, it's possible, but you can't wander into it, it has to be done consciously, with a shared vision among devs, or it can't work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I'm so excited about &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools for Thought&lt;/span&gt; is it's a chance to start something new, to use the open principles of established by blogging and podcasting, foster a community of developers, each of whom understand that they're part of an ecosystem, they are not themselves the whole ecosystem. That's the key idea that most developers have yet to embrace. It requires some maturity to understand this idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if any journalists covering the future of podcasting will even consider that it't more than a battleground for big companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1427952893966102535&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from a member of the Roam user community asks how you would explain an outliner to someone who didn't use one. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1427976153164390405&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; followed. Text on rails is something you have to see. One incorrect thing people say about outliners is that they are strict hierarchies, but it's not true. The structure the outline manages is dynamic. Things move. It may look hierarchic but over time it's infinitely fluid, it can be anything you want.</description>

			<description>The likely sequence of events in Afghanistan, from reading a bunch of stuff and watching Maddow last night, which had a lot of info the other news reports didn't. Trump did a deal with the Taliban in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_peace_process#:~:text=The%20second%20peace%20treaty%20was,the%20terms%20of%20the%20agreement.&quot;&gt;Feb 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The Afghan government was not included in the deal. The Taliban agreed to stop shooting at American troops, and the US agreed to withdraw completely by May 2021. There were probably private deals that will enrich Trump and his buddies. Remember our government was an unabashed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy#:~:text=Kleptocracy%20(from%20Greek%20%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%80%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82%20kl%C3%A9pt%C4%93s,misappropriating%20government%20funds%20at%20the&quot;&gt;kleptocracy&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Once the deal was in place, it set in motion something that should have been obvious to the US negotiators, and for that matter, American journalists -- the local governments and probably the national government made individual deals with the Taliban. In exchange for money and protection, they switched sides. I probably would have done it too. So there was no resistance when the US withdrew. The Taliban just marched in, having won a political and economic victory if not a military one. No one gave the order for the American-supplied troops to fight. They took off their uniforms and went home. We'll have to see what happens to these people once we're fully gone from Afghanistan. A lot of Afghans didn't see this coming, that's why there was so little preparation for an immediate evacuation. Hard to blame this on the US. People wanted to stay and see what would happen, maybe the US-supplied army and the US-puppet regime would prevail? As it turns out, a bad bet.</description>

			<title>Trumping on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Someone I follow on Twitter complained that people thought just because he was a VC he wasn't allowed to have opinions. So I decided to take a look at what his opinion was.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what I wrote to him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I think you should have opinions, but trump watched tv all day, and sold us out any chance he got. He’s a fucking Nazi. When he lost the election he tried to overthrow the government. That’s what you support? I didn’t block you yet, but I did unfollow.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't see him as a troll. I think there are VCs in Calif who have a very limited set of people they talk with, and they actually fit into Trump's target. Even though they;'re hugely rich, young, healthy, super super privileged, they really feel misunderstood and victimized. It's real. They really feel it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it was worth one shake of the shoulders. Hey this isn't a good look.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Undoing the opml.org redirect mess</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/15.html#a210111&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the mess that opml.org has become, and how I want to start fresh with a well-organized site that points to all the resources available to devs working with OPML, and has lots of room for more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today I want to try to unwind one part of the mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;opml.org's DNS is at hover.com.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've set up the root, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;opml.org&lt;/a&gt; itself, as an A record pointing to 142.93.4.110. This server is where I host all my simple PagePark sites, ones that consist of static pages, and config.json settings. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I try to go to opml.org, I am redirected to dev.opml.org. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why? Until recently opml.org was a bucket on S3, set up to redirect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/&quot;&gt;dev.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm guessing they used a 301 permanent redirect, which causes my browser to cache the redirect. It doesn't bother making a DNS request for opml.org, because (guessing) the redirect was permanent. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So that's where I am this morning. I want to get opml.org unstuck, and able to be its own site, not to redirect to dev.opml.org, which I'd very much like to retire (and in doing so probably redirecting in the other direction to opml.org).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EeiLcLTisBQ&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the problem I hope to solve today.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try various things and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/221&quot;&gt;put notes here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1427273264485781511&quot;&gt;Poll&lt;/a&gt;: What do you get when you go to opml.org?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Followup -- we fixed it. Thanks for all the help...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Brent Ashley had exactly the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brentashley/status/1427290535480463361&quot;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1427293487410696195&quot;&gt;needed&lt;/a&gt;. opml.org problem solved everywhere. I can start with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/16/solved.png&quot;&gt;fresh slate&lt;/a&gt;. Excellent. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Comments on Afghanistan</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the time of the Vietnam War. I was draft age, had a low lottery number, no exemptions, and was flunking out of high school, so the prospect of being drafted was pretty real. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I was absolutely sure of was that none of the people who were draft age in that time would start another war like Vietnam, but then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush&quot;&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It became a debacle just like Vietnam. But with a few differences. No draft and no body bags. And far fewer American casualties. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of the US converting a country we know nothing about and don't want to know anything about into a country modeled after the US is just as wrong today as it was in the 60s and 70s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson&quot;&gt;LBJ&lt;/a&gt;, who did so much for civil rights, also was brought down by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson#Vietnam_War&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of parallels. Another one is that journalism is completely fucking up the story, telling bedtime stories about what the US could do, and how events developed, and getting the story completely wrong. I'm no expert, but I've read enough to know that there was a deal between the US and the Taliban that did not include the Afghan government, where the US committed to leave in 2020, and the Taliban agreed to not attack us as we left. Had we decided to stay, breaking that deal, we would have committed to a full scale war with the Taliban. There was no middle alternative between leaving and war. Whether or not this was wise is something you have to ask former president Trump. He desperately wanted to get out of Afghanistan and was willing to give up everything to get it. But even that much he couldn't pull off. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Fact: once we went in, there was no graceful way out. Give Biden credit for being willing to take the hit to get us out, finally, after Bush, Obama and Trump kicked the can down the road to the next administration. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of all the things you can read today, I recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;https://laurajedeed.medium.com/afghanistan-meant-nothing-9e3f099b00e5&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, written by an Afghanistan vet. It rings true. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also Heather Cox Richardson's &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/august-15-2021&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; is as usual excellent. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You could use a CNAME for any name, including the top level of a domain. It's so rational, I don't understand why all DNS service providers don't allow it.

The whole idea of having a name like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;pagepark.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is so that I can easily relocate it to new hardware someday without having to find all the places that have its IP address hard-coded.

			<description>I discovered yesterday that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbomax.com/hub/classics-curated-by-tcm&quot;&gt;TCM library&lt;/a&gt; is available on HBO Max. Well I think that did it. I'm going to be spending a lot of time with that. The first movie I watched was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor/Victoria&quot;&gt;Victor/Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. I love everything about that movie, even the cornball stuff. But the best part is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews&quot;&gt;Julie Andrews&lt;/a&gt; playing a woman playing a man playing a woman, and it's so entertaining. I first discovered TCM when I was recuperating from surgery in 2002. They gave me an unlimited supply of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone&quot;&gt;Oxycontin&lt;/a&gt;. So I was weak and completely stoned for a full month watching TCM movies basically non-stop. Without commercials. For such a serious life moment, I was actually enjoying it pretty well, I have to say. One of the movies was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09.html#victorvictoria&quot;&gt;Victor/Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. I probably watched it all the way through 20 times in 2002 (I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09/27.html#l478d29742a10d66001e366393966eb78&quot;&gt;TiVO&lt;/a&gt;). It was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140102022028/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/940179%7C0/Robert-Osborne-on-Joan-Crawford.html&quot;&gt;Joan Crawford Month&lt;/a&gt;, so I watched every JC movie they had, going back to silent movies. She was a super cutie, whatever you think of her &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/06/publicShamingIsWorthALook.html&quot;&gt;as a mother&lt;/a&gt;, I could watch her all day, esp with the Oxy. Then they did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_in_film&quot;&gt;movies of 1939&lt;/a&gt;, which was probably the best year ever for Hollywood. The way the early web may have been the best time for tech. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/08/14.html#When:1:03:47PM&quot;&gt;The Women&lt;/a&gt; was an unusual movie from 1939. You don't realize this right away but there are no men in the movie, not even an extra. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Women_(1939_film)#Cast&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; of superstar women actors of the day. There was also The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Anyway, after all this time, I can't get Oxy anymore (glad for that, I liked it too much) but I can get as much TCM as I want, and I get to do the programming. Geez. All I need is a bungalow in the Florida Keys or a hacienda in Taos, and nice way to watch TCM, and I could just disconnect. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/world/meanwhile-in-america-august-3-intl/index.html&quot;&gt;Taliban crush&lt;/a&gt; the Afghan government so quickly makes quite an impression. I think bringing our military home was probably a good idea. While we were protecting Afghanistan from their Taliban, we've been growing our own fundamentalist terrorism culture here. The Afghan Taliban wants to return their country to the 5th century, the American Taliban wants to go back to before the Civil War. They want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesaurus.land/?word=subjugate&quot;&gt;subjugate&lt;/a&gt; women. Our fundamentalists also want subjugate non-whites and non-Christians.</description>

			<title>We're cooked</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went for a walk in the noon heat and was wiped out.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/podcasts/the-daily/climate-change-IPCC.html&quot;&gt;today's lame Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;climate crisis&lt;/span&gt; is a lot worse than they were willing to say, obviously, based on facts they cited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then they got all weepy about how it's the fault of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;boomers&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the story they should have reported.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We have not yet started to decrease carbon emissions, in fact it's still going up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even if we never emitted another ton of carbon, the next 30 years are going to be an escalating climate catastrophe. What we're seeing now is nothing compared to what we are certain to see in five years, ten years, all the way up to thirty years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then in thirty years it will level off, assuming somehow in 2021 we stopped emitting any carbon. The climate will still be horrific but it won't get any worse. But (repeated, sorry) only if we turn our carbon emissions down to zero, now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/13/194244.html?title=wereCooked#a194426&quot;&gt;#1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So the boomers are to blame, say the host and the guest. The guest is a boomer, the host is younger. This is where their version of the story ends. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the crazy part. They're doing exactly what the boomer supposedly did and feels so guilty about. Not owning the truth of now. Softening it. Shifting to blame instead of what to do. Now, even if we got our shit together, and we aren't and won't, we're &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; fucked. It's already too late.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the new generations are so cool, why are they doing the same thing? Why are they making it sound like we're not living in a wrecked ecosystem?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I know the answer. Here it is. It's a myth that anyone has any ability to turn the ship around, or even that all of us acting collectively could turn the ship around. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The true story that I've yet to hear the NYT say, and today they had the perfect opportunity to say it, is that we're already over the cliff. The planet is ruined for life as it currently exists. It's done. Nothing to worry about. It's over. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the true true version of the story, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM0uZ9mfOUI&quot;&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from The Newsroom, which was broadcast in 2014, seven years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; forever. It was part of my blog that was wiped out in the transition in May 2017 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; to Electric Outliner and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/span&gt;. I finally had the thought to look in my previous editing system and there it was. I said this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html&quot;&gt;I want my old blog back&lt;/a&gt;. I decided that all the crazy michegas in trying to make Twitter, Medium, Facebook, the defunct &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/span&gt; that still limited what we could do with blogs, from its grave, to make all those work with my writing -- it wasn't worth it. All these limits amounted to there was nothing I could write that would make even a small subset of them happy. And no links, titles, bold, italic, or podcasts. Fuck you Facebook. What a bad netizen they are. And Twitter, although I love it, it's fucked up too. They support every damn type, video, audio, gifs, whatever -- except HTML text. What the fuck Jack. I'm out of patience with Twitter too. So in May 2017 I broke free of all that bullshit. And now four-plus years later, I'm getting ready to do more.</description>

I decided that all the crazy michegas in trying to make Twitter, Medium, Facebook, the defunct &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/span&gt; that still limited what we could do with blogs, from its grave, to make all those work with my writing -- it wasn't worth it.

			<title>From 2017, why I prefer blogging on the open web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I prefer to blog here rather than on Facebook is that if I get an Aha! idea about a feature, over here I can implement it. On Facebook I'm just a user. That was/is one of the great things about the web. Anyone can develop features for it. On Facebook, just their employees can. No wonder it never moves.#&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When a company dominates an activity, they tend to invest elsewhere. Seems kind of perverse, but that's why markets don't always evolve to fill every niche. Open platforms are more favorable. If you want to perform a new style of music in Central Park, you can. If you want to do it in Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, you need to get the approval of a lot of rich people&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been reading books this year by black cultural figures. Really informative, perspective &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;exploding&lt;/a&gt; stuff. Some great writing, like Alice Walker. And she narrates so beautifully. An interesting side-effect is that I embrace my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1425130084038545408&quot;&gt;own cultural heritage&lt;/a&gt; with more confidence.</description>

			<description>I need to create an S3 bucket that's publicly accessible over the web, so serve web content. I used to do this routinely, but not recently. They've changed it enough that I can't figure out how to do it.  BTW, I found a current tutorial and filled in the missing bit, and now my bucket is happily serving over the web.</description>

			<description>Is there a theory on why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/08/biden-infrastructure-bill-senate-502785&quot;&gt;the Repubs&lt;/a&gt; are going along with Biden's infrastructure bill? I've heard that it's their way to break away from Trump. Also thought it might be a trap, to push forward the date when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling&quot;&gt;debt ceiling&lt;/a&gt; has to be raised? Very odd.</description>

			<description>I loved everything about Alice Walker's narration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Color-Purple-Audiobook/B07LCV3R2F?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_&amp;pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&amp;pf_rd_r=ZQPG218HEYYMHVWY2V03&quot;&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/a&gt;. It's a beautiful story, and Walker has such a beautiful voice, oddly I find myself narrating my own story in my head in her voice. The book is in the form of letters between two sisters, who lead very different intertwined lives starting in the early 20th century. This has been so far a year where I have let black authors speak to me of the black perspective on life in America. I'm going to continue this exploration.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/simpleCrossNetworkScript.html&quot;&gt;Back in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, we were getting ready to simplify scripting of apps that ran on other nodes on the net. I felt there was no reason function calls should be more complicated than they need to be, just because the function was on a server. Spoiler alert, we did implement this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; and it was wonderful. Now the question is -- can we implement it in JavaScript, or will it require a pre-preprocessor, which is an option in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; since we have a very thin pre-processor. I opened a thread for discussion &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/219&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>We spend a trillion on defense, but it doesn’t protect us against Russia or the virus. Humbly suggest perhaps we‘re spending all that money preparing for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line&quot;&gt;wrong war&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>When I was in grad school I was famous for writing great error messages. That was from their point of view, and the time (mid-late 70s). From my point of view, then and now -- I was making tools that made computer science useful for people, not just better compilers and databases. My error messages &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; better, because I was writing them to try to communicate something to the user. This, at the time, was a relatively new idea. They certainly didn't teach it in CS grad school. I wonder if they do now?</description>

			<description>I completely forgot about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myRoute53&quot;&gt;Node script&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that lists all your Route 53 names, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/08/makingAmazonsDnsApiSimple.html&quot;&gt;five years ago&lt;/a&gt;. This would make a very nice addition for Drummer scripting.</description>
