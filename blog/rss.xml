			<description>Today we commemorate a horrific event &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/09.html&quot;&gt;21 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. The pandemic is orders of magnitude more devastating than that event. And it's ongoing. It's still killing massive numbers of people and destroying lives.</description>

			<description>Trump is responsible for over a million American deaths. He knew how deadly the virus is, and did nothing to protect the country. Yes, he must be punished for trying to overthrow the government, but don't forget all the American death and suffering he's responsible for.</description>

			<title>New strategy for feed text</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In the new feed management system, instead of stripping all HTML from the descriptions of feed items, we're now allowing &amp;lt;p&gt;s to get through. I want to have full text in my rivers, with a MORE icon that lets you see all the text. So the flow isn't dominated by long posts, but the text is there if you want to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I don't want all the quasi-malware that comes with feeds these days. My plan was to strip all the markup, but it really wasn't workable without the &amp;lt;p&gt; elements. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I put out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/215#issuecomment-1242749537&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt; yesterday and got two good answers. Use regex or the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html&quot;&gt;sanitize-html&lt;/a&gt; Node package. I went with the Node package. It builds on a full HTML parser, so it's legit technology, not a hack (though I was happy to use a hack, have been for years). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/11/before.png&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/11/after.png&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; in screen shots. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a good call. I thought about enabling other HTML elements, but decided to stop here for now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Recall we already have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss&quot;&gt;support for Markdown&lt;/a&gt; in the feed system. So there's an even better way for friendly feed writers to do this, rather than trying to gum things up so badly that all we can do is nuke &lt;s&gt;all&lt;/s&gt; most of the markup. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A testbed for HTML in feeds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/stripMarkupInFeedItems/source.opml&quot;&gt;link that opens in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It contains the package.json, a template file and the JS code that reads an RSS feed and produces an HTML rendering of the items in the feed after running the description text through sanitize-html with the p's removed. Once written it made it easy for me to try out a lot of different combinations for the options, but I settled on the simplest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple package&lt;/a&gt; to read the feed, and is thus a good demonstration of how easy that is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I usually would have done the work to put it into a GitHub repo, but this is a lot easier for me, because this is how I work on my code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If people can read the code in the outliner (you can!), that will make it possible for me to share a lot more code. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Tools are so important.</description>

What? Unreal. Then it came to me, this is normal. Itâ€™s why even when the temperature in California is over 100 in lots  of  places,  we're  still pumping carbon into the atmosphere. Pakistan is drowning, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Powell#21st_century_drought&quot;&gt;Lake Powell&lt;/a&gt; is drying up. Business as  usual. What was abnormal was the brief period when many made sacrifices to fight Covid.  Now we just  shrug  it  off, I guess?</description>

Pakistan is drowning, and  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Powell#21st_century_drought&quot;&gt;Lake Powell&lt;/a&gt; is drying up. Business as  usual. What was abnormal was the brief period when many made sacrifices to fight Covid.  Now we just  shrug  it  off, I guess?" created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 21:26:45 GMT" type="outline" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1567766704385581057" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/09/08.html#a212645"/>

I'd love to use it, its user interface is way better than Spectrum but -- the only way to get the Mets and Knicks games is from Spectrum. Let me know when I can watch my teams on YouTube TV and I'll be back right away.</description>

			<description>The Mets are slumping now. I haven't even looked at the standings this morning, but they are in a deep rut, and who know when or how they will come out of it. Another thing that's like developing software. Sometimes everything's clicking, you go through each step methodically, and you do lose your way but you get back on track quickly. Even a team that's booming hits into double plays. And even teams that are winning, lose no less than 1/4 of their games. The league leading hitter only gets a hit 3 out of every 10 times they come to the plate. But when it's all clicking, you want to stay in the game.</description>

			<description>If you watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/06.html#a152242&quot;&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, creating a software product is done the way the sous-chef Sydney develops a new item for their menu. If you're going for the full effect, you iterate and test, think, go back and do it all, over and over until you've struck a good balance and compromises with reality. A product goes from dream to reality in many stages. In food and software, in everything.</description>

			<title>Would you like to be a slave?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was an excellent MSNBC show about the Civil War last night. At one point they interviewed a current-day Confederate. They almost got to the best question to ask such a person, which is:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Would you like to be a slave?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear the answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I asked if, when we were in our 20s, he thought we'd live to see marijuana legalized. He gave a vague answer. I said that's it! That's how it is with Trump facing justice. I have no idea, but it &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; happen. Stranger less likely things have happened.</description>

			<description>Inside your head is a thing called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious&quot;&gt;subconscious&lt;/a&gt; that's primitive, has little understanding of the world. It mainly sees you, and projects all its memories on you. It's looking out through your eyes the same way you view the cosmos. WIth awe but little actual understanding.</description>

			<description>I had a doctor who retired recently who always referred to me as a friend. I never doubted her sincerity, and it was a really good thing to do because it reminded me at a conscious &lt;i&gt;and subconscious&lt;/i&gt; level that there was trust between us. It's a given. If you can't trust your doctor, you need to get a new doctor. So I've started to do that in my own mind as I narrate projects to myself. Okay that's done &lt;i&gt;my friend. &lt;/i&gt;Let's figure out what's next friend. &lt;i&gt;My friend&lt;/i&gt; this is a hard problem. I just add the punctuation to remind myself that I trust myself, I'm doing something I'm good at, and know it. It really does manage the mood of my subconscious, it's reassuring. I got this, really means &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; got this.</description>

			<title>The Knicks are the un-Nets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People think so linearly about the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few players out there with the potential of Donovan Mitchell to lead a team to dynasty. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Think of what the Knicks have to offer a potential trader. The Knicks bench is filled with potential like few others are. We've got a stockpile of draft picks. And the Knicks and the Garden and the talent are starting to get interesting to players. Like the way they want to go to Duke or Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Knicks are the un-Nets. The Knicks are building, not trying to buy a post-season powerhouse.  Look where that approach got the Nets. What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://netswire.usatoday.com/2022/09/03/shaquille-oneal-agrees-that-nets-star-kevin-durants-career-is-a-failure/&quot;&gt;mess&lt;/a&gt;! ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So sit tight, this is not the end of the dream of what those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/knicks/roster&quot;&gt;kids on the bench&lt;/a&gt; could become. They can become lots of things, not just Donovan Mitchell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

He's saying the things I've been thinking about the news, how the business really works, from the inside, the things they will never say on CNN or MSNBC. Plus he's incredibly funny. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the things he won't say about I Heart Radio, the company that owns his podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They are the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Clear+Channel&quot;&gt;Clear Channel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/clear-channel-communications-inc-history/&quot;&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; dominant force in broadcast radio and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=clear+channel+billboards&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZ39eBjyVCa1XTI5iai3tHDrUwBNQ:1662226537560&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiitrqylPn5AhUbGFkFHdqKDZUQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&amp;biw=1549&amp;bih=1000&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;outdoor advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They would probably love to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, but they aren't so all their podcasts available &quot;where ever you get your podcasts,&quot; my favorite phrase that I will never get tired of hearing. (I own that, I made sure podcasts would be that way.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I Heart Radio hopes to stop saying that at some point. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how much they pay Olbermann or if it depends on whether they can lock it down?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All that said, listen while it's not behind a paywall, it's wonderful Golden Age of Podcasting stuff. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

Instead they'll groom their own superstars. There are so many good young prospects already playing for the Knicks. Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, RJ, Sims. This is team, the one they already have, is worth being patient for. And the current Knicks management, by hanging tough, remains a powerhouse for future deals and there will be more deals. Mitchell is a fine player, but far from the only one.</description>
