			<description>I spend an awful lot of money on video entertainment and receive very little in return. There were many months I paid for HBO but didn't watch a single thing on it. I paid for Showtime, but I think there were whole &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; that I never watched anything there. I'd love to re-watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-knick&quot;&gt;an HBO show&lt;/a&gt; that I recommended to a friend (and am hereby recommend to you) but I'd have to re-sub to watch it legally. Couldn't I just use one of those months in the past where I watched nothing but paid anyway? Okay so they need so much money for the lavish productions of new stuff. Maybe they could price their archives separately? How about that. Anything more than 10 years old say, you can have for $1 a month, and do a bundling deal where I can get everything that's 10 years or older from any of the majors for $10 a month. Problem is they'd find they have a glut of good stuff. We don't really need that much more. The whole thing is grossly out of whack. BTW, I did sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/19.html#a125040&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt;, only to find out they don't have an app for my LG TV, which is a whole other rant, why exactly do there have to be special apps for every TV. (Yes I know the answer, but I'm asking at a deeper level. Thank you.) I thought I might watch the Knicks, but there was an inauguration, and I had my Covid vaccine, and it made me tired, I think, so instead I just went to bed.</description>

			<title>Twenty years ago in podcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ericnuzum&quot;&gt;Eric Nuzum&lt;/a&gt; for writing this &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/article/first-podcast-feed-history&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml&quot;&gt;first podcast feed&lt;/a&gt;, about the project I did in January 2001, twenty years ago. The feed he writes about was used to test software I had developed that reads podcast feeds, otherwise known as a podcatcher. The feed was a small effort compared to the software that reads podcast feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few people on Twitter have criticized Eric's story, they say it was wrong, but actually &lt;i&gt;he got it right.&lt;/i&gt; That's why it's always a good idea to hedge a bit when you say someone is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay first, a nit -- the idea that Chris Lydon had the first real podcast is not true. There were a couple of others that predate his Radio Open Source -- Doug Kaye's IT Conversations and Steve Gillmor's Gillmor Gang. They were doing MP3-based radio when we came out with the podcast format, and they quickly adopted it. I've written about them here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+%22IT+Conversations%22+%22Gillmor+Gang%22&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt;. Lydon's podcast was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/02/21/cbcsOriginStoryOfPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; I had a role in producing. I've shrugged off the distinction a few times, because Chris was the first who showed up to play in my sandbox, and that, to me, was worth a lot. I learned from his experience, a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My UserLand on the Desktop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's where Nuzum got it right and his critics are wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In early 2001, after meeting with Adam in New York, which Nuzum documents, I produced a daily feed of Grateful Dead songs. I don't think the RIAA would have had a problem with it (as Nuzum jokingly says) because the Dead had a culture of letting their users do what they like with their music. I thought it was completely appropriate that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=320&amp;v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&quot;&gt;Heart of Gold Band&lt;/a&gt; would play a role in bootstrapping the new medium. I created the feed to test my new podcatcher. Here's the story of that software, whcih is also documented in the archive of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, at UserLand, we created a product called My UserLand, to compete with Netscape's My Netscape. Both were server-based RSS reader apps. This was the very beginning of RSS being used as a news publishing format. Then a we created a desktop version of My UserLand called, unimaginatively, My UserLand On The Desktop or MUOTD for short. It did what the server-based product did, but it ran as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;app on a user's desktop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Grateful Dead podcast feed was there to test the podcatcher functionality in MUOTD.&lt;/i&gt; That predated Adam's iPodder by over three years. Adam used it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;MUOTD was later merged with Radio UserLand, a desktop blogging tool, creating something that has yet to be matched by anyone -- a desktop blogging and reading app, all in one. It was pretty cool. I'm pretty sure the guys who later formed Twitter used it. It was more or less Twitter on the desktop, based on RSS, five years before Twitter. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was all part of an idea I loved that I called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers&lt;/a&gt;. MUOTD and Radio UserLand were full powered web servers that ran on the user's machine. Most probably weren't even aware they were running a server, because the user interface was so smooth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; for Scripting News for January 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/jerrySingsForMe.gif&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of MUOTD from 1/11/2001.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351992214344388610&quot;&gt;got&lt;/a&gt; my Covid vaccine today. I was really lucky, I had signed up to be notified from a local pharmacy, and I got their email last night a few minutes after they sent it. Signed up right away and at 3PM today I got my first dose of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/19/a-side-by-side-comparison-of-the-pfizer-biontech-and-moderna-vaccines/&quot;&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. So far no side-effects. Two life-changing events in one day. Not bad! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/podcasts/the-daily/trump-supporters-biden-transition-capitol-riot.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. They interview Trump voters about the Capitol invasion/insurrection. Lots to think about. Here's what I'd like to tell people who support Trump and feel like invading the Capitol and killing people was kind of okay. We didn't like Trump. We protested. But no one invaded the Capitol and no one killed anyone because we didn't like the result of the election. Also, we do a really good job with elections in the US. The best in the world by some accounts. So if you say our election was bad, you'd better have some facts to back you up, or seriously shut the fuck up. What I've heard so far is totally lame. And if you think you're the good guys, well, it doesn't seem to me you are. It seems you're bullies. You think what the rest of us, the majority of us, think doesn't matter. You get your way even if you're the minority. That is un-American as hell.</description>

			<description>On this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/howlongfortrump/&quot;&gt;last full day&lt;/a&gt; of Trump's presidency, I am grappling with an inconsequential decision. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351299875791634486&quot;&gt;CNN vs the Knicks&lt;/a&gt;. I can have one of them, but if I want both it'll cost me an extra $65 per month. If I felt strongly about either, or both, the decision would be easy. It's difficult only because I'm somewhat ambivalent about each. CNN is for mindless relaxation. I like watching Wolf Blitzer because he's so pompous. &quot;This &lt;i&gt;just in&lt;/i&gt; to the Situation Room,&quot; he likes to say, but of course it's a studio not a room, and nothing is &quot;in&quot; there. It's the most old and stuffy place. It's totally out. I find it relaxing the same way I used to find it relaxing to watch my grandmother knit, or my cat lick herself. I like watching Erin Burnett because (I know this is weird) I think she's hot. Esp when she's angry, and these days, she is very angry, a lot (at the same things we all are angry about btw). I also like CNN because they have better guests. But I could live without them. For 20+ years I never watched CNN. Then there are the Knicks. I've been a Knicks fan, on and off, for most of my life. I came back strong for Linsanity, and hated them for screwing that up, and then they fired Melo and Porzingas, well I kind of gave up for a while. The pandemic and the bubble made it seem illegit. But with a new coach this year, they're looking interestings, and they're competitive, and sometimes they win! I'd like a chance to watch, not sure I would actually watch. The sports news service Fubo doesn't have CNN, and YouTube TV has CNN but no Knicks. So I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351299875791634486&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; to find out what people thought. As I write this the consensus is to leave CNN and go with the Knicks. I think it's time for a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_la_carte&quot;&gt;Ã  la carte&lt;/a&gt; menu. Most of what's on either Fubo or YouTube TV doesn't interest me. Too many good choices on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, and podcasts are great these days too.</description>

			<description>I think the people who invaded the Capitol are telling the truth when they say Trump told them to do it. But that's not all. Trump made them feel special. They were one of a few thousand people that he trusted to set this right. It may not be logical, but the people in the videos seemed drunk. From the recognition from god. The ProPublic videos show that, at the demonstration. They actually called him god. Trump. The scene in the Senate from the New Yorker video, sounded like what I think a hospital for the insane would. Where was their sense of self. DId they think they would get away with it? Why would they think that? Hard to imagine someone could be so far from reality.</description>

			<description>Here's why you need super lightweight easy to deploy networking interfaces. So you can quickly create connections between apps when the idea occurs to you, when you have the need. Then you can use it, and then you have experience using the 1-in-10 idea that's so good to want to further develop, when you develop it for real. That's why your second version of something is so much better than the first, and the third version is good enough for other people to use (even though we make them use the first two versions anyway). The idea we had, for connecting apps on a single machine, back in the mid-80s was right. It has been a big part of the evolution of every layer since. (And probably before, I just wasn't around during those evolutions.) I mention this because in less than 10 minutes I whipped up a connection between two worlds I'm working on, and watched the newer app update based on a ping from my older app. Ping! It &quot;just worked&quot; and if you're a programmer you know how satisfying that can be.</description>

I mention this because in less than 10 minutes I whipped up a connection between two worlds I'm working on, and watched the newer app update based on a ping from my older app. Ping! It &quot;just worked&quot; and if you're a programmer you know how satisfying that can be." created="Mon, 18 Jan 2021 16:02:35 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/05/29/sanders.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/18.html#a160235"/>

			<description>I've been working, in slow mode, on a new feature for my outliners, tagging. I saw a similar idea in action with &lt;a href=&quot;https://roamresearch.com/&quot;&gt;Roam Research's&lt;/a&gt; outliner, and thought it was a really nice idea. I always want to save references to my notes in a cumulative index, like the index in the back of a book. This has always been a good companion to the fluid hierarchy, the outline structure which is more like the table of contents in front of a book. Only when you're working electronically, there isn't really a middle. Everything is in both places, at the same time. It's ideas like this that make programmers' eyes glaze over. They start using words like orthogonal, or loosely connected, and of course the always welcome &quot;distributed.&quot; Really having fun programming the last week or so. As the world is falling apart. Why not? It's not like any of us are getting out of this alive. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>White supremacy is the crisis in the US. There was confusion after 9/11 if we were at war, and now it's even more confusing. What's not confusing is that both events were Acts of War. If I were white, and I am, I'd want to have a way to clearly say I am not with them.</description>

			<title>Good morning everybody</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a weird feeling in the world right now. Tomorrow is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day&quot;&gt;national holiday&lt;/a&gt;, and Wednesday is Inauguration Day. No matter what, things will change radically in the US in the next few days.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got an answer to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/16.html#a170934&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; I asked yesterday, about who 20K+ troops in DC will report to, until Biden is sworn in. By law they report to the commander-in-chief, President Trump. Just a fact. If Trump orders them to assassinate everyone at the inauguration, it's not all that different from what Trump told the mob to do on January 6. So unfortunately it is in the realm of possibility.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It all hinges on who the troops are loyal to. Turns out the military thought of that, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2021/01/troops-inauguration-pre-screened-extremism-says-dc-guard-commander/171456/&quot;&gt;pre-screened&lt;/a&gt; the soldiers assigned to this job to weed out white supremacists. I kid you not. They know how to do that? I guess it would be naive for them not to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a nightmareish vision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Anwar_Sadat&quot;&gt;Anwar Sadat's assassination&lt;/a&gt; in 1981. If you haven't seen it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKu-u-W5J84&quot;&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;. You've never seen anything like it, even in a movie or TV show.  As they &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/16.html#a170600&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;, this is why you want to have programmers around, we think about these things. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read last night that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/01/pentagon-wont-throw-traditional-farewell-ceremony-trump/171408/&quot;&gt;the Pentagon turned Trump down&lt;/a&gt; for a great military send-off on Wednesday morning. Interesting, are they allowed to do that? No one seems to be questioning it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if it goes smoothly and the Bidens end up running the government on Thursday, and recinding Trump's orders, the tension goes down a lot. We still have to deal with Trump, and Republicans, but really if they could just STFU our real business is with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the usual mottos apply, Let's Have Fun, Still diggin, and It's not like anyone gets out of this alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

While I was growing up, we went to space. I remember the Mercury and Gemini missions, and I was 14 years old when we landed on the moon. When there are catastrophes elsewhere in the world, America helps them dig out. We can do this. It will be a great thing to be reminded of our capabilities. We've spent the last four years losing. We need a win. This one is a slam dunk.</description>

			<description>There are 20K troops in DC. Who do they take orders from? Do they think Biden won, or it was stolen from Trump. How many of them believe in the peaceful transfer of power. The question really is, who is the individual cop or soldier loyal to. Since the Civil War, as far as I know, this has not been in question.</description>

			<description>I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/15/memoTrump.png&quot;&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; at the home page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt; this morning, wondering how journalism would adjust to not having a daily Trump story (or more) to obsess over. How will everyone else deal with that. What will Maddow talk about every night? The fear factor should diminish, one would hope. Former presidents have much less power than sitting presidents. Trump could be the exception. They will have plenty to write about. First the impeachment. The trials of the January 6 insurrectionists. Trump's trials, bankruptcy. Trump going to jail? One can hope. Will this be good for Biden? For us? I don't know. The Democrats need to get a great online organizing machine rolling, for more than raising money and getting out votes. We need to have healthy forms of political action, to balance out the evil kind, which we're seeing so much of. Say what you will about Trump, he did organize an active base. The Democrats could too, but they don't seem to know it. Same as it always was.</description>

			<description>Come to think about it, Maddow will have plenty to talk about as details of how Trump and his associates hollowed out and looted the US government while they were in office. We'll be finding smoking holes in the ground for decades to come. Things that used to work that no longer exist. So if you need a nightly story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-american-carnage.html&quot;&gt;American carnage&lt;/a&gt;, you will be well taken care of.</description>

			<description>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510771928010753&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from the Wednesday about the &quot;significant ramifications&quot; of banning Trump from Twitter. In the thread he talks about Twitter funding an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992&quot;&gt;open decentralized standard&lt;/a&gt; for social networks called Blue Sky. I remember when they announced this in 2019, I think I offered to help then, and I offered again today. Creating an open distributed system at Twitter's scale is an ambitious undertaking.</description>

			<description>There are, as far as I know, two places to get a Covid vaccine in Ulster County, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.ulstercountyny.gov/vaccine-resource-center/&quot;&gt;county itself&lt;/a&gt; in Kingston and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drnealsmoller.com/vax&quot;&gt;Village Apothecary&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. Neither are making appointments now, but you can register to be notified when they are.

			<title>Roku's UI?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think Roku is an incredible product. The remote is the best. The UI is great. On screens that integrate it, where Roku is the OS, it's even better. It's how screens should work, imho. I called it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;Entertainment Desktop&lt;/a&gt; in April 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's something I've heard a lot -- Roku's user interface &quot;needs work.&quot; Or it's old-looking, dated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I don't get it. Compared to what? It seems pretty good to me, and I've spent decades thinking about and working on interfaces for stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Remember iTunes?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Nets traded for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30706097/sources-houston-rockets-trade-james-harden-brooklyn-nets&quot;&gt;James Harden&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top stars in the NBA. They gave up most of their draft picks, so their future looks pretty grim. And they now have two of the most worst-attitude players in the NBA in Kyrie Irving and Harden. Not sure about Durant. But I wonder how many games Kyrie is going to play this year, when ball-hog Harden is on the court. Maybe he can lead the second team. Somehow the power has to gravitate away from the stars, and back to the teams. In the meantime, it's kind of a blessing for the Knicks that none of the superstars want to play there. That way every victory feels earned. The team has a spirit. Of course they have egos, but none so dominant as the ones who now play for Brooklyn. Now I just wish I could watch the Knicks for less than $65 a month, which is a ripoff that I refuse to pay.</description>
