			<description>Something I learned from reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811&quot;&gt;Elie Mystal's book&lt;/a&gt;. The Second Amendment’s original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-slave-owners-dictated-the-language-of-the-2nd-amendment&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; was to enable slavers in Virginia to put down a slave rebellion without depending on the federal government. It wasn't put in the Constitution so people could protect themselves against robbers, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, and if appropriate there could be laws that allow it specifically. But it isn't really a Constitutional right.</description>

			<title>A Wordle hack</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/20/wordleResult.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; is an addictive word game that became popular and then was bought by the NY Times. It's free to play, as far as I know (I have a NYT subscription so if it weren't free it's possible I might not know). The diagram to the right is a standard, produced by the game. It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's the hack...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you know the second and third letters, as above, and have eliminated a fair number of consonants, and are sure the first letter is a consonant…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Type one of the eligable consonants and the next two letters into a web browser and check out the auto completes. Repeat. That's how I figured out the answer to today's puzzle after I got to the situation in the third line. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty consistently getting the answer in four steps. In the first two steps I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just gathering data. By the third, I constrain my guess by the information I've gathered so far, assuming I've got one or two hits.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this case I got two green squares on the first one. I thought for sure I'd get the answer in three instead of four, but I hadn't eliminated enough consonants to be able to puzzle it out. I was surprised by how hard it was after step three, mostly because (I think) this was a weird word, letter-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Defending your right to ruin people's lives seems really weird. Why not defend your right to love other people? I don't get people who get pleasure out of hurting others. I certainly don't respect that.</description>

			<title>The NYT editorial is a good sign</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't have a lot of time to write this morning but I wanted to get this out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, my goal for the web has always been that I want the bright minds to be on the web, sharing important stuff that comes from what they do. These people would be considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; in journalism, not reporters. I've been working on this since I first started using the web as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;writing platform&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that keeps bright minds from fully expressing their ideas on the web is the sense that it's a savage place, where people cut you down, make your life miserable, possibly lose you your standing, even your job. So they don't take the step.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This idea comes from journalism. From organizations like the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They paint us all with the same brush. They talk about us as monsters. All the same. They don't listen. Only their ideas get out. Reporters are easily fooled, we've learned, with great cost for all of us. Journalism says Facebook sucks, a lot, and that scares some of my neighbors from using Facebook, and keeps us from making connections that would make things work better on a local level. We need more of that. Journalism has stood in the way of good uses of the web. Maybe they don't know they've been doing it, but they have been doing it just the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when a big influential organization like the NYT says, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;its official voice&lt;/a&gt;, that this is a problem, and presumably we should do something about it, I see that as huge progress. We have an ally in organizing our knowlege and passion, the good stuff of human intelect, with their support, instead with their derision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I am so sad when I see people who already have mastered the tools predictably try to put the NYT down for noticing this problem which &lt;i&gt;all of them know about, &lt;/i&gt;I'm sure of it. So who has the old idea and who has the new one? Who's wired and who's tired?  In my mind, the NYT has made a breakthrough. I love it. Build on it. Bring that philosophy into the NYT itself. Look for the good on the web, not just the mean stuff. Set the example. I think the light will come on for others, not all of them, some are too dug in, but progress can be made here, I feel it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Save me the lecture about the First Amendment. I go way back with the fight against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;CDA&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. You use the First Amendment as a hammer, the same way the gun lobby uses the Second Amendment. I see you as exactly like them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I used one of my montly gifts as a NYT subscriber to provide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DODm8SiOMNAo6B_EGKbqNlbNY3mj-GQMNcKrJqSuZ_w6pEJ0FgQAntupyAnNIFPyAx48qVb18B4qjsD_o-4CO4KS6wMvt-z7my-E_cO2PoXPGPzSErIQ16pZRgIEX52ScI2qzPR7Ny3YR_ia9yBotoBmtVPFn8tPPrDhl7O9mUPFqLukRtBbYvCXyElsWc6rkAbAxTFVrNKXt-6m03499fU8gFaOe9d1VzPZqj3shCTzBgP4yrBJYuRoXLl7QMsbTFqhyEzMLe1Oz9dYCNcFG1TG9VoeW7P86L&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;link to the editorial&lt;/a&gt;. The link should go through the paywall. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Much like the update I did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; last year. Really simple sample code. It was time to pull together the code I use to parse feeds these days in JavaScript apps and publish it as open source. It builds on Dan MacTough's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; package, so it inherits its support of different feed formats: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, Atom and RDF. The result is what developers want in 2022. A simple JavaScript object containing the information in a feed and nothing more. One system call to parse it. Works like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse&quot;&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a simple feed reader could be built. Or any other feed-consuming software. I felt it was time to try to bring this together, enough time has passed, don't you think? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>My two cents: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1504807644963479562&quot;&gt;The NYT Editorial Board is correct&lt;/a&gt;. We all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/220318/p17#a220318p17&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt; what we say to avoid all kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tsuris&quot;&gt;tsuris&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it's cops at your house in SWAT gear, guns drawn, responding to a call there's been a murder. Or a knock on the door from a stranger, saying they just wanted to know if this is where you live. It could be a small thing, or it could drive you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape&quot;&gt;out of business&lt;/a&gt;. The key point is people hold back what they think because they don't want the drama or danger that would come from expressing the idea. The rebuttals are stale. Heard them for decades. It doesn't change the fact that there's important ideas not being exchanged. And we need the best minds, with the freshest ideas to deal with the issues of the day.  And btw this kind of suppression is just as effective as what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/08/florida-senate-approves-dont-say-gay-bill-00015120&quot;&gt;Repubs are doing&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, for example. Think about that, and look in the mirror. You aren't that different from them.</description>

			<title>How to get the public writing system we want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw comments from two noted journalism thinkers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/jeff.jarvis/posts/10158648424506905&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/1504459556939776004&quot;&gt;Mathew Ingram&lt;/a&gt; saying more or less the same thing. It's amazing to me, because it's the flipside of what I've been wanting to do for years -- develop software for writers and thinkers without trapping them into a tech industry business model. Today the software is inexpensive to make and operate. That isn't the problem, we know how to make the software, the problem is attracting a critical mass of users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a way to do it. The challenge is not making the software, it's getting the users have to show up. What will convince them to use a system that lets them write for free, gives them a permanent archive of their writing so they don't get locked in and lets them use whatever writing tools they like? I can't convince them on my own. I'm not famous enough, trusted enough, or whatever. When I do it, it doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I think would work is to get the support of foundations. Then, with the resources, hire professional testers to be sure that as we add features, the software keeps working. Use some of the money to hire a real PR firm to pitch the idea to pubs, tell writers we want to make the tools they want, without the gotchas. But wait to pitch until there's something they can actually sign on to and use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I was at Berkman, a very long time ago, we tried to get support from the tech industry, AOL, Microsoft, Apple, Google -- but they wanted to do this stuff themselves. Now I'd suggest asking the Knight Foundation, Newmark, MacArthur, not sure who else. This is far from my area of expertise. And it's not the money we need so much, but the endorsement. Grants would say: We looked at the idea and the people involved, and thought it was worth creating the service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The users are the key. They have to trust it. Just going out straight, as a pitch -- well I've tried it. The problem is they expect software they use to come from VC-backed companies or huge multinationals. The foundations invest in projects at news orgs that are more proof-of-concept than actual systems people can use. This project would be different, its goal would be to get a public system up and running, cloneable, free to use, with features competitive with Medium and Substack. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Summary: Foundations acting as VCs, to get specific production software built to enable reliable and open systems to flourish, where the VCs always have gotchas, these projects would be guaranteed not to have them. The only ROI is the system itself, developed and up and running and freely clonable. No business model, guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This project would be different, its goal would be to get a public system up and running, cloneable, free to use, with features competitive with Medium and Substack." created="Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:24:18 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/17/141759.html?title=howToGetThePublicWritingSystemWeWant#a142418"/>
				<source:outline text="Summary: Foundations acting as VCs, to get specific production software built to enable reliable and open systems to flourish, where the VCs always have gotchas, these projects would be guaranteed not to have them. The only ROI is the system itself, developed and up and running and freely clonable. No business model, guaranteed." created="Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:25:28 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/17/141759.html?title=howToGetThePublicWritingSystemWeWant#a142528"/>

Also why I wanted to be at Harvard in 2003. And how lucky it was that Chris was there too. I ramble a lot, if you listen to me, you know that.

			<description>I can’t imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2022/3/16/22980192/lebron-james-knee-soreness-injury-swelling-video-medical-explainer-lakers-video&quot;&gt;Lebron&lt;/a&gt; has any fans left after he’s dumped so many teams. It’s not just that he wins championships, it’s that he leaves behind wrecks. Fans don’t want to win as much as we want to love. I’m glad he never chose the Knicks. I can’t imagine another team accepting LeBron unless he swears he will leave the team in better condition than he found it. That would be something worth giving a try. Go to Orlando, for example, and don’t bring any stars with you, just work. And do it for a dollar a year. Then there will be at least some goodwill for you going forward.</description>

			<description>I wrote something the other day that bears repeating. &quot;When you read something, you're not in touch with the author's emotions, not when they wrote it, and esp not now, long after they wrote it. Emotions are fluid things, and unless you're very careful, it's unlikely that the emotions you are feeling, as you read the piece, are the author's. It would be a remarkable coincidence if they were.

I hope people who get other electric cars have a similar experience. It's just such a smooth ride, and so much power.

			<description>At one point in the ride I was shuffling podcasts and thinking this is too dangerous and then I remembered I'm driving a car that theoretically can drive itself. So I clicked the right stick down twice to activate the driving functionality and took my hands off the steering wheel. I talked to the car as if it were a 17-year-old learning to drive, giving it encouragement and preparing to take over when it started to drive off the road. Something weird happened, it started flashing red, and then really started flashing red, which I interpreted as &quot;I can't handle this, you take over, Mr Human.&quot; Which I did. But I was driving on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_209&quot;&gt;US 209&lt;/a&gt;, basically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9641439,-74.0222502,3a,75y,200.84h,80.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D284.48877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;, two lanes in each direction, divided, lots of room everywhere, good weather, well marked lanes.

			<description>I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/a-new-nuclear-age/&quot;&gt;latest Open Source podcast&lt;/a&gt;. You must listen to this one. It's about the new reality of nuclear war. Chris Lydon talks to all the most interesting academics, and it's clear they really like and respect him. If you watch MSNBC, skip Rachel Maddow one night every week and listen to Chris and his guests. I think they should put him on TV with exactly the same guests as he has now, and let him cover exactly what he covers. It's much higher quality than anything you get from any other source. Swear to god. It's for adults, smart ones. It's not a bedtime story (and that's a good thing).</description>

If you watch MSNBC, skip Rachel Maddow one night every week and listen to Chris and his guests. I think they should put him on TV with exactly the same guests as he has now, and let him cover exactly what he covers. It's much higher quality than anything you get from any other source. Swear to god. It's for adults, smart ones. It's not a bedtime story (and that's a good thing)." created="Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:34:54 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/03/15.html#a153454"/>

			<description>So I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how I have really good friends for a long time who have never used an outliner, and somehow must think they understand me at some level, when they just can't. Imagine for example you had a friend who was a guitar player. Not the most famous or best ever, but still someone who had devoted their life to creating music with guitars. And then imagine not only had you not listened to your friend playing the guitar, but you hadn't listened to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; play a guitar. You didn't know what a guitar was. You sent them a link to a story about someone humming while driving and asked if it was like that. That's been my experience. I live with it. But I've never liked it. My software actually isn't hard to learn, at least not compared to other software like Twitter, Facebook, a word processor, an ATM. It's a low-grade source of frustration. Most days I write stuff on this blog and hear back nothing. But it seems some people read it. I just write for myself. I think I'm going to go back to doing that with software too. 2021 was an exceptional year, I decided to devote the whole year to creating a real end-user piece of software -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I never hear anything nice about it. Mostly from people who refuse to read the docs complaining that they don't know how to do something that's covered in the docs. This isn't what I had in mind when I spent all of last year building the product and writing excellent docs.</description>

			<description>Another example. I probably spent in total a whole month doing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2022/01/23/153755.html?title=howToUseTreechartFromDrummer&quot;&gt;Tree Chart&lt;/a&gt; app. Two comments. One saying they wanted more features, and another from a semi-famous person who said he missed MORE, so I pointed him to Drummer. He complained that the tree chart part of Drummer wasn't as good as MORE's and that's it. Nothing beyond that. I wonder if people know how much effort it takes to create something like this (obviously they don't) or are willing to invest anything at all in helping? Obviously not that either. So I think the only way to go is to create software for a market of one -- me -- and leave it at that. Maybe I'll share some of it, maybe I won't. It's a lot of extra work to share it, and from my point of view, the work is an utter waste of time. Basically most people are selfish assholes. I think the Beatles felt this way about their fans too. I've been learning so much about them this year. But at least we all listened to their music, even if we had no idea who they were, and how they created the music.</description>

			<description>A few months ago I read a comment on Twitter, not directed to me but with my name tagged, that said that RSS will be able to move again once Dave Winer is dead. Isn't that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwoUKhZQbg&quot;&gt;special&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure that's not true btw, but to be thought of as only contributing obstruction. I think it's like that in a lot of things I've worked on. People have tried to buy my products away from me, not realizing I still owned them. That was comedy. Other people, supposed friends, told me they were taking over, I should get out of their way or I'd get hurt. The first couple of times that happened, from someone who was very rich, I fell for it. It wasn't true. His products were flops because he had no idea what people valued in the products. I did because I had connections with the users and I listened, systematically. At LVT we got very good at listening, we knew in advance that new releases would be loved because were simply giving the users what they wanted. Once another rich guy offered me $1 million for my company or he was going to blow me out of the water (his words). Yeah I said, i've heard that before. Go right ahead. He never shipped anything even remotely competitive. BTW, our product was making more than $1 million &lt;i&gt;a month&lt;/i&gt; at the time. He didn't even bother to get the numbers. All this says to me is that &lt;i&gt;we should fucking work together dammit. &lt;/i&gt;Look at the Beatles and how individually they reached out to other musicians and recorded with them. Why don't we do that in software. If there's going to be more RSS, why shouldn't it benefit from what I've learned? You might be surprised to find that a new RSS can't happen &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; I am involved, Mr Waiting For Me To Die. Why take the chance? I didn't save the tweet because I didn't want to ever close that loop. Imagine how that felt. The world is full of self-important assholes, and we've given every one of them tools to express their assholyness. You can quote me on that.</description>

			<description>Putin was probably inspired by Dubya and his shock and awe, but too bad for Putin he didn’t have America’s arms industry and wealth. So no one was very awed at Putin’s shocking depravity. Whatever punishment he gets should also be applied to the Americas war criminals, Bush, Cheney, Powell etc.</description>

			<description>This subject comes up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/&quot;&gt;Ben Thompson's latest newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, which he has kindly given me a free subscription to.

The occasion is their releasing an iOS version of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; reader. Since Substack is VC-funded, I am suspicious of their support for RSS. I expect there's lock-in in there. But I don't have the time or actual interest to dig in and find out what they did. I know they require you to use their editor to publish through their channel. When they came out I was looking for a way to distribute this blog via email, so I asked if they supported inbound RSS. No. You have to use their editor. Well I had been through that with Facebook and Medium and was fed up with software turning me into a typist. As with most writers, I have a writing setup that I'm happy with, and I'm not going to change all that just to get an email delivery system. I wrote my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;emailer&lt;/a&gt;. I wish we had a good way to offer that to everyone, but that takes time that I don't have. And frankly some users aren't adult enough to deal well with gifts. So writers who want to distribute via email are getting locked in. So it goes.</description>

A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/14/fatRussianMcDonaldsFan.png&quot;&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt; Russian man named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikas_Safronov&quot;&gt;Nikas Safronov&lt;/a&gt; chains himself to a closed Moscow McDonald's, fighting for his right to a cheeseburger. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have the right to close down!” he protests.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Wikipedia he &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/14/safronov.png&quot;&gt;looks&lt;/a&gt; like a rock star. Seriously. If this is what we did to Russia, well I understand now what we're looking at. That could be Lincoln, Nebraska -- if they lost their Wendy's or Boston if they cut off the internet. We need to turn our attention to the people of Ukraine, and observe the difference. The future demands our determination. We are failing the test. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Putin, Trump, Boris Johnson, they're all the same disease. To break free and get our species on track, we need to face ourselves.

			<description>The Allman Brothers are great for workouts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rQWh62VUHE&quot;&gt;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&lt;/a&gt; is on the speaker now. I have my Apple Watch hooked up to my Peloton so I'm getting readouts on my heart rate. I'm starting to really enjoy the daily indoor rides. Pretty soon I'll be riding outdoors too.</description>

This material should be streamed, just like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; video was. The anthology incredibly long, includes interviews with all the Beatles. Goes through the whole history, in great detail, with concert performances that I had never seen, didn't even know existed. It's even more clear that the Beatles didn't &quot;break up&quot; as much as they stayed together for a long time. You get the sense of how exhausted they must've been of being a Beatle. This goes back to something I've learned myself in a career that included more than the normal amount of public presence. We all are just individual people, no matter how big the rep. It doesn't get much bigger than being a Beatle. But it doesn't really have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; to be a Beatle, because a human can't be that big. The disconnext has to be resolved somehow. We're all the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;size&lt;/a&gt;. Something has to give.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=get%20back&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; recording session comes off as a catastrophe in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/13.html#a203829&quot;&gt;Beatles Anthology&lt;/a&gt;. Harrison tells a great story of how it compared to a session he had just come back from with Bob Dylan and the Band in Woodstock. I think the Beatles got lost trying to do more than what they were best at -- which is hanging out in a studio for a couple of months and turning the music world upside down in a great way. McCartney at one point says we're just a small band, we do rock and roll and the blues. So why were they doing movies and having boutiques and planning big concerts where the fans were kept far away. I wish, as a fan, they had found a way to continue doing what they did so well, and branch out and do all the other stuff they wanted to do as individuals. If they had had a good manager, someone who loved them and who could manage an organization and keep it out of their way, the Beatles might have been able to do more. But I'm still satisfied that the amazing thing was that they lasted as long as they did.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; was down for a few hours this morning, I think the problem was related to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daylight%20saving&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Daylight Saving Time&lt;/a&gt; change. The problem started exactly at the time of the switchover. Could be a coincidence. Probably isn't. I rebooted the server and it seems to be running normally.</description>
