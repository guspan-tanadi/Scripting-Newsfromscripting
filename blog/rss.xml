			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1374827994057949190&quot;&gt;asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; last night for a clear statement of the case against Stallman. Not much came back, certainly not the dispassionate point by point statement with links to actual evidence that should be required minimally, to destroy someone's life. This routine destruction, without any process, that's the greater sickness imho.</description>

			<title>Drummer's key innovation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on yesterday's news about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, its key innovation is that you can write JavaScript code that's much simpler because it does not need to use callbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dns.getDomainName (dns.getDottedId (&lt;a href=&quot;http://liveblog.co/&quot;&gt;liveblog.co&lt;/a&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This works even though both DNS operations do I/O.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are using JavaScript's threading, we are not blocking the CPU. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A programmer in any other language will be scratching their head wondering what's the big deal. I know. I've been saying that for years. If Python can do this, I don't see why JavaScript shouldn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: JavaScript as spec'd &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; do this. But we were able to make this work with a very simple pre-processor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is a callback?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I looked around for a decent explanation of JavaScript callbacks, but they take too long to get to the point, or they never explain what they are. Maybe it's too hard to explain? I've been writing a lot of docs lately, so let me try! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Callbacks are used when an operation is going to take a long time and your program wants to do other things while it's waiting. So you create a function to run when the operation is done, and provide that function to the slow operation you're calling with the intent that it will call this function when it's done. Thus it is a &lt;i&gt;callback&lt;/i&gt; function. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;fs.readFile (&quot;notes.txt&quot;, function (err, filetext) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if (err) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;console.log (err.message);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;else {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;console.log (&quot;The file contains &quot; + filetext.length + &quot; characters.&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;});&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;console.log (&quot;Hi mom!&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look in the console, you'll see:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hi mom!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The file contains 28 characters.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example of a real world callback. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After you upload a video to Facebook, you'll get a dialog when the upload is done saying this is going to take a bit of time to process, so we'll let you know when it's done. In the meantime you can read stuff. When the video is ready, you get a message saying you can watch the video now. That's the basic flow of a callback. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>When Medium shrugs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; has been around since 2011, getting pretty close to ten years, and in that time, they have switched business strategies many times. The appear to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81&quot;&gt;done it again&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/#a210323p19&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. So here's another opportunity to take stock of writing on the web, and where we have been and what could change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, I got a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1374541139970260996&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; from Jay Rosen thanking me for pushing him to keep his own web presence, to not depend on any of the platforms. It's gratifying to see a longtime friend doing so well with this approach.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jay then sent me a link to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jabberwocking.com/why-have-blog-audiences-declined-over-the-past-decade/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Drum asking why blogging has declined in the past decade. I think there's more to it than what Drum says, that the disappearance of Google Reader, while it certainly hurt the cause, is only part of the puzzle. The problem is that I can't write on my blog and share it with the popular publishing platforms without limiting what I can do with my blog. If you add up all the limits of Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader and Medium, then you can't blog at all because their requirements are contradictory. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One requires titles and two don't allow titles. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Facebook doesn't support the basics of blogging, links, simple styles, podcast enclosures and (again) titles. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Medium supports most of what you would want them to support but doesn't allow updating, so if you make a change you have to do it by hand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;None of them want to peer with blogs. They all insist you do your writing with their tools of greatly varying quality, and some are reallllly bad. Even the new hope of writers everywhere, Substack, requires you to use their editor. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So, trying to keep this short as possible, in 2017 I gave up trying to peer with any of those services, and went back to writing my blog the way I like to write, and the lights came back on. It works again. So the moral of the story imho is to forget about peering, and just blog the way you want to, and I think we can all be happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I mentioned Google Reader in the list of limiting environments. Oddly, even though it's long gone, it is still controlling how we blog. They didn't support the full RSS spec, they don't handle posts without titles.

				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; has been around since 2011, getting pretty close to ten years, and in that time, they have switched business strategies many times.

I think there's more to it than what Drum says, that the disappearance of Google Reader, while it certainly hurt the cause, is only part of the puzzle. The problem is that I can't write on my blog and share it with the popular publishing platforms without limiting what I can do with my blog. If you add up all the limits of Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader and Medium, then you can't blog at all because their requirements are contradictory." created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:35:02 GMT" collapse="true" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/123159.html?title=whenMediumShrugs#a123502">

			<description>I've been doing a lot of work on web scripting for the last few months. Put everything else aside. I think I'm ready to create a small subset of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; that runs in the cloud. Basic components are outlining of course, twitter and a cloud-based file system. Scripts run from a user-editable menu as they did in Frontier. Still major things to work out, it's probably months away. But I might start sharing little bits of the work I'm doing, to get discussions going, esp with Frontier alums. The language is JavaScript, but here's the thing -- we don't need callbacks for asynchronous operations, it flows just like any other language. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; figured out the escape from callbacks, that was what convinced me that you could make a scripting system based on JavaScript. BTW, the codename for the project is Drummer.</description>

			<description>One curious thing from working on Drummer: I like working on verb docs. I find it relaxing, satisfying, rewarding. I just realized why. I'm writing a book. At the top level the structure is rigid. I like working within such a structure. By verb docs, I mean docs like what you &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/file/exists&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/&quot;&gt;DocServer&lt;/a&gt; from Frontier, which is still running, btw. The difference is this time I'm writing the docs. Last time I didn't have the energy to do it, but now it's the structure for my review of various aspects of the system. Reading the verb docs you'll know I went through that verb's functionality before release. Of course I'm also documenting the bugs.</description>

			<description>In my experience, most programmers don't care how things came to be the way they are. I'm different, I always want to know the story. I find this the most fascinating thing about us humans, how do we synthesize ideas, build on other people's work. More common is people try to ignore the past, esp if it interferes with their success.</description>

			<title>NFTs contain a good idea, and it's not the money</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't care for the money in NFTs, I don't really believe it's there, but what I do want is an alternative to patents to get people credit for their innovations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Patents have really screwed things up, but no one has ever picked up on the idea that we could have something like patents, but without the tarriff. I want people to know whose work they're using. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once I made enough money, I stopped trying to put barriers on where my ideas could flow. But as a result, I rarely have been able to finish an idea before a big company comes along and takes it over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a bad system, no way to win. If you have to join a big company to be creative, well you can see from that how little creativity there would be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What great musician or artist worked for a company like Google or Microsoft? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The potential of NFTs is it could document how ideas entered the world. I'd be fine if we took the money out of it, also the blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why is everything shit in America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Everything should be great in America, but it isn't. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FIrst watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/seyitaylor/status/1373646185311969285&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from a 60 Minutes interview with Fed chairman Lewis Powell on how he creates money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misperceptions about how money works, even among educated people, is that we have to pay for projects by raising taxes. The fact they're missing is that the Federal Reserve creates money. So we don't have to raise taxes to provide relief to victims of disasters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When they say the debt is something our children and grandchildren will have to pay off, that's not true either. We can pay the debt by printing money. If we owe you $100 who's to say if we got that money by taxing Americans or simply by giving you new money we created for that purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Money has to start somewhere, and unlike a household budget, the US government has an infinite supply of it. Basically the only country with the power to create new money that can be spent everywhere is the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The United States is unique because our dollar is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; for the world. So if say Egypt owes money to India, they pay them in dollars. If a small country is reserving some money for a future project, they store it in dollars. Our currency, unlike all others, is in demand all around the world. Which means we can give them dollars we just printed and they will send us goods that cost real money, because of course when we printed the money, it was real, simply because we printed it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are the richest country there is, it's not &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=hyperbole&quot;&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;. And yet we have one of the worst benefit systems for our people in the world. If people really understood how this works (just re-read this piece) they would be enraged about how health, education, infrastructure, everything basically, in the US, is shit. You see this when you travel to Europe. A sense that everything is first class. And they don't have the economic advantage that we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, why is it this way, such a rich country that lives so poorly? Some of it is the rich self-dealing, grift, the 1%, inequality, etc -- but a lot of is the dysfunction of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The quality of life for Americans hasn't been a priority in Washington, at least not until very recently. There is cause for hope of that changing. Just don't believe the politicians when they say something good for the people has to be &quot;paid for.&quot; Tell them you understand how it works, and the exact opposite is true, it does not ever have to be paid for. We, the United States, can buy whatever we want. And we need to start doing that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I remember those times differently, and very well. Microsoft was in no danger. They could have let Netscape grow, it never would have hurt them. For all of Netscape's bluster about &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14610341&quot;&gt;device drivers&lt;/a&gt;, they had a really bad codebase, and a chaotic team that while blessed with a product that the web was growing around, had a long way to go before they could compete with Microsoft.</description>

			<description>Microsoft could played a senior role, and &lt;i&gt;helped&lt;/i&gt; the rest of us add all kinds of editors and databases to the web, and at least try to bring across some of the GUI innovations of the 80s. Instead all that was lost. Today, decades later, because of the chaos Microsoft brought us then, the editors on the web still suck. They are really inferior. Far less useful than the editors we had before the web. What if Microsoft had chilled and brought together the best minds from the PC era and asked some basic questions like how are we going to make the web better for everyone, at least as good as what we had before. What a time that would have been to do just that. But they acted like spoiled children. Andreessen et al could be excused, they really were basically children then. Gates had a dream of world domination forever, or at least until he was tired of it. So selfish, narcissistic, and so wrong. And the gloating and self-importance today, they still don't, even in retirement, understand that they held all of us back, that's why they failed to continue to dominate. Holding back progress is not ultimately a good strategy for world domination, esp at the leading edge of technology.</description>

			<description>I've been talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; a lot lately, the usual stuff, outliner, object database, verb set, threading, integration, etc. But I realized I leave out the most important thing about Frontier when I recite the features. Whenever we saw a protocol we could support, we did. And we even created new ones when there was a void, as with XML-RPC, OPML and RSS. The best part is we extended the language to make inter-app communication use exactly the same language syntax as local procedure calls. Factoring was also a very big part of the process. So it is kind of a central station, and always getting more high level through factoring. Our software is all about communication, and making it as effortless as possible. It still is, very much.</description>

Whenever we saw a protocol we could support, we did. And we even created new ones when there was a void, as with XML-RPC, OPML and RSS.

			<title>A tale of two podcasts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two podcasts, one good the other one awful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good one was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/18/978687605/could-trump-be-convicted-of-criminal-charges&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a long interview with New Yorker reporter, Jane Mayer, about whether or not former president Trump could be tried and convicted of a criminal offense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The awful one was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-rebecca-traister.html&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein interview&lt;/a&gt; with Rebecca Traister, a reporter for New York magazine, about Andrew Cuomo. It was about how offensive and sexist governor Cuomo is, but the ironic thing, that I can't believe Klein couldn't hear, is how incredibly offensive &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; was being, in a sexist and racist way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first thing that hit me the wrong way is she described a conflict between Cuomo and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio as a &quot;dick swinging contest.&quot; That quote (about 9 minutes into the interview) is as bad as anything Cuomo is accused of saying, and she did it publicly, with a member of the press listening, and he didn't say a word, didn't question it. Try to imagine something like that being said about two women politicians, using the female equivalent of &quot;dicks.&quot; You'd never hear it, and a respectful discussion of politics can't be at that level. It's not just disrepectful of the people she's talking about, but it's disrespectful of the audience and the interviewer, and the NYT which hosted the interview. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She admits she was furious that her &quot;liberal peers&quot; were liking Cuomo's leadership, leadership we desperately needed at the time, but that is not grounds for removal, and you have to wonder, could New York Magazine, and Klein, have found a more dispassionate person to tell this story, someone like Jane Mayer, for example. And maybe present another side of it, about what it was really like for us one year ago. Why were her liberal peers so willing to overlook their dislike for Cuomo? Perhaps because they, like the rest of us, were scared out of their minds. Just a theory. (I certainly was.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later in the interview she admits her issue is with &quot;white, male politicians.&quot; I turned the interview off at that point. This isn't a scandal, as she almost admits, there was vulnerability, a coverup perhaps, a mistake for sure, in a perilous time, and now, the fear having subsided, a bit (and imho irrationally) the opportunists move in. That's a story I'd love to hear on a future Ezra Klein podcast. How and why did we give journalism so much power, was it a good idea, and how can we put it back where it belongs -- with the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Traister should run against Cuomo next year, and her writing should be clearly labeled as partisan, but come on, we have to do better. And Klein, you can't support this kind of partisanship without at least questioning it, or properly labeling it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A fair journalistic treatment of this supposed scandal has yet to be offered, by anyone. The best indication of that is that the people aren't buying the product that journalism is offering, for some reason, a big majority of NY voters are not calling for his head. Maybe it would be worth finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another podcast I listened to recently was a Fresh Air interview with author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978185402/novelist-kazuo-ishiguro&quot;&gt;Kazuo Ishiguro&lt;/a&gt;. I'm reading his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972841445/klara-and-the-sun-is-a-masterpiece-about-life-love-and-mortality&quot;&gt;Klara and the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, based on listening to the interview, and &lt;i&gt;loving&lt;/i&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: On this day a year ago, I proudly scored a thermometer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A year of pandemic-imposed isolation takes a toll. This might be the worst moment of the year. It's rainy and cold. Spring keeps teasing, but it never comes. There's nothing you can do that would be a normal rainy day. When the sun comes out, this weekend, I hope it'll feel better. I'm sure it will.</description>

Their audience likes to hear about liberals freaking out. If you can make them cry, even better. All they have to do is come up with a few things that piss off the libs every week, and they're gold. And if the libs don't get upset, you can just lie and say they did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho they aren't the only news org doing this.  As Maddow says, watch this space. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it's not my business model or any other kind of model to get anyone upset. Quite the opposite. I want to get everyone to work with each other.

			<title>It's not really a scam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been fascinating to watch writers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/210317/p16#a210317p16&quot;&gt;come to grips&lt;/a&gt; with the idea that Substack is not a level playing field. They recruited some famous writers, paid them advances, in some cases (apparently, not verified as far as I know) of up to $250K. The rest of the writers got nothing but the opportunity to make money from their newsletters. By seeding the market with this money they could honestly say that some writers were making six figures from their Substack work, implying perhaps that you could too. Maybe you could. But honestly -- you won't. The system they've set up doesn't work that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One writer called it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so&quot;&gt;scam&lt;/a&gt; but I'm not sure that's a good word for what's going on. It's more like &quot;business model&quot; or &quot;growth strategy.&quot; This is how the tech industry works. They do whatever it takes to create an illusion of potential growth, then they sell that to seed investors, who in turn sell it to angels, then to Series A and B and so on, and ultimately to the public. Huge amounts of money are raised, and none of it goes to the writers who keep the wheels spinning, in the case of Substack and their ilk, writers. And the writers who may think of themselves of savvy tech journos are scammed, that's where the real scam is, they largely did it to themselves by believing the fairy tale that they could get rich off writing, or even make a good living. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, this is not new. Medium has been paying writers for years. I know several of them and have confirmed it. I found out by questioning why they wrote for Medium, when it seemed against their values. The answer: they needed the money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I regularly make offers to work with writers on easy writing and distribution systems without the constraints. But you all keep going for the tech industry business models. They get rich, and we're always starting over. When you decide you want to do this for real, with your eyes open, learning from all the experience, write a manifesto and call for open source devs to help you, and then we can get something going. But until the writers lead here, you're going to keep having your hearts broken and the tech for writing on the web will continue to go nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was having a philosophical conversation the other day about the difference between an app being scriptable or having an API. This has always been a big question. It's like this question: when does an actor become a star? Aren't they doing the same thing? Yes, they are, but no they aren't. An app being scriptable means that its API went through a process, it was conceived from a user's point of view. The designers looked at the user interface and made sure everything you could do there was also possible in a script. The terminology matched the UI. You didn't have to learn a new vocabulary. There were examples provided that showed how to do things the app couldn't do on its own, things that a user would want to do, and would inspire a script-writing user to want to do more. You're looking for the tiny fraction of users who in their hearts are developers, but don't know it yet. These people make software system devs don't think of, and aren't impressed with, because what drives the user-programmer is utility, not programming prowess. Further if you tell them they're programmers, they'll disagree for a long time -- no, I'm a lawyer, no I drive a bus. No I do this or that. But eventually quite a few will come to see that they are programmers. Then, as the programming priesthood takes hold, these people are confined to niches where the devs thought to add a scripting interface. That becomes a platform and the process begins again.</description>

			<title>When your parents die</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you learn when your parents die, the people whose goals and dreams you studied for your formative years, is that our goals and dreams don't matter  much.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that matters is that my mother made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/17/evesQuilt.png&quot;&gt;quilt&lt;/a&gt; for me because she wanted me to have it after she was gone. That she walked my brother to school one day 50 years ago and someone took a picture so I can put it on the wall of my living room today. She planted trees on her street, trees that wouldn't give shade until she was long-gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That my father wrote about what he learned about using a computer to organize his work, with software I had written. The time after I was home from the hospital and he took me to the toy store and said I could have whatever I wanted. I have no recollection of what I chose, but I remember that he did it. I imagine that day he was glad I was okay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The things they give you, their love, the small incidental memories -- they end up mattering more than any of the battles they fought or the impossible dreams they never achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Following up on Roam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got some feedback to my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct&quot;&gt;questions/observations&lt;/a&gt; about Roam's product, which does appear to be an outliner after all. This was my most basic question. I could see that users had the ability to control detail with a familiar expand and collapse operation, but could it reorganize according to structure, the second major feature of outlining? Text on rails. It does have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I have a couple more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is there a directory of interesting public graphs created by Roam users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it a web? Can I link to other people's graphs? What if I create my own Roam-like product, can my graphs be incorporated into other people's?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Observations&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I spent some time a few years ago brainstorming with Ward Cunningham, the great wiki dev, about how we could combine outlining and wikis. We didn't figure it out. It seems Roam, or one of the products it has inspired, may have it. Andrew Shell, who has spent more time with Ward recently said he had the same thought.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should really spend some time learning this product, but it's hard to find that kind of time. This is one of the problems with software development. It's not like listening to music, which you can do while you are driving a car, or seeing a movie, which takes at most a few hours. Learning to use a software product can take months or even years. Very few products get used by most developers, which is a big reason we keep reinventing each others' wheels.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Long story&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to distill this down to something shorter, but don't have the time right now..&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I first showed up in Silicon Valley, after spending a couple of years in Madison making my first outliner (and getting a CS degree), I was disappointed to find out that someone else had thought of outliners before I had, years earlier, and had developed one, and made a big splash, of sorts -- but opinion-leaders were just as puzzled about his product as I found people were with mine. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I'm having a different feeling, after I stopped trying to make outliners pop up everywhere, and turned to other interesting products such as system-level scripting, RSS readers and web CMSes -- that now a new generation of devs is trying again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We had tens of thousands of users of our outliners in the 80s, not millions. People who use outliners are rare, I found. I think it may be possible that doesn't have to be that way, there's nothing very hard about using an outliner, but people have to be interested in how they organize and use info, to see the possibility of tools to make that more efficient, and most people aren't that interested.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The product didn't take off until it did something other than outlining -- presentations. Some people asked if they could just have the outliner, and others wanted just the presenter. Which raised the question, why are these two very distinct functions, in one app? Shouldn't they be split into two, so users could plug them into other tools? This is a big idea, that still hasn't seen its day in the sun.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That made me turn to making glue that could combine the features of products to make a hybrid product. That's the germ of an idea that led to Frontier. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, when I knock on any developer's door and ask about their connections to the outside world, this is what I'm getting at. I once approached a company making a notification system if they supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. They said it was a third-party opportunity and sent me back a link to their developer site (it cost money to be a developer, btw). This felt like when I approached &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/06/whatHasPodcastingAccomplis.html#yesPodcastingIsHugeHeSaysButLookAtHowItsDominatedByNprThatMeansRadioWonHeSaysThePromiseOfPodcastingWhichWasAnOverturningOfTheHierarchyWasALosingProposition&quot;&gt;WBUR&lt;/a&gt; at the dawn of podcasting to offer to work with them on a new kind of public radio, and they sent me a prospectus for giving them money. Or the time in 1978 that I cold-called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/18/pressFreedomIsNotMyFreedom.html&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt; and told them I knew how to create a computerized encyclopedia and would they like to work with me, and they sent a salesman to try to sell me books! The guy was persistent, we kind of became friends, but he never understood one word of what I was talking about. Heh. I guess it was hard to understand that someday they would be on the web, but this was way before the web existed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, I want to know what kind of product Roam is making. One that welcomes the rest of the world, or one that wants to be its own world. Not really judging, just trying to understand. It's like asking if you want to be a cop or the Chief of Police. (A rabbi, or god?)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: Ultimately I personally decided I wanted to be a cop. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;👮‍♂️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PPS: Anyone else working in this area, if you're planning an API, let's collaborate, I have some working code in this area. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PPPS: I wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Michalski&quot;&gt;Jerry Michalski&lt;/a&gt; has looked at this? He was and is an advocate of a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jerrysbrain.com/&quot;&gt;The Brain&lt;/a&gt;, it seems a lot like Roam too. If Jerry likes it, that means something, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's about it for now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The guy was persistent, we kind of became friends, but he never understood one word of what I was talking about. Heh.

			<description>I was telling one of the devs I work with yesterday about Lotus 1-2-3's macro language. I'm going in that direction again, I think the web needs a scripting language. Not one written for devs, but for people who think of themselves as users. That was the thing about 1-2-3. Also Hypercard. And my own product, UserLand Frontier. The idea that there are programmers who would reject the idea that they are programmers. It's a very subtle idea, people who are great hackers in the sense that they will work endlessly to find a way to do the thing they must do, who will develop a deep understanding of the problem they want to solve, but not as much depth on the nature of programming. Mitch Kapor was one of these people. He wrote a product in 1980 or so called VisiPlot. Written in BASIC. It sold really well. Programmers didn't like it. But they sold a lot because it worked really well with Visicalc, the leading spreadsheet of the day. He went on to found Lotus, and they put a macro language into 1-2-3, and the loop was closed. A user created a tool for other users to create tools for other users. The beat goes on. I love the idea of empowering users to create the products they want out of the components us &quot;serious&quot; devs create.</description>

			<description>I had a bunch of errands to run today and thought to get my car washed, to get rid of all the caked-on mud from the winter. It was so dirty, you couldn't even tell it was a white car. When I pulled up to the car wash the guy was just waiting for me, far away from the entrance way. I kind of got annoyed and opened the window and asked if he worked there. He asked if I have a mask. I wasn't wearing one. This is the attitude of a vaccinated citizen. Sometimes we forget to wear the mask, even though I know that's no excuse. Rather than say &quot;Hey bud, I'm vaccinated,&quot; I just put the mask on. I felt a bit ashamed because I used to be so militant and vigilant about masks. I wonder if other vaccinated folk are having a similar experience.</description>

			<description>Whatever the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/15.html#a135524&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; was with the emails, it now seems cured. Lots of things get screwy in the cloud when we switch to Daylight Savings Time, or even when you change time zones, not that we do much of that these days. But the emails went out last night at midnight and they sent the proper stuff, so I'm going to relax about until it happens again, which no doubt it will. Remember -- it's even worse than it appears.</description>

			<description>About politics, I'm not one of those people who cherry-picks bits of news to support a cherished theory. I try to see all the info that's available to me, and I do change my mind, sometimes in a very big way. I used to vote for Republicans, don't ask me why, I can't believe it myself. But I stopped that nonsense in 2004, and ever since I can't imagine why any sane person would. I also know that Andrew Cuomo was part of a very nasty campaign against Ed Koch on behalf of his father, Mario Cuomo, when both were running for mayor of NYC. They were &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/ed-koch-held-decades-long-grudge-against-cuomos-over-vote-for-cuomo-not-the-homo-posters&quot;&gt;picking on Koch&lt;/a&gt; because he was a single man, questioning his sexual orientation. Back then this was nasty bullshit, but it didn't disqualify his father. Today, if the word ever got around, if people knew the slogan they were using, it would probably ruin Governor Andrew, as it should. To this day I can't hear the name Cuomo without thinking of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=cuomo+homo&quot;&gt;bit of nasty&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the Cuomos ended up fucking themselves, and they deserve it.</description>

			<description>I'm also curious about how short people's memories are, apparently, and if people have any thoughts about how close the journalists came to throwing out Joe Biden's candidacy for president in April and May of 2020. Now, as president, he's doing a great job (I think he is, despite my not supporting him in the primary). But he was almost Frankened. There was no process with Biden, it was as if by magic, the journalists decided to give him a pass, and let him run for president without making an issue of the accusations of sexual assault. No explanation. They just erased our memories and went on. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_sexual_assault_allegation&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; didn't forget. :-)</description>
