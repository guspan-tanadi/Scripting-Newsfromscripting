			<description>Portland could send a handful of plain clothes cops to DC to arrest the temporary acting secretary of Homeland Security. Grab &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Wolf&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; off the street, into an unmarked car with DC plates, fly him back to Portland, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-justice-department/index.html&quot;&gt;lock him up&lt;/a&gt;, and put him on trial for kidnapping. He's a nice looking guy, he'd probably look great in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Penitentiary&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The virus will kill many thousands, very soon. It's running uncontrolled through the population. This is what Trump does so well, change the subject.</description>

			<description>Reading about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/coronavirus/missouri-governor-s-comments-on-coronavirus-mccloskeys-raise-eyebrows/article_aeac1f42-9460-5605-9fe5-73ca3ca72b2f.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the governor of Missouri, I think everything else is a distraction including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/pelosi-blasts-trump-and-his-stormtroopers-as-portland-s-mayor-tells-troops-to-get-1.9004427&quot;&gt;storm troopers&lt;/a&gt; in Portland. I hadn't thought of this before, but it's time to raise an issue with the World Court, in preparation for (we hope) trials for crimes against humanity. That's the scale we're operating at right now. We need to fight the pandemic. Our government is using it as a weapon against the people.</description>

How many people would be healthy who are sick. How many people would be alive, who are now dead.</description>

			<description>People debate whether there is such a thing as &quot;cancel culture.&quot; I don't think there's much debate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken#Aftermath&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; got canceled. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/18.html#a135951&quot;&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt;. You could debate whether they deserved what they got, but not really that they got it.</description>

			<description>The tech industry is like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_selling_pharmaceutical_products&quot;&gt;pharma&lt;/a&gt;, they only make products that have huge financial upside. That means there are lots of drugs for cancer, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic diseases, ones that might not kill you right off, but require lifetime use. This is like virality and lock-in in tech. Tools that don't bring in other users, or get you addicted can't make a ton of money. They might be worthwhile though, they might help someone figure something out that saves humanity, for example.</description>

			<description>The reason came to me in a dream. The politicians and their masters arenâ€™t saving our lives because thereâ€™s no money in it for them. But pharma sees big bucks in a vaccine and even more in a treatment. I hear the vaccine might require a booster every few months. They must love that. Every human on the planet would need it. Think of the enormous cash flow for the holder of that patent.</description>

			<description>I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW-Madison&lt;/a&gt; for a visit a few years ago and got a tour of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://discovery.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;new building&lt;/a&gt; created to generate &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.wisc.edu/tag/patents/&quot;&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;. But it didn't appear it was used for much. Extravagant and luxurious. Very unlike a typical utilitarian campus building at a large state school. I learned they built it to recruit a professor who generated billions from patents, and I guess they felt was likely to continue to do so. The money apparently flows to the university, but the professor gets to work in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal&quot;&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt; of campus buildings. Not sure. But it was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; impressive, and surprising.</description>

			<title>A new coding construct?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a language design question, not a coding question.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This bit of code comes up all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if (callback !== undefined) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;callback ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to try to come up with a clean way to say that so it would still be obvious what's happening, but would save you from having to check it so often.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically I want to call the callback if the caller specified one, otherwise, do nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just putting that out there, not offering a solution to the puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Later...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How about this syntax&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if possible callback ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; might be a new keyword that's something like a &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; but not as serious. In other words, don't get upset if this doesn't work. On the other hand, it's not much more concise than the original expression, and it doesn't say anything about what you expect not to work about it. Really for anything other than &lt;i&gt;undefined&lt;/i&gt; I probably want an error to be thrown so I can find the problem and fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not an Applescript type person, I think programming can't be a spoken language, but I also don't go so far as to say programming is like linear algebra or differential calculus (both of which I took in college). I like words that mean something when I read them, both in human language and programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another random thought, not a big fan of using &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; as a new kind of declaration. I imagine they chose it because that's what BASIC used, but why would a nice Algol-like language use BASIC as prior art. I actually like how we did it in Frontier:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;fileloop (f in &quot;tmp/&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;local (fname = file.fileFromPath (f))&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;file.rename (f, string.upper (fname))&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;fname is only accessible in the body of fileloop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;local&lt;/i&gt; is the keyword for declaration. It says fname is declared here, in this scope, and it is only accessible here.  I think it does a better job of explaining itself than &lt;i&gt;let. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even later...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Allen Wirfs-Brock suggested via email, that JavaScript already has this feature, he sent a link to the docs, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it. I said how the hell do you pronounce that? That's where the comment about linear algebra and differential equations came from, above.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well he started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs/status/1284945363531493376&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter asking how people pronounce this feature that as far as I can tell does not have a name? It's an instant classic of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's an even bigger risk. Twitter itself could be bought for 1/2 of $28 billion, the company's valuation according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/&quot;&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; price. That's a fraction of the net worth of a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2020&quot;&gt;billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. And you could probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout&quot;&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition, so you would need much less than $14 billion to pull it off. Basically Twitter itself, legally, is very insecure. We're depending on something a bad actor could take over, legally. I've been writing about this for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. I hope other people tune into it before it actually happens. (Do you think Peter Thiel hasn't thought of it? Don't be naÃ¯ve.)</description>

			<description>Biden is now getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-warns-of-russian-election-meddling-after-receiving-intelligence-briefings-idUSKCN24J02N&quot;&gt;intelligence briefings&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, someone is actually reading them. I bet his staff is planning on how to address each of the issues. Anyway, for now he says both Russia and China are interfering with our election and he says what you'd hope a president would say. BTW, &quot;meddling&quot; is the wrong word, meddling is what a Jewish mother does. What Russia did in 2016 was an act of war. Americans are dying because of what they did.</description>

I like it because it's clean and simple. They gather reviews of lots of pubs, rate them on a scale of 1-100, and they give the movie or show a rating based on the average. A show with an 80 or higher is must-watch.</description>

			<description>I was talking with a friend yesterday about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen&quot;&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt;. We both felt that he had been unfairly &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woody+allen+condemned&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt;. And yes the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/woody-allen-memoir-canceled-hachette-outrage-1202216039/#!&quot;&gt;applies&lt;/a&gt; to his experience. He's one of the great film makers of our time. The movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(1979_film)&quot;&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; came up in our discussion, I saw it was playing on Amazon, so I watched it. What an incredible movie. People forget that Allen wrote the movie, so any flaws you see in the main character, and they sure are there, were put there &lt;i&gt;by him. &lt;/i&gt;In the end you feel his heartbreak at having been so dismissive of Mariel Hemmingway's character, she was so much more wise than him, even though she was so much younger. I had forgotten that Diane Keaton was in the movie. It's a masterpiece.</description>

			<title>Simple is not stupid</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people seem to think I'm realllly stupid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it's because I strive for simplicity in my work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened right from the start, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt;. I factored it for years, until it was super easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The others said they could do it in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Heh. They couldn't&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the next version, we added a blindingly complex feature, cloning. It was actually also pretty simple, but when you demo'd it, you could see their minds exploding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hooo, what was that? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ohhhh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to impress them if you want them to believe you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Biden appears to be doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html&quot;&gt;what I hoped he would&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to suck in as much of the Republican Party as possible. Yesterday I saw AOC pointed out that the Dem Party is a conservative party. That's cool, so maybe we'll end up with 3 or 4 parties out of this instead of 2. And we can have governments that aren't all one or the other. We keep doing and undoing, with little consistency in American govt over the decades. Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. Biden is the single most comfortable Democrat for Repubs. Good. Let's have a unity government that isn't completely nuts. Let's get used to compromising and working together. Let's have some goals, and not drift from them. I know it's a lot to hope for.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep&quot;&gt;Steve Inskeep&lt;/a&gt; seems like such an affable fellow on NPR, but he's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep/status/1276320073809100804&quot;&gt;bit of a snob&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/a&gt; is a real concept. Yes he has one, even if he thinks it's just a &quot;buzz phrase&quot; that's &quot;oft-parroted&quot; (his phrasing). It's bad enough the AG lies about important things, the problem is squared when a supposed neutral news org lets him do it without correction.</description>

			<description>I like to ask questions like this:  &quot;In a sane world, X would be Y.&quot;  I'm not saying I have a plan to turn X into Y, just that it would be ideal if X were Y.  It pays to know what success looks like, that way if it ever shows up by chance, you know immediately to say yes. (Example, in a sane world Fauci would be president.)</description>

			<description>We have to change how we think of Trump. Heâ€™s the enemy and heâ€™s president. If you canâ€™t resolve that apparent contradiction, the half to give up on is that heâ€™s president.</description>

I'm determined to find the most invigorating beer for summer consumption. I've discovered I like beer. This is a new thing for me. If you see a favorite let me know.</description>

			<title>Stop giving Trump the benefit of the doubt</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay stupid question -- who does?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You do. You evaluate his actions against what a president would do, and you know he's not a president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He's trying to kill huge numbers of Americans.&lt;/i&gt; Teachers and children. And make even more live with disabilities, in great pain, for who knows how long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity&quot;&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; -- that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are purposely committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There isn't a more heinous crime.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The virus is making us smarter. We can't get out of it until we become experts. At least as virus-savvy as we are about the weather. If you can prepare for a tornado, that's not unlike the virus. Except it's always virus season, everywhere. That's why I say journalism will fix itself. We can't get back to work until we develop information flows we all trust. That's why I'm always banging on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+fauci&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Fauci&lt;/a&gt; drum. As long as he's muzzled by the government, we can't get out of this mess. I wonder if he sees this. But you and I should see it. If you're smart enough to read this blog you're smart enough to understand this simple idea. The virus makes us smarter. The faster we get smarter, the less the damage. That's where our power is. There's no time for bullshit and we need all hands on deck.</description>

			<description>DuckDuckGo is getting more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/schlocky&quot;&gt;schlocky&lt;/a&gt; all the time. When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649&quot;&gt;started using it&lt;/a&gt; as the default linking service for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;, it was as plain as could be. A logo and a text box. Maybe a link at the bottom or off on the side, I have no recollection. But over time they've been adding junk to the page, so much so that this morning, doing a search there, I ended up at a page where you install a Chrome plug-in. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I paused, tried to imagine how I got there, hit the back button and square in the middle of the DuckDuckGo home page is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/15/duckduckgoButton.png&quot;&gt;big button&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;only button on the page,&lt;/i&gt; and it doesn't submit your search, it takes you to this crazy-ass page to install a plug-in. I chose DuckDuckGo precisely because I thought they would never do crap like this. Seriously rethinking my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/06/06.html#a080649&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;. Are there any nice search engines that do a decent job that don't have dreams of world domination?</description>
