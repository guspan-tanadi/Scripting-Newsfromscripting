			<description>I  just got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to &quot;A wholistic RSS namespace for podcasting.&quot; I wasn't even aware that it existed. No one tells me anything. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I like that they use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt; as guidelines for the work.

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt; has a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/3b4a4e289d87ebd9cffe9d239c7a8b63b3954a4c/client/opml.js#L154&quot;&gt;end-point&lt;/a&gt; that reads an OPML file, and if it has an &lt;i&gt;urlUpdateSocket&lt;/i&gt; head-level attribute, sets up a subscription, and calls back when the outline is modified. Captures all the complex code behind the interface, so an OPML-consuming app can have instant updates with no effort. It's wonderful to see this in action, hope to have a public demo soon.</description>

			<description>To developers wishing to work in the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; world, we can work together as equals, instead of platform vendor and third-party developer. There's a huge difference between the two models. In the first model we are free to compete, but never on the basis of user lock-in. In the latter, the platform vendor has all the power, you can only coexist with them on their terms, and they can change the terms at any time. This has always been true in my experience. The way we work as equals is we agree on an interchange format. I have committed to supporting &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/span&gt; in all my products. So they can all be replaced. And so can yours, if you make it easy for users to migrate, and when you do that you also open the door for people to create products that plug into yours without having to replace yours. We compete as equals. We compete to please users. We are free to build on each others' work. That's the kind of discipline I like as a developer.</description>

			<description>Journalism did their part in screwing up the 2016 election. No contrition, they’ve never done an exposé, and they have the gall to be sarcastic. I’m no fan of Facebook, but journalism is actually making them sympathetic.</description>

			<title>Backing off tweets.opml</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have taken the feature out of the first public release of Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turned out it was a mistake to try something so ambitious so late in the game. We'll come back to it in a due time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This happens sometimes, I wish it hadn't happened in view of the testers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They all have been wonderful, enthusiastic, and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Onward! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Journalism in the aggregate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I judge journalism in the aggregate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, I say &quot;journalism&quot; did this or that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do it that way for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They do act as a unit. You'll see basically the same stories on all websites and cable news stations. They often interview each other, which is pretty amazing if you think about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To balance the way they treat online writers. They talk about us in the aggregate too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And to balance the way they view Facebook, with 2.7 billion users, they only consider one user when they talk about Facebook, as if we all are just Zuck-clones. I made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of all the things Facebook is, and journalism rarely considers anything but the personality of one person when talking about &quot;Facebook.&quot; Not that they really have any insight into his personality, btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To tell journalism, to the extent that I can, how unthinking and automaton-like they are. There will come a day when computers do what they do, because they use so little of the intellect they certainly have. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

At one point Heather Cox Richardson said, almost proudly, that the only thing she knows about NYC is the line in the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u1zK8AaHic&quot;&gt;New York, New York&lt;/a&gt; &quot;If you can make it there you can make it anywhere.&quot; This is one of my big problems with podcasts, the thing that tunes me out, when people speak from a position of false expertise. They're having a grand time, while I (the listener) am deciding whether or not to cut them off, based on the probability that they'll ever say anything interesting before the end. Yesterday I cut them off and listened to music for the second half of my ride. It's the same reason I can't watch any MSNBC show for more than 3 minutes. They're filling the air, meantime I know there are things going on they should be informing me of, and add to things my mind can think about. Okay so N&amp;T had a bad episode, not the end of the world, the other most recent episodes are totally worth listening to, I highly recommend them, and I will keep listening in the hope that the NYC episode was just a bad idea they followed through on instead of canning.</description>

At one point Heather Cox Richardson said, almost proudly, that the only thing she knows about NYC is the line in the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u1zK8AaHic&quot;&gt;New York, New York&lt;/a&gt; &quot;If you can make it there you can make it anywhere.&quot; This is one of my big problems with podcasts, the thing that tunes me out, when people speak from a position of false expertise. They're having a grand time, while I (the listener) am deciding whether or not to cut them off, based on the probability that they'll ever say anything interesting before the end. Yesterday I cut them off and listened to music for the second half of my ride. It's the same reason I can't watch any MSNBC show for more than 3 minutes. They're filling the air, meantime I know there are things going on they should be informing me of, and add to things my mind can think about.

			<description>We are now all complete newbies when it comes to understanding how networks can be used to spread misinformation. We might look back in a few years and realize that our first line of defense was Facebook, Inc. Maybe tearing them down is like the press tearing down HRC in 2016. I don't trust their judgement on this stuff, do you?</description>

			<title>A thread from my tweet stream, as captured by Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If only we had journalism covering itself we'd probably learn they've been doing the exact same thing since the dawn of journalism.  This is a big defect in our system, no one is watching journalism.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/w8nGgjZTfb&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, what do you think the Pulitzer Prize is, other than a bunch of ads they do about journalism every year. No doubt the awards are highly politicized, and stories looking too deeply into corrupt journalism probably don't stand much chance of getting an award.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until there's some way for journalism's corruption to be exposed, why would any intelligent person think there's anything but corruption in journalism? In an Occam's Razor sort of way.  I'm watching The Wire, about to start Season 5, btw, if you know what that's about. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's this great scene at the end of Season 4, with Bodie and McNulty on a park bench. Bodie is talking about how fucked up the bosses are in the drug mob in Baltimore. It sounds just like what McNulty would say about the police department. That's the point.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the scene with Bodie and McNulty.    (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EtwlxhFKEz&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;Twitter Pro&lt;/i&gt; probably seems like a weird idea. Could there be &lt;i&gt;professional&lt;/i&gt; Twitter users? There are. It's a writer's platform. The name they chose makes such an idea uncomfortable, perhaps. But it's a for real idea.</description>

			<description>The next round of changes in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; will be about organizing tweets, using Twitter as a source for your writing work. Here's the use-case. You're out and about, and get an idea that belongs on the to-do list for your latest project. Open up Twitter, and post a note about it. When you get back to your desktop the note will already be in a Drummer outline, ready for you to act on it. It doesn't matter what kind of writer you are, whether you write for yourself, as a note-taker, if you write docs, research, news reporting, a blog, or a great novel. If you're a writer and and a steady user of Twitter, and interested in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; and outliners, I'd like to add you to the Drummer test group in a few days because I want to groom the product to your use of it. Send me an email, let me know if this interests you and we'll get you on board soon.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Little&quot;&gt;Omar Little&lt;/a&gt; is the most likeable character on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlo_Stanfield&quot;&gt;Marlo Stanfield&lt;/a&gt; is the coldest.

			<description>As summer winds down (tomorrow is the last day), I chose to listen to music instead of a podcasts on today's bike ride. I am loaded up with new ways of thinking from having gone through the archive of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then&quot;&gt;Now &amp; Then podcast&lt;/a&gt;. If you find your podcast fare is repetitive or shallow, dive into that podcast. It's a great college course in the history behind current affairs. Anyway, I've loaded up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)&quot;&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;, a very middle-class iPhone thank you, with lots of music history, and set it to shuffle the songs. The songs of my childhood. As this summer winds down, it feels like a metaphor for the summer of my own life winding down. The feelings from childhood that I re-experience with the music were the &quot;other side&quot; of the experiences  of adulthood which is now passing just like summer. The dreams of a child were of the future, full of possibilities, are now balanced by the regrets of an old man. I'm doing my best to stay fit, but it gets harder every year. This fall, esp because the pandemic is now going into its &lt;i&gt;third&lt;/i&gt; winter, has a grim feel to it. I know winter can be beautiful in the Hudson Valley. But this winter, unlike recent past winters, there's a sense of dread that hasn't been there before.</description>

			<description>Everything we think is a new low in American governance is far from it. We were taught a lot of crap in school. The people whose egos were being protected are all long-dead.

			<title>What I'm learning from The Wire</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how many times I've watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; from beginning to end, but it's probably more than five. The last time I remember watching it was in 2010 when I just moved to NYC. I was living in the West Village, and had an active social life, and The Wire was something nice to do calmly, alone, just to get absorbed by a fictitious yet very familiar culture, again. Like coming home in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the thing about all good series that achieve suspension of disbelief, you feel like you're in the story, you're part of the family. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; with five seasons of 13 shows each, each show an hour, with all the characters and their stories, and relationships, makes for very absorbing reality-shifting and an emotionally satisfying experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I know what's coming, and amazingly, sometimes I've forgotten. But some big events, you remember, and experience them in full fidelity now, as you did the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also if I recall correctly the first seasons were only available in low-rez, they came out before 4K, but somehow they've upgraded the source material and it's all up state of the art, at least to my eyes, which aren't the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm toward the end of season 2. Not even close to half way through. Looking forward to the end of the day when I might watch a couple of epsiodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And get this, while I'm working through The Wire, I can't watch cable news. It's just too sad, slow, repetitive and just wrong. On one hand you see how great we can be as story-tellers, and the stories told on MSNBC and CNN aren't stories at all. The characters say nothing. Even the ones with reputations for saying a lot. There's absolutely no human connection. And you can see that the things they're saying are repeats, just like watching The Wire for the 5th or 10th time, but there's never a question about what the characters might say or do, it's always exactly the same. Yet it's supposed to be The News which would lead you to believe their intention is to say new things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep asking the question -- does news have to be as bad as it is? Could imagination bet part of it, curiosity, intellect, depth of knowledge about something other than politics or law?

				<source:outline text="I have no idea how many times I've watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; from beginning to end, but it's probably more than five. The last time I remember watching it was in 2010 when I just moved to NYC. I was living in the West Village, and had an active social life, and The Wire was something nice to do calmly, alone, just to get absorbed by a fictitious yet very familiar culture, again. Like coming home in a way." created="Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:05:13 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/150450.html?title=whatImLearningFromTheWire#a150513"/>
				<source:outline text="That's the thing about all good series that achieve suspension of disbelief, you feel like you're in the story, you're part of the family. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt; with five seasons of 13 shows each, each show an hour, with all the characters and their stories, and relationships, makes for very absorbing reality-shifting and an emotionally satisfying experience." created="Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:28:53 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/150450.html?title=whatImLearningFromTheWire#a152853"/>
				<source:outline text="Sometimes I know what's coming, and amazingly, sometimes I've forgotten. But some big events, you remember, and experience them in full fidelity now, as you did the first time." created="Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:12:05 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/150450.html?title=whatImLearningFromTheWire#a151205"/>
				<source:outline text="Also if I recall correctly the first seasons were only available in low-rez, they came out before 4K, but somehow they've upgraded the source material and it's all up state of the art, at least to my eyes, which aren't the strongest." created="Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:12:45 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/150450.html?title=whatImLearningFromTheWire#a151245"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, I'm toward the end of season 2. Not even close to half way through. Looking forward to the end of the day when I might watch a couple of epsiodes." created="Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:14:12 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/150450.html?title=whatImLearningFromTheWire#a151412"/>
				<source:outline text="And get this, while I'm working through The Wire, I can't watch cable news. It's just too sad, slow, repetitive and just wrong. On one hand you see how great we can be as story-tellers, and the stories told on MSNBC and CNN aren't stories at all. The characters say nothing. Even the ones with reputations for saying a lot. There's absolutely no human connection. And you can see that the things they're saying are repeats, just like watching The Wire for the 5th or 10th time, but there's never a question about what the characters might say or do, it's always exactly the same. Yet it's supposed to be The News which would lead you to believe their intention is to say new things." created="Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:14:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/150450.html?title=whatImLearningFromTheWire#a151451"/>
				<source:outline text="I keep asking the question -- does news have to be as bad as it is? Could imagination bet part of it, curiosity, intellect, depth of knowledge about something other than politics or law?

They all seem flat and boring, and just plain stupid, bored with their jobs, but keeping the seat warm.

			<title>I turned off Maddow last night</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I turned off Maddow  last night as she was reporting a leak of software for elections. She left out the vital part of the story, was this the first time the software had leaked? If not, all it tells you is the people who are doing the &quot;recount&quot; in Arizona are bad people. This is not news. If they were new leaks, I doubt I'd be hearing about it first on Maddow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it for all their breathess breaking stories, I can't remember Maddow ever cited by another news org as the source of a major story. Yet they often present their work as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And the dishonesty when it comes to tech reporting, gives me an idea of how dishonest their other reporting must be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>CNN could use a constant critic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Saw a report on the news that Facebook is evil because they enhance pictures on Instagram. A really thin story because so many things other than Facebook damage people's self-perception based on ridiculous standards of appearance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;CNN does it, for sure in huge ways. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=brianna+keilar&quot;&gt;anchor&lt;/a&gt; reporting the story is a beautful woman, but probably not quite as beautiful has her makeup, hair and lighting people make her seem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish they were required to have a constant critic in a window in the upper right corner of the screen, pointing out these hypocrisies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Brianna Keilar&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I will always admire Keilar for how she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Kb7IDmFF4&quot;&gt;interviewed Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, before he was famous. If you haven't seen it, you might love it. It's very different from the usual TV news fare. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Thinking about the extent that Boomers are held responsible for where we're at, I still think that's nuts, the more I learn about slavery and how the Civil War is still going on, that's what we are fighting about in the US, that's why we can't get our shit together. We haven't accepted a very large part of our population, people who are fully entitled American citizens. Then I wondered about all the post-boomer generations that blame us. I wonder if they voted in every election they were entitled to vote in. What are the percentages of participation in democracy among the generations. I don't know if the idea of the vote as a sacred right is a Boomer thing, or what.  I know my parents had the participation bug. I got it from them, I'm sure. But if you didn't vote, I think it's hard to blame others. My friend NakedJen has a wonderful slogan for this. You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up. ❤️</description>

			<description>One reason I want Twitter to get rid of the character limit is so I no longer have to say &quot;I wrote a tweet.&quot; I have never liked the idea of writing tweets. Tweeting is weird and joke-like, self-deprecating, which I don't mind, but please not about writing. Writing is a religion, not something I joke about. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
