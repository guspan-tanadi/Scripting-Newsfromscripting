			<description>Why now? RSS 2.0 will be &lt;i&gt;twenty years old&lt;/i&gt; on September 18. One month from today. I'm working on something pretty big for that day, maybe it'll be out a bit earlier, who knows. But in the meantime, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweetfeed.org/&quot;&gt;something new&lt;/a&gt; to spark a new use for RSS and Twitter -- hooking people's tweets up to feed reader apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsblur.com/&quot;&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoldreader.com/&quot;&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I once heard an interview with comedian Steve Martin, and was surprised at how serious he sounds when discussing his profession. I expected comedy, but when he talks about what he does, vs doing it, he's all business. It made an impression.</description>

			<description>The reason I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1559879683776331776&quot;&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt; is that soon you will be able to publish to all RSS readers from Twitter. It really works, there's some serious innovation here, and fills in a missing piece that's been there since the mid-00s. This is RSS and Twitter waking up after a long sleep.</description>

			<title>Slippin Jimmy is back for the love</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Better Call Saul spoilers follow. You have been warned! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The previous episode ended with the hero threatening to kill an old crippled woman whose mistake was trusting him. People thought this meant that his slide would continue in the finale, and it certainly did, but then it turned around -- and it became what I had hoped it would be -- a love story! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't spend 14 years with this character, all the while knowing he had a good heart, he loved his brother and Kim, and all the old folks at Sandpiper, he really did love them, only to find out at the end his heart was cold and there was no redemption for our hero. I thought that would not be consistent with the writers of the show. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the final scenes, we see the hero, sentenced to 86 years, doing the same thing he was doing at Cinnebon in Omaha, and as usual his fellow prisoners and guards had fallen in love with him, as we all did. In the final scene, he's back together with Kim, sharing a cigarette. He's still Slippin Jimmy with a heart of gold. And she's slippin around too, her ID as a lawyer hadn't expired. And the door is wide open for a sequel, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The final touch, where the actors come out one by one and thank us -- what a concept -- for our love of them. In all the finales of all the shows, great ones and not so great, I've never seen this done, and it ended this show with a heart on just the right note. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was always taught the basics of a good story are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws&quot;&gt;who, what, when, where and why&lt;/a&gt;. With Trump and his stolen top secret US government documents, we don't know who he was selling the secrets to. The what part -- we don't know either. They say nuclear secrets, but what if they got you access to world's banking system. That could be considerably more valuable. Why? With Trump there's only ever one reason -- if it makes him richer he's in. If not why bother. Our journalism repeats the same old bullshit over and over.</description>

They say nuclear secrets, but what if they got you access to world's banking system. That could be considerably more valuable. Why?

			<description>Gotta wonder why none of the news orgs are looking at this. I remember years ago when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/transcript-rachel-maddow-show-10-19-21-n1281957&quot;&gt;Maddow&lt;/a&gt; was telling about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska&quot;&gt;Oleg Derapaska&lt;/a&gt; and Trump. What ever became of him, and why did all the news orgs stop looking at how Trump was selling us out.</description>

			<description>Come to think of it, Twitter and RSS have a lot in common. Both are roughly contemporary pioneering efforts on which today's social media and news worlds are built. Both are a bit worse for wear and tear, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/14/wearAndTear.png&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJBkL9_Lfm4&quot;&gt;Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Visiting Flushing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My mother died in February 2018. My father had died in October 2009. So she lived there alone for nine years. I came and went, it was nice to have a place to stay in NYC. I just took a trip to NY for the first time to stay overnight since I moved to the mouintains in 2019. And for the first time I didn't have a place to stay in NY. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://maxisnoodle.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/13/maxisNoodle.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was the hottest night of the year. I ate a fishy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/dining/wonton-soup-maxis-noodle.html&quot;&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; in Flushing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://maxisnoodle.com/&quot;&gt;Maxi's Noodle&lt;/a&gt;, one of many Chinese and Korean restaurants in the place where I grew up, only when I lived there it was a sleepy midwestern-type place you traveled through but never stopped at. I would take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_Queens#Q16&quot;&gt;Q16&lt;/a&gt; bus to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing%E2%80%93Main_Street_station_(IRT_Flushing_Line)&quot;&gt;Main St&lt;/a&gt; and from there got on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Flushing_Line&quot;&gt;7 train&lt;/a&gt;, never stopping for more than the time it took for the train to leave. But it's now a destination. It felt like a foreign country. What a thing to return to where you grew up, to experience it as a white American man would in a foreign country, Hong Kong or Seoul. What was odd though, was when the locals talked the young ones talked like me. Makes sense, but strange. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When my mother died, shortly after we had the house cleaned out to get ready to sell, I realized I should have made a movie of the inside of the house. The scene of most of my childhood memories, good and bad. Now they only reside in my head. If only I had thought to make a video. That's what's funny about big transitions. When you look at the place so familiar so lived-in, why would you take a video, it never crossed my mind. Until the instant you realize, after the fact, that it's gone forever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the morning after staying in a weird hotel that smelled funny, in the stinky heat of an August morning, plotting my trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html&quot;&gt;Utopia Bagels&lt;/a&gt;, I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7687934,-73.7918902,3a,75y,231.86h,75.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srVHSLcEmp8uSz67aCZY2Lw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; (on the app) on my path at the intersection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Francis+Lewis+Blvd+%26+32nd+Ave,+Queens,+NY+11358/@40.7688738,-73.7926528,210m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c28a7fa6261b81:0x5df5b6691664bc4f!8m2!3d40.7689226!4d-73.7919782&quot;&gt;32nd Ave and Francis Lewis Blvd&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to imagine which corner it was on, what it had replaced. Turns out it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbanklocations.com/reliance-federal-savings-bank-29210.shtml&quot;&gt;Reliance Federal Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, where I, as a 5th-grade boy had my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook&quot;&gt;bankbook&lt;/a&gt;, a hand-written thing, maintained by someone behind a counter who carefully stamped the date, and wrote the amount and balance in the account for every transaction. I don't remember what I was saving for, possibly a new baseball bat or glove, or later sound equipment. And of course all that remains of that little person, the former future Dave, are little vague bits of memory. How unlikely all this was I imagine that boy would think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Until the instant you realize, after the fact, that it's gone forever." created="Sat, 13 Aug 2022 18:45:02 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/13/184041.html?title=visitingFlushing#a184502"/>
				<source:outline text="In the morning after staying in a weird hotel that smelled funny, in the stinky heat of an August morning, plotting my trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html&quot;&gt;Utopia Bagels&lt;/a&gt;, I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7687934,-73.7918902,3a,75y,231.86h,75.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srVHSLcEmp8uSz67aCZY2Lw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; (on the app) on my path at the intersection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Francis+Lewis+Blvd+%26+32nd+Ave,+Queens,+NY+11358/@40.7688738,-73.7926528,210m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c28a7fa6261b81:0x5df5b6691664bc4f!8m2!3d40.7689226!4d-73.7919782&quot;&gt;32nd Ave and Francis Lewis Blvd&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to imagine which corner it was on, what it had replaced. Turns out it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbanklocations.com/reliance-federal-savings-bank-29210.shtml&quot;&gt;Reliance Federal Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, where I, as a 5th-grade boy had my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook&quot;&gt;bankbook&lt;/a&gt;, a hand-written thing, maintained by someone behind a counter who carefully stamped the date, and wrote the amount and balance in the account for every transaction. I don't remember what I was saving for, possibly a new baseball bat or glove, or later sound equipment. And of course all that remains of that little person, the former future Dave, are little vague bits of memory. How unlikely all this was I imagine that boy would think." created="Sat, 13 Aug 2022 18:46:35 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/13/184041.html?title=visitingFlushing#a184635"/>

			<title>Carnegie Hall vs Central Park</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I prefer to write on the open web rather than on Facebook is that if I get an Aha! idea about a feature, on my blog I can implement it. On Facebook I'm just a user. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was/is one of the great things about the web. Anyone can develop features for it. On Facebook, just their employees can. No wonder it never moves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When a company dominates an activity, they tend to invest elsewhere. Seems kind of perverse, but that's why markets don't always evolve to fill every niche. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to perform a new style of music in Central Park, you can. If you want to do it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Hall&quot;&gt;Carnegie Hall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Center&quot;&gt;Lincoln Center&lt;/a&gt;, you need to get the approval of a lot of rich people&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The idea of putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; into the world of the browser was a mistake. The world of news is another world altogether. The web tried, in every way to turn RSS into the web. And it was very unsatisfying for a reason, the web was designed for documents. Things that have lasting value. The news is different. It's ephemeral. You want to keep a record of it for sure, but yesterday's news has no value as news, because it's not new. It's like the difference between music and podcasts. Music you may want to listen to many times, to cherish, to attach memories to, if it's good enough, over your whole life. A podcast is one and done. Pfffft. Off to the bit bucket. It's value is over as soon as the next episode is out.</description>

Engelbart thought augmenting human intellect was his real life's work. I know because 1. he told me and 2. same with me. Augmenting human intellect sounds spacy, something only a genius could understand, which is why it's not a good term for something that's pretty simple. Using an outliner to take notes and manage a project is an example of the computer augmenting your intellect. Doing something for you that you are not as good at as a computer is. Using a spreadsheet to augment human intellect could mean doing what-if analysis on a projected balance sheet. Sharing a recipe on Facebook with a group of friends is another example. Remember, Engelbart was talking about this long before there were computers outside of research labs. What seems kind of obvious today was anything but obvious then.</description>

			<description>I usually exercise in the afternoon, but it's been so hot, so I did my Peloton ride first thing this morning. Then swimming, a nice breakfast with a tall glass of delicious ice coffee. The sense of well-being is overwhelming. I used to have this feeling all the time after working out when I was younger. Now it's harder to get there. It's nice to see if I do everything well, I can still do it.</description>

			<title>We should write a book</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should write a book on bug reports. There's so much to say. A case study. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A user is testing a fresh new feature. Released seconds before. He tries it out on his iPad and gets a blank screen. Tries it on his desktop machine, it works. He concludes there's an incompatibility with iPads and reports it as such, in great detail with screen shots. He follows the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/12/165429.html?title=howToAskForHelpWithSoftware&quot;&gt;1. 2. 3. format&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as the developer reads the report, right from the start, he's pretty sure that the user's theory is incorrect, that it has nothing to do with an incompatibility with iPads. He has strong reasons to believe this, because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The new feature reuses already tested display code, there was nothing new there in this release. Almost all browser incompatibilities are display problems. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He had just seen the same behavior on his own machine, and the problem was that he hadn't done a hard reload, so some code files updated, others didn't. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The developer would like to know if there are any error messagess in the JavaScript console, being 99 percent sure there are. The user's report didn't include any info on this. They error messages are in the software for a reason, to help figure out what went wrong, to take the load off the user and the developer. To make these puzzles resolve faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're not in  a good place, because the developer is going to have to first convince the user to look elsewhere first, and users like everyone else, don't like to be told they're wrong. That's why we have to slow down. Don't rush to write a bug report. At least try it again, to be sure it reproduces. Think about what else can go wrong.Like it or not, the user has to participate in the debugging process, if they want the problem resolved reasonably efficiently in time, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best bug reports are short. A bug report and lab notes are different things. By digesting your report into simple statements of fact, you get to challenge your own assumptions and might cause you to change your thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to think about it as likely your problem, not the software's because in my experience that's what's usually going on. In almost 50 years of being a programmer only once did I find a bug in a compiler, yet in my early years, I often stopped looking because I thought I had, only to find the bug later, in my own code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A reader thanked me for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html#a141224&quot;&gt;tip&lt;/a&gt; about Olbermann. &quot;With Maddow only one day a week, it's nice to know there is still a good, daily source of my kind of Snark and News available.&quot; My response: You're very welcome. But I think when you listen to Olbermann you'll realize as I did that Maddow wasn't cutting it. She stepped back because she lost her edge, she must've known it. I also think the MSNBC management must have been forcing her to not say the whole truth. Olbermann for now at least is unchained. But his show is owned by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia&quot;&gt;big corporation&lt;/a&gt; so he'll probably eventually go stale too. But for now -- he's got it.</description>

What the Confederacy did by seceding from the Union was quite similar to the January 6 attempted coup, but after the Civil War, we (ie the United States) made the same mistake the Bidens are making. They wanted to bring the Confederates themselves back into the country. So really it was no surprise that slavery continued, it was just a bit more complicated. When we prevail this time, when Trump is dead and gone, and his successors are a bit easier to shame, we must have a purging. With force. No more trying to love the rebels back into the country. Deport them any place that will have them. Offer them to Russia or Hungary. You want em? We don't. If not, build huge prison camps in remote parts of America. Life sentences with no parole. These people should not feel after all is said and done that they are part of America. They didn't love it, they left it, tried to destroy it, they do not get to come back and enjoy the benefits of living in a free society. It's their turn to really feel the pain.</description>
