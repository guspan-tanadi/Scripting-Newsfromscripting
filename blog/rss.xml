			<description>The promise of the web, twitter, etc for journalism is it's supposed to give the people a voice in the news. So far that has not happened. That has been the core of the clumsy argument we're having about Facebook. Users like it, because it gives us a voice. I think though journalism hasn't been clear about it, even to themselves, that's why they don't like Facebook. It encroaches on their exclusivity.</description>

			<description>A long time ago my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; and I agreed that you don't make money &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; a blog or podcast, but you can make money &lt;i&gt;because of&lt;/i&gt; a blog or podcast. It's a subtle but important difference.</description>

			<description>They have so many awards for journalism, why don't we have anti-awards, for acts of great cowardice, hubris or greed, at the expense of the public. It probably would do more good than the other kind of awards.</description>

			<description>I can see how the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump&quot;&gt;impeachment trial&lt;/a&gt; could backfire. Trump has been obscured, pushed to the side. He used to be the focus of everyone's attention, but now it feels like years ago that he was a menace. The trauma could be substantial. On the other hand, it has to be done.</description>

To understand what was in the video, I asked if she had called someone else the slur or whether she was rapping or quoting a book title. In asking the question, I used the slur itself. I should not have done that. Originally, I thought the context in which I used this ugly word could be defended. I now realize that it cannot. It is deeply offensive and hurtful. The fact that I even thought I could defend it itself showed extraordinarily bad judgment. For that I apologize.”</description>

			<title>NY Times fires Donald McNeil</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the NY Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/210206/p6#a210206p6&quot;&gt;fired Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;, a reporter I've written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+McNeilhttps://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+McNeil&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in glowing terms, many times. There isn't another reporter in the world that I have so much respect for. He taught me about viruses, in clear language that I understood, that didn't insult my intelligence. In a time where all our lives are threatened by a virus, his reporting and advice was potentially life-saving. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember well the first time I heard him interviewed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I was driving on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston%E2%80%93Rhinecliff_Bridge&quot;&gt;Rhinebeck bridge&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kingston-Rhinecliff+Bridge/@41.9776606,-74.0860387,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89dd095c9557317b:0x4e76e90146cedab!8m2!3d41.9776606!4d-73.945963&quot;&gt;the Hudson&lt;/a&gt;. I had just heard a WHO press conference where they said the virus had gotten out of control and now was a pandemic. For that moment I felt like we were defenseless, completely at the mercy of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't know anything about pandemics. Then I listened to McNeil &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; how the Chinese were already getting it under control. Testing, isolation, contact tracing. I could see how these three together, efficiently administered, could actually isolate the virus and thus destroy it. Now I knew it wasn't impossible to solve the problem, but it did require us all to work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From that point on, every time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;McNeil&lt;/a&gt; wrote something or appeared on the podcast, I stopped everything and read and listened carefully. His reporting is full of information and history, it was more than great reporting. They don't have a prize for this, but they should. Reporting that's useful. In this case very timely and useful, life-saving and useful. A gift. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the NY Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/business/media/donald-mcneil-andy-mills-leave-nyt.html&quot;&gt;fired McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what I understand happened, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/06.html#a161003&quot;&gt;McNeil's statement&lt;/a&gt;. He was asked by a group of high school students a question about whether it was okay for a friend of theirs to say a racial slur in a video. In answering the question McNeil himself used the word. This is a word that is used publicly, often as a term of endearment, in a lot of contexts to refer to all kinds of people, and it's not controversial, it's accepted. He didn't aim the racial slur at anyone. Grammatically it was the subject of a sentence, not an adjective. He said the word. And now, many months later he was fired for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this isn't what happened. I'm open to hearing more. But if this is it, the Times should apologize and offer him his old job back. Apparently some reporters will object, and somehow threaten the Times. &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; should be fired. It's an honor to work at the Times, and if you don't like it, leave. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What the Times did here is disgusting. This isn't the first time I've said the Times is disgusting. I think it virtually every day as they flaunt their conflict of interest re tech, never offer an opposing view to rebut their nonsense. They either naively or corruptly promote stories that put our country in danger, based on lies, just like the ones Fox is being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/podcasts/the-daily/smartmatic-fox-news.html&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; for now. These are well-known. The Times doesn't seem to care. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect the Times will reverse itself. So I hope McNeil lands somewhere where there is a daily podcast he can be interviewed on, and who will sponsor his reporting, which was exceptional, deep, informed by an enormous base of experience, thoughtful and caring. Let's make sure he's still viable as a source of information and encouragement to us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

These are well-known. The Times doesn't seem to care." created="Sat, 06 Feb 2021 15:52:27 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/02/06/154705.html?title=nyTimesFiresDonaldMcneil#a155227"/>
				<source:outline text="I don't expect the Times will reverse itself. So I hope McNeil lands somewhere where there is a daily podcast he can be interviewed on, and who will sponsor his reporting, which was exceptional, deep, informed by an enormous base of experience, thoughtful and caring.

Journalism wants money from tech, they campaign for it, in their output, openly, in their hit pieces on tech, that are generally off-target. There are a lot of things to be critical of tech for, but the NYT and Maddow, two who I follow, don't have an idea. Why don't products like Clubhouse come from the journalism business. If they're so demanding of tech, compete. Show us how to do it. If Clubhouse is going to be a unicorn, it's still early days.</description>

			<description>Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/17&quot;&gt;braintrust&lt;/a&gt;, once again have figured it out. In the docs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; we ask them to map port 80 requests to port 1339 using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables&quot;&gt;iptables&lt;/a&gt; command. But the routing was only going one way. When an outside request was coming into the server. For requests made going out of the server, the same mapping must apply. And that fixed the problem. Now I have to update the docs. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A little computer design/philosophy. Everywhere you look on a computer you see the same pattern repeating itself. Folders, sub-folders, files. If you're looking for it you see it everywhere. So why not have one really great browser for such structures, and use it everywhere. That way when you add a feature to the core, it improves everywhere. I think very quickly the computer itself would become simpler. BTW, this was the basic idea behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22outliners%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/a&gt;. We never got close enough to putting code &quot;in ROM&quot; to complete the vision. But that was the idea.</description>

			<description>A favorite recent Twitter feature: I can filter replies so I only see, by default, replies from people I follow. It has made Twitter more civil for me. But it has a downside, that I realize when I reply to someone who doesn't follow me. They probably can't see my idea.</description>

			<description>In a brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1356988600483799041&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/globalvoices&quot;&gt;Global Voices&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, I mentioned the idea that news has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;unbundled&lt;/a&gt;, today no single publication delivers the news, as they used to. A story to illustrate. As a student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW-Madison&lt;/a&gt; in the late 70s, I'd often go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/&quot;&gt;Memorial Union&lt;/a&gt; with a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, on a sunny afternoon perhaps, and sit on the patio by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mendota&quot;&gt;Lake Mendota&lt;/a&gt;, people-watch, and read the news. Today I'd do it in a minute if I could, but today I'd read news on an iPad or laptop using &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds. I'd have an all-in-one bundled news experience as I did in the 70s. But: My system kind of sucks, I never put any effort into maintaining it, and my system is vastly better than what most people get as a news experience. No wonder the truth has trouble getting out. The news industry blames Facebook, but as a former entrepreneur, I blame them. They've invested so little in understanding how their readers use their product. Their system is based on an incomplete understanding of their roles. The news industry product needs to be re-bundled. I believe the rewards will be huge for the first publication that bets on this idea. They wouldn't be the first, btw -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/19/whatToDooWithYahoo.html&quot;&gt;My.Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; did it in the 00's. Have the guts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;point to your competition&lt;/a&gt;. And if you have a paywall, send them some money &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; some readers. Now that Jeff Bezos is retired, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; such a platform, I would stand up and applaud if they had the guts to try this out. I'd also line up to hook my blog into such a network. Not because my writing depends on making money from it, it doesn't, but to help disrupt the news industry that's daydreaming itself to death over distribution, competition and economics.</description>

			<description>I'm trying an experiment in Less Is More. After writing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/30.html#a174046&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that I am writing too much, I decided let's do one or two ideas every night and see what if anything changes. And also let's see if I can stick to it for a while at least. (Update: It didn't work.)</description>

			<description>There is a consensus among scientists that Covid will be with us basically forever. It will not be eradicated, it will continue to evolve, circumventing our vaccines, which will have to evolve too. It will kill approximately 10 times more people than the seasonal flu, and will make people a lot sicker for a lot longer. It may mutate into something less damaging, but it might go the other way too. No one knows. The probability of a return to what we used to consider normal is zero. So maybe no more movies or restaurants, in-person spectator sports, theater, art museums, bowling, singing, long distance travel. The smarter we are and the more we work together the less damage the virus can do. It eats &quot;deeply polarized&quot; cultures, like ours.</description>

			<description>Political journalism is as broken as the Republican Party. Of course you'll never hear about that in the news. And there will be no discussions on CNN or MSNBC on how to work around their brokenness. The system self-perpetuates until it collapses, which is has been doing lately.</description>

			<description>This is not a request for support. If Spectrum had decent customer service they could probably get me to subscribe again. But last time I had to wait an hour on hold to talk to a rep to cancel my free trial to a service that wasn't well-explained on their site. That said, they have service that's a lot cheaper than the unbundled version, because you have to buy everything twice just to get CNN and MSG because of exclusive deals they've made. I guess the old cable companies are grandfathered in?</description>
