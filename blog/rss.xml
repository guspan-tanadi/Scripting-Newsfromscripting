			<description>I'm loving going through &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/span&gt; for the second time. I've promoted it to my friends, but the comments I get back are a lot like the ones about &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bojack Horseman&lt;/span&gt;. They're turned off by the fact that it's a cartoon. I don't mind it at all, myself, and it has the advantage that they can go places with their imaginations that human actors can't. That's esp important for a show like R&amp;M. Also another thing I like is that there's no fourth wall at weird times. Rick talks like a game show host, about commercial breaks, and then talks about episodes, and seasons of R&amp;M. I love it when writers are free to talk to us through the characters, quite literally, not through manipulation. I think it's a masterpiece, as I did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bojack&quot;&gt;Bojack&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the thing, as kids we loved cartoons right? I know I did. I also loved movies. So now I like movies made for adults, why not cartoons for adults?</description>

			<description>Listen. There are plenty of famous delusional loudmouths. Why aren't there any sane loudmouths to balance them? I'll tell you why -- because being confident and outspoken is considered a sin among the sane. But! It's not a sin to communicate in a way more people understand.</description>

			<description>I wonder when someone in journalism is going to break the Republican lie that we're all independent of each other, that somehow we don't need the help of others to eat, stay warm, stay alive. We don't live on the prairie in the old times, before railroads and medicine. If your house catches fire, my house will too. Once we establish that foundation, that we depend on each other, we can solve problems, but not as long as our political life is mired in this argument about what liberty means.</description>

			<description>I am very happy with the way &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; testing is going. There have been some surprising contributions, really good questions, and plenty of people actually using the software. Enough people to keep it moving. And I'm not in a rush. As far as I'm concerned this is the whole game. I have no development plans beyond Drummer and the scriptable apps I've lined up to hook into it. I'm not sure why this time is different, but I'm not arguing. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Worth starring Michael Keaton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Netflix movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worth_(film)&quot;&gt;Worth&lt;/a&gt; got great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/worth&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;, and it stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keaton&quot;&gt;Michael Keaton&lt;/a&gt; so I got out the popcorn and sat down to watch with great expectations and came away not liking the movie. That was almost a week ago, and I've had some time to reflect on why it was so bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, the score on Metacritic for Worth has gone down by 20 points since I looked late last week. Now it gets a 66, &quot;generally favorable&quot; which is not great. But I left the first paragraph alone. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, Keaton is a great actor, and this was an unusual role for him, playing a lawyer whose job it was to save the economy from being sued to oblivion by the families of victims of 9/11 by giving them money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I'm going to spoil the plot, but it's kind of funny -- you might not even realize this was the plot, esp the second part, after you watched the whole movie, that's how poorly done it was. So here goes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The families wanted their dead relatives' stories told, they cared less about how much money they got, although the money was important to some.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The families of rich people who died scammed the regular people and they took a lot more of the money from the settlement, and there was nothing Michael Keaton could do about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But the most important part of the plot was that Keaton started out as a stiff and heartless lawyer and came out the other end as a champion of the people. Only we never saw the process by which this transformation took place. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I came to, after giving this enough time, was that it should have been a 6 to 10-part series. Netflix should have done for the families what they wanted Keaton's character to do. Tell their stories. That's where the juice was. If you want to make Keaton the central thread, that's a good way to do it. But we just got tiny little glimpses of the families here and there, and no understanding of who actually died in the 9/11 attack. And that's a shame, because it could be a good story. Maybe a bit like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway as a movie it was imho a failure. Michael Keaton, as always, commands your attention in a good way, just to see someone who's a true artist at his craft. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My podcasting habit wanes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Editor's note: This started as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1435615566476230661&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and turned into a ramble &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/08/144104.html?title=myPodcastingHabitWanes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on my blog...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to admit the only podcast I listen to these days is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;, and I don't listen to that very often. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/a&gt; did one, I would listen. A weekly version of her newsletter. Yes. She's one of those people I never have an argument with, and always learn something from. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In contrast the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; (which used to be my main daily news fix a year or more ago) sucks so much now because the NYT reporters are either dumbing things down intolerably or (sorry but this is more likely) they're just too young and inexperienced to have a clue. About anything, even what they're supposed to be expert in. I know they hire kids with great degrees from great schools, but I wonder if they aren't all the pre-med-type students who just go for the grade and recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then think about all the doctors they keep inviting on to CNN and MSNBC. The same ones all the time and they say the same things. You wouldn't need AI to do what they do!  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I would listen to a &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/span&gt; weekly podcast about what's new with Covid. I wouldn't mind if he also talked about cooking, or great trips he's taken that didn't get him fired from the NYT. I think he should be as popular as that &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk&quot;&gt;asshole&lt;/a&gt; on Spotify who got Covid and is taking oxycloriquin or whatever. How about a rational outspoken person to balance the crazy outspoken people. McNeil with a good sidekick could do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They could do a clean sweep of MSNBC while you're at it. Again, clinging to a world that is gone. No patience for that. Get &lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/&quot;&gt;HCR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/&quot;&gt;DM&lt;/a&gt; to begin. Offer Brian Lehrer a nightly spot. That's three hours right there. The people they have now are out of ideas. Need a rest, a change of venue. Put them out of their misery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Who to blame for Afghanistan?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Who to blame for the Afghanistan debacle? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not nearly as complicated as journalism makes it sound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people who voted to re-elect Bush in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blame yourself if youâ€˜re one of them. We had a chance to listen to the world and use our dominance in so many areas other than blowing up Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Very limited imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I love one thing about Facebook. It gives the person who posted a piece absolute power over the existence of comments. On pieces I post, I don't limit myself to deleting abusive or personal comments, I delete ornery or challenging ones too. I hate online debates. I host a debate-free environment. If you want to debate, take your business elsewhere.</description>

			<description>All the nasty fascist crap that's surfacing now has always been there, handed down lovingly from generation to generation. Every family no matter how good or bad, depraved, sociopathic, narcissistic, everything -- they all think they're the best, smartest, luckiest &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the worst treated and unluckiest. SItting around the kitchen table listening to mom and dad philosophize about the world, it rubs off. What makes families different is how they deal with those beliefs. March, write letters, watch Maddow or Hannity. Or join the Nazi party. I don't honestly think there's anything that can be done to break this, family is the strongest force for determining our view of the world.</description>

			<title>Factoring</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent about an hour today doing a factoring experiment, taking a promises-based API and transforming it into a callbacks-based API.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well no surprise they're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism&quot;&gt;isomorphic&lt;/a&gt;. When you do the translation, you end up with the same thing with different names. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The promises syntax is slightly more compact. A long distance to go and a lot of introduced complexity for very little gain.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like getting nice fat clothes instead of just losing the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a philosophy in programming, one I thought was stolen from, but actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4&quot;&gt;mis-attributed&lt;/a&gt; to Einstein, who ironically said as much in a lot more words.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a basic mathematics thing. They're always looking for a way to find one theorum that encapsulates and makes unnecessaray two or more. A more fundamental truth. The hope is ultimately to have one concise way of saying everything. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty&quot;&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/a&gt; kind of idea. But why do programmers always seem to do the opposite? Solving a problem of too much complexity by adding even more complexity.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was a math major before I was a programmer, so I find this whole thing super frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At some point, instigated by Drummer perhaps, I hope we will have a great debate in the JavaScript community where our respected leaders explain to us why we need any of this stuff, and we can't have a language that behaves like all others, where asynchronous bits live underneath the interface that the langauge defines for the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Unite rather than divide. I don't care how you got to the party, I'm just glad you're here now.</description>

			<description>I saw a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/05/snarkySlogan.png&quot;&gt;snarky thing&lt;/a&gt; in a friend's Facebook feed that said women don't need men telling them what to do with their bodies. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; shows that 43 percent of American women are pro-life and 45 percent of men are pro-choice. I thnk everyone should be pro-choice, but it's wrong to blame men for the current situation.</description>

			<description>Most people in America donâ€™t get how slavery is what weâ€™re still fighting over. Colin Kaepernick  is  black, in America that means heâ€™s a slave. Our country has yet to settle that question. Most of us have decided to grow out of it, but for a sizeable minority, theyâ€™re going keep fighting it. What Kaepernick is to them, a slave who forgot his place.</description>

			<title>Getting caught up with Electron</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A query for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; devs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+electron&quot;&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; Electron apps for five years at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have an Electron version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; for the Mac (to start) almost ready to go, but there are problems with the File dialogs. It feels like a versioning thing? These routines worked fine in earlier software. So I figure what I need to do is get this app building using the latest versions of Electron and the latest build tools. If I recall correctly they change a lot. And it's been a while since I figured out how to do it. When I read their docs for building stuff I feel as lost as I felt when I was just starting out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here's how I build the app currently:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo electron-packager . &quot;Electric Drummer&quot; --platform=darwin --arch=all --overwrite --icon=drummer.icns --electron-version=7.1.10&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What should I change to get my build process up to date? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It works, it builds the app, and I've been using it, it's just not the current Electron release and their are quirks with the file dialogs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ideally I'd like to not have to learn too much about the Electron release process or versions -- just give me something that works and I can get back to my sprawling codebase. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/222&quot;&gt;thread for comments&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>JSON Feed after four years</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/11/04/164251.html&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about JSON Feed a few times. Summary: it was a bad idea. I don't know why devs want to come up with new names for well-established concepts. It makes all our lives more complicated if the format catches on, and if it doesn't, it just makes a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely had to have a JSON feed format, which no one does, it's easy to encapsulate anything you don't like about a format behind a simplifying API, and anything you can represent in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; can be represented in JSON and vice versa, the best thing to do was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSONified RSS&lt;/a&gt;. But they didn't do that either. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so four years later &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manton/JSONFeed/issues/157&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; appears in the support repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I might have been vaguely aware that Apple has a new format, obviously its own reinvention of RSS, also a totally bad idea, and another developer thinks JSON Feed should adopt its features. He is correct. That is the right move. Or even better, just leave JSON Feed behind and support both Apple's new incompatible format and RSS 2.0. Given that they're rooted in the Apple world, probably both. But the sparsely supported format they put out there was a bad idea and today it's an even worse idea, and it's only going to get more so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People keep doing this, thinking that starting over is the thing to do. Apple will have trouble with their format because publishers will see it as the trap that it obviously is and probably will forever tell Apple it would be better if they didn't go off and blaze a new trail when there already is a well-worn path. No one wants to get locked in the trunk, they want to ride up front with you. And in publishing, thankfully, Apple still is not dominant. And hopefully it stays that way. And the rest of us have to circle the wagons and &lt;i&gt;reduce&lt;/i&gt; the number of formats we have to deal with, not add to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wish Facebook would silence the spammy viral phishy poll messages that get thousands of shares, my friends fall for them, and they're certainly gathering all kinds of data that hurt people, they're easy to detect, it should be a big issue for journos, but for some reason it isn't.</description>

			<description>I saw a supposed expert on Wolf Blitzer's show on CNN last night saying there was nothing the Dems could do about Roe v Wade. This is what passes for expertise at CNN these days. People who look nice in a suit and learned how to speak in CNN style.</description>

			<description>Drummer user note: When you're creating something new in a chronologic structure, use the big + icon at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/03/plusIcon.png&quot;&gt;top of the icon bar&lt;/a&gt;. Don't do it by hand. The software that cares about chronologic notes ignores nodes that were created by hand. The + icon puts special attributes on the nodes that matter. You could if you wanted to do it yourself. But why would you? I'm saying this 20 different ways, here on Scripting News and everywhere else I can think to because I want &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; users to get this right. It's important. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'm doing user support for the first time since &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/span&gt; days and am reminded of what sucks about it. In the groups I am part of, as a user,when I ask for help I have reproduced the problem on my machine several times. I have tried workarounds. I've thought about it. I don't immediately ask for help, because I know the other people are like me, doing it for love, it's not their job, they're helping because they like to help. For whatever reason the groups I assemble often don't do this. At the first sign of trouble they post something that's impossible to understand, and it's really clear they didn't try it again, or they would have spotted their mistake. Support is a dear resource. Use it when you need it, but be sure first that you do need it.</description>

			<title>We have to fight, at some point</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I saw Amy Klobuchar interviewed on CNN and the reporter pressed her to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/jun/13/stephen-breyer-retire-supreme-court-alexandria-ocasio-cortez&quot;&gt;Breyer should resign&lt;/a&gt; while there's a Dem president, was wondering why no one wishes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; had resigned when Obama was president, but of course there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland#Supreme_Court_nomination&quot;&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in hindsight, we should have had the fight over the Supreme Court when Garland was nominated and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/03/16/470664561/mcconnell-blocking-supreme-court-nomination-about-a-principle-not-a-person&quot;&gt;McConnell refused to confirm&lt;/a&gt;. Obama could have taken that as an affirmation, and seated Garland. It would have been a better time to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said it at the time. If McConnell won't vote, then after a decent amount of time, Garland takes the seat. Set a new precedent, if the Senate abdicates its responsibility, we go forward without them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good guys have been scared of a fight, and the Repubs have been walking all over the Constitution. You can't be nice always, sometimes you have to hit back. We've been delaying and delaying. And btw, where are the indictments of Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland#Attorney_General_(2021%E2%80%93present)&quot;&gt;Mr Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>On Facebook, when you reply to a post you disagree with, your followers will then see it in their timeline. This puts people who follow you in an awkward position. I want to unfollow you because I don't want my timeline polluted with nonsense about how great the former president is (for example), and the only way I can do that is by unfollowing you. So your momentary feeling of righteousness has a hidden potential cost you should be aware of. 1. You help a cause you disagree with and 2. You alienate your friends.</description>

Only one app is keeping me on the Mac, the OPML Editor, and only for its ability to manage my development work. But Drummer is getting pretty close to being able to do that. When it's fully up to speed I will be able to run everything in Linux, and believe me -- I will relax. I'm skating on thin ice on the Mac and know it.</description>

			<description>The usual monthly ritual is complete. Archived the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/08.opml&quot;&gt;August posts&lt;/a&gt;, and started my outline with a fresh slate for September. Trying to imagine what wonders and atrocities await us! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Tagging in Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My use of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt; has been going for a while now, and i'm still doing it, which in my experience is a total success for a categorization system. Even better, some of the tags are getting enough references to be useful, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tag=drummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What seems to come next is to hook all of this up with a Wiki, so the landing page for a tag can have more than just links to articles. In other words all of this amounted to integrating an outliner with a Wiki, which was one of my goals after hanging out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ward+cunningham+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of days &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html&quot;&gt;a few years back&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Software development sometimes is like painting. You do something over and over iteratively, from a lot of angles, and arrive somewhere, but that itself is probably just on the road to what's next after that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
