			<description>Watching the news tonight I couldn't stand the cowardice of the commentators. When is one of them going to say look here's the deal, Trump is a sadist.That explains all that they claim to be so inexplicable. He's a sadist. Next question.</description>

			<description>Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive. PS: I can fly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger&quot;&gt;debuggers&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of the coding process. I almost never run anything complex without stepping through the code in the debugger, to be sure it's running the way I intended it to. Having the data it's working on right there, easily browsable, gives me ideas for new functionality. Imagine being a surgeon who can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; the living body, turn off all the systems to examine things, then click a button and have the organism reanimate. And then imagine having such a tool available to you and not using it. There are programmers who don't use debuggers. They're working at a lower level imho. Like flying without instruments.</description>

			<description>So I have the last 4.5 years of Scripting News in the Daytona index, now I desperately want all the rest of the years, but that's not going to be so easy. In 2017 I had a really good idea of how I wanted the data stored, but until then, I was playing around a lot. A lot of it is in OPML, somewhere, probably. But a lot more of it is in HTML. But it's pretty incredible to have 4.5 years. Makes all that writing so much more useful.</description>

			<description>I noticed people are talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; on their blogs, and there's a general positive view of it, and an expectation that I will continue to improve it. That's all good. But a lot of that depends on how much I get back from users. Ideas that are interesting, not necessarily obvious, and aren't expressed in terms of panic. I want to move this forward, with friends, with people who are as excited as I am and are ready to roll up their sleeves and participate. But if you wait for me to do it, then I'll just add the things I want. I'm hoping that &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users take an interest. And not just &quot;do this for me now&quot; -- help out. I can't read minds, and I don't really like working for free. I don't want dollars, I want the product of intelligent, kind people who help. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=nakedjen&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; has the perfect motto for this, &quot;You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up.&quot;</description>

But &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; new. We needed it and it's so weird we didn't know we needed it. The really interesting things are like that. It breaks new ground and it's not just for blogging. But it's not for lazy people. If you don't want to read the docs and understand what it's doing, you won't get it to work. Maybe in a while we'll figure out how to pave over some of the difficulties, but not yet. Daytona is a gift. It's something we had no right to expect. But sometimes there are breakthroughs, you discover some power that's amazing, and everything you try with it is something new. This is one of those products.</description>

			<description>The Democrats need someone who can be counted on to say &quot;The Republicans are full of shit&quot; when called on by the press. Too bad we had one, in Al Franken -- well, now we need another. It's really simple, most of the things they say are BS, so it needs to be said apparently because journalists seem largely unable to say that simple truth.</description>

			<description>Today I learned that if you want Apple's mouse to scroll, as if it had a scroll wheel, you have to go to the Accessibility panel on Preferences, then click Options, and check the Scrolling checkbox. Then it works. I had gotten a cheap Microsoft mouse that had a scroll wheel, but it's junky compared to the Apple mouse.</description>

I had tried before and gave up, for the same reason I guess I gave up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Halt and Catch Fire&lt;/a&gt; -- it's too close to home. I come from both cultures, Maisel from my home in NY. Miriam's mother and father could have been my parents or grandparents. And I lived the HACF life in Silicon Valley in the same timeframe as the show. But for some reason when I tried MMM this week, I got into it. I think I figured out why. The family I was part of is now completely gone, and has been gone since early 2018 when my mother died. Enough time has passed that the memory has softened and idealized in an emotional way. I still remember why they upset me so, but I don't feel it so much any more, so Maisel is tolerable, even adorable. And bingeable. TV shows are excellent because they immerse you in their society, you start thinking of the characters on the show as members of your clan. Maybe I should try HACF again. Also, it's really funny that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; comes even closer to the lifestyle I led, and I loved it when it came out! I think I was actually in a couple of episodes of that show, certainly some of my friends were.</description>

			<description>Made a small change to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter a search string, it constructs a URL for the search and redirects to it. That way the address bar has a link that's ready to be shared. This is something Google does that's quite useful. It works if you're searching Scripting News or the Drummer Docs, but sharing searches into your own public writing doesn't make sense, because they will search in the other person's public writing, not yours. For now you're the only person who can search your public writing. But I had it redirect because you might want to remember the URL for your own use.</description>

			<title>What is OPML?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A thread on Twitter led to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blogisch/status/1469579178890743808&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from JoÃ«l de Bruijn: &quot;Is an OPML file meant to encompass a whole library (with a notebook, subnotebook, note structure) or is it more like &quot;one note = one OPML file&quot; structure? Or something in between, what a user prefers?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; is just a file format, like HTML or RSS. So it can be used for whatever you want, large files, small files, libraries, bullet charts, tree charts, graphs, calendars, directories, projects, things we haven't invented yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/manila/opml/spec.html&quot;&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt; designed as the interchange format for the outliner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, a scripting environment I created at UserLand Software in the late 80s and 90s. In Frontier, an outline could be a script, a menu, an object database, a blog, a blog post, or just an outline. We needed a way to exchange outlines with our product and other outliners, so this is what we came up with. OPML wasn't the first interchange format for outlines, there was a format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/misc/dotHeadFormat.html&quot;&gt;.HEAD&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced dot-head) that we used for outliners in the 80s, but OPML was better because not only did it handle structures of text, they could also have attributes. Anywhere you could put an outline node, you could add attributes. They aren't visible when you're editing, but they're accessible through a dialog, or software can automatically attach attributes, such as the creation date of a node, so that they are indentifiable and can be pointed to from outside the outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then came a very special attribute, the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute -- which says basically that this node in an outline is a document, so the outline containing the node behaves like a file system. That's how I edit my blog. Each post is a document contained within a day, which is part of a month. I find it convenient to start a new outline every month, and archive the previous month in a GitHub repository. You can study what real-world OPML looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, I have 4.5 years of archives there. I recently created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;search utility&lt;/a&gt; for those, which is kind of like the tagging systems you see in Tools For Thought products, but I don't have to tag anything, I can just search for the words. It's already a lot better than Google or other search engines that don't understand outline structure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway that's a longish answer to a question that can be answered simply by saying that an OPML file can be whatever size makes sense for the application. It's just a file format. Its signficance, I hope, is that it can provide a way for all kinds of outliners, and applications that accept outlines as input, to share the same data, making it possible for lots of outline-based tools to co-exist, and for users to be able the use the right tool for whatever job they want to do right now, without having to convert any data. It's totally possible, and I'm happy to help any way I can.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, a plug for my product &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, whose native file format is OPML. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have an announcement coming shortly, having solved a problem that I've posed here as a task for &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/span&gt; databases, I want to get all the OPML files that I have archived for Scripting News queryable so I can do research on my own writing. I now understand why they couldn't do it, and the solution is remarkably simple, was easy to program and imho blows away the tagging approaches the other TFT apps use. Sometimes you have to start with the use-case, not the technology. And this is a long-term problem that was solved, it goes all the way back to the beginning of outlining. The braintrust query above is for this project. I want it to be just right before showing to you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Sometimes you have to start with the use-case, not the technology. And this is a long-term problem that was solved, it goes all the way back to the beginning of outlining. The braintrust query above is for this project. I want it to be just right before showing to you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 10 Dec 2021 14:28:17 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/10.html#a142817"/>

			<description>BTW, another advantage of the approach we've used is that it's not just for Drummer. Literally any outliner can participate. I am indexing OPML files that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;stored on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. It's impossible to know which outliner they came from.</description>

			<description>The Beatles broke up because they were tired and sweet loving people, in way over their heads, and wanted some semblance of normalcy in their lives. They stayed together so long because they were best friends, and loved making music together, but when their manager died, it fell apart. Get Back tells an important story. The Beatles were and are still a huge force for good. But they were also people.</description>

Also Tesla makes a visual promise with that huge screen in the middle of everything, but then you find out it doesn't do any of the things you expect from Apple Car Play. All that promising screen real estate -- it doesn't deliver what you expect it to. How much would it cost for Subaru to add a huge screen to their 2023 or 2024 models? Heh, they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be doing this.</description>

			<description>Apple and Google can get other companies, large and small, to do things for them. That goes for huge automakers to individual developers. Tesla is a loner company, and ultimately there is an ecosystem already growing around Google and Apple. I know very well what they're going up against. Back in the early 90s I built a great system-level scripting product, around simple open protocols. Apple swooped in, and first took over the protocols, and then took over scripting systems, with, imho demonstrably inferior products. Didn't matter. When Apple had a developer meeting they all came. I knew it was over when they had a meeting and I wasn't even invited. I think Elon Musk is going to know that feeling pretty soon.</description>

			<title>The de-upgrading of the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Probably the worst thing to happen to the web is the gradual degradation of Google's search engine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started in tech, I assumed everyone was at least trying to move forward.

			<description>Outliners should support &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, then users will be able to switch between products without having to convert their work. OPML is the best candidate for interop between outliners, and we are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a long way from that. It's a mature format, widely deployed. it's something I think the users are going to have to ask for because the developers are either too busy, or are not on board with the idea of people being able to use their work independently of the tools they use. I'm not looking to profit here, any more than I profited from RSS or podcasting. I want the users be empowered, because we need better-organized thinkers more than anything. I'm here to help.</description>

OPML is the best candidate for interop between outliners, and we are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a long way from that. It's a mature format, widely deployed. it's something I think the users are going to have to ask for because the developers are either too busy, or are not on board with the idea of people being able to use their work independently of the tools they use. I'm not looking to profit here, any more than I profited from RSS or podcasting. I want the users be empowered, because we need better-organized thinkers more than anything.

Emphatically it is not a long way off. This isn't that new. We were doing outliners 40 years ago. These problems have been solved. Let's work together, users and developers.</description>

			<title>Peloton, 25 rides in</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;25 rides.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got an email from Peloton yesterday congratulating me on 25 rides. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've got a groove all righty. Here's how it works. I have my teacher, Emma Lovewell. Such a sweetie, she's like a neice to me, so nerdy and she has a lot of things right. I don't have to do this ride, I &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; to do it, she says. I am becoming something, let's find out what it is, she continues. Anyway, I found this 20-minute ride of hers that I really like, so I just keep doing that ride very day, over and over. I really like the tunes, there's a Tom Petty song (American Girl), and Fleetwood Mac, Genesis, even a Beatles song. I know them in order. I pay attention to her instructions, somewhat, but I do what I want to do. I take a break after every song, even though she wants me to keep going. As long as the music is off I don't have to pedal. I take a sip of water and let my legs recover a little. And then I'm back at it. I sing along. Close my eyes a lot. And before you know it, the ride is over. And I always feel great after the ride. Like Superman. Mind is clear, body strong, I'm directed, going somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now people say it's hard to get the shoes in and out, but I find it really easy to get them in, a little more difficult to get them out. It's like snapping ski boots into the bindings. I have the official Peloton shoes. I can't figure out how the top strap works so I leave them undone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing -- I can't ride standing up. I don't feel balanced. But I think I will get it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This works. I am getting a daily exertion, no matter the weather, day or night, and am getting stronger. I only wish I had started this regimen 20 years ago, imagine how my body would have responded, but it is what it is. I'm doing great for an old dude! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Beatles had a sad end</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt;, and I kind of hated the way it ended, but it is what it is, it's not like there were screen writers who chose the wrong ending. The rooftop concert was a Ouija board thing. Something Ringo could have an opinion about, so they had the concert. I thought it was awful, esp for the last live performance of the Beatles. It wasn't really a concert, it was cheap, they used London, acted like dicks, it made the whole Let It Be process suck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At one point the idea of going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cavern_Club&quot;&gt;The Cavern&lt;/a&gt; was brought up, and I thought that would have been great. They clearly have very strong feelings for that period of the Beatles, even though it's something most of us never experienced (it was before the mania). Or they could have arranged to be surprise guests at a London club. I'm sure they were there, and any of them would be happy to host the Beatles. Then it would have been legal, the enthusiasm would have been there, and they could have fucked around and everyone would've loved it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe there was just no place for the Beatles to go in 1969. I've noted this about superstar basketball teams. Once they win a couple of championships, I felt, they should just disband the team, because there would be no joy in a third or fourth. It seems like everything they did in the album Let It Be was no more interesting than what they did in Magical Mystery Tour or the White Album or Sargent Pepper, Revolver, they were all huge leaps. Let It Be -- no -- it's great stuff, historic -- it all really matters, but none of it was necessary. Anything past that, well there was no vision for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned, over the whole three episodes, is how little the Beatles cared about business and how much of it they delegated. I had read the story of Billy Joel, and was amazed about how he kept money far away, and had gotten ripped off massively by someone he trusted. Lennon was in awe of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Klein&quot;&gt;Allen Klein&lt;/a&gt;, but he sounds like a schmuck. I think if the Beatles had a manager who loved them, and cared about them, they might have continued writing music together for many years, and gotten what they wanted out of independence. It doesn't seem like it had to be either/or, and what's also clear is how much love there was between them. It's a common pattern, something great happens, and the assholes move in and squeeze the life out of it. How strong the Beatles were that they got so far. Or how much their manager, who had just died, must've loved them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A good movie to watch after finishing Get Back is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Eight_Days_a_Week&quot;&gt;Ron Howard documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the touring Beatles. It's on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-beatles-eight-days-a-week-the-touring-years-d3b00689-e450-4fcb-9853-d37e78ed4c57?&quot;&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
