			<description>Comment to CNN: Yes, right now Biden is leader of the free world, but a couple of years ago our president was on the other team, and not too far down the road, if things don't change radically, we'll be changing teams again. Don't forget that context. That's where Putin has fun. He can screw with our political system, but it appears we have no power in the other direction. We can't give him a problem at home.</description>

			<title>Drummer status report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a DM from Ken Smith, an everyday user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=drummer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;It's been so long since I had any hiccups in Drummer that I can't remember when it might have been. Not sure there's anywhere in particular to report that.&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have had the same experience though I'm using &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; mostly, and testing new stuff in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;web Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I haven't seen an outline overwritten in a long time. That was the big problem with the new tabs system in Drummer, contexts would get swapped incorrectly, and one outline would replace another. It's a hard problem to get data on, bug reports invariably are vague. You can't see the problem happen, the user typically doesn't see the problem until long afer the mistake was made.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/11/drummer.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;There's reason to believe the problem has been fixed. I was led to a problem in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/150&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, on Jan 8, with steps to reproduce an outline overwrite. When I traced the problem to its source and fixed it, it occurred to me that this mis-coding could be the source of the remaining overwrites we were seeing. I didn't say that in the thread, but I did say it in a private conversation with Scott Hanson. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still don't know if the problem is gone, but it was worth commenting that the product has been really stable for well over a month, zero problems seen, or reported. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/22&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;, a geography game somewhat inspired by Wordle. Here's the (spoiler!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/23/wordleSoution.png&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; to today's puzzle. I got close on the first guess then putzed around but did finally get the answer. I loved maps as a kid, so I have the shape of countries pretty well memorized.</description>

			<description>I was just looking over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040102121830/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;home blog&lt;/a&gt; at Harvard in 2003, a blog which I had the privilege of editing. I was looking for a snapshot of the &quot;What is a weblog&quot; page. A lot of work went into defining what it meant, because there was some confusion about this in the 2003 blogosphere. And then it turns out the page in question is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;still there&lt;/a&gt; on the Harvard site. Good thing it was preserved. And in case that page ever disappears, it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160729162359/http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html&quot;&gt;also on archive.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

It's also weird that watching shows where people use the word casually and often, your mind starts saying the word in your head, and it's not impossible that it could make it out of your mouth.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Raised%20By%20Wolves&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt; has bits of Westworld, Game of Thrones, Lost, Alien, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica and I'm sure a few other classics.

			<title>Heckuva job Putin?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We invaded Iraq with as little provocation as Putin has for invading Ukraine.

			<title>Public editors, again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT should have public editors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They should only be copy edited. What they write is up to them.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Their work appears alongside the op-ed columnists, same prominence.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They must not be journalists, but must be good/great writers, and news users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why this has a chance of working?   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The journalists will be more likely to read it, because it gets the same distribution they do, it's harder to ignore.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The writers have no reason to tiptoe around journalists because they don't care about access, and aren't trying to protect a career in journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They come into the job with no fixed ideas on how journalism works. They view things only from the readers' perspective.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so they are vastly outnumbered by the people writing for the NYT who are trying to keep careers going and do care about access.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The author says it's about Russia and the US and that the US doesn't want the new pipeline to be used to pump natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. The one weird thing about this is why would Putin pick this time to invade Ukraine when it gives the US pretext to shut down the new pipeline before it could get started? Seems like he has a lot to lose right now. Why not cement the bond with Germany before having an adventure in Ukraine. In any case, he says the US public is being conned, much as our journalism says the Russian people are being conned by their media. I don't doubt for a moment that the news we're getting is at least misleading if not total fiction.</description>

			<description>I've started bingeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/raised-by-wolves/season-1&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I like it so far into 3 episodes, and I hear it gets better. I have no idea why it's called Raised By Wolves, there are no wolves in the show (so far). The human kids are raised by androids. Here's something good/.interesting. It was liked by one person on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fraised-by-wolves&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;, Jake Savin, who is also considered the best match with me on BW. Jake said it was the Best. Aha I know I'm in the right place. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It could be that Putin gets to pick the day WW III starts. If so why wouldn't he wait till Tuesday so it can be a famous day -- 2/22/22. Just wondering about that while working on some tricky code. Yes, this is the kind of thing programmers think about.</description>

			<title>The Twitter-to-RSS project</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The project is coming along. Implemented so far... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tweets can have titles. Make the first character in a tweet a #. The rest of the first line is the title. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Full Markdown support. Anything you can type in a tweet can be Markdown and will be rendered as it's converted to an RSS item. Markdown is ideal for where Twitter is at now. It a plain text environment, and that's what MD is designed for. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads are rolled up into the first message, forming one RSS item. In RSS there is no character limit. And Twitter has a good thread composition tool built in. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160316075154/http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&quot;&gt;Emoji short codes&lt;/a&gt;.

I want to wait until the major coding is done before deciding that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This post as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1495442593630638086&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, and then as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/20/thePostInMyReader.png&quot;&gt;RSS feed item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't watch All-Star games ever since I realized that players never play defense, esp in the NBA.

			<title>Why didn't Zuck fight back?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a comment that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/19/facebookstockoversixmonths.png&quot;&gt;Facebook lost&lt;/a&gt; half its market cap because they changed the company's name to Meta. It rings true. It was a really stupid move. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They changed their name because journalism has the power to shape public opinion and markets and they've been trashing the company name, confusing the company with the platform and the user community. It's amazing to me how much power they still have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago they decided as if by osmosis to conflate the company with the things users do with their service. When the users do something evil, they say Facebook did it. It's beyone inaccurate. Underneath the error it seems to me there must be malice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say it often enough and it sticks in the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook == evil. Over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So rather than try to clean up Facebook as a brand name, they just changed the name of the company and tried to disown the biggest cash cow ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is that Facebook the company has the best propaganda machine ever invented, but they don't use it for that purpose. If Zuck et al had chosen to usurp journalism's name shaping ability he could probably have destroyed them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't have made a difference to me or other people who don't have the power, but you wonder why they didn't use it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sure journalism would have screamed bloody murder. So what. Let them scream. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Recall that the word &quot;Facebook&quot; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;at least 8 meanings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Everett Dirksen could tell a story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I thought of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen&quot;&gt;Everett Dirksen&lt;/a&gt;, former Republican senator from Illinois. Probably hadn't thought of him in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I found him endlessly entertaining. He was a funny looking guy and had a froggy kind of voice, but he told great stories, the kind of stories a pre-teen kid could get into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Au2-J-3on0&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Dirksen telling a story about lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I wondered what happened to the American politicians who could tell a story? There aren't many. Certainly not in Congress or the executive branch, or even the court. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a bigger problem than it first appears. Because to be good at telling a story is being good at relating to other humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Trump is a good storyteller. People think that Trump resonated with his supporters because they're racists and narcissists, like Trump, but it could just be that he can tell a story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His stories always have him as the hero, and tend to blame immigrants, people of color for all the problems, but a Woodie Guthrie or Will Rogers for example might get the same people to vote Democratic. That is if you still believe in the basic goodness of most people, which I desperately try to cling to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>First major difference between the new iPhone and the old one -- the new one has 512GB of memory, the previous one had 64GB. That means that I can have all my apps loaded at the same time, where the system would always be swapping them out. That makes a big difference around where I live where cell coverage is very spotty.</description>

			<description>I was having breakfast with a local friend the other day and we were talking about the Beatles. He is not a fan. He cited as an example that Hey Jude is too long, at over 7 minutes. I had never thought about that. I expected that it was meant to crowd out other music on FM radio, where the standard song length was more like 3 minutes. He said he didn't know about that. I said if it were tech instead of music that would definitely have been the motivation. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+hey+jude+so+long&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; it up.</description>

			<title>Doc Searls on iPhone 13</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc&lt;/a&gt; commented on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; saga in a thread on Facebook. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All these companies, Apple included, have service systems that are big B2B backends sold and serviced, again as a B2B thing, by Salesforce, Oracle, ServiceNow and other giants which, in the business, they call &quot;arms dealers.&quot; And all of them put all of the blame for their system failures on the poor low-wage workers who handle the phones when &quot;please go to our website&quot; and &quot;talk to our chat system&quot; diversions don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then, after the service fails, usually because the system and not the voice on the phone is to blame, they want you to complete a survey the whole purpose of which is to punish or not punish the poor person who failed to solve the problem they couldn't solve.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only way to solve this is by creating new systems that start by equipping customers with their own standardized ways to interact with any service function on the sellers' side, at scale. We actually have tools for that called phones and browsers, but we need to advance on both.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="All these companies, Apple included, have service systems that are big B2B backends sold and serviced, again as a B2B thing, by Salesforce, Oracle, ServiceNow and other giants which, in the business, they call &quot;arms dealers.&quot; And all of them put all of the blame for their system failures on the poor low-wage workers who handle the phones when &quot;please go to our website&quot; and &quot;talk to our chat system&quot; diversions don't work." created="Thu, 17 Feb 2022 20:13:55 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/17/201350.html?title=docSearlsOnIphone13#a201355"/>
				<source:outline text="And then, after the service fails, usually because the system and not the voice on the phone is to blame, they want you to complete a survey the whole purpose of which is to punish or not punish the poor person who failed to solve the problem they couldn't solve." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/17/201350.html?title=docSearlsOnIphone13#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="The only way to solve this is by creating new systems that start by equipping customers with their own standardized ways to interact with any service function on the sellers' side, at scale. We actually have tools for that called phones and browsers, but we need to advance on both." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/17/201350.html?title=docSearlsOnIphone13#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
