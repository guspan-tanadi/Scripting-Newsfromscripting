			<description>How many people who will be enraged over the abortion decision, didn't vote for HRC in 2017 because they didn't trust her. This would not be happening if a few more people came out to vote on election day in 2016.</description>

			<description>To Democratic marketers (I hope there are some) -- it's time to introduce a new actor to American politics -- The Federalist Society. Treat it like the right treats Sharia Law or Critical Race Theory, only of course the FS is real. And the conspiracy is real. It's how we got here. I heard Biden on the radio this morning talking about MAGA being behind this. That's not useful and it's not true. The MAGA people will really be hurt by this. Now is a good time Mr President, to try to unite us. This is the real anti-people Republican Party. The 1%. The Federalist Society. It's a plot to rob us of our rights. To turn America into a religious dictatorship. Mr President here's your chance to be transformative. But first you need to learn how to talk about it.</description>

			<description>Is abortion “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition?” Among people alive today, most of whom have lived their whole adult lives in a country where abortion was always constitutionally protected, yes it is very much deeply rooted.</description>

			<description>The events of the last few days are proof that reporters should never guess the outcome of an election months before it happens. Even today, after the news of the Roe v Wade decision leaked, they're saying that Repubs are expected to take control of Congress in the November election. Let's dive into that supposed fact. Who is doing this expectation? Shouldn't they say? Isn't it just reporters who expect that? Like so much news this is like barbers cutting each others' hair. They isn't any actual news. They should always be aware that anything could happen and almost always does that could change the expectation, so stop advertising your expectations, they have no value as news.</description>

			<description>Consider the possibility that the leak of the Alito decision might not have anything to do with Roe v Wade. It might be the work of a Putinite wanting to distract attention from the atrocities they're committing in Ukraine.</description>

			<description>The Supreme Court protects the rights of Americans. They’re not a religious body, they are not chartered to adjudicate religious questions, because there is no religion attached to our government. That part is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/&quot;&gt;the text&lt;/a&gt; of the Constitution, for our textualist  friends.</description>

			<title>Outliners and big code comments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1521719807116148736&quot;&gt;Scott Hanselman laments&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;No one writes code comments today like we wrote code comments in the 90s,&quot; citing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffwilcox/status/1519742875759611904&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; with a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/04/oldSchoolBigCodeComment.png&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1521805736124325889&quot;&gt;My response&lt;/a&gt; -- I do leave big code comments, and it's not painful because I use an outliner, and do it carefully and consistently. There's a big comment the top of each major routine, it’s like a blog, with reverse chronologic notes about each major change. At the end of the list in the first comment is an explanation of what it does, params, etc. And since it’s in an outliner, it’s all collapsed until you need to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/listings/oldschool.html&quot;&gt;read-only outline&lt;/a&gt; listing of oldschool.js, the CMS that renders this blog. If you scroll down to &lt;i&gt;publishBlog&lt;/i&gt; and expand it, you'll see a Changes sub-outline. Expand it to see the changes, and under each change are notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This format goes all the way back to the 90s believe it or not when we started coding in an outliner in Frontier. It's the way to organize internal docs. And yes they are absolutely necessary if you plan to maintain and build on the code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I watched a lot of news this evening. I forget who said this -- women do not want Ted Cruz controlling their bodies. I think that's compelling. I, too, would not  want &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1521331931878731776/photo/1&quot;&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt; anywhere near my body.</description>

			<description>An idea for a movie. Get a writer to transcribe the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt; fiction, turn it into a screenplay. That's the story. I bet it would be a box office smash. I'm surprised Hollyood hasn't done this yet.</description>

			<description>People used to assume you have to make money from a blog, which is ridiculous. My blog did make me money but only incidentally, by making products of mine more famous, or helping establish standards that allowed me to build other products. But I never did this for the money, I pay money to do the blog. I do it because I have ideas that I want to get out there. It's worth it.</description>

			<description>Ukraine had to deal with what we're &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1521145126390796288&quot;&gt;going through&lt;/a&gt; now. Their political system was undermined by Putinites, proclaiming their right to speak, but they were undermining their democracy like the Putinites here are today. They solved the problem by being hardcore about it. Free speech is not more important than survival of democracy. We will have to make that choice too, until we do, we'll be stuck where we are.</description>

			<description>I don't know how McCartney came up with the idea for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;, but I imagine he goes into a junk store and takes a look around. Then he goes home and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paulmccartney/junk.html&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; a song about what he saw. &quot;Candlesticks, building bricks, something old and new.

			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1520786270728990721&quot;&gt;trying to figure out&lt;/a&gt; why Wordle's reports get mangled when they come through the Twitter API.

Update: It appears it has nothing to do with the Twitter API, rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1520791215414947847&quot;&gt;the fonts&lt;/a&gt; that are used to render the page.</description>

			<title>I want my karass</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem on Twitter is that no one will hear this tweet. Because trying to stay in touch with 1000 people is utterly impossible. Some people follow many more. And then there are the people you don't follow who have a good idea. How do you keep that channel open without also leaving it open for scammers. We haven't figured that out yet. As far as I know, no one is trying. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What we are left with -- everyone's attention even for the things you follow relatively closely is infinitesimal, and it's constantly diminishing. So it gets even harder for ideas to circulate because nothing penetrates. How can I forward you something you need to know if I never see it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I yearn for is a &quot;karass&quot; system, for the 12 people who I want to communicate with who I know will pay attention, and will let me build up ideas over a period of weeks or months. And I do the same for them. Their projects connect with mine, we're constanty improving the system, creating new gateways, modifying others. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had that work once in 2001, when I was working on Radio UserLand with a small team of people spread out over the world. Ever since I have been trying to recreate the experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: According to the Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle#Bokononism&quot;&gt;Cat's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, a karass is &quot;a group of people linked in a cosmically significant manner, even when superficial linkages are not evident.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
