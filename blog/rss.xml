For people who worked on outlines in Frontier, have a look. I found a way to work on outlines as JavaScript structs. It's very efficient and much easier to program.</description>

It's as if I didn't get a PC until the IBM PC came out. Or maybe later. Here's something I figured out the other night, driving on a mountain road with lots of turns and ups and downs, a road I'm quite familiar with -- the Tesla makes you a better driver. This is something my Subaru does too, you only have to hold the steering wheel loosely while navigating the turns and ups and downs. The road is well-marked and the car knows what to do. The Tesla even more so. It's like my iPhone which takes better pictures in 2021 than the 2011 model did. We like to say &quot;no filters&quot; but the truth is they're just really good filters that make you think you're the photographer, but the phone did the hard work. Same with the Tesla. I like driving it in the same way. It flatters me to think I'm that good a driver. I know the truth though -- I didn't become a better driver, I just got a car that makes me feel that I did. And who wouldn't love that.</description>

Next: eliminate the numbers, add links, simple styling, let me give it a title (optional) and we’re ready to rock. Think they’ll have that by say 2030?</description>

The exercise is making me stronger. I don't know why I didn't want to do the classes. I love my teacher, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emmalovewell?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;Emma Lovewell&lt;/a&gt;. She's super nerdy. When we're doing something particularly strenuous, I close my eyes, focus on my breathing, in through the nose, out through the mouth, and I listen to her say that this pain is worth it because it'll become strength when the workout is over. It's so true. I don't particularly care for the music she chooses, I don't know any of it, and it's not catchy. But she's a lot younger than I am, so I guess this is the kind of music the young folk listen to? I'd love it if there were a Tom Petty ride or a Grateful Dead ride. I can see riding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFnOfpIJL0M&quot;&gt;Refugee&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdPOAhBp2Ag&quot;&gt;US Blues&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Markdown work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Going to do some more cleanup work this morning on Markdown support in Old School. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/14#issuecomment-974824472&quot;&gt;the thread continues&lt;/a&gt;. If you're planning on using Markdown to write blog posts in Drummer, you might want to tune in, because things are being locked down today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are only two rules that govern how Old School generates source for the Markdown processor:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One newline per outline node. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Indentation belongs to the author, generates nothing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I sent a private note to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, letting him know this discussion is going on. As far as I know we are setting prior art for outliners used to generate Markdown for publishing. If there is prior art, I would love to know about it now, asap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is different from the Obsidian model also used by LogSeq -- which uses Markdown as a file format for outlines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: Here's a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/11/21/153825.html?title=updatesToMarkdownSupport&quot;&gt;this morning's changes&lt;/a&gt; to Markdown support for publishing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This used to be a complex thing to do, but it's absolutely as simple as it can be. I did something new here. I'm only passing through values that are documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;. That's not as draconian as it might sound, because I'm using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; written by my friend Dan MacTough that handles all the common feed flavors, including Atom. His code translates the variants to a common vocabulary. And I further winnow it down to just the basic concepts. To some extent, RSS grew in an unruly chaotic way, but imho the core is solid. After all this time, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; as a new platform, I think it's a good time to pause and create (hopefully) a simpler future that can work better.</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/14#issuecomment-974157255&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about how Markdown should be processed for Drummer blogs. Basically, what role if any should indentation play, and how many newlines to generate for each line in the outline. My current position -- indentation should play no role in the Markdown we generate from the outline, it should be ignored. And we should generate one newline for every line in the outline. Note this is not how Drummer works now.</description>

			<title>What people at bigco's say for 2000, Alex</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something I've been hearing from employees of big tech companies for my entire career, going back to the late 70s --&gt; &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what they say and do. So many examples. And almost all of them are gone. They were significant, maybe, for a few weeks. Then poof, some other asshole at some other tech giant comes along, and gets his or her (mostly his) few minutes to be a super asshole. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How much more would we get done if we lived up to the hype about supporting innovation. You can't do a lot of that as some random putz inside of a bigco. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You pretty much have to do what I've done, which is stay out of those monstrous structures, that is, if you want to actually do anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then of course the jerks come along and kick over your sand castle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then they're gone in a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So far I've survived them all. Knock wood, praise murph, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A simple XML viewer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you view a normal XML file in the browser, Chrome gives you a simple, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/18/xmlviewofscriptingopml.png&quot;&gt;readable XML viewer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to invoke that viewer from a JavaScript app running in the browser. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some kind of JavaScript call like&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; window.xmlViewer (xmltext);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only other option is to rewrite it from scratch, which I'm open to doing but would rather not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/226&quot;&gt;Does anyone know if such a thing exists&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, one of the things that kind of silently limits the size of RSS is the way browsers display RSS feeds. They can handle other XML types in a normal sensible way. But the RSS viewer is broken. I wish they would just let it be, and show it as a normal XML file. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/226&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to discuss Markdown with people who know Markdown and use Drummer. We should have a Markdown nodetype. I've been playing around with it, but I'm not satisfied with what I have yet, not ready to lock it down.

			<title>A week of Peloton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had my &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Peloton&lt;/span&gt; for a couple of weeks now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've done a session every day for the last six days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At first I didn't think I wanted to do the classes, but the second time I tried a class I was intrigued, then by the third, I was hooked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The exercise on a Peloton is more than twice the exercise you get riding around the moutains on an E-bike. It's hard work going up the hills, but you get to just have fun going down, there's no work involved. So 20 minutes of Peloton riding equals 40 minutes of road riding. Only it's even more, because you're working harder. Always harder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My legs feel stronger and healthier, and overall I feel that way too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An entirely positive experience, and my idea of what exercise is about is shifting in an interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And -- tomorrow I get my Tesla Model 3. So I expect some more major horizon busting is to come. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My Peloton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this thread on Twitter this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’ve had a Peloton for a couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I got it so I could exercise when the weather is too nasty to go out for a ride or a walk.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’ve done classes and rides with no content. I don’t like the classes. The impersonal “you can do I it” motivation is a real turn off. Who the heck are you, and yiu have no clue who I am. Ugh.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why not have classes where you learn something? Then I’d look forward to it, instead of dreading it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m going to keep trying with the classes. Basically I am already motivated, I love the high I get from exercise. But I wouldn’t mind using the time to learn stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then this evening I took a class with a teacher I really liked. And it made all the difference. I got a better workout, and I had fun. I even talked back a few times. Totally got into it. Weird. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Peloton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Blogs, newsletters, and whatever new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_press&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamphlet&quot;&gt;come&lt;/a&gt; up in the future. This would initially be an internal resource, but the obvious next step is to share the resource with their readers, in the interest of increasing news flow, broadening perspectives, and also introducing transparency. And perhaps most important to introduce criticism of their work to their flow, something we need and they need. If I were going to beg for anything that would most likely be it. I wrote about how this would work in more detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/13/howToHaveAFuture.html&quot;&gt;May 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I read yet another NYT article or op-ed about how Facebook is letting us down, I keep wondering when they're going to look at how &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; contribute to this problem, how their coverage of Hillary's Emails, for example, gave Trump the White House, and set the country on the path to authoritarianism. I think they did far more damage than Facebook, and not surprisingly, that has not been examined to anywhere near the extent Facebook has. This is a serious problem, and it's not going to get better in the current news system. That's where rivers could make a huge difference, if they cared enough about the service they provide readers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytimesriver.com/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is what a River of News looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When I was starting out in tech, after getting a degree in computer science, I was drawn to PCs because the adults hadn’t gotten there first. They were still simple. If they had kept their stuff simple, I might have invested on their platforms. The web after all these years is still really simple if you ignore Google and use common sense. It’s still possible to see the web as unspoiled as it was at the beginning. Just ignore Google and it’s all good.</description>

When I read the post, I was pretty sure this was the name. I love how it connects to the name of the product, and it conveys the utility of having a language in a product such as Drummer. It also reflects the duality of the product. You can beat the drum in Drummer by writing, if you're a poet, and if you're a plumber, there's Drumkit. It's also nice because it leaves open the option of the language existing outside of Drummer, but no one will miss that the language &lt;i&gt;came from&lt;/i&gt; Drummer. That's important I've found. I left similar clues in RSS and in podcasting. I think naming a product is a community thing, the best names don't come from one person's mind. Gary understands a lot about what I'm trying to do with the language, how else could he have devised such a perfect name. He can be proud, much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;Dannie Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; can be proud of coming up with the name we eventually used for what we were calling audio blogging, even though there's a British journalist who falsely claims to have coined the term. Already the Drummer community has made a great contribution to Drummer. Many thanks! 🥁</description>

			<title>Morning ramble</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I signed up for Twitter Blue for $2.99 under the mistaken impression that it got me through paywalls. Okay it doesn't do that. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to pay $100 a month, but even so I will not use Twitter as the primary way I read news. Not ever going to happen, I already have news reading tools that blow Twitter out of the water. Sorry Jack. I've been working on this stuff for a long time (just like you).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So we're still a really long way away from having rational networked news. Yet the deficiencies of news are what's killing us as a democracy and a world power. It isn't Facebook, that's just a diversion. Most people are falling for it. The problem is that the news system is sick. We talk about inequality in terms of how much money people have, but what about inequality in terms of the information they have access to. I pay for better news that poorer people can. But even with that I'm still  impoverished. News people are lazy. I can't believe they weren't all trying to get a real ticktock of Trump on January 6, starting on January 7 (give them a few hours to get over the shock). But I hear from the Washington Post that they thought they had an innovative idea to look into this in October! Holy shit. Is that what they think news is. Oy we are so lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want news like they portrayed it in Hollywood when I was young. The shit where they go out to get the story that brings down the empire. The biggest story of 2021 is what was Trump doing, who was he calling, what threats was he making, when the insurrection was actually going on. I read the WP story. It's really weak. We should know a lot more by now. And this was happening all through the Trump presidency. The news was resetting expectations constantly, noting that Trump wasn't a normal president over and over. Well we figured that out thanks, now how about telling us what he's actually doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all information impoverished, just pretending we're informed, but in our hearts all of us knowing we have no idea what's being done to us in our own name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why GitHub, for poets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the plumbers fully appreciate the value of hooking up a writing tool like &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; to the default place in the world for posting code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We can do a lot of renderings of outlines in Markdown, which is the writing language favored by GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Watch out, because the docs on GitHub are about to get an upgrade, the same kind of lift blogging gets from writing with an outliner.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Docs are even more structured than blogs.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay that's the plumber's rationale.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For poets, think of GitHub as a great arena where all kinds of sports are played, except in this analogy the sports are ideas and docs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until now there hasn't been a great arena for poets. There's only been such an arena for programmers, and that's very new. GitHub didn't exist as the great programming idea arena until maybe the mid-teens. Maybe it's just now starting to come into its own.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Certainly a big publishing platform like Facebook and Medium had the opportunity to do this, but the too quickly pivoted to business models, and that had a chilling effect at making it a great arena for ideas. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Amazon, amazingly, had the best opportunity to create such an arena, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/18/enduserStorageFromAmazon.html&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to do it, openly, but they wouldn't do it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What does such an arena need? Not a whole lot actually.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A simple user authentication method. The technology for this is called OAuth. It's what everyone uses. It's what GitHub uses. Twitter does, Facebook, Slack, on and on. The important thing about this method of authentication is that YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT.  You use it, you don't even think about it. It makes sense to you. So right off the bat, you're ready to join in. I can put a command in a menu to &lt;i&gt;Log on to GitHub&lt;/i&gt; and you won't be surprised at all by what it does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only other thing it needs to do is storage, and GitHub does that, very powerfully. Have a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader&quot;&gt;ArtDownloader&lt;/a&gt; project for an idea. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/10/artdirectoryscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;huge amount&lt;/a&gt; of art there. It's great stuff. Hook it up to your screen saver, and enrich your life. It's free for you, and guess what, it's free for me too. GitHub says fine, we'll host it, you don't even have to ask. You can create your own repos. I promise you, it's not hard and we can probably even make it easier, given enough time. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why is it such a great arena?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Because you can point other apps to the arena you write to using Drummer, and they can do stuff for you with that data. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a fucking platform. It's free. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another thing it is -- based on an open standard -- GIT. So we're not getting locked in the trunk here. We are free to leave. We are depending on their API which their competitors will hopefully clone. They'd be idiots if they didn't. They probably already are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is where I like to work -- at the edge of possibility. We might be able to bootstrap something wonderful here. I am certainly optimistic myself based on the intelligence and curiosity of the people who are using Drummer. And their collegiality. That's the most important ingredient. I've had all this stuff for years, outliners, code that writes to GitHub, scripting interpreters, etc etc. But having all of it in a package that is used by enough smart people, to help start the bootstrap, that's like the sourdough starters everyone was trading in the early days of the pandemic. You can have all the ingredients, but if you don't have people to play in the arena, nothing interesting is going to happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Then when &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; moved to the web, the apps were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&quot;&gt;MSIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHTTP&quot;&gt;MacHTTP&lt;/a&gt;, then Google and &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, then WordPress and Twitter. Along the way came new protocols -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. Drummer already has excellent scripting support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=twitter.addGroupToList&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I made this a priority to have one really good scriptable app when Drummer came out. Now I'm working on the second biggie. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a143815&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that GitHub could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS&quot;&gt;MS-DOS&lt;/a&gt;. What I meant is that it's basic low-cost storage for everyone with a GitHub account that's about as easy to work with as MS-DOS was. For early adopters, what we used to call power users. It's an amazing resource. And that made me think of MS-DOS because both are owned by Microsoft and storage is basically what MS-DOS did, and btw, MS-DOS is the one product they didn't use as a weapon when they were trying to usurp the web, so it has a nice taste to it, still. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/7&quot;&gt;started a thread&lt;/a&gt;, on GitHub of course, narrating what I've got working. Watch this space.</description>

			<description>I put about twenty &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty&quot;&gt;Tom Petty&lt;/a&gt; songs on my iPhone and have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmFxgEGKH0&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; on and off. The thing about Tom Petty is his songs are the kind that you sing in your head all the time days and days awake or in dreams. To have twenty Petty tunes co-resident means you're living the Tom Petty lifestyle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMyCa35_mOg&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt; for it to pass, but kind of hoping it doesn't. It's kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling&quot;&gt;Rickrolling&lt;/a&gt; but with really good music.</description>
