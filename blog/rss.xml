Journalism will let the center go where ever the Repubs want to put it. Now Roe is extreme, last month it was the settled law, according to all but one of the Supreme Court justices (publicly, privately they were ready to destroy it). The problem isn't Repubs, they're just taking what we're letting them have. The problem is journalism and the Democratic Party, but even more broadly the problem is we don't put a stop to this and tell the Dems clearly that they have to get real, or we won't re-elect them.</description>

Here's the deal. We have a really interesting team, we're going to get really emotionally involved with them next season. We're going to &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; rooting for them, win or lose. So stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Yiddish_origin#Kvetch&quot;&gt;kvetching&lt;/a&gt; and relax. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

They got some things right. The protocol was designed in a couple of weeks by four people, two at Microsoft and two of us not. The Microsoft people were from their networking group. They wanted a cross-platform protocol to do what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model&quot;&gt;DCOM&lt;/a&gt; does. It was and is a brilliant idea. I wanted it as a way of designing APIs for scriptable blogging systems. We were in the process of shipping a new Windows version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, we already had a Mac version, and I wanted the two Frontiers to work beautifully together on LANs and on the net. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it, when I figured out that it would be done with XML and HTTP. I then got an email from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft asking if I wanted to work with them on this. I always admired Bob and people like him at Microsoft, they had an excellent engineering culture imho, so of course I said yes. What followed was one of the most productive collaborations of my career. And as a result not only did Frontier get great cross-platform compatibility, all the early blogging systems has compatible APIs. To the Hacker News folks, that's what matters in a protocol, what kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; did it enable. See my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt; for more on this.</description>

			<description>I want Biden to step back after the election and let the Democrats have a great primary campaign where we really discuss, as a country, what our options are going forward. Not limited to things considered too daring, like expanding the court. It's clear Biden will not do what we need. But that's okay, his greatest contribution would be to create a stage for the next generation of leaders to work things out, along with Bernie Sanders and others.</description>

Why can't I have the full text of the article in the right panel of the reader?

			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who say we shouldn't criticize Dems are crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're losing on every front and all the Dems have to say is we need to vote so they can codify reproductive rights, which is, sad to say only a small part of the problem, a symptom of the disease, not the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic leadership has yet to commit to doing anything about all the other chaos that the Supreme Court has inflicted on us. It's not good enough to bring back reproductive rights, we have to neutralize all the other attacks as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a voter, citizen, taxpayer, human being -- this is unacceptable. If the current leadership of the Democratic party can't get this together, now, then we must act quickly to get new leadership. We don't have any time to waste. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Twitter appears to be down this morning. I have no idea what to do with myself. Clicking the Twitter icon in my browser's chrome is an unconscious thing. Only when Twitter is down do I really feel it. Amazing that Twitter can't find a way to monetize that. (At 9:20AM Eastern it's back up. Whew.)</description>

			<description>I noticed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1546615344780914688&quot;&gt;Twitter promotes&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tweepy.org/&quot;&gt;Python toolkit&lt;/a&gt; for API support. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davetwitter&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; for Node.js, and it does a lot of extra stuff, like merging Twitter threads into a single tweet. I also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/docServer/blob/main/docs/pages/twitter.md#&quot;&gt;Twitter support&lt;/a&gt; in the scripting language in &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and that's even easier.</description>

			<title>Medium in the rear-view</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People are writing their summaries of Medium's accomplishments today, because yesterday Evan Williams announced he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/220712/p14#a220712p14&quot;&gt;stepping down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO to start an R&amp;D company. Here are the ones I've seen people mention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Clean look.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't have to start a blog to write a post.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Authors have a way to make money.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No argument with the first item. Design was always its big thing. It was designed by someone who understood writing and reading on the web. That's the thing that made it stand out in 2012 when it started, and now its ethos has been absorbed by designers everywhere and that was good positive contribution to web design. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not having to start a blog is mainly a matter of how they present it. You don't have to give your space a name. Maybe that is an impediment for writers. As a designer myself, I'm taking note. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;About making money, I think that was the fatal flaw of Medium. The thing that no one could relax about for a moment. It was always judged on those terms. I didn't think it was achievable ten years ago, and I don't think it's achievable today. Writing publicly on the net is about something other than being paid as a writer and funding a public writing space as Williams and Medium's outside investors did, shouldn't depend on whether Medium makes money. I just don't understand why someone who's worth as much money as Williams cares in the slightest whether his new (in 2012) blogging system made money. He didn't care if Blogger made money a few years earlier when he was broke! Now that he has an infinite amount of money all of a sudden he cares about making money? I don't know. Doesn't make any sense to me. It's okay to make software just because you love to make software, even if making money is not the motive.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now Substack has taken Medium's place as the default place of for-the-record-writing, and once again they've tied a business model to public writing, and that will make them do all kinds of contortions to restrict the movement of their writers and eventually readers, because at some point their investors will want to know how they're getting paid. And of course investors have every right to expect to make money, that's why they invested. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One time around this loop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At some point, I hope the default place of for-the-record-writing is an easily cloneable system that supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twowayRss&quot;&gt;Two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt; then we can all relax and wish them the best, and see it as a good thing for the flow of ideas on the net. But as long as these systems are tied to the expectations of VCs, we will never get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Maybe one of the foundations would support an open, cloneable and free place of for-the-record-writing to once and for all remove the business model from this important societal function?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium as the place-of-record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I talk about default place-of-record writing in this piece, something that everyone knows about but I haven't seen people write about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you want to get something on the record, people still use Medium, but it's not the only place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I knew something was out of whack when the President of the United States, Barack Obama, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ObamaWhiteHouse/president-obama-addresses-the-nation-on-keeping-the-american-people-safe-b4cfa8a0f143&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; it for that purpose. The taxpayers gave him a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; for that. He should have used it. Archives is something the US government knows a lot about, and the United States itself is a lot more long-lived that a struggling Silicon Valley startup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I knew something weird was happening when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Baquet&quot;&gt;Dean Baquet&lt;/a&gt;, the Executive Editor of the New York Times, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amedium.com+Dean+Bacquet%2C+the+Executive+Editor+of+the+New+York+Times%2C+wrote+a+Medium+post&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsbJrF7zqIeZsYzxJM16xR5mMiIXrA%3A1657739233902&amp;ei=4RfPYq3VNuaJptQP18mY8Ao&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtyarxx_b4AhXmhIkEHdckBq4Q4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=site%3Amedium.com+Dean+Bacquet%2C+the+Executive+Editor+of+the+New+York+Times%2C+wrote+a+Medium+post&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BAgAEEc6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEEcQsAMQyQM6CggAEOQCELADGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGAFQ_jtYkVxg9V1oAnACeACAAWuIAZ4JkgEEMTYuMZgBAKABAcgBDcABAdoBBggBEAEYCQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;Medium post&lt;/a&gt; about some newsroom controversy. I guess the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times&quot;&gt;Grey Lady&lt;/a&gt; wasn't a good enough &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_of_record&quot;&gt;place-of-record&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The default place-of-record on the web is valuable space, and it should be a level playing field, and have a commitment to maintain the record so we can refer to what a president said about something a hundred years from now. As far as I know Medium has never said anything about a commitment to maintaining the record, although being a for-profit business they wouldn't do anything to get people to stop thinking of it as the default place-of-record. We need and deserve better. It's time to stop thinking of technology as only a place to make money. It's clearly being used for other important things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="About making money, I think that was the fatal flaw of Medium. The thing that no one could relax about for a moment. It was always judged on those terms. I didn't think it was achievable ten years ago, and I don't think it's achievable today. Writing publicly on the net is about something other than being paid as a writer and funding a public writing space as Williams and Medium's outside investors did, shouldn't depend on whether Medium makes money. I just don't understand why someone who's worth as much money as Williams cares in the slightest whether his new (in 2012) blogging system made money. He didn't care if Blogger made money a few years earlier when he was broke! Now that he has an infinite amount of money all of a sudden he cares about making money? I don't know. Doesn't make any sense to me. It's okay to make software just because you love to make software, even if making money is not the motive." created="Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:53:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/07/13/134729.html?title=mediumInTheRearview#a135351"/>
				<source:outline text="So now Substack has taken Medium's place as the default place of for-the-record-writing, and once again they've tied a business model to public writing, and that will make them do all kinds of contortions to restrict the movement of their writers and eventually readers, because at some point their investors will want to know how they're getting paid. And of course investors have every right to expect to make money, that's why they invested." created="Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:58:45 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/07/13/134729.html?title=mediumInTheRearview#a135845"/>

All my reading tools can hook into their authors' writing. It's good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as a writer, I can't use a system that doesn't do inbound RSS. It's the inverse of the silo problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Such a site insists that I do all my writing on there. That's a deal-stopper because I already have my best writing tool and I do all my serious writing in that tool.  It's as if a radio station insisted that I use their guitar to play music. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someday we'll look back on this practice and think how could we have missed something so obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked writers who use Substack how they feel about this, with mixed results.

			<title>Give us something to remember</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping for something spectacular from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet&quot;&gt;first photo&lt;/a&gt; released from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope&quot;&gt;JWST&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at 5PM, but when I saw it I had no idea what I was looking at. The explanations were technical, and while I am technical in some areas, the cosmos is not one of them. Also as someone who was raised in NYC -- I didn't grow up with a view of the cosmos as people who live in more rural areas do. So none of what we saw in that photo means much to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We were told by experts that this was really impressive, I'm sure they're right -- but I was hoping for something that would make me gasp, that would give us &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; something to remember. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am old enough to remember the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/07/20/#a1405894933&quot;&gt;moon landing&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. I suppose there were some who said they shouldn't bother with a TV camera for live broadcasts, but they had it, and we saw Neil Armstrong climb down the ladder and say his famous first words. This moment is probably just like that. The first time we're seeing the cosmos as a peer, not from the point of view of someone on or near a planet, but from the perspective of a solar system. Maybe at some point we'll have a telescope outside of our solar system, but I won't be around for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I tuned in at 5PM for the great unveiling, I was greeted with nothing. There was nothing on the TV channels I tuned into. Nothing on Twitter. A few hours later on Twitter I saw a picture a bunch of blurry lights. I was told this was it. Come on folks, point the camera at something we know. &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/2490/saturns-rings-shine-in-hubble-portrait/?category=planets_saturn&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt; perhaps. Maybe Earth. It's not what the telescope is for, I get it, nor was the moon landing for sending a TV show back to Earth, but we're the audience for the moment. Give us something we can remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway there's another moment coming up this morning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webb.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/countdown.html&quot;&gt;the official unveiling&lt;/a&gt;.

I made up a new slogan -- Shea Stadium Rules. No bullshit while we're focused on the one thing in the world we truly agree on. The New York Mets. She agreed. Because it was true. When it came to the Mets nothing was more important. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I'd invoke Shea Stadium Rules in other places, esp since they tore down Shea Stadium, something I totally didn't approve of (does the Catholic Church tear down the Vatican to add a couple of skyboxes?

			<description>As if to prove that billionaires can be putzes too, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/jeff-bezos-this-is-what-you-are-going-to-regret-at-80.html&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos says&lt;/a&gt; the same old boring shit about what you'll regret when you're 80. I mean how could he know. If he asked 80-year-olds there's a pretty good chance they lie to him, I expect. I wouldn't trust them. Here's what I think, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1545431247417139200&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what you'll regret at 80 -- that you aren't 20. Heh. And btw it's because sex is great at 20. So if you're 20 you should do a lot of that. At least it'll make you smile when you're 80 (I imagine).</description>

			<description>Every time I hear someone talk about podcasting in such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardberryuk/status/1545385842956550145&quot;&gt;mainstream way&lt;/a&gt; I feel a sense of accomplishment. Podcasting made a difference. It worked. The thing that really gives me pride is that it can serve as an example to young developers that their work can make a difference, and it isn't all about making huge piles of money, and you don't have to work for a big corporation, if you think creatively and seek out others with a similar perspective.</description>

It &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/07/twitterNotePresents.png&quot;&gt;presents&lt;/a&gt; as a link to an off-site story. When you click the link, it takes you to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/notes/1544501177814880256&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on twitter.com, where you can read the story, which is limited to 2500 words (a lot). It can include images and embedded tweets and links to offsite pages. The author uses some bold and italic styling. A story has a title. All this is good. Are there limits on what you can link to? Impossible to say. The link to the note also includes a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/notes&quot;&gt;howto page&lt;/a&gt; for Twitter Write, which presumably is the tool you use to write a Twitter Note. You can edit a note after posting it, unlike a tweet. They say they are still developing it. I highly recommend a different user interface on the Twitter timeline, that they present a note analogously to how they present an image, video, audio chat, etc -- that is, inline. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;mockup&lt;/a&gt; of how this would work in 2015. The way they present it now, i think most users will see the links to notes as they see all other links, not worth the trouble. By putting it inline, they start reading, and when they want more, they just click the more link. There's great prior art for this -- Facebook. It works there, it would work great on Twitter.</description>

			<description>BTW -- to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterDev&quot;&gt;TwitterDev&lt;/a&gt; -- is there an API for Notes? This is a crucial question. If yes, then devs will be able to hook great editorial tools to Twitter in ways no one has been able to do before. It will open so many doors not just for Twitter, but for the entire net.</description>

			<description>The other day I replied to a tweet by a famous  columnist and even though the trolls couldn't reply, a  number of them did QT it with the usual boring crap. Then I remembered I had turned Twitter's quality filter off. I turned it on and they went away. Poof. As if they never existed.</description>
