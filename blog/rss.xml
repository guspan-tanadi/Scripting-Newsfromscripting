			<description>The memory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22google+reader%22&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; may have faded so much that Google appears ready to try again. Even the headline of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/undead-again-google-brings-back-rss/amp/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch article&lt;/a&gt; is disturbing. Google did so much damage to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, the thought of them &quot;reviving&quot; it is analogous to Exxon reviving the site of some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfund&quot;&gt;huge oil spill&lt;/a&gt;, one that they didn't contribute to cleaning up. Even worse, browser vendors have no place trying to provide the user interface for RSS. Another toxic dump site. If Google wants to help RSS, great -- here's how. Do the subscribe button, that's a good thing. But the result should be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/15/feedReaderDevs&quot;&gt;dynamic OPML subscription list&lt;/a&gt;, that the user can provide to any reader app they want. It's dynamic in that the contents can change, and the readers should periodically check to see if feeds have been added or removed. This way, if someday Google abandons RSS, again, everything can keep on ticking, more or less. Inviting users to rely on them shows that they have no sense of responsibility for the trust they betrayed in the past. Perhaps users can refuse to go on this ride? That might be too much to hope for. And TechCrunch, they're hopeless, have been for a long time.</description>

			<title>Newsgeist calendar</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/newsgeist?lang=en&quot;&gt;Newsgeist&lt;/a&gt; this year, and accepted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a virtual conference, so no travel is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The conference is split in two parts, Ignite and Discussion. Each set of sessions is split into four groups, for various time zones around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/18/newsgeistSchedule.png&quot;&gt;official calendar&lt;/a&gt; is hard to figure out because they don't translate all the times into my home timezone which is Eastern Time in the US. So I did a little table with the times in my timezone. You can easily translate to yours, I hope. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ignite sessions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;APAC -- May 17, 5AM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;LATAM -- May 18, 4PM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;EMEA -- May 19, 11AM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;North America -- May 20, 5PM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion sessions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;APAC -- June 14, 10:30AM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;LATAM -- June 15, 9:30AM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;EMEA -- June 16, 4:30AM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;North America -- June 17, 11:30AM ET&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only hard ones to figure out were the APAC times, which are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/sgt&quot;&gt;SGT&lt;/a&gt;, which is 12 hours ahead of Eastern time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you see errors, let me know! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I hear there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/booming-podcast-industry-comes-age-with-ambies-awards-show-2021-05-15/&quot;&gt;podcast awards&lt;/a&gt; last night. The companies sponsoring it are the ones trying to own podcasting. If they succeed we will all lament how podcasting used to be something anyone can do, but now they're all Disneyland and Burger King. You know when blogging started getting big, all the news orgs said they started blogs. We said yeah if you use blogging software to publish your articles that's not a blog. The point of both blogging and podcasting is that they are media open to anyone. No one can create rules that you have to adhere to, like Apple with their app store. Facebook has standards, and the same journalists who tried to usurp blogging want them to make them make us conform with more of their rules. What can you say, except corporatism keeps trying to own everything. Nice, good for them, but it's boring and fucked up.</description>

			<description>I don't know why I continue to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_episodes#Season_4_(2021)&quot;&gt;Handmaid's Tale&lt;/a&gt;. It's the most ridiculously written show. Every scene is more ridiculous than the one before it. People keep changing their minds. One scene a character is in Toronto, safe from Gilead, then they show up in Chicago at the front, in the closing scene, meant as some kind of cliffhanger, I suppose. What is she doing in Chicago the writers must have thought we'd all be wondering. Can't wait till the next episode. Knowing there will be no good reason other than she felt she belonged there or some stupid shit like that. Aunt Lydia is a big power broker in Gilead, even though she's one of hundreds of aunts and a loser, and ridiculous. June Osborne keeps ranking on her. No explanation why this aunt is the new boss, except that she's played by one of the stars of the show. I should've stopped watching it a long time ago. But I obviously hate myself enough to keep going.</description>

			<description>This may sound odd, but I think the most direct way to fight what the Repubs are trying to do to our voting rights is urgent and broad education about slavery in America. We need to quickly learn who we, this country, really are. Even people who immigrated here. No matter what was done to us, we joined a country built on slavery. It never went away, despite what we were taught in school, and what we came to believe when we elected a black president. We are very much still fighting slavery.</description>

			<title>Twitter could help fix news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/newsbox.png&quot;&gt;box&lt;/a&gt; in the upper right corner of their web interface that lists news stories they think I might be interested in. I almost always ignore it, or try to, because I've been trained to believe that clicking a link in that box is a total waste. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I'm hoping two new developments with Twitter mean they may be doing something to fix that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter&quot;&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; Scroll.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/looks-like-twitter-may-be-working-on-a-subscription-ser-1846903280&quot;&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; that they're going to have a $2.99 per month subscription plan. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The dream.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As long as Twitter is collecting money from me for the subscription, they can also let me give them say $25 per month to give to news publishers when I go from Twitter to reading their otherwise paywalled stories. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A story I was interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This morning they had an item about how Bill Gates owns a big piece of Canada's largest railroad network. This is a current interest, how the non-philanthropist side of Bill Gates is more or less the same as before inventing his philanthropist alter-ego. I'm wondering how much the philanthropy is just good PR, vs a real change of the goals of a hugely rich and aging person (Gates and I were born in the same year, so I have an idea). He said, during his most active years in tech that someday he would stop being a predator, and start giving away his money. That's a full-time job he'd say.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shots and links.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I clicked the link. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/newsbox.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. It took me to Twitter's news page, but there's no obvious link to the story, just a synopsis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/topOfTwitterStoryPage.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;) that isn't even about the investments. Oy I've been sold a bill of goods, I thought to myself. I looked everywhere for a link to the story, but it doesn't seem to be there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Eventually I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TorontoStar/status/1393658704529170432&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; further down the page from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TorontoStar&quot;&gt;@torontostar&lt;/a&gt; with a link. I clicked it. Aha &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/business/2021/05/15/how-did-bill-gates-end-up-owning-13-billion-worth-of-canadas-biggest-railway.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMedia&amp;utm_campaign=Business&amp;utm_content=billgates&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;source=torontostar&amp;utm_medium=SocialMedia&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_campaign_id=&amp;utm_content=&quot;&gt;here's&lt;/a&gt; the story. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/storyTopOfPage.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. I start reading. But after I get through the first paragraph, which is a repeat of what I had just read on Twitter, I am informed that this story is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/16/paywallArrrrgh.png&quot;&gt;Exclusive to Subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Arrrrgh!! All that just to hit a freaking paywall? You gotta fucking be kidding me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do they have UX people at Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It seems they must know this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience&quot;&gt;UX&lt;/a&gt; sucks. It didn't take me very long to figure that out. Maybe they don't know, so I'm doing them a favor by documenting it. Instead, please let's have a new rule Twitter, offer a deal to pubs via your new Scroll acquisition, they take down the paywall for readers coming from Twitter, in return they are paid a fair price for every click, and the news can start becoming useful, at least to Twitter users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This problem is festering!!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The news industry complains they need money from the government. No that's not what they need. They need to offer their product in an easy to use way that isn't completely diseconomic. It's ridiculous, I am not even slightly in the market for the Toronto Star. I live two hours north of New York City in the US. But they got a story, apparently, that no US paper has, so they're entitled to some money for that. All they're getting from me now is grief. And btw, same with Twitter. Yes, I was interested in a story about the non-philanthropist Bill Gates, they got that right. But I do not have a subscription to the Toronto Star. Surely you can figure that out. If not, I'm willing to tell them which pubs I actually do have subscriptions to. Or better, to repeat myself for the 80,000th time, let me pay. I will pay you. You will make money. You will stop complaining about how there's no money and we can move on from this ridiculous stalemate. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

You will stop complaining about how there's no money and we can move on from this ridiculous stalemate." created="Sun, 16 May 2021 15:00:39 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/05/16/144853.html?title=twitterCouldHelpFixNews#a150039"/>

			<description>Taking off masks now is like letting people bring weapons and explosives on planes, only a bit more damaging and deadly. We’re such pussies in America, wearing a mask is nothing. Wait till you or someone you love gets the disease.</description>

			<description>Everything the Repubs are doing is about white supremacy and reinstating slavery. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/podcasts/1619-podcast.html&quot;&gt;1619 podcast&lt;/a&gt; and reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/26.html#a135710&quot;&gt;Roots&lt;/a&gt; has changed my perspective on what we call racism, but is so much more. Whites in America feel entitled to all the money and to own everyone else.

			<description>I asked lawyer friends and the EFF for help in establishing credit for innovative technologists who choose not to patent their work, but I guess money is all that matters even for the supposedly &quot;good&quot; lawyers. Thus if you want credit for your contributions, even if you'd prefer to give them away, you'd better erect a tollbooth. This came up in the interview I did with Guy Kawasaki that will be part of his podcast, I hope.</description>

			<description>I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Richard+Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; thanking me for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/02/145549.html?title=pleadingForStallman&quot;&gt;standing up for him&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, I thanked him for his many contributions, and for politely telling the people who wanted to destroy him to fuck off. We need more people to refuse to go away just because an internet mob demands it of them. Imagine if &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Donald+McNeil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; had said that to his bosses at the NY Times. They never did tell us why he had to go. And every time something puzzling happens with Covid I think of how they betrayed our trust, not that they care what we think. Clearly they don't. Imho, the only reason to keep the NYT around is to tell us the truth about what's really going on. Well, firing McNeil was something we never did hear the truth about. And I'm not forgetting it.</description>

			<description>I saw Dr Fauci on CNN last night, and it appears he is horribly conflicted by what the CDC did. If he quits, it'd be a scandal. But what they did, in removing the mask mandate, is as bad imho as anything Trump did. Back then he could telegraph his disagreement, but apparently he can no longer do that. &lt;i&gt;People are going to die&lt;/i&gt; because of what they did, possibly many people. We're throwing away the advantage we got from the vaccine. How do I know? I have been paying attention and I know enough basic math to understand that we are not yet in a position to declare victory over the virus. And wearing a mask is a lot easier than being intubated and living for years if not decades with the lingering features of the virus.</description>

			<description>I agree, it was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DrLeanaWen/status/1393030530577444865&quot;&gt;mistake to cancel the mask mandate&lt;/a&gt;. I imagine they did it thinking it would incentivize people to get vaccinated, but it seems it'll do exactly the opposite.</description>

			<description>I figured out the cruise control on my 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Forester&quot;&gt;Subaru Forester&lt;/a&gt;, and it's lovely, interactive. Turn it on, set the speed, and how far you want to be from the car in front, it does the rest. It knows if you take your hands off the wheel and yells at you. The Forester also knows how to stay in lane, even on twisty mountain roads, like the roads where I live. I find  I no longer stress about driving off the road, which is weird because I used to be paranoid about that. But I kind of trust the car to keep me from killing myself.</description>

			<title>We haven't won the war</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's too early to declare victory over the virus. We haven't won.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like a Knicks game where they're leading going into the fourth quarter and then somehow the other team swings into high gear and gets through the Knicks defenses, and they win. It happens even in 2021 (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RozIVdLmNpE&quot;&gt;Lakers game&lt;/a&gt;, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They thought they had the virus licked in India, and then something happened, we don't even know yet what, the balance tipped and virus is winning big, and as a result their health system has collapsed and the near future is bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After the last year &quot;it can't happen here&quot; must be totally discredited right? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway we do not get to declare victory now. It's not over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are kids who can't be immunized, anticipating you'll say kids don't get sick -- that's wrong, they do, and we don't know the long-term effects, and kids are different from adults in that they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; a long-term future. So we have to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who has had a kidney transplant. He got vaccinated, but the belief is that it doesn't do much for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppression&quot;&gt;immunosuppressed&lt;/a&gt; people like my friend. Sentencing him to death because we don't want to wear masks sounds pretty harsh, and that's what it amounts to, if the virus is allowed to run wild. Which is, it seems to me, certain to happen now. There aren't enough vaccinated people to stop that from happening, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Last night the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/knicks-clinch-playoff-berth-first-021855101.html&quot;&gt;Knicks clinched&lt;/a&gt; a spot in the NBA playoffs. Tears are streaming down my sad old face as I write this. The first playoff year since 2012-13, the season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1747434-timeline-of-jeremy-lins-rise-to-linsanity-and-journey-to-where-he-is-today&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;. This year it's a team full of Linsanity. Randle, Barrett, Derek Rose, Quickley, Bullock and so many more. A lovely team like the 1969 Mets. So the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Yb0HCTe1ET4?t=30&quot;&gt;paper bags&lt;/a&gt; come off our heads, at least for a while. We're no long staring into space wondering how a team could possibly suck as bad as the Knicks. Fans being kicked out of the Garden by the owner for telling the truth about him and his stinkin team. Phil Jackson, his triangle offense and all the lousy trades. This was the year the superstars of the NBA spit on the Knicks and went to Brooklyn. There must be a Basketball God who looked at this and said, my dear friends, fate is not in the hands of KD, Kyrie and Harden. I am the master of fate. The Knicks believed in themselves and we came to believe in them, however tentatively. And meanwhile, thankfully, Melo, playing in Portland, seems happy in his new role. For one day in May, pandemic or not, all is good because god loves us and we love the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Double-square brackets revisited</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/12.html#a142449&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I explained what the &amp;lsqb;[square brackets]] are doing in the various outlining products that support them. But I got it wrong. They are simpler than I thought, and represent a feature we had in our web CMSes going back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatdoesclaylooklike.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. They're doing the same thing they do in Wikis.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you've written something in an outline entitled Bill Gates vs The Internet. Then a year later you could link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;lsqb;[Bill Gates vs The Internet]]. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's useful if you give titles to what you write, but this is an old discussion not just in blogland but elsewhere apparently. To programmers it is convenient if every piece has a title. But the truth is most items in web and personal writing don't have titles, in this sense: there isn't an obvious title for them, if you had to come up with one it would be convoluted, and probably collide with some other convoluted title, depending on how long you had been writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the things I write don't get titles, so this feature, with this definition, would be fairly useless to me. I use permalinks in their place, therefore I've made it really easy to generate an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp&quot;&gt;anchor tag&lt;/a&gt; in my writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I started blogging in 1994, all my pieces had titles, but over time, I realized my daily writing comes in long and short bits, and even many of the longish ones don't get titles. I'm not writing for a magazine or newspaper. I'm writing a blog. My thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see how they get around this in Roam by starting a new outline every day, and giving it a title, which is the date. I could do that in my blogging outline, and even in my development status outline. But I have to say I've never wished for such a feature. Maybe now that I know they use them so much in other products I'll get more ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I automatically put a &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; attribute on every node, which is a string representation of the date-time, for example: Thu, 13 May 2021 16:41:07 GMT. From that I generate a permalink for the node, which is displayed next to it in the web rendering by a purple poundsign. If you're reading this piece on the web, you'd see a purple poundsign next to each paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots more to say. In Roam et al, they use links as private connectors. When I refer to a piece called My Favorite Soup that refers to my piece with that title, not yours. But in a wiki, which is a group writing tool, there's only one piece with that name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our outlines have attributes, and conventions for what the attribute names mean. For example, if a node has type &quot;include&quot; and a &quot;url&quot; attribute, that's an include node. The url points to an OPML file. When you expand the node in an outline, we read the file, parse it, and insert its contents under the include node. All that happens instantaneously for not-too-large included outlines. Some people call these transclusions, we call them includes. It's the outline equivalent of an HTML link. In Drummer it will be possible to have these link to specific nodes in outlines. Bookmarks can already do this, in the Drummer in development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+glossary&quot;&gt;glossaries&lt;/a&gt;. And they are explained in lots of places.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here may be the biggest difference between my outline world and the nascent ones. I've tried out lots of approaches to lots of different things in the over 40 years I've been working on outliners. I'm happy to share what I've learned, and I think all of it is applicable to the connected world we live in. But there are also advantages to being a newcomer to this stuff, you start with a clean slate. You might think of something that takes another 40 years to develop, where my horizon doesn't extend nearly that far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are also big differences in the way our outliners work. I could explain that in a podcast, but don't have the time to write it up now. The takeaway is that without open modular connections between the components via APIs, this new burst of outlineism will end up with a sad story of silos and stagnation, not a wonderful explosion like the earlier open platforms. One silo vs a thriving ecosystem -- either approach could win. It's happened both ways in the past. We have to be careful to learn from past mistakes in evolving open platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For that, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1392476430525771780&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt; is a great American. Any Republican who at this time stands for the rule-of-law and the Constitution deserves our support. We may disagree on everything but these basics. We can respect them because we agree on everyone's right to participate in our government. We have this cause in common, to make sure the fascists and would-be slave owners go back into hiding. We have a terrible history to overcome. Another way of looking at it -- Cheney might be one of a small number of Republicans in Congress who aren't owned by Russia.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1392476430525771780&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt; is a great American. Any Republican who at this time stands for the rule-of-law and the Constitution deserves our support. We may disagree on everything but these basics. We can respect them because we agree on everyone's right to participate in our government. We have this cause in common, to make sure the fascists and would-be slave owners go back into hiding. We have a terrible history to overcome. Another way of looking at it -- Cheney might be one of a small number of Republicans in Congress who aren't owned by Russia." created="Wed, 12 May 2021 13:52:26 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/05/12.html#a135226"/>

			<description>Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/11.html#a164404&quot;&gt;yesterday's thread&lt;/a&gt; about integrating &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; with Obsidian, an idea promoted by SMS. He said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sabre23t/status/1392115762358276097&quot;&gt;he expected&lt;/a&gt; that putting a word inside two &amp;lsqb;[square brackets]] would open a page full of links to that word within my outline. This is a very important point, and one I want to focus on. I actually put that feature into the outliner I currently use to write my blog, when I saw how they were doing things in &amp;lsqb;[Roam]] and &amp;lsqb;[wikis]]. I will ship that for sure, it's a good thing, I'm using it myself. But! It would be so much better if all these tools worked together in an open web of these things. That's the way I think about it. Remember, I led the development of &amp;lsqb;[RSS]] in its early years. I always wanted outlines to be &lt;i&gt;world&lt;/i&gt; outlines, ie to include content from other outlines all over the web. I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+%22world+outline%22&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; a lot about that. In that context, I should be integrating with a &lt;i&gt;world wide&lt;/i&gt; service that integrates lots of tools into a database of linked material. Roam insists that you use their editor, which is abhorrent to me, I will never support that, where Obsidian takes the open web approach. So the question I throw back to SMS and others is how can we set things up so a &amp;lsqb;[bracketed]] reference works with the &lt;i&gt;world wide link manager.&lt;/i&gt; We can do this. The technology is totally here. It sounds like &amp;lsqb;[Obsidian]] is off to a good start.</description>

There will be a &quot;controversy&quot; about who the &quot;real&quot; president is. I said Trump will pardon him. Who will do what about that? How many days of fake rage will this generate on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, etc. No one seems to grasp the kind of twisted horror show American politics is becoming. Also, what happens if a Democratic senator dies. It's good to have programmers around. We are paid to think of the worst thing that could possibly happen.</description>

			<description>Interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sabre23t/status/1391981493438668802&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from a person named SMS. &quot;I would love to see how your outliner app can work with Logseq. A few Obsidian users had got Logseq to work with Obsidian on the same folder.&quot; Lots of new terms in that sentence. He posted a pointer to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.obsidian.md/t/logseq-a-perfect-companion-for-obsidian/10887&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is something like Roam, but it's an open system, where Roam is a silo with lots of lock-in. So we like Obsidian over Roam, instantly -- simply because our tools (yours and mine) have a chance of participating, where Roam, well we can use their outliner, and get locked-in, which I don't see happening any time soon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is where we start. Since outlines are in an easily used and open format dating back over 20 years, and can be made accessible to any web-able app (by making them public), it should be possible to &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt; hook it up to Obsidian or any similarly open platform. This is a good place to start. Now, this has to be a community thing, because I'm busy working on a new product, and don't want to detour. And that's why we support open formats and protocols, so there are no limits on what users and devs can do. See my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/10/164703.html?title=myNolockinPledge&quot;&gt;no-lock-in pledge&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't new, it's the same idea I've been using since I started developing commercial software, way back with ThinkTank in 1983.</description>

			<description>BTW, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, and this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricserver.scripting.com/users/davewiner/electric/blog.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; it's generated from. Gives you an idea of how a chronologic outline can be turned into a publication. My blog has been running since 1994, and for most of it, I've been writing it in my outliner. I did take a few detours to use other tools I was working on, but realized eventually that the only writing tool for me is the outliner.</description>

			<title>Testing local file system with Logseq</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay I don't know much about either &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Logseq&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=mozilla+local+filesystem&quot;&gt;local file systems&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm just trying it out, starting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. There was a box I clicked on that asked it to connect with the local file system. I was expecting something like localStorage, but it's not, it's better. The files are stored in a folder on my local system. That means they can be used by, or generated by, other apps. Very nice. I'm not sure what Logseq does with them from there, if they can be connected with other apps in some way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are two screen shots. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. A simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/11/editor.png&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; as I edit it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. What that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/11/markdown.png&quot;&gt;generates&lt;/a&gt; in Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/file-system-access/&quot;&gt;intro&lt;/a&gt; from Google to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/&quot;&gt;File System Access API&lt;/a&gt;, updated in April 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My no-lock-in pledge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, I love there's new interest in outlining software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's too much lock-in in the developing systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is anyone's business who wants to use these systems for collaboration, now or in the future. I may like to use one editor, others may want to use another. Key point: We should be able to collaborate even though we use different writing and organizing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the servers and back-ends, which are so powerful for outliners. They can be used for beautiful tree visualizations, or networks of nodes, presentation slide shows, blogs. There are many different ways of rendering structures created by outliners. You should be able to innovate here without having to write your own outliner! It would be like having to use a different text editor just because you got a new printer. These things should work together. If we've learned one thing about tech over the decades it's that locking people in to using one vendor's tools stops growth. We should compete on the basis of price, performance and features, not lock-in. Users and devs should demand no lock-in. Long-term it means what holds promise now will devolve into a complete mess of things that don't work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There should be simple APIs to connect any outline editor with any back-end used for storage, graphic displays, data crunching.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I promise that all my editors, storage systems and renderers will be connected through simple, open APIs. There will be no lock-in for users or devs. I challenge anyone developing idea organizing software and back-ends to do the same. Users and developers should demand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
