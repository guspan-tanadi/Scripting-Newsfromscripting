			<description>I made the change that I wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/30.html#a150259&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. Now when you go to an instantoutliner.com address, &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/k5&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, it will redirect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, and it will open the outline, read-only, and updates will be live.</description>

He tells a good story. Honorable person in a corrupt administration. Very worthwhile. He answers the questions. I saw John Bolton on MSNBC last night, and he evades them. Vindman worked for Bolton. Vindman would make a good software tester, imho.</description>

			<description>I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-alert-ny/&quot;&gt;Covid Alert NY&lt;/a&gt; on my Pixel 4a. It uses Bluetooth to collect IDs of phones I spend ten minutes within six feed of and remembers them for some period of time. If one of them reports positive with Covid, I get notified. It's contact tracing with phones that we've talked about for a while. Does it work? I guess I hope not to ever find out. Yes I know it probably is a huge drain on the battery and privacy.</description>

			<description>Trump can condemn white supremacists, but it doesn't matter, he still is one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Occam's News%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Occam's News&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Happy birthday Uncle Vava</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today would have been my uncle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Ken Kiesler%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Ken Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;'s, 75th birthday. He didn't even make it &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;to 60&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure he's happy on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie&quot;&gt;hippie&lt;/a&gt; beach in the sky. See you soon &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;Uncle Vava&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, people may not know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/28/212326.html?title=uncleKenAndAuntDorothy&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; was an early blogger. He, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;, were the first two users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, outside of UserLand. In 1998 or 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was my mother's brother, and nephew of German novelist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first member of my family born in the US. I was the second. He was only 10 years older than me, and was as much a brother as an uncle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems so weird that he could ever be as old as 75, but it's even more weird that he's been gone so long already. He died in Jamaica, in 2003, a few weeks before the first BloggerCon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ken and Dot, with a few of Ken's cars, on their land in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crescent+Beach,+FL+32080/@29.7387049,-81.2768389,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e69977c882aea5:0xe61a1afbdfe01fae!8m2!3d29.76886!4d-81.2536786&quot;&gt;Crescent Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I did not watch the debate. I was watching the previews on CNN and MSNBC, and I could see where it was going. I went to sleep instead, as I did on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html&quot;&gt;Election Night in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't really understand what happened until I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/podcasts/the-daily/presidential-debate-election-trump-biden.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, just now, which included excerpts. Trump is dominant. He really practiced dominance. He's got a knack for it. About halfway through the show I realized this is what happens when you debate a troll. You never get to finish a thought, he always has another nit to pick, an annoying way to say something. He disrespects your dead son. He makes it about him, 100 percent. There's no room for anyone else. He was awful on his town hall a couple of weeks ago. A bluff? Anyway, I never thought Biden should debate him, or it should have been with rules that made it impossible for Trump to talk over him. Trump owned the stage last night. Glad I didn't watch, from what I can tell it was a nightmare. Also it was an incitement. The reporters say he &quot;targeted his base.&quot; Not really. He told his nascent militia to make a mess of the election, and he's setting up &quot;the left&quot; to get the blame. We gave him access to 100 million people so he could fuck us up the ass.</description>

			<description>I usually don't write about work as I'm doing it, but wtf, let's give it a try. Today I'm going to pick up the thread I last worked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/littleoutliner/versions.opml#1594307363000&quot;&gt;July 9&lt;/a&gt;. LO2 becomes its own reader app. It was always weird that you had to go outside LO2 to read a published outline. It make the connection uneasy. Not obvious how you'd create an outline of your own. By having the published outline (aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2018/05/06/170728.html&quot;&gt;instant outline&lt;/a&gt;) be viewed read-only in &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, you're right there, in a tab, in the tool that creates these outlines.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld&quot;&gt;Hello World web app&lt;/a&gt; for ES6 modules. It uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/module.js&quot;&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; that defines one function, secsSince. It then calls that from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/code.js&quot;&gt;another module&lt;/a&gt;, and displays the result on the page. It's as simple as I could make it and it works. Not sure I want to use ES6 modules, but at least now I know how to do it, and you do too. All the other tutorials were missing some information you need to understand how modules work. The most confusing thing about modules is that you can only invoke modules from other modules. That means all the JavaScript code in your web app has to be in a module. Not sensible imho, but also not much of a burden. BTW you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/moduleshello/&quot;&gt;run the code&lt;/a&gt; without downloading.</description>

			<description>Joe Biden will show up tonight for a normal presidential debate. Trump is coming to an incitement. He'll point to Biden and say he'll take away your guns. He supports same-sex marriage and abortion. He will give all your money to black people. Biden is the new Hillary. A puppet for the deep state. Your life is over if you allow them to steal this election. The &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; is everyone but White Christian MAGAs. Get ready to revolt. I'll stand by you if you stand by me, says Trump.</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/podcasts/the-daily/donald-trump-taxes-investigation.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the Trump tax returns had a fair amount of info, but overall was disappointing. Barbaro never came to grips with a key idea: Trump is not a rich guy evading taxes. He's broke. He's a loser. That's his usual state, even though he's had two huge windfalls of cash, first from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump&quot;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and then from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;. Each time he's invested in marginal businesses and his management turned them into failures. Then he borrowed, failed to pay back his debt, went bankrupt. He's about to go bankrupt again with the $400 million that comes due in the term he's running for now. But we don't know who he owes the money to, but we can take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_mafia&quot;&gt;good guess&lt;/a&gt;. The big takeaway from the tax returns is &lt;i&gt;Trump is a loser. &lt;/i&gt;It's a shame they don't have a whole podcast series about what's in the returns. We've spent so much time speculating about the truth of Trump, now we have a huge load of data. Podcasts are the best medium for revealing it. Sadly only the NYT has this story, so it's not getting a deep dive.</description>

			<title>The ideal blogging tool</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The ideal blogging tool design would come from merging the publishing of WordPress with the interactivity of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean the culture of either product. WordPress imho is too exclusive in its deployment. It should be easier. And without any FB-like algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You should be able to deploy it on your own. It should install as easily as an app on your iPhone. And you should have full control of hosting. Move whenever you want with no breakage. It should be as easy to port as it was to install.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A cartoon from 2005. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The House could still impeach Trump to halt the ratification of the new Supreme Court justice. And the Democrats, assuming they take power in January, can increase the size of the court to whatever they want. Of course the Repubs will scream bloody murder and the press will repeat that, with volume, because it's an exciting story. And we know the Dems can't stand that. Look what they did to Al Franken. Concerned they would be called hypocrites by the Repubs, itself an act of total hypocrisy, they destroyed his career which was going pretty well, you'd have to say. One of the most eloquent Democrats in a party that has trouble finishing sentences, much less whole thoughts.</description>

All readers know this. Since people in news orgs must read other pubs, they must know it too. We need a meter on our browsers, a set of prefs we easily control, a max budget, a special offer to subscribe when it makes economic sense. Create an &lt;i&gt;easy path to subscribing, &lt;/i&gt;not the brutal wall that interrupts you at exactly the wrong moment. We can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; a rational system for news that grows. The web should be a fantastic way to get news, not the repetive junky stuff we get now, but news with real nutrient value. We're stuck and don't need to be.</description>

			<description>There's some good news about Covid-19 that you don't see in the news -- eventually it will become less deadly. Most viruses in that family do, the virus mutates, and a strain that kills fewer victims comes to dominate, and that process repeats. The virus spreads out to find new victims and over time it weakens. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; ended after two years, with no vaccine, but the virus didn't go away, it became seasonal. It still pops up, to this day, but it's nowhere near the problem it was in 1918. That will probably happen with Covid-19 too.</description>
