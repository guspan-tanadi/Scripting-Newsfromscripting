Those same people think you're rude if you insist that you have done that. I think they get angry, one or two have made fun of me, as if I'm a fool. It's not really very fair or friendly, even though these people may think they're friends. I can think of a dozen people who think I'm rude because I acted like &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is a breakthrough. Or maybe they didn't like the way I said it? Hmm. I wonder how else you could. I've been through this loop over and over. As long ago as 1989 I was thought to be finished as a software dev. I wish it would get easier once. Just once. If I keep beating the drum, I guess when people see I'm not giving up, they might have a look? I'm not giving up, btw. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I learned how to use the web from reporters in 1994. I volunteered to run the SF newspaper strike website, and they were shooting me articles from all over the country, in HTML, and telling me how they wanted them published. Most important -- preserve the links. It was an incredible time of learning and fun and working together. That's when I'm happy, making software for people who have a vision.</description>

			<title>Twitter as a backup</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A good reason to keep a Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon's scaling is an unknown at this point. And it's growing very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Had this thought just now when I couldn't get through to either of the instances I frequent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least think of Twitter as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Still diggin!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The thing I like about the end of 2022 in this part of the internet. My toys are very much on-topic now, after many years of being aggressively ignored by those in-the-know. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I kept wanting to say this. I've been counted out many times only to rise again. Sometimes even I believe that bullshit. I'll keep digging until I can't dig no mo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Was it worth it? Well I had a good all-afternoon nap, so that was pretty good. Now my vision sucks in a new way, but the how-to guide says it'll clear up in a day or two, at most a week. At times the colors are intense, like I imagine an acid trip to be, and some light reflects off objects like a Fourth of July sparkler. I think this is just foreign material being assimilated into human material. Was it worth it? Hmmm. I'll let you know. But I'm pretty sure it was. Your faithful correspondent -- Davey.</description>

			<description>I was looking for links to prior eye surgeries, on the left eye. Not a good story. I started with decent vision, and a left-eye floater freaked me out. An eye surgeon said they could get rid of it, they did, but there was a new dead spot in the middle of my left eye. This surgery, in 2007, has given me crappy vision since then. Finally I had to get the lens in my right eye replaced, that's what was done today. After this, when the dust settles, my vision should be closer to what it was after the first surgery. The lesson: when a doctor says they can fix a condition, find out in advance if the cure is worse. A floater, I learned later, is harmless. Your brain gets used to and and factors it out, you stop seeing the floater after a while. The best thing to do is wait it out. Bigger lesson: if you can avoid surgery, avoid it.</description>

I wrote posts of all lengths, some with titles, on their own pages, and others just a sentence or two or a paragraph, many on the same page. They used to coexist in one flow, and it was great! All of a sudden there was a fork, on one side you had to use Twitter and the other side you could use blogging software, on one side you were locked in and in the other you had choice. We've been suffering this division since 2006 or so. But we're in a really good place now because we could rejoin the two flows, and let &lt;i&gt;writers&lt;/i&gt; decide how much writing each idea deserves, not a random limit imposed years ago without any clear idea of why. Right now please everyone think about what the world would be like if we had blogs and tweets flowing through one pipe. All kinds of new ways of visualizing flows will develop, the boundaries will melt. You can have it all, I promise, as a software developer. As a writer, we'll learn how to play with length without having to edit to fit an engineer's idea of how writing works. It's as if a geek said to a painter you can only create on a 140 pixel canvas. You could make good art that way, but think of all the art you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; make. I promise, you will be inspired by the new kinds of software we make. Most people using computers today have never been around for a blue-sky boom, where all the rules that were holding us back are gone in an instant. We are there right now folks, let's make the most of the moment.</description>

			<description>Some Mastodon posts are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/27/mastopost.png&quot;&gt;gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;. And they're going to look even better when Masto has Markdown support. The version I'm testing has Markdown now (also a 10000 character limit btw). Think of how long it took for Twitter to not do Markdown in tweets. And we've got users to play with. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Users and developers party together.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Where we're headed is a world where it doesn't matter where you write, you can use the tools you love, and it doesn't matter where you read, again what you love, in the moment is what you will use. Computers used to be like this. In the 80s you could use any writing tool you wanted and any printer. There was no concept of a writing tool that was bound to a printer. We're very close to that now, closer than we've been in a decade. I am determined that we do not pass up this opportunity. Seize the moment.</description>

			<title>To MastoDevs re RSS + Markdown</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I posted this on one of the discussion boards for Mastodon devs, but it may not have been the right place. So I'll try here. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm the author of the RSS 2.0 spec, and actively working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and hooking it up to Mastodon. Very excited about what we're building and how well it works with MD.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon's RSS feed is also great. Items that don't have titles don't have titles in the feed.

			<description>An idea for a New Year's resolution. At least once a day agree with someone. Not silently. Say &quot;I agree with you.&quot; No qualification, not &quot;I agree with you, but..&quot; It's jarring at first, then liberating. And the responses will surprise you.</description>

			<description>I can't tell you how convenient it is that Mastodon has the same name as my first real internet presence on CompuServe in the early 80s, also Mastodon. I have a whole language already designed to go with that name. Mastodoctor, for example. For a while we were all adding &quot;bunny&quot; to our names, so I became Mastobunny and then Mastobun for short. Most of these names are available, so I'm tempted, but so far I've resisted. I have bought a couple though. Like most domain names I buy, I'll probably never use them. But it's nice they're there. I keep hoping someday to come up with a service that deserves the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://ou.rs/&quot;&gt;ou.rs&lt;/a&gt; which I've been renewing for many years.</description>

			<description>I had a great talk with Doc Searls yesterday. They're always expressive and irreverant. We had fun at the expense of New Jersey, Kevin Durant, The Nets and of course the current mess at Twitter. I keep thinking we should do a podcast. If there was anyone in the world I want to do one with it would be Papa Doc.</description>

			<description>To &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; users. If Twitter turned us off for some reason you’d still be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/11/17/122301.html&quot;&gt;read your news&lt;/a&gt; while we worked around the outage. But so far there have been no problems that I’m aware of, and rushing to change tested software is a sure way to break things. That said we're making good progress on hooking up to Mastodon. Planning to show off a new way to do news products with FeedLand, and I want to write Mastodon threads in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks due in part to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt; who persuaded the Masto folk that feed items are not required to have titles.

Item titles are optional. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/21/specshot.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;It's in the spec&lt;/a&gt;. In fact it's so important that I said it twice in two different ways in case anyone was confused.

			<description>i have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. Lovely car. After a year, I still love driving it. but it's funny -- no Nazis or smelly wanna be dictators show up in the passenger seat when I'm driving . I think Elon should get Twitter to run like a Tesla and in the meantime just stfu. I hope he knows what stfu means.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5HV0-sFbvw&quot;&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;: I didn't want long posts to dominate the feed, so I came up with this approach, a down-arrow that reveals the full content, in place, without having to go anywhere else. It's this approach that would make it possible to have indefinite length posts in Masto or Twitter or whatever, without dominating the feed.</description>

			<title>Trump is all wrung out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had to say this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1594372293723045888&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is making the same mistake that Kevin Durant did when he signed with the Nets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First thing he did after signing, he had a press conference where he dis'd the Knicks. I guess he was thinking there was some kind of rivalry. There wasn't. No one had any feelings at all for the Nets. A complete zero among NY basketball fans. And the Knicks, well we have a lot of heart there and for the most part it's an ache. The last thing we have any energy for is an idiot who has no idea of the place he's entered, and where we're at, basketball-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Musk has no idea where Twitter users are re Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what led him to believe anyone had any more juice for Trump. Even the people who liked him are tired. He had a good run, as far as &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; go, but we're just tired. Not even remotely excited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump is all wrung out. Even he knows it. But somehow that fact escaped Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
