			<description>When Twitter shuts down client apps everyone says Twitter is bad. But Google deliberately &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;breaks their browser&lt;/a&gt; and blames my blog, people don't seem to care, probably because it sounds like Google is being benevolent when they're actually engaging in a huge act of piracy.</description>

			<title>On owning a Tesla</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Tesla Model Y.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will no doubt get a new EV in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I bought a new PC every year or so when they were new. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn't miss driving a Tesla now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMo36SfyQhw&quot;&gt;Harry said to Sally&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's how I feel about EVs. It's like driving an amusement park ride every time I go out. I deserve this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Lots of choice, but one timeline. And there has to be a basic agreement on what goes in that timeline. What are the elements of a message. A way to define more types, without going to a standards body, which always crush the individual in favor of the bigco's. Something minimal, orderly, easy to document, lots of example code.

			<description>The WordPress user interface must be seen as a platform, a command line, and much higher level writing tools built to run on it. It should be possible to never see the UI of WordPress except for configuration and global settings, much the way you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/16/systemPreferencesMac.png&quot;&gt;System Preferences&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac. This is why blogging software has languished. The software we use for blogging must fit into the One Timeline paradigm, above.</description>

			<description>When I think of obvious missing tech products, I can’t do most of them, because as soon as the idea gained traction as a product it would be taken over by a big company, partly because users prefer that. So a lot of gaps never get filled. That’s the lesson from twitter shutting down the clients again. It isn’t just twitter, you as an independent developer, can’t step into any platform vendor’s territory, they will eventually take away your business.</description>

			<description>If Google  succeeds at burying the open web, we'll create a new open easy to write for web that Google doesn't own. In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about this I suggest we should just use the web since it already does what we will ultimately need. There will be too much creativity locked up behind Google's blackmailing, and it has an easy way to escape, we just need to create a new open web. TBL showed us how to do it, we'll just do it again.</description>

			<title>Debuggers and internal docs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Developers who don't use debuggers limit the complexity of code they can create.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you don't document the inner working of your software you will break things unnecessarily, if you're the one who's working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone else is working on it, they'll beg to be allowed to rewrite your code so they can understand what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Gmail shut me down</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night while I writing some stuff Gmail said it detected that my computer was sending some kinds of unspecified messages, and they were concerned about it, so they logged me off. I could still check my email on my other systems. I tried to go through the &quot;prove this is you&quot; process, but when it said it had sent a message to my phone, no message arrived. When I got to that place on other systems, the message did arrive on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed my account on Google, everything looks fine. The phone I have hooked it up to is an Android. I have a backup email address connected to my account. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I changed my password, and re-logged-in on my various other systems, everything worked, but not on my desktop. The problem is -- no confirming message ever appears on my phone, or anywhere else I can read my Google chat messages. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their help system is unhelpful, they keep telling me things I already know and have tried. I can live without accessing Gmail from my desktop because oddly while Gmail won't work with Chrome, it works fine with Safari. But there are often links in my emails and when I click on them the pages open in Safari. So this is very disruptive to my workflow. I'd rather still use Chrome on my desktop because everything is set up to work there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/248&quot;&gt;post a note here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, still can't get GMail to open on my desktop. I've had it try to send me a security message to my Android phone, without luck. I've quit ever app, removed every extension to Chrome, still no luck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Bingeing report. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/band-of-brothers&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt; all the way through. It's good, but I had forgotten how bloody it is. Since I was in that mode, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-2022&quot;&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix. Same idea, with 2020's production, a different war, and from the other side. I think the next thing will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/they-shall-not-grow-old&quot;&gt;They Shall Not Grow Old&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I think an AI could have plotted this path for me.</description>

			<title>FeedLand roadmap</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of new stuff here and I don't go into great detail. There is a link to a place to comment or ask questions at the &lt;a href=&quot;#a161849&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;FeedLand is a feed management system for individuals and groups. So far it's only been offered as a free service on the web. This roadmap explains how that will change.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The next version will by default &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use Twitter for identity. When you sign up you'll specify both a name and an email address. Both must be unique. An email confirms. Click the link and you're sent back with the credentials your browser needs to access your account. The usual dance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I do not plan to transition &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt; to work this way. Recall that we haven't been accepting new members since December 12. Everyone who uses it has a Twitter identity and it's working, and I don't want to screw with that. As long as Twitter is willing to let us use their identity service, we'll keep using it on this server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the big news: The new FeedLand server software will be available as open source, so anyone will be able to run a FeedLand instance. It's a Node.js application. Uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to hook up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; bucket for special features like RSS feeds for Likes. At first email sending will be via &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ses/&quot;&gt;Amazon SES&lt;/a&gt;, the method I currently use. It will be possible to plug in new drivers to use other email services. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The open source model is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/license/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; which uses GPLv2. I want to make it as easy to set up a FeedLand instance as it is to start a new WordPress server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People can set up commercial services to host FeedLand for individuals and groups. Every instance is set up to do that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's efficient software. I'm spending about $25 a month to host feedland.org for almost 1000 users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The client, which runs in the browser, will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be open source. I don't want to spawn a bunch of incompatible forks. I want FeedLand and its API to be solid. By maintaining control of the client, which btw need not be the only client, I can help be sure that we're starting a developer community with some basic rules about interop. If you want to run FeedLand it has to behave like FeedLand. I've been down this road and watched others go down this road. I think this is the right way to start. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Typical use-cases: A university department maintaining a FeedLand server to gather new writing from other departments at other universities on topics of interest.  Workgroups at companies. It would make a lot of sense for a news org to offer a FeedLand service to readers and their internal news writing staff. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't have dates for any of this. But at this point the path is pretty certain, so I felt it was time to say where FeedLand is going. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Friday I posted an earlier version of this roadmap on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;FeedLand support&lt;/a&gt; repo. I'm sure there will be other changes to this document as we go forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have comments or suggestions, you can post them as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;comments to Friday's post&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I don't use WordPress very much, but recently I had a chance to try out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/&quot;&gt;block editor&lt;/a&gt; and my reaction was that I can't imagine writing this way.

			<title>Defaulting, explained simply</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who can understand the rules of baseball or football, who can play poker or Monopoly, can understand the rules of defaulting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the US were to default the same thing would happen to the US that happens to a person if they fail to make a payment on a loan. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Foreclosure, the lender seizes assets to cover the default.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your credit rating goes down and cost of borrowing goes up. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today, before default, the US defines what money is. If we create a dollar that's worth a dollar. No other country has this power.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world lets us do this for them because a dollar is considered the safest way to store value. That's why the US dollar is the world's dominant &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar&quot;&gt;reserve currency. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However if we default, there goes the safety. It's gone, and that kind of trust, built over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/alexander-hamilton-debt-national-bank-two-parties-1789-american-history-great-courses-plus-180962954/&quot;&gt;hundreds of years&lt;/a&gt;, once lost will never come back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we really will be as poor as the oligarchs want us to think we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, why are the oligarchs who own all our sources of news, willing to let a default actually happen? I think it's a good chance it's due to inbreeding, narcissism, stupidity, selfishness and resentment. They don't believe they will suffer personally if the US turns into an economic basket case. Maybe they won't. For sure, that's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; they care about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep waiting for a news article that doesn’t gloss over the real impact of defaulting. If news were run like journalism this would be the horserace of the millenium. A story with a billion angles. We'd all tune in every night to hear how bad it'll be. But they clearly aren't interested in that. They're interested in keeping their jobs. That probably also explains why we're not responding to the climate crisis or the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The theory they had was that it had something to do with the reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/third-party-twitter-apps-tweetbot-twitterrific-echofon-down/&quot;&gt;outage&lt;/a&gt; at Twitter. Only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tangentially&quot;&gt;tangentially&lt;/a&gt;. The cause was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; item &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/13/nolink.png&quot;&gt;without a link&lt;/a&gt;. The mail-sending software had never encountered such a thing before, and it turns out there was an assumption that all linkblog entries would always have links. So the software lost its mind and went boom. Easy to find, the error message and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace&quot;&gt;stack crawl&lt;/a&gt; were the last thing in the log. Adding a protection against such a situation was also easy. This is how software gets mature. Sooner or later every weird case shows up and hopefully it will be patched well and documented, so next time it happens the email goes out as it's supposed to. This is all part of the &quot;It's even worse than it appears&quot; philosophy of Scripting News. And, how was this related &lt;i&gt;tangentially&lt;/i&gt; to the outage at Twitter? Well that's what the stupid linkblog entry was about.

			<title>Medium gets Mastoicized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was smart for &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/medium-embraces-twitter-alternative-mastodon-with-launch-of-its-own-community/&quot;&gt;Medium to embrace Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It gets people talking about Medium again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What comes next? Setting up a Masto-instance is easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Will Substack, who stole Medium's thunder, be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=substack+mastodon&quot;&gt;next&lt;/a&gt; to embrace Mastoicism?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Mastodon will become WordPress? Just support Markdown and get rid of the character limit and Masto is almost there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time every day using Mastodon and use WordPress only when i'm testing for compatibility with WordPress. Mastodon is much closer to what I think a centralized blogging host should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep wondering how this will evolve. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I'm working every day on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. Quietly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be a very hard job I imagine to make Medium an ActivityPub node. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure ActivityPub gets you all that much, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm still betting heavy on RSS, just enough syndication.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some random end-of-day thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Let RSS be RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: RSS is how we move documents around the web. That it works so poorly is because the big social media companies want it that way. We need products and services with big installed bases to serve as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterweight&quot;&gt;counterweights&lt;/a&gt; and help pull RSS out of corp-tech control.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How I got there...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/11.html#a175023&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; something provocative about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;HiMY SYeD read it, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@HiMYSYeD@mstdn.ca/109662819679711900&quot;&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;, on Mastodon: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What Mastodon is to ActivityPub...&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;WordPress is to RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first response was:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Interesting analogy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to think about.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After pondering a bit...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are other products that could claim ownership of RSS -- like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Google+Reader%22&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which still controls the market almost 10 years after its demise.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And Twitter, by &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; supporting RSS is also a big definer of RSS, in a negative way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think we'll be on solid ground once RSS defines itself and the products get out of the way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I think that's the key point&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS has never had a chance to be itself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Right from the start, all kinds of people and companies sought to own it. No one succeeded at that, but each of them diluted it, added confusion, took some of its power away and gave back nothing in return. Very typical approach of tech to open tech they didn't create. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until we can get RSS leading, as itself, and not being carved up and controlled, we won't really have a good way of moving documents around the web, which is what RSS is for, btw, imho. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All the usual disclaimers apply.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I hope people at WordPress read this. Right now they're in the best position to help RSS if they're inclined to do so. There aren't many companies I would credit with possibly wanting to do that. Slack was one, and Automattic is another. I still have to write the howto doc for what it would take for that to happen, subject to discussion of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My new old Mac laptop</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got my 2015 MacBook Pro. Two problems to start.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It came with Mojave installed. I got this machine because the software I want to use specifically does not run on Mojave. I didn't realize this until after I had copied a huge number of files to the machine via Time Machine backup. I will have to do this again.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Today they're selling the same $600 machine &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/12/pricechange.png&quot;&gt;on Amazon for $389&lt;/a&gt;. I wish I had an idea what the price range was. I could have waited a few days. I thought $600 was a good deal, but it's a ripoff.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so I thought this morning I'll just copy a High Sierra installer to the hard drive and run it, but Mojave won't run it. The app is there, but it's grayed out. Who knows why. Presumably it won't run on this machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up I went into Recovery mode to install the OS that's in ROM, it was El Capitan. As the machine is rebooting after install it freezes with a totally cryptic error message. Here's a photo.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/12/appleErrorMessage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;A not very encouraging error message from my new MacBook.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After restarting, the message is gone. I found I couldn't restore from a Time Machine backup because it comes from a machine more advanced than El Capitan. So I then did the minimum to get the machine to boot up, went into the System Preferences app, turned on file sharing and copied an install app for High Sierra. It's running it now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: After a lot more bullshit work, I think I'm pretty close to having the laptop working the way I need it to. If so, I will be able to travel and still keep up with my development projects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>WordPress is in the way. I've avoided saying this because I like Matt, but at some point, it being in the way has to win out. And since when do I not say something because I like the person who made it. It's in the way. I would like to see it move out of the way. I will write a piece soon explaining how they could, and should, do that.</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin&quot;&gt;Banshees&lt;/a&gt; movie is supposed to be a comedy of sorts but it was so painful to watch, not much room for laughter. And I guess I didn't really watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans&quot;&gt;Fableman&lt;/a&gt; movie, walked out after the opening scene. Spielberg's movies have declined into self-obsession. He thinks we're so freaking stupid and he's so freaking wonderful. Come on man do another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)&quot;&gt;Jaws&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was a movie. One thing I got from Banshees is that the Irish say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feck&quot;&gt;fecking&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder if it means what I think it means. Anyway, I'm looking for something great to watch, and have fallen back to re-watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. It's been so long since I last watched it that it seems pretty fresh. I long for that kind of story-telling, but they don't seem to make shows like that these days.</description>

And isn't really used in real life the way it is in movie versions of Ireland.</description>

			<title>I still love my Tesla</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my Tesla before people got all crabby about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And no just because you don't like Elon Musk I'm not going to walk away from a $70K purchase of a product that I absolutely adore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I drive my car I feel like it's a huge privilege to drive it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know of no other product that makes me feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yes I think Musk is an asshole too and a danger to our civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then I actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;warned you all&lt;/a&gt; that someone like Musk could buy Twitter, and you didn't listen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How you know you're gaslighting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; when you tell another person how they feel about something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I see myself doing that, I hit the brakes hard, and go for a walk and think about it. And over time I've trained myself not to believe I know how other people are feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Esp people who I only know from reading their emails or blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A sad truth</title>
