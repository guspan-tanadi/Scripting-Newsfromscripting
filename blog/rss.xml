			<description>Twitter isn't going away. What we should hope for is they start adding stuff to Twitter that users really like. And that'll force Facebook to do it too. As a result technology moves forward. One-party systems stagnate as we've seen.</description>

			<description>The discussion about Threads is happening on Twitter. In a sense nothing has happened until links to Threads posts show up here. It's an almost zero-interop system at this point.</description>

			<description>Actually you can embed posts in HTML pages (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fruitsalad.lucky.wtf/embedfrombluesky.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), but that's about it. &lt;s&gt;You can't even link to individual posts or threads. Or if you can, I haven't seen any.&lt;/s&gt; You can also link to individual posts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/t/CuVhc4xpYZS/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Must have browser interface</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Chip Bayers, my editor in the good old days at Wired, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chipbayers/status/1676794017244143617&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they shipped too soon. I've said the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing they reallllly need is a browser interface, so it can exist on the same plane as the other social nets. I can't paste links back and forth between their network and others. even at that primitive level of interop, it doesn't exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Twitter I'm able to write fluidly esp now that the character limit is just a speed bump. I've never felt in any way like writing on a phone was writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big picture is no one gets that these tools are writing environments. so they design them to have features writers can use.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Facebook is not attractive</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I started to write about how boring, sad, depressing and unnecessary Threads is. How pathetic Zuck is. How I visualize the process that led to this product as being a combination of the TV series Succession and Silicon Valley. Facebook is desperately trying to become anything but Facebook. I like Facebook as a community. I have friends there who I would never talk with if it weren't for Facebook. I hope they keep running it. But I wish the company behind it would stop demanding attention because they are so completely unattractive. And btw, I can't get into writing on an iPhone. I write at a desk, or maybe occasionally a tablet. Everything about this product pushes me away. Maybe that'll change, maybe the people who are trying to get ahead on Threads will think up some new use for social networks that will justify using it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Will Threads prevail? If so, then?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends think that Threads is enough, and once they fill in some missing features it will suck the life out of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They might be right. Hard to argue.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All I want is a playground with an open API and enough creative users to try out new ideas from developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to the pace of innovation we had going in the 90s and 00s. The big platforms snuffed all that out, corralled it and kept it in some too-restrictive bounds. Did what BillG failed to, locked us in the trunk and cut off the air supply. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That some of these people were the most fervent advocates for open platforms says that maybe those beliefs ran pretty thin, and the opportunity to cash it out for billions made it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe we'll just be hobbyists. I'm okay with that. Or maybe people are will to pay good money to sustain creative development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect that to be possible on Facebook's new network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been developing a new thread-authoring and publishing tool for Bluesky. Looking for people who are good at reporting bugs to try it, report on the experience. Looking for deal-stoppers, important things that don't work. If you have time today to try it, please send email. Thanks!</description>

			<title>Fireworks</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder what dogs think fireworks are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tell you what I think -- I think they're boring and stupid, and when the climate crisis is in full swing we'll look back and wonder how we came up with the idea of adding more smoke to the air as &lt;i&gt;entertainment.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went to the fireworks in NY harbor in 1976, the 200th birthday of America. It was supposed to be this &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; thing. I thought meh. What. Why? Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The answer is of course before tv, radio, videogames, social networks, air travel, space travel, fireworks were exciting technology displays.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today? No.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism should care about Google breaking the open web as much as they care about Musk breaking Twitter because, in capitalism, Musk has the right to break Twitter, he owns it, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google doesn’t own the web&lt;/a&gt;. I think the reason journalism will report on Musk breaking Twitter and not Google breaking the web is that they need a person to report on, and Google has never really had a personality. The two founders are quiet, and I don't think I've ever heard the current CEO speak a word. So they're unreportable?</description>

			<title>Facebook's new social net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We now &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/threads-instagrams-twitter-competitor-is-expected-july-6/&quot;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook's new social network, Threads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/230703/p25#a230703p25&quot;&gt;will be available&lt;/a&gt; to the public on Thursday. The day after tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's lots of discourse on the net about &lt;i&gt;What's To Be Done&lt;/i&gt; about this big event. Based on decades of experience with such launches, here's what I say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No matter what we do right now it'll probably have no effect on the Facebook rollout. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's better to listen, study and learn, size up the product. We don't know what it is. Wait till we find out.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Call them Facebook, not Meta. They're trying to run away from their legacy, but it's very relevant. People should know it's coming from Facebook not &quot;Meta.&quot; When I see Meta my mind reads &quot;Mets.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After the dust has settled, what if anything should be done may be more apparent.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Remember, Bigco's launch with big thunder but the products often flop. Don't get sucked into the hype. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Whatever you say or do now, viewed from a few weeks from now, will seem silly and over-reactive. Keep on truckin. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let's study the product, discover what can be done with its APIs (assuming it has some) and keep an open mind. It's possible that some good can come from this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't depend on journalists to study it. They tend to report on the press releases, and amp up the fear. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First and foremost -- don't panic. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

I could convert completely to HTTPS, it would make my life a bit easier to do so. But I won't as long as Google is the one forcing it. If they back off and commit to not blocking the non-HTTPS web, then maybe I have more flexibility.</description>

If they back off and commit to not blocking the non-HTTPS web, then maybe I have more flexibility." created="Mon, 03 Jul 2023 14:36:45 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/02/16/gaslight.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/07/03.html#a143645"/>

			<description>If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; user, and you can still access your files, you should download them asap. Use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/03/downloadFilesCommand.png&quot;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; in the Tools menu. Then you should switch to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It's a significantly better version of LO2 and &lt;i&gt;does not depend on Twitter&lt;/i&gt; for identity. I think the reason it still works for some people is that we cache the login information on the server, and as long as the server doesn't restart, you can continue to use it. But the server will eventually restart, and that'll be the end of LO2. It's had a good run and Drummer has been out there for a couple of years now.</description>

			<description>Of course Harvard is using ChatGPT in their comp sci classes. I can't believe how snotty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/harvard-is-using-chatgpt-to-teach-computer-science/&quot;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; can be. If you were a doctor and a new treatment for cancer appeared, no matter how flawed, you'd want your students to be up on it. Maybe they'll figure out how to fix the flaws. Journalists act as if they're the only ones who know the outcome and everyone else is either corrupt or stupid. That's who covers news for us.</description>

			<title>Still diggin!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Where did &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22still+diggin%22&quot;&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;come from? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use this phrase to end posts about stuff I'm working on that's now ready to use. A new feature, fix or workaround. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea. As a developer, I started off a long time ago by digging a hole. Then I dug another, filling the first hole with the dirt from the second. Then a third and fourth and so on. The holes get a little better over time, deeper, new features, etc. But they're still holes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the end, when I've dug my last hole, what will be left is a hole and a bunch of piles of dirt. Over time, the piles erode and maybe someone else fills in the last hole and another group of humans do it all again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when I say I'm &lt;i&gt;still diggin&lt;/i&gt; that means I'm still alive, digging holes and filling them in. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there's another theory about where Still Diggin! came from. Back in my youth, when the NYC power utility &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Edison&quot;&gt;Con Ed&lt;/a&gt; dug up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/62710514&quot;&gt;street&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JulianneBond/status/585938323799171072&quot;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; posted a sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/weekinreview/once-again-for-con-ed-it-s-dig-we-must.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Dig we must for a greater New York!&quot; That stuck with me. And if you think about it, it's just another instance of the use in the first explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A validator-validator. I'd submit my feed to it via a web service (not sure if they have an API), and if that feed doesn't validate with the W3C validator, and we believe it is valid per the RSS 2.0 spec, we would open an issue on their repo. Maybe if they want to be really cooperative, they could run the test feeds against their validator whenever they make an update as part of the validation process, and never release a version where those feeds didn't validate. This would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/allay&quot;&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; my concern about them breaking RSS because they don't respect or understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. I'd start with the Scripting News RSS feed, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;does validate&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validation.png&quot;&gt;this time&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, their warnings are bogus imho. They should recognize the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Source namespace&lt;/a&gt; not warn me about it. A copyright statement can and should be able to have a &amp;copy; character. Why not? The spec doesn't prohibit it, and it's part of the language we use for copyright. And this is not an Atom feed so that warning about Atom was a bad move. The authors of the original validator were promoting Atom at the expense of RSS. Why not put that to bed, it's not exactly an ethical thing for a validator to do imho.</description>

It has probably also meant that the right-margin images weren't showing up in other RSS systems for much longer.

Has to be that way. There are hundreds of thousands of us, maybe tens of them. They're having trouble keeping the system running. As I dig in more on Bluesky, not because I'm getting married to the platform, btw -- more friends reach out and ask for help getting an invite code. It isn't about Bluesky though, it's just that we got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html&quot;&gt;the feeds up&lt;/a&gt; there first, so there's a way I can build. Ultimately my goal is to build a layer on top of all the social nets I can, so it doesn't matter which service you use, the stuff I create can make it to you and will. I used to write about &quot;when a big tree falls it creates room for new growth.&quot; I wrote that about Jerry Garcia. And it's equally true about Twitter. As they vacate, and get smaller and more focused, I believe understandably, the places they vacate once again become interesting places to develop. I can't miss an opportunities like these.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry.html#2&quot;&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Like the big tree that fell last March, the death of a huge human being like Jerry Garcia frees up a huge amount of space. Once there was a tree, now there are seedlings. After the sadness, there will be huge creativity.&quot;</description>

			<description>I found and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/207&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; a problem with inline images from &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; as displayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. I believe the problem has been there since we switched to email-based identity a few months back. As a result today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/01/221953.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; with an inline image works.</description>
