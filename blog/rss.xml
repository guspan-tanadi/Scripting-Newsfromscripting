			<description>Dear media experts. Have you wondered why podcasting is still a competitive thing? No tech company dominates, but not for lack of trying. How do you explain that?</description>

			<description>I forget where I read this, but the idea of the US losing our democracy is too strange for people to accept it, so you can be pretty sure it’s going to happen. Then 30 years later, maybe we’ll overthrow the dictatorship, with great effort and loss.</description>

			<description>I heard on NPR this morning that we elected Biden to fight Covid. Nothing else. Stated as fact.  I don't know about you, but I would have voted for anyone who wasn't Trump.   I think NPR ought to be much more careful lest people forget to vote in 2022 and 2024.</description>

			<description>Another thing. Americans need to grow the fuck up.  The president made vaccines free. But he couldn't make everyone take it. Thus we're experiencing more sickness. And you (the press) want to blame Biden? You're crazy. Journalism, never has it been more clear, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;you're hurting America&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I apologize for a mistake I made yesterday in my bit about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/19.html#a210633&quot;&gt;Google searching&lt;/a&gt; my blog for a specific title. There was a typo in the query that explains the missing results. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=gravitas+wins+elections+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;correct query&lt;/a&gt; without the typo. Oy.

			<title>New blog archives in Daytona</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did the initial Scripting News collection on Daytona with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;current archive&lt;/a&gt;, started in May 2017. It's in OPML, so it was ready to be imported into the database as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have now converted the previous months, August 2016 through May 2017, from a JSON-based format to OPML, and published the result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017&quot;&gt;in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, and also imported this archive into Daytona. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Along the way I found another eight months of blogging that's in the same format. I plan to convert those as well, and flow the result into Daytona.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to march back in time, looking for OPML versions of the blog, or OPMLizable data. The goal is to see how much of the 27 years of Scripting News I can get into Daytona. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017/chatlogToOpml&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that converts chatLog.json text to OPML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbsrjRrDOw&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the tool I used to edit my blog in this period. The software is 1999.io.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When the web started, setting up a server was not particularly hard to do, but it was very hard to understand how something so little could be so big. The hardest part of evangelizing in those days was being believed when you said Yup that's all there is to it.</description>

			<title>Following my tweets in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now follow my tweets in outline form in Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click this &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://tweets.opml.org/davewiner/tweets.opml&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. It'll open a tab in Drummer with a live outline of my tweets. When I write a thread, it will be nested in the outline. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing more to do and it doesn't cost anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to broadcast your tweets like I do, no problem, just go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweets.opml.org/&quot;&gt;tweets.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions are right there. Basically all you have to do is log in, the server will do the rest. No cost, my treat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if your outliner supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, you don't even have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. The same way you didn't have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=radio%20userland&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; to get the benefit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. It's exactly analogous, and it worked, so  if you have your doubts remember that bootstraps work.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to create an ecosystem around outliners and OPML. Twitter is sort of a go-anywhere outliner. That's why integrating Twitter and outliners is so good. I can jot a note down on my phone and it'll be in my outliner when I get back to my desktop. I think this is an important combination. It is for me, as a writer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt; . I meant it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In general journalism should report tech that is actually being used to do new things, not on VCs hyping ideas of things that will make them even richer but don’t actually do anything for anyone. If a VC is promoting something that fact alone should make you suspicious.</description>

			<description>Idea for a TV miniseries for HBO or Netflix. In 2022 a variant of Covid comes out that kills Republicans and leaves Democrats unharmed. Two thirds of the Supreme Court is wiped out. The state governments of red states are decimated. Within a few months there are no more red states. Series ends with the main characters enjoying a beautiful sunset reveling in the bright future ahead.</description>

			<title>Why Daytona is a game-changer</title>

One of the goals of the project was to have great &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, and I think they came out pretty good, but there was still a major problem -- where to put things. This is the problem in all docs. Even if you're a good docs writer, and I've had a lot of practice, and you know the product well, and care about the users, some things just won't have a place. So you document them on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, or in the Change Notes outline, and hope people can find them in a search engine. But they keep doing a worse job of indexing our stuff, and they don't know what is a Drummer doc and what isn't, so you can't say for example, &quot;search the Drummer docs for instructions on how to restore a blog.opml file in a myfiles archive&quot; which is a question a user posed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/140#issue-1082790948&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I smiled when I saw it. This is a job for Daytona. So here's the query I entered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Import%20opml&amp;collection=drummerdocs&quot;&gt;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Import%20opml&amp;collection=drummerdocs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I laughed out loud when the result came back. Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't in a place a user would have looked, and Google &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; would have found it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point is this -- it's past time to take responsibility for finding the stuff we write, and if we do it well, and Daytona does, all of a sudden blogging works so much better, and the incentive to write stuff, to document, to narrate our work, to index everything you can, makes total sense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We crossed into a new generation. I think this is a lot closer to &quot;Web3&quot; than the hyped up garbage the VC industry is selling, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/30/grannySmithApple.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;If someone was a passionate user of one of the other &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tools%20for%20thought&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; projects, and they asked me to sell them on using &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, I would probably say why don't you stick with the product you like, and work with us to get it interoperating with Drummer. That way when you want to try Drummer, you won't have to switch, you can just use it, and use the other one too, whenever you like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something I struggle to explain to people. I'm 66 years old, and have spent decades making software, so I think about it differently than I did when I was say 22 and wanting to take on the world. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=runway&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;horizon&lt;/a&gt; is obviously 44 years shorter now than it was then. And my goals are adjusted as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/14.html#a144920&quot;&gt;other day&lt;/a&gt;, I've been lucky because of when I was born and my interest in technology, to be part of several &quot;bare metal bootstraps,&quot; where we got down to a basic set of functionality, a complete machine that everyone agreed on, and we as developers built up from there. Some amazing things can be accomplished if the baseline is powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of my &quot;product&quot; today not being Drummer or Daytona or whatever's next, rather it's wanting to have my passion, outlining, experience the same kind of birth as a platform as the Apple II did, or CP/M, MS-DOS, Windows, the web, RSS, podcasting. Look at that string! Wow. But today's users and developers haven't even really experienced &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; exploding platform. That's my product now. I want outlining to be the basis for growth the same way those others were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you don't have to use Drummer but do insist on the highest level of interop with it from the people who make your software. Don't accept no for an answer. I'm not. Hopefully that makes sense? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Drummer is more than a piece of software -- it's an interop &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt;. It's going to sit there and grow, inviting others to interop with it, and every feature and service I add will make the proposition more enticing. Think of Drummer less as a product and more as a seduction. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was there for the early web, it wasn't a vague VC pyramid scheme. The web was a reduction of all the crazy complexity of tech platforms, web made it so you could write a network app in an afternoon. It was the opposite of the FUD that they're &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1471115846101737476&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt; &quot;web3.&quot; I've yet to hear a coherent explanation of why it should be called web-anything. Selfish beyond belief.</description>

They are cynical about tech, and have every right to be, based on experience. They know all about lock-in. Most of them have never experienced the wide-open &quot;blue sky&quot; feeling of the early days of a platform with huge potential. I have experienced that many times, because of when I was born. It's not too late to transform Tools For Thought into that kind of platform. It can be even better than the web, why not -- we come after the web.</description>

			<description>Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive. PS: I can fly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger&quot;&gt;debuggers&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of the coding process. I almost never run anything complex without stepping through the code in the debugger, to be sure it's running the way I intended it to. Having the data it's working on right there, easily browsable, gives me ideas for new functionality. Imagine being a surgeon who can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; the living body, turn off all the systems to examine things, then click a button and have the organism reanimate. And then imagine having such a tool available to you and not using it. There are programmers who don't use debuggers. They're working at a lower level imho. Like flying without instruments.</description>

			<description>So I have the last 4.5 years of Scripting News in the Daytona index, now I desperately want all the rest of the years, but that's not going to be so easy. In 2017 I had a really good idea of how I wanted the data stored, but until then, I was playing around a lot. A lot of it is in OPML, somewhere, probably. But a lot more of it is in HTML. But it's pretty incredible to have 4.5 years. Makes all that writing so much more useful.</description>

			<description>I noticed people are talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; on their blogs, and there's a general positive view of it, and an expectation that I will continue to improve it. That's all good. But a lot of that depends on how much I get back from users. Ideas that are interesting, not necessarily obvious, and aren't expressed in terms of panic. I want to move this forward, with friends, with people who are as excited as I am and are ready to roll up their sleeves and participate. But if you wait for me to do it, then I'll just add the things I want. I'm hoping that &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users take an interest. And not just &quot;do this for me now&quot; -- help out. I can't read minds, and I don't really like working for free. I don't want dollars, I want the product of intelligent, kind people who help. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=nakedjen&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; has the perfect motto for this, &quot;You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up.&quot;</description>

Drummer is a baseline product. There aren't many new ideas, it's mostly making some tried-and-true ideas work in an environment that has a strong future. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; new. We needed it and it's so weird we didn't know we needed it. The really interesting things are like that. It breaks new ground and it's not just for blogging. But it's not for lazy people. If you don't want to read the docs and understand what it's doing, you won't get it to work. Maybe in a while we'll figure out how to pave over some of the difficulties, but not yet. Daytona is a gift. It's something we had no right to expect. But sometimes there are breakthroughs, you discover some power that's amazing, and everything you try with it is something new. This is one of those products.</description>

			<description>The Democrats need someone who can be counted on to say &quot;The Republicans are full of shit&quot; when called on by the press. Too bad we had one, in Al Franken -- well, now we need another. It's really simple, most of the things they say are BS, so it needs to be said apparently because journalists seem largely unable to say that simple truth.</description>

			<description>Today I learned that if you want Apple's mouse to scroll, as if it had a scroll wheel, you have to go to the Accessibility panel on Preferences, then click Options, and check the Scrolling checkbox. Then it works. I had gotten a cheap Microsoft mouse that had a scroll wheel, but it's junky compared to the Apple mouse.</description>

I had tried before and gave up, for the same reason I guess I gave up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Halt and Catch Fire&lt;/a&gt; -- it's too close to home. I come from both cultures, Maisel from my home in NY. Miriam's mother and father could have been my parents or grandparents. And I lived the HACF life in Silicon Valley in the same timeframe as the show. But for some reason when I tried MMM this week, I got into it. I think I figured out why. The family I was part of is now completely gone, and has been gone since early 2018 when my mother died. Enough time has passed that the memory has softened and idealized in an emotional way. I still remember why they upset me so, but I don't feel it so much any more, so Maisel is tolerable, even adorable. And bingeable. TV shows are excellent because they immerse you in their society, you start thinking of the characters on the show as members of your clan. Maybe I should try HACF again. Also, it's really funny that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; comes even closer to the lifestyle I led, and I loved it when it came out! I think I was actually in a couple of episodes of that show, certainly some of my friends were.</description>

			<description>Made a small change to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter a search string, it constructs a URL for the search and redirects to it. That way the address bar has a link that's ready to be shared. This is something Google does that's quite useful. It works if you're searching Scripting News or the Drummer Docs, but sharing searches into your own public writing doesn't make sense, because they will search in the other person's public writing, not yours. For now you're the only person who can search your public writing. But I had it redirect because you might want to remember the URL for your own use.</description>
