I have no idea who else is involved, how big it is, and how much power it has. But I find it interesting and believe it's well-intentioned, so I participate. They ask you to look at posts and rate relevance, sources, context. None of the messages have profanity or are abusive or personal (some contain assumptions that are). I think there must be filters in place that see the items before people like me do. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/10/communityQuestion.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of something they asked me to look at. I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to disclose so I'll stop with that.</description>

			<title>My manifesto for feed reader developers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, credit and respect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt; for helping steer Mastodon to titleless feeds. That's a mega-contribution to moving toward turning the web into a functional writing environment instead of the utterly broken mess stemming from when Twitter and Google Reader couldn't come together on micro-blogging and feeds. Imagine if they had worked it out. We'd be so much further ahead. That was in 2007. Writing on the web has been broken since then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now most feed readers imho are broken, even the beloved products we depend on every day. We can love them even though they're wrong. I can't be mushy about this. Wrong is wrong. But we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; that is both code and prose, I say what I think the purpose of feeds are, to serve writers and readers, and there is no room for the wants of programmers, esp when it's so easy to do what the writers want us to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been nice about this for a long time. We need to get together, users and developers and get this fixed so we can start adding more features to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/whatIsADocument/&quot;&gt;common feature set&lt;/a&gt; of writing environments for the web. We can easily get unstuck if we decide to get unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A prototype for a feed reader</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than just preaching how feed readers could easily accommodate both titled and title-less items, as I have been, I put up a prototype that illustrates, with real data. It's not a lot of work, I developed this from scratch in one full programming day. Still have a little work tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it deals with three test feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.nytimes.com%2Fservices%2Fxml%2Frss%2Fnyt%2FWorld.xml#&quot;&gt;NYT feed&lt;/a&gt;. It's an easy case because the NYT feeds are uniform. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News feed&lt;/a&gt; contains both titled and title-less posts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;My Mastodon feed&lt;/a&gt;, where all items are title-less. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will publish the source tomorrow, and hopefully skilled UI designers will have a look and then maybe we can approach the developers at each of the feed reader developers, and get past this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I have 20-20 vision for the first time in my life. Seeing so much more in a lot of ways. I told a friend today it's like I have Tesla eyes. I know people don't like Tesla these days, but I still feel like it's a privilege to drive my Model Y every time, even though I've been driving it for over a year now. It's a feeling of able-ness no car has ever given me. And that's the feeling my new eyes give me. I've been dis-abled seriously for years now. And my vision never really worked, even when I was a kid. I remember getting glasses for teh first time in second or third grade. I never knew there was so much writing in the world, everywhere. It's like that except at an age where such discoveries are pretty rare. I think this experience will fade away as my new eyesight becomes the norm, but for now, it's given me a new youth-like experience, pretty cool.</description>

			<description>A fact I've observed. Most programmers who work on web content systems not only aren't writers, they don't make an effort to know or understand writers. The really good products, the ones writers like to use are not surprisingly written and designed by programmers who are also writers.

			<title>Feed items without titles</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to be true to the intent of the author of a feed, and create a good experience for the reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the real world some feed items have titles and some don't. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/08/itemsWithoutTitles.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. I've put red arrows pointing to the items that don't have titles. You could argue I suppose that they should have titles. That I should take a 9-word item and give it a two-word title. But I don't do that. And it shows up in my feed without a title, because the item does not have a title. And that's not up to anyone but me, the author of the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/08/readerviewitemswithouttitles.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of how a popular feed reader displays those items. It isn't terrible, but it's imho wrong. The first item has a [no title] message where a title would go. Why? Look at it from the human reader point of view. What information does that convey, above what the writer was saying, in bigger type and in bold. &lt;b&gt;NO TITLE&lt;/b&gt;. I don't know about you but to me that looks like criticism, an error message, from the software to the person who wrote the post. Sometimes all the posts show up with that message. This time only one did. And for the others, they repeat the first bits of the post. Again, why? The human read them once, why put the same words they just read on the screen again? That seems quite wrong to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't know why they designed their software this way, but I can guess -- when they started they designed it assuming all posts had titles, and it took a while before they discovered that some items don't. So they shoehorned those into the app without disrupting the design of the product. But this has been going on for a very long time, many years, basically since Google Reader decided, incorrectly, that all feed items must have titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Mastodon supporting RSS, and Mastodon booming in popularity, feed readers should expect to see a lot more feeds with items without titles, unless for some reason Mastodon does what Twitter did many years ago, under pressure from Google Reader to add titles to items, and just withdraws the feeds. All because they couldn't adjust to a reality they hadn't planned for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so what's the answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Never display NO TITLE. It's not a good use of your space, the reader's time and it's wrong. The author didn't use those words. They're your words. You don't have a right to put your words in space reserved for the words from feeds. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Instead display the first words from the description element of the item where you would put the title. If there are too many words, flow them into the space you've allocated for the description, but &lt;i&gt;do not repeat words&lt;/i&gt; from the description. Again, you'd displaying something that isn't in the feed. The author did not repeat the words, so you can't do that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it, unless I'm missing something, and if I am, tell me. You can send me email, dave@scripting.com, and if you don't want me to publish it, say so and I won't. I don't want to embarrass anyone, I just want to solve this problem and move on to a feed world where feeds with items without titles are handled well by the reader software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, one more thing, some feeds will have both kinds of posts, items with titles and items without. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; is like that. The item for this post will have a title because the post has a title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I don't know how to say this without pissing a bunch of people off, but I have to say it anyway. It's not ActivityPub that's booming now, it's Mastodon, which happens to use ActivityPub. The problem with ActivityPub is that it is basically incomprehensible. I don't know why it is that way. I could clear my schedule for the next three months and then at the end, I'd be able to tell you why it is that way. But I can't do that, because I have stuff to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and I want to get back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; soon. I have users and I want to do stuff for them. As curious as I am to find out what's there, someone else will have to do that work. What we need is this. A simple package for Node, a lot simpler than the ones that are out there, that covers the basic functionality of things users do in Mastodon interactively, without using Mastodon, just ActivityPub. Create a new post, edit an existing post, boost a post, like one. Follow someone. Etc. Over on Mastodon a few people are talking about Bear Hugs. I didn't remember, but that's a term &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/15/the-bearhug/&quot;&gt;Steve Gillmor coined&lt;/a&gt; (I believe) for what I did with RSS. I basically kept building stuff with it, and getting content people on board until RSS on its own meant something. Then I let it go. We need that for ActivityPub. The people who won't like this are the members of the W3C. I'm afraid they think AP is done. Mastodon is already doing things outside of AP. I don't blame them. I would do the same thing. They have an API, they are using RSS, both of which are comprehensible. I think AP deserves to be comrepehensified, it deserves a bear hug. BTW, Steve Gillmor is to tech as Steve Bannon is to MAGA. Very much the same concept, imho.</description>

Another interesting weirdness, as I've been working on software this week I can now see that I have been mis-spelling the names of things all over the place. I have a practice of copying and pasting names when I want to refer to a value or call a function, so as the mis-spellings propagate, my code still runs without errors. I really have been transformed into an able-eyed person in just one little operation. My dreams, also amazingly, have become more vivid and memorable and also gratifying (no more information forthcoming in re this). I think perhaps when one's vision improves it improves in many dimensions. Did I mention that the screens in my life reveal details heretofore unappreciated! The retina display I'm typing this into has many subtleties. Amazing.</description>

Good example code to get started with the Mastodon API. Also illustrates how easy feeds (RSS, Atom, RDF) can be incorporated into any Node app with the reallySimple package. Finally, I hope to start building a rep in the Mastodon development community with this package. I hope to make quite a few contributions in the future. If you have questions here's a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedToMasto/issues/1&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to start.</description>

You might want to check out who owns those services and decide if you still like me. (I use DO because they have great docs and good prices. I use S3 because it was a breakthrough product when it came out and I totally needed what they offered and I loved what they were doing, and now I'm pretty well locked-in.) And I chose Twitter for identity in 2014 because identity is a human-intensive bitch and they were offering to let me use theirs for $0. I solved the problem long ago and baked it into my system. I could bake something else in, and I would, quickly if they broke us. But so far I've been able to spend my time on more productive and fun development work. Maybe I'm giving something up. Yeah, there are a lot of choices in life. You never know what was down the road you didn't take.</description>

Apparently a lot of people on Masto didn't know about it and the response has been resounding. And the numbers are very lopsided. The piece has been &quot;boosted&quot; (the Masto equiv of RT) 1.1K times, yet I only have 3.7K followers there. Meanwhile on Twitter, where I have 69K followers, it has been RTd just 17 times. My feeling was previously that Mastodon was more alive, it's good to have a number to put behind that.</description>

			<description>For my friends Geraldine and Peter, this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;chat system&lt;/a&gt; where you ask an AI that really is amazing to write stories for you, or answer questions, or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/sqlcode.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;develop software&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone, including me, is smitten by this invention. I asked it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/trumpstory.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;write a story&lt;/a&gt; about Donald Trump admitting he is a troll and tells everyone to just ignore him, and it'll be good for everyone including him.</description>

Just click the Subscribe button and you're in. Mastodon, unlike Twitter, provides an RSS feed for each user. A huge advance in the state of the art. I hope Twitter takes note and adds this feature.</description>

			<title>Users as advocates</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1598839749740855296&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is how users advocate in their own interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon adds a feature that users value, demonstrably, by RTing the call to action and subscribing to the feeds in their favorite feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we find out which readers do it well and which do not. The ones who don't will be motivated to catch up. Once users make it an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And other social platforms will be motivated to follow Mastodon's lead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when Mastodon supports RSS, and there's demonstrated user support, Twitter must add the feature. It's a fundamental law of tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once Twitter has a competitor, all kinds of things are possible that weren't before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1598332913568841735&quot;&gt;This is a huge deal&lt;/a&gt;. If I type a web address in a tweet, Twitter figures it out and hots it up in the rendered tweet. All of a sudden a tweet can link out to lots of places. Let's hope next up is Markdown support, optional titles, unlimited length and podcast enclosures and then you better believe WordPress and Tumblr will have to do it, and that will provide impetus for Mastodon. Here we go. Please keep going Twitter.</description>

Let's say I buy a Metrocard to ride the NYC subway. Every time I slide the card through a turnstile, what is that called? Is it a micropayment? Or I have an EZ-Pass responder on my car, so I drive through where the toll booths used to be without even slowing down. I don't know how much that costs, but I assure you there's nothing &lt;i&gt;micro&lt;/i&gt; about it! One of the reasons business people at pubs must be tired of this discussion is it's their job to get MACRO payments for their employer, not teeny little micros. As I envision it, I would probably spend $100 a month on various pubs, and maybe more and more over time. When fluidity is added to the economics, how can you help but pay more. It's only because of the attitude about this at publishers that we can't have more news (and they get more money). Right now I only pay three pubs -- NYT, WP and Consumer Reports. My money should be spread around a lot better than that.</description>

			<description>My parents were children in Europe as the Holocaust was brewing. Their parents, my grandparents, got them out in time so that they could meet in Brooklyn, get married and have children, including me of course. My paternal &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/baruchWiner.gif&quot;&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt; told me, when I was a little kid, in his heavy Russian accent &quot;Daveeed, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you get a gun and go on the roof and you shoot them!&quot; My parents were horrified. I thought he was just a crazy old man. But he was a lot smarter and wiser than we gave him credit for.</description>

			<title>Feeds in the Fediverse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;These are the goals for the software I am about to release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The network of RSS publishers and readers should be part of the Fediverse. This software enables the flow of RSS content into the Fediverse.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To provide good simple working code for the Mastodon API. I had to do too much work to figure out how to get what amounts to a &lt;i&gt;Hello World&lt;/i&gt; script up and running. Now you don't have to do all that work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You should be able to build feed-based utilities without giving any thought to reading feeds. Reading a feed should be as easy as reading a JSON file. This app illustrates how that works, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to get some code out there into the Mastoverse, to start building a rep in the community.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The scope of the Fediverse, 2022</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://axbom.com/fediverse/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; is very informative.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@oblomov@sociale.network/109437619944925429&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on my Mastodon account what apps other than Mastodon and micro.blog are on the ActivityPub network.
