You can hear how tired I am. Having shipped FeedLand, I'm kind of spent, but there's more to do. I'm grateful for that. Let's make the most of it. The podcast is about using FeedLand to write, not just read. About the connection to micro.blog and hopes for connection to Mastodon. And leveraging Markdown in your feeds, how to do it with no breakage. My FeedLand feed is &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Feed writing in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A big new &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; feature today -- it's now two-way. It's not only useful for feed reading but now it supports feed writing as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a new command in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/09/editMyFeedCommandScreen.png&quot;&gt;first menu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Edit my feed. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you choose the command, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/08/editboxscreen2.png&quot;&gt;edit box&lt;/a&gt; appears where you can enter a title-less item that goes into your feed when you click the Post button.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the new feature. Any FeedLand user can have a feed. You of course must be logged-in to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;where my feed is&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's very simply an RSS 2.0 feed, public -- which you or anyone else can subscribe to in any app that can read an RSS feed. That includes feed readers like Feedly and NetNewsWire, but it also, innovatively, can included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, a system created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, in place of a blog I write there. To someone reading my feed on micro.blog, because I have included my FeedLand feed, it appears as if I wrote the post there, not over here. And why shouldn't it work that way. This is an example of what I call &lt;i&gt;Two-way RSS.&lt;/i&gt; It's common for blogging systems to support outbound RSS, where what I post there is available outside the blogging system, but it's mind-blowingly powerful if it goes the other way. Very few non-feed reader reading systems support inbound RSS, but imho if they would, web writing would be revolutionized. All kinds of ad hoc connections would be possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two systems I'd like to support this idea are:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Substack -- then I could use any writing tool that produces RSS as output to write essays that then could be received via email. CLearly they already have the technology to do this because they have a feed reader that can subscribe to sources outside of Substack. It's one simple step (imho) to let authors write using their own favorite tools rather than Substack's writing tool, which is nice, but I like the writing environment I already have, as do many other writers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon -- if they did, any app that produced an RSS feed could peer. The Fediverse would then extend futher than it can with ActivityPub because RSS is so widely supported, and easy to implement. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will of course have more to say about this new direction for feeds on the web including a chance to reboot with a safer way to write HTML alsk known as Markdown, another drum I've been beating fairly regularly, lately. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/125&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where, a couple of days ago, I introduced this feature to the inner circle of FeedLand users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ideas for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started thinking and the ideas kept pouring out. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the blue checkmarks, leave them alone. Make a very clear statement and stick to it. Blue checkmarks are Twitter Classic.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let's come up with some more colors -- silver, gold and black (to correspond to different levels of credit cards perhaps).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone can buy a silver checkmark. It means that other people, with a single click, or by hovering over their tag, can find out their real name and whatever other verifiable info the user wants to share publicly. The info comes from the credit card company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;With gold, you get more services and they cost more. Twitter will make introductions to other members who might share interests with you. With this Twitter could get into the businesses of match.com or linkedin.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Black is reserved for Friends Of Elon, whatever that means. People who hang out and smoke weed or travel on Twitter Tours. The kind of perks credit card companies offer. Hey you could even partner with Amex or whatever. Good deals on a Model Y or Starlink. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hey here's another idea. There must be a pool of good names that have been abandoned years ago. Those might be worth money. I'd like to buy a few if they're for sale. Or buy a TLD, maybe .twtr and allow their twitter names to be portable in some sense as afforded by DNS's flexibility. Thinking out loud here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, while I have your attention I used to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;, and the NYT didn't mind. It goes back to the beginning of Twitter and NYT support for RSS. I'd pump links to NYT articles through this Twitter account. Never got an explanation why it was suspended. If you like the ideas can you ask them to let me use that account again? It was fun. Free advertising for the paper of record. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I found a bug in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; I use to build Scripting News. When I change the title of a story the guid in the RSS feed for the site changes, so if you're reading me in a feed reader, you'll see the story again with its new title. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog#v0723----11722-by-dw&quot;&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; for the bug, just haven't deployed it here yet. And my apologies. This bug has been there for a long time. I'm only seeing it now because I'm debugging a feed reader myself.</description>

You have to actually try to buy an ad on Twitter to get it. Their ad system is designed for professional advertisers. They start right off with terminology that no normal person understands. All I know is the one time I considered promoting a tweet, just to see if it worked, I ended up backing out after the first or second question. Instead, they could make it &lt;i&gt;easy. &lt;/i&gt;Ask for a credit card (assuming they don't already have it from some other purchase). Then ask which tweet the user wants to promote (unless they came there by clicking the &quot;promote this tweet button&quot; on the tweet they want to promote). Then ask how much they want to spend (suggest an amount, &quot;most people spend $18 the first time they promote a tweet&quot; for example). Click Submit and off you go. And please follow up with the user by email. Make sure they know how many impressions they got. And you might as well offer a money-back guarantee for the first few tweets. After all the whole thing cost Twitter exactly nothing. And make sure people get their money's worth. It'll be like gambling, fun at first, then addictive. And the money will just roll in. And you can forget about bullshit like paywalls and membership fees. That's nickel and dime stuff. Here we're talking about Google-like money! And with some of the profits you can afford to pay people who produce sticky content that keeps people coming back. You have all the stars, make sure they feel appreciated (something Twitter is doing very badly now, really always have).</description>

			<description>Quick update on my eyes. A week ago last Friday I had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/28.html#a133050&quot;&gt;stop wearing a contact lens&lt;/a&gt; in my right eye so it could be measured for surgery I'm having late this month. The contact lens interferes with the measuring. I was very apprehensive about this, but it worked out rather well. I do see double in some situations, and depth perception is a problem that I have to always be conscious of, but driving is not a problem as I feared it would be, because all the distances there are far, and there's no problem with depth perception. A couple of days ago a wild turkey walked into my path and I was absolutely sure I was going to hit him, but swerved adeptly in an instant, and he took off at the same moment, and the turkey lived and I was impressed that my eyes and brain were able to work well together. But I do notice how small all the type is on the computer and how, if there are ways to make it more accessible, I sure don't know where they are. So I feel my way around while typing, and I'm sure I leave typos in there. This Friday I go for the measurement and then I can (I think) resume wearing the contact lens. But I kind of like not having to put it in and take it out every day. Maybe I'll stick with this approach.</description>

			<title>Twitter is mostly bullshit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't get anything from being in a club with journos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't get anything from reading bullshit press releases from politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or people who make their rep by competing to be the biggest asshole on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My art is creating new media. I want to hang out with similarly minded people and people who want to use new media and help build it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We got stuck in a rut in Twitter for 16 years.

Of course many others do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;bounds=54.251081629311635%2C-66.15380978125%2C22.042838623432843%2C-132.37939571875&amp;zoom=5&amp;filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop%2Cparty&quot;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;bounds=50.299224752263044%2C-72.844353615625%2C34.8805999926164%2C-105.957146584375&amp;zoom=6&amp;filters=store%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop%2Cparty&amp;search=Madison%2C%20WI%2C%20USA&quot;&gt;charging stations&lt;/a&gt; Tesla has, only more so, because we the users created them, with some help from twitter (suggested follows, e.g.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone leaves Twitter we must be sure we can take our place in the graph with us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And basically that graph should not be owned by a company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The graph is almost like the US Postal Service before the web came along.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Long ago when the journos were debating how to break up FB, at the time I was saying that FB should be split into two entities, the social graph and everything else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every other developer would be able to use the graph on the same terms as FB part 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're there again, I don't expect the journos to listen to me now any more than they did then.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the punchline. I'm going to put it in uppercase so you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;IF THE SOCIAL GRAPH WERE A PUBLIC RESOURCE, RIGHT NOW SWITCHING OFF TWITTER WOULD BE A TOTAL NON-EVENT. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;LIKE CHANGING YOUR ADDRESS WITH THE POST OFFICE TO HAVE YOUR MAIL FOWARDED. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>If Twitter is imploding...?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked by a number of people what to do, based on the assumption Twitter is imploding.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It’s not yet imploding. Everything seems to work, as before. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’d back up the list of people you follow, and people who follow you. How to do this? Someone should figure it out and write a simple howto.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn’t expect mastodon to be able to handle anything remotely like the load Twitter is handling for years. In the meantime, someone should write a Busy Developers Guide to peering with Mastodon, so we can get started on making the vision really work at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If we wanted a smooth transition we should have planned for a great diaspora. Years ago. But nothing like that happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for Blue Sky.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What is possible, in a few months, if we start working on it now, are mini-twitters, like lifeboats, where a small circle of friends gets together to share stuff within the group. But this won’t be free. But it won’t be that expensive either. Far less than say $8 per month. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another thing that’s possible is using RSS and writing blogs. A “back to the land” movement, perhaps. It’s much less expensive resource-wise, and really works. Lots of pre-existing options.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Realistically those are the choices, imho — with the caveat that I’ve been wrong before and all other disclaimers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Today may be historic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a very unique day, a first-ever -- Twitter is not exactly the world's town square, as some say. It's a world network, of people mostly, the API hasn't really been used very well. Everybody speaks on Twitter, and today everyone has something to say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? A core part of this network is being fired. They all have the ability to communicate with everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reverberations may be felt like nothing before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a sense of this because being one of the first to host a blogging community I learned how strange it is when the people using your software are all able to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When one of our services went down, and we had trouble getting it back on the air, the eruption made the national press. This was in 2004. Twitter is orders of magnitude larger, but it's the same basic idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people all have a podium. Some of their ideas will get through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In 2022, the ability to move simple documents around the net is limited to PDF and Word, both of which are designed for printing not online. What's stopping this? Agreement on what a document is. Twitter says it's titleless and limited to 280 chars. RSS readers say they must have titles (the readers are wrong, btw, nothing wrong with posts without titles). Blogging software, on which Twitter is based, arrived at a simple definition, and that's what I propose Twitter support because it has the simplest and yet most powerful distribution system, and basically everyone who writes is already hooked up to it. This inability of the best network to move documents around reasonably instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1588189183277166594&quot;&gt;as GIFs&lt;/a&gt;, is ridiculous in 2022. It's as if you had to carry a tank of gasoline in your electric vehicle just because they couldn't figure out how to design a car without a gas tank. Total bullshit. This is a feature they could charge for and it would be worth it. It would not be punishment for users for freeloading (as Musk seems to be positioning it). We should start out in our new relationship with a better understanding of what they do and what we do. We write. They provide distribution for writers. Let's make that work really well. No reason you can't make a good living doing that.</description>

			<description>One thing that's great about Musk's takeover of Twitter is that all of a sudden everything is in motion. I've wanted Twitter to allow it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1523656621833875457&quot;&gt;to peer&lt;/a&gt; with simple blogging systems. At least someone is listening to these ideas now. I noticed yesterday that Substack is now openly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SubstackInc/status/1587854840939663366&quot;&gt;competing&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter, again a good thing -- we need more choice, and the non-moving Twitter has been a serious obstacle to progress.</description>

I didn't know this was Google's plug-in. As far as I knew this was the way Chrome shipped. It's possible I installed it myself, it would have had to be a long time ago. But I just right-clicked on the XML icon in the browser's chrome and chose to uninstall it, and I viewed an RSS feed and it came out &quot;literal&quot; -- here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/rssInChrome.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; has been great for me because I don't have to beg Google Reader (or its successors) to support a feature in RSS I want to try out. I just do it. And I can support it in my blog or any of my content-generating tools. This is how you bootstrap new standards.</description>

			<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; has been great for me because I don't have to beg Google Reader (or its successors) to support a feature in RSS I want to try out. I just do it. And I can support it in my blog or any of my content-generating tools.

Previously I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;xmlviewer&lt;/a&gt; app. Mostly because browsers mangle XML text. For some reason they don't mind displaying &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; literally. (This may account for why some developers don't like XML.  Anyway, there's a lot more information about the feed on the FeedLand page, and it's also set up so that if you are logged in, you can subscribe with one click. And of course I don't mind if you do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
