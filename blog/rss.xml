			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/14/theTrumpWeKnewIsGone.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: It's the day after the death of the thing we called Donald Trump. In this podcast I explain how magical things happen in the days after someone you're close to dies. It feels that way with Trump. We got one last look at him, not in person, because the person is gone, the Trump who watched TV and tweeted all day from the White House. Gone, not forgotten, becoming a distant memory. What little is left is finishing up old business, and then will depart for good. It's a 20 minute series of stories. Hope you enjoy!</description>

			<description>I just released a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute&quot;&gt;everyMinute&lt;/a&gt; script. It's now incorporated into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly emailer&lt;/a&gt;. So the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330&quot;&gt;drift I wrote about earlier&lt;/a&gt; should now be gone. Fingers crossed. Knock wood. I am not a lawyer. Praise Murphy. My mother loves me.</description>

			<description>Jason Calacanis &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1361016929993908227&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the Knicks are good at basketball again. They really are. They have two full teams now. I love the way they did it, not like the Nets, Clippers, Lakers. They didn't buy a team of rental players. It's a home grown team. There are a half dozen Jeremy Lins on this team. So much fun to watch.</description>

			<description>I think Apple could make a diff in cars. The other day I was on a longish drive and wanted to listen to the NPR coverage of the Senate hearings. I went in and out of range of various NPR stations. Something the car could have handled for me. A data processing function.</description>

			<description>Listening to pundits yesterday, it was remarkable they forgot how scared we were on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/07.html&quot;&gt;January 7&lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t the end of the insurrection. Something had to be done and impeachment was the only option. That’s why I keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/07/152745.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes&quot;&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt;, it’s like a time machine.</description>

			<description>There is a silver lining to Trump's acquittal. He can now go back to his new occupation of Former Pain In The Ass. Let the bill collectors and district attorneys have him. And Hawley, Cruz and Cotton can go back to their Hitler lessons. Maybe a new reality show that every week gives you a glimpse of the miserable life of a would-be despot, who failed.</description>

			<title>I'm not too depressed</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Net-net I'm not too depressed about the Senate acquittal because I remember how the impeachment happened. It was the only instant response possible. (Except as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/remove-trump-tonight/617576/&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; pointed out at the time, the Senate could have met and voted him out of office the same day, that would have been awesome. Wish they had the guts to do it.) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The inauguration was two weeks away. The concern was what would happen next. People say McConnell refused to have the trial before Trump left, but actually that was somewhat rational. They needed to clean up the Capitol, it was trashed, covered in blood and human excrement, and secure it. It sure looked like there would be more attacks at the time. Also don't forget that then-VP Pence refused to consider the 25th Amendment. He gets his share of the credit, if you want to blame McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We know how it turned out now, but we did not know then. And of course a conviction wouldn't have had much practical value. I think it's better if Trump fades into obscurity. Let minor government officials harass him now. He'll protest. &quot;But but I'm the great Trump!&quot; No, you're now a defendant in criminal and civil trials. Then, no you are a bankrupt resident of a federal or state prison. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's give him something to really complain about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Afternoon impeachment notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We have bigger fish to fry with the pandemic, and it's not just good enough to defeat it, people have to feel the government defeating it. Maybe we don't have a Congress anymore. Maybe it's Biden and a fig leaf for a Congress. Clearly they can't deal with the problem of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For right now, treat Congress as a museum. This is a shell of what it used to be. You have to use your imagination to see that there once was a co-equal branch of government here. Now they're a PR appendage for the executive branch. They give the MSNBC and CNN journos something to fuss over. Keeps them busy when they aren't reporting on President Biden's latest heroic battle against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the Repubs win Congress in 2022, who cares. It’s a powerless former coequal branch of government. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;President Biden will do as he pleases. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up, as with the filibuster there will soon be a virtual insurrection. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fantasy presidency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then Biden renames Air Force One The Rocinante.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden and his wily clever sidekick -- Fauci Man! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Biden and Fauci and Super Veep roam the country, fighting the MAGAs and The Virus, making America safe for whatever comes next. Have to figure that part out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't believe in the death penalty for people, no matter how enraged I am at what they did. But I do believe in the death penalty for political parties.

They both sounded horribly tinny, like an old style AM radio. Actually I didn't give up, it turns out. While watching impeachment hearings, I searched for reports on the Jabra earpods and the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=jabra+elite+75t+tinny&quot;&gt;tinny&lt;/a&gt;, and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Jabra/comments/hf1z9k/should_the_jabra_elite_75t_sound_very_tinny/&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; on Reddit. Basically they said do a bunch of voodoo, put them back in their case, take them out, do it again, change the silicon fits, do it all again, say a prayer, and sooner or later they will sound like you thought they should based on the glowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Wirecutter. It worked! Unreal. This is another example of the way we used to fix broken Apple II's, just take them for a drive in the car, and they start working again. Anyway, good enough. And in the interim I ordered a new pair of Apple Airpod Pros, because I got hooked, and had headset-envy every time I saw someone on TV wearing them. As I've said many times, I collect headsets the same way some &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagesix.com/2021/02/03/kanye-west-moves-500-pairs-of-shoes-out-of-home-shared-with-kim-kardashian/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; collect shoes.</description>

			<description>BTW, Google search is getting worse all the time. I know I've told the story of how we used to fix Apple II's by driving around (they always seemed to work when we got to the repair shop), and I've also said many times that I collect headphones the way some people collect shoes, but Google can no longer find either. I've been using Google search since 1998. I hate Google for the way &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html#a170258&quot;&gt;they treated RSS&lt;/a&gt;, and the way they are doing the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;to the web&lt;/a&gt;, but I've been using their search engine for 23 years, and it's a hard habit to break, but one way to break it is to break search, which they seem to be doing. They should shrug this off at their own peril. Imagine Coke taking the fizz out of their cola. Same basic idea imho.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems likely say 8 Repubs are going to vote to convict.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That means 58 out of 100, a solid bipartisan majority.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty damning imho for the 42 who voted to acquit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet that puts pressure on *some* of the 42 to either be sick the day of the vote, or vote to convict.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My immunity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Next week I'm getting the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had mild side-effects with the first shot, which I got on January 20, also Inauguration Day. I expect it to be worse this time, but I'm excited and a little disoriented by the new reality. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A couple of weeks later, say by March 3, according to the science, I will be at 95% immunity. This means the probability of me getting infected, everything else constant, is only 5% of what it was before January 20.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A bit of info I don't have -- if I were to get infected would it be less likely to be severe or deadly?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course I'm going to continue to be masked. I ordered some new Docker brand masks for the event. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What should I risk after immunity? Go to the movies? Drive down to the city, just to get some bagels perhaps or ride a CitiBike in Central Park? These would seem very exotic now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's been 1.5 years since I've been to a city larger than Kingston, NY. I'm actually quite happy about that. I like life in the mountains.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Suggestion to movie theater owners. Offer 1/2 price to anyone who is fully vaccinated. Or Olive Garden, or Applebee's.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And yes this is yet another boomer privilege. It's fair to hate me but only for this. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

My first taste was yuck this is like water with just a little hint of flavor. So I kept drinking my Diet Dr Pepper, my current go-to carbonated beverage. But then I ran out of chilled DDP, so I went with the backup, and the second time, wow, it was a super refreshing, bubbly instant thirst quench. I know this sounds like a commercial, but that's really where I'm at now. I'd pick Fresca Blackberry Citrus over &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; at this point. Have to get some more. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I've been watching the impeachment trial on and off. It's excellent. They thought of everything. Just asked a big question -- what if Trump had succeeded. He came close. What if they had killed a few senators, the VP, the Speaker. What would have happened next? Clearly this whole thing was planned, probably around the time Barr left. Did he see how it was shaping up and decided to get out then. Are the only ones who stood with Trump up to the coup, Hawley and Cruz? Were they surprised when the mob got into the Capitol? So many questions. A lot of them are off-topic for the impeachment, but historians are going to want to know how this came together.</description>

			<title>It's about power, not feelings</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have never watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-mandalorian-star-gina-carano-fired-amid-social-media-controversy&quot;&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt;, never wanted to. I saw the big comeback Star Wars movie a few years ago and was bored. All the comic book movies are boring. So I have no idea who the actress is who got cancelled, I don't know what she said. But the reaction to her being fired is huge and obnoxious, as usual. So I know it's wrong. Whatever she said, the response is not appropriate to the offense. It's like one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm&quot;&gt;cytokine storms&lt;/a&gt; that kills you when you get Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, she's been fired, you won, you can shut up now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's supposedly all about your feelings. But that's bullshit, right? It's really about power. You like being part of a mob. It's primal. It's probably the same rush the people who invaded the Capitol got. You didn't get sad and depressed, you were excited.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Trumpers say they don't give a fuck about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/11/trumpersAreObnoxious.png&quot;&gt;your feelings&lt;/a&gt;. That gets them hot, and I bet it gets you hot too. The conflict is what you love, right? Here's your chance to have power over someone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/06/154705.html?title=nyTimesFiresDonaldMcneil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. i've read everything i can get my hands on about his cancelling by the NY Times. There isn't much out there. They say 150 staffers at the NYT wrote a letter where they say that he said a word that makes them feel bad and because of that McNeil must go. And he is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Balance that against the huge good that keeping him at the NYT does for people who want to be informed about the pandemic. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/fauci-trump-covid.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; of Anthony Fauci on the Daily podast was amazing. i don't doubt that he saved people's lives in the last year in the podcasts he did and the reports he wrote in the Times. i don't know if he saved my life, but it's possible. I was thirsty to know what was going on, and he has been learning about this his entire career. And he knows how to explain things. Really powerful stuff, right up there with Fauci. He was cancelled. no transparency, no consideration of anyone outside their elite bubble at the NYT. They're royalty so their feelings rule. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So we replace one Trump with another. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please just stop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Airpods followup. As you may recall, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/30.html#a162514&quot;&gt;lost one of my AirPod Pro's&lt;/a&gt; 10 days ago. I tried to order a replacement through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getsupport.apple.com/repair?caseid=101319750634&amp;locale=en_US&quot;&gt;Apple website&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=sfaq&amp;PGF=PGF32003&amp;category_id=SC0298&amp;symptom_id=23360&quot;&gt;the page&lt;/a&gt; appears to be broken. So I compromised, and bought a couple of less expensive bud-style headphones, one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082Y2KM92/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;, which comes highly recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-earbuds/&quot;&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0857JLRFJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;Skullcandy&lt;/a&gt;. Together they cost about what the Airpod Pro's cost. But here's the thing, both of them sound awful on my iPhone. No bass at all, all high end. So I tried them on my Pixel 4a, same thing. My hearing is fine, I tried the one remaining AirPod Pro, and it sounds great. So now I'm trying to figure out how to equalize the audio on either of these phones. I can't believe there isn't a built-in equalizer, but it seems there's not. I really got to like the AirPods, didn't think I would. I find over-ear headphones clunky now.</description>

			<description>I woke up in the middle of the night, as I often do. I always get out the iPad, check the nightly email. Make sure it went out at midnight. Noticed that the mail-sender's clock is drifting, have to do something about that. Every few days it sends the mail one second later. This is cumulative, leading to drift. So last night's mail went out at 12:00:21 AM. There is definitely a way around it. I'll let you know when I write the code. Next I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doomscrolling&quot;&gt;doomscrolling&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter, only tonight I'm seeing clever women putting down men. Some of them are really funny. A woman listening to a neighbor playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBupII3LH_Q&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pink_Panther&quot;&gt;The Pink Panther&lt;/a&gt; on his sax over and over, poorly. Next up, a woman sings an Irish ditty a cappella telling a man to stop explaining things to her. Then a NYT reporter who's been attacked the way only a woman can be attacked, to which I say, no -- men really do get attacked on the net too, in more horrific ways than you describe, sometimes involving police with weapons drawn, with all the fire trucks in Berkeley, lights flashing and sirens blazing. Other times, knocks at the front door in the middle of the night at your real actual house, the place you sleep. Also people who stalk your friends, so you have to have a conversation with your friends about this. Anyway, long story, sorry, I know I suck. Then I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paramountplus/status/1357395624874835969&quot;&gt;this ad&lt;/a&gt; for Paramount+ -- a new ridiculously unwelcome expensive streaming service. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paramountplus/status/1357395624874835969&quot;&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt; for my mood. You have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paramountplus/status/1357395624874835969&quot;&gt;watch it&lt;/a&gt;, I'm not going to narrate it, for fear of being excoriated online. But sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-Head&quot;&gt;Beavis and Butthead&lt;/a&gt; just nail it. Amazing. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>So many programs when you sit down to use them for the first time, don't explain themselves. It's impossible to figure out how to make it work, even if you already understand the general purpose of the program. A good friend sent a pointer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://astexplorer.net/&quot;&gt;AST Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that takes input from some language and shows you the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree&quot;&gt;abstract synatx tree&lt;/a&gt; for it. Okay that's something I want to do. The language is JavaScript, and let's say the parser is Acorn. Now what? So many choices. And where's the button that says GO, do the thing, give me result. I clicked on the ? in the menubar, hoping it might give me a 1-2-3 to see the app in action, but it starts out with a list of all the myriad things it can do! I can already see that from the UI. I want the docs to give me a procedure for using it. I'm human. I don't know how to use the app. Help me please. (This is generally good advice not just for this app. Before you give it to a user to try, sit down yourself and pretend you know as much about the app as they do. Use newbie eyes.)</description>

			<description>I was asked why I care that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/06/154705.html?title=nyTimesFiresDonaldMcneil&quot;&gt;NYT fired Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. It's pretty simple. We all have an interest in how journalism works. They like to say that journalism is a essential part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/opinion/international-world/athens-democracy-forum.html&quot;&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;, but do the people have any influence over journalism? To really press the point, democracy is about the people, right? You can't be of democracy without being of the people. We have a role in this, which journalism hasn't embraced, in fact by fighting Facebook they are actively undermining our participation. And when they fire a great reporter who helps people, I, simply as a person and nothing more, have a stake in that, as does everyone who depends on good information from news orgs. And sure I care how 150 reporters at the NY Times feel, but I don't care abput them that much, compared to how much I care about the service McNeil was providing.</description>

			<description>Another reason the firing of McNeil was such a concern is this question: Would the 150 people at the NY use their power to cancel against the people they cover, for an infraction like McNeil's. Are we ready to accept that as a proper role of reporters at a news organization?</description>

			<description>Part of program design is checking your assumptions. Sometimes things that conceptually seem like a lot of work, might not take a lot of time to run. A great example of this was in the early 00s, I wanted to add a feature to Radio UserLand that was eventually called &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/stories/storyReader$6957&quot;&gt;upstreaming&lt;/a&gt;. It would watch a folder and mirror any changes to a server. That way you could maintain a website on your local hard disk. I had investigated ways to do it through the operating system, but it was too complicated, or not reliable, I don't remember why, but it wasn't feasible to use it. So I decided to write a bit of script code that watched the folder, the simple dumb way, to see what I was up against. To my surprise it took virtually no time to scan a large nested folder looking for changed files. It was something you could do every few seconds without a performance hit. The product shipped, thousands of people used it, upstreaming worked. I try to keep that in mind. Always check your assumptions. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The promise of the web, twitter, etc for journalism is it's supposed to give the people a voice in the news. So far that has not happened. That has been the core of the clumsy argument we're having about Facebook. Users like it, because it gives us a voice. I think though journalism hasn't been clear about it, even to themselves, that's why they don't like Facebook. It encroaches on their exclusivity.</description>
