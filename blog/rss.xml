			<description>I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/15/memoTrump.png&quot;&gt;looking&lt;/a&gt; at the home page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memeorandum.com/&quot;&gt;Memeorandum&lt;/a&gt; this morning, wondering how journalism would adjust to not having a daily Trump story (or more) to obsess over. How will everyone else deal with that. What will Maddow talk about every night? The fear factor should diminish, one would hope. Former presidents have much less power than sitting presidents. Trump could be the exception. They will have plenty to write about. First the impeachment. The trials of the January 6 insurrectionists. Trump's trials, bankruptcy. Trump going to jail? One can hope. Will this be good for Biden? For us? I don't know. The Democrats need to get a great online organizing machine rolling, for more than raising money and getting out votes. We need to have healthy forms of political action, to balance out the evil kind, which we're seeing so much of. Say what you will about Trump, he did organize an active base. The Democrats could too, but they don't seem to know it. Same as it always was.</description>

			<description>Come to think about it, Maddow will have plenty to talk about as details of how Trump and his associates hollowed out and looted the US government while they were in office. We'll be finding smoking holes in the ground for decades to come. Things that used to work that no longer exist. So if you need a nightly story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/trump-coronavirus-american-carnage.html&quot;&gt;American carnage&lt;/a&gt;, you will be well taken care of.</description>

			<description>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510771928010753&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from the Wednesday about the &quot;significant ramifications&quot; of banning Trump from Twitter. In the thread he talks about Twitter funding an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992&quot;&gt;open decentralized standard&lt;/a&gt; for social networks called Blue Sky. I remember when they announced this in 2019, I think I offered to help then, and I offered again today. Creating an open distributed system at Twitter's scale is an ambitious undertaking.</description>

			<description>There are, as far as I know, two places to get a Covid vaccine in Ulster County, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19.ulstercountyny.gov/vaccine-resource-center/&quot;&gt;county itself&lt;/a&gt; in Kingston and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drnealsmoller.com/vax&quot;&gt;Village Apothecary&lt;/a&gt; in Woodstock. Neither are making appointments now, but you can register to be notified when they are. If you know of others, send me a link and I'll try to post it here or in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Roku's UI?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think Roku is an incredible product. The remote is the best. The UI is great. On screens that integrate it, where Roku is the OS, it's even better. It's how screens should work, imho. I called it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;Entertainment Desktop&lt;/a&gt; in April 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's something I've heard a lot -- Roku's user interface &quot;needs work.&quot; Or it's old-looking, dated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I don't get it. Compared to what? It seems pretty good to me, and I've spent decades thinking about and working on interfaces for stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Remember iTunes?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Nets traded for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30706097/sources-houston-rockets-trade-james-harden-brooklyn-nets&quot;&gt;James Harden&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top stars in the NBA. They gave up most of their draft picks, so their future looks pretty grim. And they now have two of the most worst-attitude players in the NBA in Kyrie Irving and Harden. Not sure about Durant. But I wonder how many games Kyrie is going to play this year, when ball-hog Harden is on the court. Maybe he can lead the second team. Somehow the power has to gravitate away from the stars, and back to the teams. In the meantime, it's kind of a blessing for the Knicks that none of the superstars want to play there. That way every victory feels earned. The team has a spirit. Of course they have egos, but none so dominant as the ones who now play for Brooklyn. Now I just wish I could watch the Knicks for less than $65 a month, which is a ripoff that I refuse to pay.</description>

			<title>Terrorism and tech</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The NYT needs someone who understands tech at a human level, the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/donald-g-mcneil-jr&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; understands viruses. Yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/podcasts/the-daily/capitol-attack-social-media-parler-twitter-facebook.html&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/a&gt; could have been so much better, more informative, and less scary.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The terrorists will hit some new speed bumps now that they've had some success. If their online groups follow the pattern of every group I've ever belonged to, it won't be long before they're attacking each other. Probably has already started.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just like there were defenses against the virus, which we learned about in March from McNeil, there are defenses against the terrorists, beyond deplatforming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maddow needs help too. You know how she always asks if she got it right and the other person says yes. Well, when it comes to tech, the answer is no. Her stories, when they involve tech are usually nonsense.(I say usually because I haven't heard them all.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, the app stores on Google and Apple. That's where Parler was cut off. They didn't provide back-end services, they provided distribution. Like when you buy bread at the supermarket, they didn't make the bread, but they have it all there in one place for you to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Apple and Google, they make it very hard if not impossible to install something that didn't come through their store. This is for security, and also gives them full control over the platform. So when they removed Parler, that was pretty much the end for them on mobile devices. They still had the open web until Amazon knocked them off there too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also the news is butchering the difference between Amazon and the others (Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google). They are providing something completely different. And them kicking Parler off is pretty unprecedented for them. That in itself is big news. Like the failure of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's another interesting angle that they touched on yesterday in the Daily, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming&quot;&gt;deplatforming&lt;/a&gt; has a disadvantage, it means it's harder to spy on the terrorists. Something like this happened 20 years ago with Napster. At that time everyone was getting their music from Napster. The music industry, sued them, and won, buh bye Napster. But something was lost there. The idea of a central place for music, that might have been interesting. It'll never happen again, just like we will never get the Coronavirus contained again, as it was before 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tech is interesting! But the lack of confidence among journalists not only lets people manipulate them (Hillary's emails) it often distributes information that's just plain wrong and that's too bad. Because a lot of these things aren't mysteries now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="With Apple and Google, they make it very hard if not impossible to install something that didn't come through their store. This is for security, and also gives them full control over the platform. So when they removed Parler, that was pretty much the end for them on mobile devices. They still had the open web until Amazon knocked them off there too." created="Thu, 14 Jan 2021 16:34:04 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/14/163200.html?title=terrorismAndTech#a163404"/>
				<source:outline text="Also the news is butchering the difference between Amazon and the others (Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google). They are providing something completely different. And them kicking Parler off is pretty unprecedented for them. That in itself is big news. Like the failure of a vaccine." created="Thu, 14 Jan 2021 16:34:14 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/14/163200.html?title=terrorismAndTech#a163414"/>
				<source:outline text="There's another interesting angle that they touched on yesterday in the Daily, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming&quot;&gt;deplatforming&lt;/a&gt; has a disadvantage, it means it's harder to spy on the terrorists. Something like this happened 20 years ago with Napster. At that time everyone was getting their music from Napster. The music industry, sued them, and won, buh bye Napster. But something was lost there. The idea of a central place for music, that might have been interesting. It'll never happen again, just like we will never get the Coronavirus contained again, as it was before 2019." created="Thu, 14 Jan 2021 16:34:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/14/163200.html?title=terrorismAndTech#a163419"/>

			<description>Suppose for the sake of argument that the election was rigged, a conspiracy between state governments, including Republican state governments, and journalism. Do you think their coverup could be so complete we'd never have hard proof of this conspiracy? Hard to imagine intelligent people believing that it could. And BTW, don't think they're not intelligent. There were a lot of very educated and successful people who attacked the Capitol last week. What's going on inside these people? Not asking a question of people who read this blog, just expressing bewilderment. At what point will their deep gullibility lose out to their experience and bullshit detection?</description>

			<description>Repubs are objecting to being scanned for weapons going onto the House floor. Should we conclude that they have been bringing weapons onto the floor? Why else would the Capitol police want to put a scanner there? Are they afraid of a hostage situation where the perp is a member of Congress? So many questions. If in the opinion of some reps, they are entitled to bring weapons onto the floor, is there a limit? Can they bring automatic weapons? Grenades? An automatic grenade launcher? How about a tank, could they bring a tank onto the floor of the House. I suppose that could come in handy.</description>

			<description>Over the years Trump was on Twitter, I had him blocked. I urged people I follow not to RT him. That's the first and only rule of trolls, &lt;i&gt;don't feed them.&lt;/i&gt; That's what they need. His fans love that he pisses off the libtards (that's you btw). How much more effective it would have been if instead of waiting for Twitter to ban him, we all did it, by blocking him. Pay no attention. That would have been incredible. But people need to learn. Okay now it's time not to RT the Repubs as they desperately try to reboot their reality distortion field. Let Trump's base take care of them. Don't RT them. &lt;i&gt;Let them fail.&lt;/i&gt; When you feed their attempts at controversy you are, perhaps ironically, saving them.</description>

			<description>Trump doesn't need Twitter, he could just use a blog. If he did, there would be pathways for people to find out he updated, and software that would let his followers read his latest messages, in reverse chronological order. There would be no Twitter to shut him down. Now, I'm not sure where he could go to get the blog hosted. I wonder if Blogger and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/11/messageFromWordpress.png&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; et al have considered what they'd do if he started a blog in either of those places. Thing to know is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is a lot easier to deploy than a Twitter-like system, and it could be distributed. We looked at lots of those things in the heyday of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Napster%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; to route around the music industry. I hate that I'm helping Trump be the monster he is, but I feel obligated to share this with my followers, who probably want to think about real-world applications of distributed internet technology.</description>

			<description>Here's something positive. Re this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-trump-supporters-turned-one-mild-mannered-dc-lawyer-into-the-angry-guyonporch/2021/01/07/384be64c-5106-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NRKveronica/status/1347002291249770496&quot;&gt;GuyOnPorch and WomanInCar&lt;/a&gt; meme that became viral. Let me set the stage. The guy on the porch is an older white man. He's screaming obscenities at MAGAs (off-camera) telling them to get the fuck out of DC. Then the camera swings to a black woman in her car, and she's kind of astonished to see the white man saying what she was thinking. And she said so. I cried watching it. Later in the profile they said something that grabbed me. “Humphries was stunned that it was this 60-year-old White man speaking her truth. Their truth.” I wanted to give them both a big hug. We need to get our shit together. It's not just her truth and his truth, it's the truth of America. We love this country. And that means we love each other. For real.</description>

			<description>I had a post here entitled Morning Depression Notes. I deleted it. I don't need to make your day worse. But I do want to say Monday January 11, 2021 is one of the worst days ever. I somehow made it through 2020 without getting depressed. But 2021, it's a real challenge. Maybe I just want to say one thing. Let's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Participants_in_rebellion&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/a&gt; all the Republican senators, except Mitt Romney. Send them all home. They had a chance to stop this, the Dems tee'd it up for them, all they had to do was vote to convict. Sure they might have lost their jobs. They're going to lose them anyway. But they might have had a tiny little bit of residual honor, and we all could have stood up for them, when the MAGA mob comes for them. Now, let em go -- out the airlock. Good riddance.</description>

			<description>A long time ago I wanted to try Google Cloud Platform. I had to give them a credit card. I quickly decided I didn't want the service, so I turned off my test project. Now the card has expired and they're sending me emails saying that I have to register a new credit card. But my bill is $0, has been forever. I don't owe them any money and I don't want the service. I have written them feedback using their support mechanism. Yet I still get the warning emails. The easy thing to do would be to give them a new credit card. This is the power of huge faceless corporations. Even small ones can threaten your credit rating. A foot doctor sends me bills for $40 every few months. Can't talk to the doctor, they won't permit it. Or Experian had a bug that caused my credit to be hurt. It has hurt a lot of other people, I hear. This is the background to the idea of Amazon shutting off an annoying customer because people, including their employees, are hassling them about it. You better stay popular with the people Amazon cares about or you'll be out on the street. I'm not going to give Google a new credit card. Let's see what happens.</description>

			<description>Assume Trump's devs are scrambling to get up a new social net. I'm sure they'll find something. I heard it said they won't get thru the App Store and Google Play. This is true. So guess what -- they'll have to use the open web. Politics and tech make strange bedfellows. ;-)</description>

			<source:outline text="Assume Trump's devs are scrambling to get up a new social net. I'm sure they'll find something. I heard it said they won't get thru the App Store and Google Play. This is true. So guess what -- they'll have to use the open web. Politics and tech make strange bedfellows. ;-)" created="Sat, 09 Jan 2021 17:49:10 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/09.html#a174910"/>

			<description>A friend writes on Facebook: &quot;Apple, Google, AT&amp;T and Verizon know who was inside the Capitol. The FBI has names and warrants already.&quot;</description>

			<description>The arguments about how you don't have free speech on private platforms don't reflect the reality of Twitter and Facebook, which have monopolistic power in the worlds they define. Those worlds are huge, powerful, growing, and most important here -- exclusive. We call them &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22silos%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;silos&lt;/a&gt; in tech, but they behave like monopolies in other contexts. They don't imho have the rights of truly private companies because they wield government-like power that can have the effect of restricting speech. Because they are silos, there's no way to route around them. This is dangerous stuff. Suppose for example the Republican Party owned Twitter. You can see how that would damage free discourse in our political system. And it's not impossible for a political entity to take control of Twitter, they're not very highly valued in the stock market. That's why the government must be involved in decisions that cut off political leaders. What made this situation so difficult is that it was &lt;i&gt;the president&lt;/i&gt; who needed to be silenced, before he could do more damage. A tough call, and a very difficult precedent. BTW, I do advocate for political parties becoming social networks. I think they already are that.</description>

			<description>Also, having the employees of Twitter and Facebook influening the censorship decisions the companies make is not good ethically. The employees should do their jobs, they should not personally have any say in who gets to use the network. We need ethical rules for professionals in tech. Here's an example from the medical profession. If you were a doctor in a hospital, and they wheeled in someone whose political opinions you abhor, you have to treat them no matter what. We insist that bakeries in Indiana bake cakes for gay couples as they would for heterosexual couples. It's easy to see when people you disagree with overstep professional ethical boundaries, much harder to see it when you do it yourself.</description>

			<description>These kinds of decisions have a lot of impact. For example, I was blacklisted from speaking at a few tech conferences probably because their sponsors didn't like the affect my work was having on their closed networks. As a result, I'm perceived to having left tech, when in fact, a couple of powerful and/or rich people pressured conference promoters to not allow me a public presence. When I complained about it on my blog, or in person to friends, they shrugged it off, kind of the way Repubs shrug off ethical failures in their work. There are consequences to this kind of back-room deal-making. By this time very few people have any sympathy for Trump, but this act sets a precedent. You may not like it when someone you support is cut off this way.</description>
