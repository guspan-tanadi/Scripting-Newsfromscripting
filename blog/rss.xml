			<title>Fight against hell</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When people say we're &quot;fighting for democracy&quot; even that isn't strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We must fight so we don't become a fascist country with slavery for Blacks, ovens for Jews and women turned into baby-producing handmaidens. And for a human-habitable planet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think that isn't what's happening, well it is.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This country has never actually revoked slavery. A lot of people are still bitter about the outcome of the Civil War. Blacks are not, according to many Americans, entitled to the full rights of Americans.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anti-semitism is also a foundation, not just of America, but most of the world. We heard Trump say that American Jews are really citizens of Israel, which emphatically is not true.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And the last one, women as baby-producing handmaidens, that's what overturning Roe v Wade is for.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And of course it's not just Blacks, Jews and women, there's a hellish place for every non-white non-male  non-Christian American. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And who knows why they don't want to keep the planet habitable for humans. Maybe they think God meant for them (and not us of course) to migrate to other planets. Whatever it is, it's another form of hell. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yet journalism still mostly sees it as a partisan horse-race and every step we take into the abyss is bad news for one or two people like Biden or Schumer. Their delusion by now is really a form of insanity. Forget about waking them up, we have to move past them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that unites us is the hell the Trumpists have in mind for all of us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tree Charts and outliners</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in 1986, my then-company Living Videotext shipped a product called MORE. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We called it that because there was so much more in it than the earlier outliner, ThinkTank 512, we didn't have any idea which new feature, if any, would be the one that turned people on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't have the luxury of picking among them because our company was on the verge of going out of business. We needed help from Apple to make it to shipping. They gave us a loan of $400K, and we put our source code in escrow in case the company failed, which looked like a real possibility. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well the product was an instant hit. And now, so many years later, I can tell you for sure which features made the difference -- tree charts and bullet charts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a MORE tree chart looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.userland.com/misc/outliners/images/more11c/treeChart.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You'd edit an outline, click a button and boom a colorful tree chart would appear. Go back to the outline and make a change, view it again, and boom, the tree chart changed. Up till then color graphics, which were still very new to computers, was something for a priesthood. This was color graphics for &lt;i&gt;thinkers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We sold a huge number of MOREs that year and in 1987 sold the company for a lot of money and I was able to go back to making software and stop being a CEO which was a good thing for me to do! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's 2022 Dave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;OK so here we are, it's 2022, an unthinkable number of years later (36) and here we are again. We have a nice powerful outliner. Like MORE it can print (these days that means render as a blog), but where are the beautiful graphics?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here they are. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/treechart/blob/main/README.md&quot;&gt;new Tree Chart viewer&lt;/a&gt; that hooks into Drummer very neatly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; user, go have fun. I'm sure you'll love it. And if you use another kind of outliner, either give Drummer a try, or ask the people who make your outliner to have a look at Tree Chart (it's open source) and either adapt their outliner to work with Tree Chart (the better idea) or adapt Tree Chart to work with their outliner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, these days my product is interop. I made my fortune in the 80s, and I've invested well enough so that I don't need a hit product now. What I want to do is re-kindle the interest in computers used as thinking tools around common formats and protocols so it can grow like the open web, not so much like a silo. We've been down both roads and open is better for the users. And also for the vendors imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>We need to change the subject</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The press is stuck in a rut. Everything is about Biden and the various horse races. But that isn't what matters. What matters is that we don't become a fascist country with slavery for Blacks, ovens for Jews and women turned into baby-producing handmaidens. Also a human-habitable planet would be nice. Focus on these things. This is what matters, not that random journalists earn a salary for flushing America down the toilet.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Melber&quot;&gt;Ari Melber&lt;/a&gt; last night. The only reason I didn't turn it off is because he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Carville&quot;&gt;James Carville&lt;/a&gt; on. Melber is entertaining and sometimes interesting, but usually just repeats the same bullshit night after night all the while claiming to be a journalist. He's an entertainer. But Carville, while also very entertaining, actually has ideas that you don't hear all the time on cable and in the NYT etc. More Carville please. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Carville says. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Dems are actually doing okay. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They would do better if there were a few more Dems in the Senate, and also in the House. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So the campaign, he says, should be about what they can do for us, workers, families. And they have quite a few things they want to do for us, s&lt;i&gt;o sell those things!&lt;/i&gt; Man, sometimes it's so simple when you get a clear thinker who doesn't have anything in particular to sell and doesn't give a shit if you like him (and we do like him, he's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coonass&quot;&gt;coonass&lt;/a&gt; after all). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Four more Senators and hold the House, and you can have it all. So we can do some very specific things &lt;i&gt;for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's so logical. Get actors, great ones, who look like Democratic voters, and run ads that say what Carville says they should say, and let's have the slogan be something like this. You have the power, for real. Just vote, and we all win. Yeah it could be shorter. Use the last three words. We All Win. Come on, that's what it's about. I would give the max to fund such a campaign and so would a lot of people. The ads sell more ads. And the call to action is: Make a difference and vote. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run the same ad with different faces. Surprise us, have one with Stacey Abrams or Val Demings. Run it over and over. We all win. We all win. Over and over. Buttons, bumper stickers, flags, lawn signs. We all win everywhere all the time. Basketball games. Hockey games. Football, baseball. County fairs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because we all want to feel we can do good. Maybe not all of us, but I suspect a lot of Trump voters while they may be racist (face it, we're a racist country, so you have to work really hard to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be racist) what they really want is this: To make a difference. Trump filled a vacuum, the Democrats while they care about us in the aggregate, never get that we are individuals and we want to make a difference. We all want to know there's something we can do to help us all win. If you want to win, Mr or Ms Democrat, you have to bring the people into your marketing. And then, if you want to keep governing and not be completely obstructed, you have to bring us into governing too. The mistake that Obama made was not bringing the people into his administration. McConnell and his fascist Federalists wouldn't have been able to stand up to him if he had us behind him. No Democrat should ever try to do that again (though Biden is doing it too). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all win. Tatoo that on your forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Journalism could have said that despite what the candidate is saying this is what Repubs do when they gain control of a state government, esp one in the South. So when you vote for the Republican, no matter how you feel about Critical Race Theory, he's doing to do X, Y and Z which are things that most Americans find hideous. And btw, the Democrats could do that too. They are awfully nice to their Republican friends.

			<title>What is Electric Drummer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As we're starting to test the Linux and Windows versions of Electric Drummer there have been some basic questions. I thought I should respond publicly so people understand what we're doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; or E/D for short, is an app that runs on the desktop, hosted by its operating system.  Like a word processor or a graphics program. It's most like &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/building-hybrid-applications-with-electron/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; editor, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=drummer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-tab outliner for note-taking, organizing and publishing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It runs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful environment that makes cross-platform apps easier to create and manage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D saves files on your local file system as any desktop app does. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It can also hook up to your web Drummer account for outlines that you want to make public. It's how I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. The outline that I edit is on my local system,. It's also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/blog.opml&quot;&gt;public file&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be accessed by the CMS when I ask it to render my blog from the outline. The public file is stored in my web Drummer account. It's a nice combination.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D is a scripting system, like web Drummer is. It will be able to access the local file system, and also will be able to run a server, none of which are possible from the web app. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is already a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of E/D that has been available since October 10, when Drummer shipped. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same as web Drummer, a few commands work differently because it runs in a different place, but it's the same code, same outliner, same UI, same bugs (!), etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can tell today is going to be &lt;i&gt;one of those&lt;/i&gt; days. My power went out overnight, but luckily I have a generator this winter (newly installed in the summer) and it automatically kicked in. But there are no outages listed on the Central Hudson outage map. Oy. I'll make the best of it.</description>

			<title>Political marketing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do I have anyone following me who is a political marketer? Is there such a thing. We need them now.  The way you fight this, and it's getting late, is by demonstrating the opposite.   Famous people of different races visibly doing things to help each other. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MU4F79oyfT&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to do.  We should be wearing buttons, small ones, with MLK's image on it. People of all colors. Americans. Showing support for all of us, esp people whose ancestors were slaves.   We have to urgently heal this huge wound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to do, we need to show each other that we are here, in great numbers.   I don't like huge national marches, what I'd love more than anything is people showing their passion for voting. Not just in November, but every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's meet up at our polling places for coffee and a sandwich and good old political talk. Talk about what we want. Yes there will be trolls there. But let's hope we outnumber them. I think we will always outnumber them, but can we get out there and show it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we need to use online advertising.   Campaigns should NEVER GO OFF THE AIR.  This a vestige of TV-based media, last generation.  And they should raise money and pay for themselves.  And speak with power, not powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've lost the marketing war, with a Baby Huey type character as the other side's spokesperson. We have much better people, but we lack the political organization and understanding of how little time is left.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They start out easy at the beginning of each week, and get harder progressively until the Sunday puzzle which only great crossword solvers can do, like my mom. It was one of the things we could do together. I'd fill in a few of the answers and come back later to find the whole puzzle solved. She said she didn't mind that I did the easy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post recently started publishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/crossword-puzzles/daily/&quot;&gt;free crosswords&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I'm a paying NYT subscriber, their crosswords cost more, even for me. I find the Post crosswords are just as satisfying and clever as the NYT ones, and the price is great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know I have never been the answer to a clue in a NYT puzzle, or for that matter on Jeopardy. And I've never written a NYT guest column. I will be able to die a happy man when I've checked all these boxes. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we turn to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;. At first I looked at it and thought it was too much trouble, but then I read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/01/13/164646.html?title=solvingWordleWithLetterFrequency&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by my friend Ken Smith, the English professor from Indiana, who explained how to approach it mathematically. The idea is that your first word should have as many of the most likely characters as possible, which are the vowels and N, R, S, T etc. Then I don't know the best approach for the second word or third. What I've been doing is taking the matches from the first word, and there are bound to be one or two, and use them in the second word. If the position is correct, use that letter in that position, to make it a bit like a crossword, except there is no clue. Repeat in the third, fourth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've played Wordle twice and both times got extremely lucky and solved the puzzle in the third word. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; Scrabble. No patience for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html#6&quot;&gt;Que Sera Sera&lt;/a&gt;, October 1996.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To anyone who wants to lead -- show us software that's fun and empowering, get us interested and excited. Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted. We're at a crossroads now, do we go back to the mess of the past or do we learn to enjoy the que sera of it all, and stop seeing threats everywhere we look?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much of the energy is about defeating and destroying, so little is about creating. People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans. They forget that no matter how rich and intimidating each leader of our industry is, or would-be leader, none of them predicted the world we live in now, and by extrapolation they are powerless to control the world we will live in in 1997 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll do my part: here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I finally am able to use Linux as a GUI machine, not just a command line thing. But it's burning my brain cells that the Cmd and Ctrl keys are in the opposite places as on my Mac (and in my brain). It's easy to change key mapping on the Mac, but on Ubuntu, you have to do some pretty horrible stuff.</description>

			<description>With yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/165018/covid-vaccine-mandate-struck-down&quot;&gt;Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; about Covid and OSHA, I think we're firmly in illegitimacy territory. I'm not sure if I were president I would obey this edict. This is a crisis. Maybe not treated as such by journalism, but what else can we expect from this court.</description>

			<title>Sinema for president?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr -- it might work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1481836126495256576&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; asking people to identify Sinema as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;bribed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blackmailed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;held hostage&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;insane&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had not considered another possibility -- she wants to be president! This came up in a tweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1481997298078990336&quot;&gt;forwarded&lt;/a&gt; by  the innovative Democratic campaigner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first thought: no way, maybe option #4 is correct after all, but then on reflection, it would increase interest in the primary and that's a good thing. Nothing is worse than a primary with candidates who all appear to be losers or bore you to death in their speeches, or worse make you feel uncomfortable (Biden, Hillary Clinton). And I don't want another Obama, I feel wounded by his presidency. Left us in a bad place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then I realize, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI5Z7Zg64YM&quot;&gt;Sinema&lt;/a&gt; is a good speaker, based on video of her back when she gave speeches. This crazy personal insurrection of hers has done one thing, it has made her much more famous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People vote for candidates who are confident and make them feel good about themselves, like they matter. That's pretty much it. I wish it were otherwise, but there's a lot to be said requiring a leader to be able to lead. Yes it matters where they lead us, but to a lot of voters, their thoughts don't go that far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've beem thinking about who I want to run in 2024. My two main interests are Jay Inslee and Gavin Newsom. Both are confident, good speakers, and their politics are  straight Democrat. I think they are our best shot at winning, and yes that's the primary concern. We simply can't have another Republican president and not go completely to hell. Please don't ever overlook that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's also a note there on how this will evolve. Right now all the loose-ends are showing, that's because I know almost nothing about LogSeq. As the people from LogSeq-land get familiar with this, they will no doubt have ideas about how to better integrate this software so it's super easy. This is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=bootstrap&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;bootstraps&lt;/a&gt; start.</description>
