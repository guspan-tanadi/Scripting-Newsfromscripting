			<description>Something interesting to ponder. When we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt;-compatible social media networks, there will be no more wall between blogging and tweeting or tooting. And then we will be able to choose our writing tools and they could be blogging tools as easily as they are the tiny little writing boxes Twitter et al give us. Blogging tools are equipped to deal with titles, styles, links, enclosures, no length limit, editing. These might seem like luxuries now, but once we have them, we'll be amazed that we put up without them for so long when they were very very very very easy to implement.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/blueskyoutliner/&quot;&gt;Bluesky People Browser&lt;/a&gt;: I'm playing with ideas of how to browse around a network of followers on a social media platform. Bluesky is the first that I've had an OPML interface to work with. So I created an outliner for walking the structure of people and who they follow on Bluesky.</description>

			<title>ChatGPT is great, reason #897</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am an infrequent SQL query writer. My knowledge of the language is pretty limited, but I'm pretty good at understanding the kinds of things it can do, and since I am an experienced programmer, I can specify my needs in fairly accurate technical terms, they just don't happen to be in the SQL programming language. That's where ChatGPT is very useful! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote out my query in pseudocode, ie English --&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have a database with three tables, feeds and subscriptions and users. If a user subscribes to a feed there is a record in the subscriptions table connecting the two. I want a query that tells me which feeds have 0 subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the old days before ChatGPT I'd write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22braintrust+query%22&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;, put it on my blog and the odds were pretty good that in 24 hours I'd have the answer, and would feel grateful and proud. That of course would be after putting in a few minutes trying to find the answer using Google and StackExchange. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I just &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/aad60d06-4d3f-4279-ae6f-dd0296426f3e&quot;&gt;feed it to ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and it translates it for me, to good SQL code, and in ten minutes I have the query and the answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;SELECT feeds.feedurl, feeds.title FROM feeds LEFT JOIN subscriptions ON feeds.feedurl = subscriptions.feedurl GROUP BY feeds.feedurl, feeds.title HAVING COUNT(subscriptions.feedurl) = 0;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I edited it a bit because it assumed field names where I used slightly different names. And I never said that fields had URLs that identify them, and we must use that, not the unique integer ID that each row also has. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It worked. Turns out there are 872 feeds in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt;'s database that have no subscribers. I'm looking for ways to make the feed reading part of FeedLand perform better, and time spent reading feeds no one is watching could be a place for savings. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, you have made me a more confident and creative programmer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Succession notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Spoilers! Spoilers!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I imagine during the day I'm going to think of a few random things about Succession. Be sure this is 100% top to bottom spoiler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A nice thing about Succession: The Roy kids could fuck each other up and all the while they're still a family. They spent a lot of time on that in the last episode. Trying to give us a glimpse of the future for them. Now the ways the hurt each other will be more mundane, more like a normal 0.0001 percenter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Succession is a parody, that's what makes it so entertaining. And they play games with us, distract us into overlooking what was obvious -- what eluded all three of the kids, even though the adults were constantly reminding them that they didn't compete at the level they thought they did. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just got some quiet time to think about the story of Succession, and the whole show was constructed brilliantly to leave you with the feeling that how could we not all have seen this coming, it was just math. Once the &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The ending of Succession was like a magic trick, revealed. The answer was right before us. Impossible to miss. Yet..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for anyone else, but I was led astray by this speech from Karl, about Tom: “You’re a clumsy interloper and no one trusts you. The only guy pulling for you is dead. And now, you’re just married to the ex-boss’ daughter, and she doesn’t even like you. And you are fair and squarely fucked.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pretty close to the beginning Marcia said: &quot;He made you a playground and you think it's the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Logan said, recently: &quot;You are not serious people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Logan was a monster. The Swede is a monster. The kids are journalists, pundits. A tribute band if that. They think there are plays. As if they were performing for spin. But the Swede lies and steals and cheats. He was the guy who was Logan's successor, if you think it was Tom, sorry Tom is the next Gerri.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

In certain situations, telling a lie to save someone's life, that's probably the right thing to do, but lying to spare someone's feelings? They'll be upset if you tell the truth so you don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a house where you had to manage other people's feelings. It was so dirty and I hated it so much. I had serious stomach issues as a kid, that suddenly went away when I was no longer living in that house. But being selfless meant I had to spare everyone else's feelings, and as result, betray myself, hurt myself, act selfless, as in my &quot;self&quot; doesn't exist. But outside the family, I was surprised to find that I actually did have a self.  And that is when I &lt;i&gt;started&lt;/i&gt; feeling like a person. Started, I still had a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until many years later that I discovered these patterns everywhere in my life, just not so suffocating as the ones in my childhood home. I was always clashing against this, because I wanted to do important creative things with my life, and as they say -- you can't lie to a compiler, garbage in, garbage out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a hot topic here because I've listened through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-165-dark-star-by-the-grateful-dead/&quot;&gt;500 Songs episode&lt;/a&gt; about the Grateful Dead, all four hours 40 minutes of it, and learned how the selflessness  destroyed their gift. The fans and their employees made demands, and the band gave them what they wanted. I had never heard the story of the Dead told this way, but it matches up with the facts I have from living through that period myself, and going to quite a few Dead shows, and being one step removed from people who worked in the Dead company, and almost dying myself from similar kinds of pressure. Ultimately if you want to live, you have to not be selfless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It might not be possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification&quot;&gt;de-Nazify&lt;/a&gt; social nets like Twitter, Mastodon or Bluesky -- yet that seems to be what users want. Which leads to a big question, what is the purpose of these networks? Has anyone ever tried to write that down?</description>

			<description>What if for the sake of argument there were lots of Mastodon or Bluesky instances that didn't connect to any other instances, that just served little communities, maybe gathered around a blog, for example. Each one being its own Reddit type thing, or a micro-Twitter. Not part of anything bigger than themselves. And what if it were reallllly easy to start one of these things. And, what if it were carefully designed to do at least what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec calls for. What if.</description>

			<description>When I was in my late teens going to school in New Orleans, there were still a lot of childhood foods I didn't like -- asparagus, fish, cheese -- but I decided to be brave and try each of them, and I found that I now liked most. This was important because there's a wide variety of great affordable food in New Orleans, it would have been a shame to miss out on it.</description>

Maybe there's some big secret you're not clued in on because you're picky about who you listen to. Just sayin.</description>

			<description>The trick to making a system easy to work on when one part is on a server and the other part runs on the user's machine, is to make the machine the same in both locations, so code that runs in one place &quot;just works&quot; in the other. The further the two are from each other, the more difficult it is to work on. Ideally you should stay in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language&quot;&gt;HLL&lt;/a&gt; even in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/simpleCrossNetworkScript.html&quot;&gt;remote procedure calls&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>YouTube and inbound RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;YouTube is &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/update/youtube-rss-plans&quot;&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt; to support inbound RSS for podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My take on this -- this doesn't seem controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;YouTube is a podcast client. No problem with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And -- they're doing inbound RSS, just like I want Mastodon and Bluesky to do! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;YouTube could be perfect if they also offered outbound RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twowayRss&quot;&gt;Two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>The important thing about art is not the creation of the art, but the observation of it. So, if artificially created art inspires creativity in the observer, there’s great value in that.</description>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters&quot;&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. The top of the journalism food chain, where they all want to be. In the last episode she talked about how many times she had talked with Rupert Murdoch, who the patriarch of Succession is patterned after. That was a strange idea for me. Not only have I never spoken with him, if I were to meet him, I probably wouldn't find anything he said interesting. I went to a lot of conferences in the 80s with people like him. I hated it. Yet my vision of tech has been implemented, in the interim. She and I live in dramatically versions of tech. We don't even remotely speak the same language. Yet she is considered an authority on what tech has value and doesn't. That was the big epiphany for me, the moment I realized we are completely living in different worlds. She created this Facebook, Twitter, Spotify world as much as Zuckerberg, Musk or Ek. So if you don't like the way it turned out, you shouldn't look in that direction for leadership. That said she does good interviews, I will miss the podcast after next week, although I gotta say they could probably keep doing it for &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; and still be interesting. Succession is great TV, terrible reality. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, I know that a lot of people can't get on Bluesky. But if you know me, I'm not just doing this for one social net. The point is that once we have something wonderful running on one, we have something to show to people on others. And I'm on Mastodon and Twitter still (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a133305&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). Both have APIs and could conceivably get the same features we've added to Bluesky. That's what &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is all about, it flattens out the differences between the networks at a higher level than tweets. Optional titles, styling, links, enclosures, editable, no length limits.</description>

			<description>I decided to pay Twitter a year in advance for the blue checkmark and whatever other privileges come with it. It's not that much money. I pay more to Hulu or Apple TV. Is it worth it? I can afford to find out. (I've gotten a bit of pushback. There are users on Twitter, and I make software for people who use systems like Twitter, so it's like owning a Windows machine if you make software that runs on Windows.)</description>

Imagine a newsletter publishing app that let you feed stories to it from your favorite editor via RSS for publication to a list of subscribers. I'm thinking of a future Substack competitor that doesn't force writers to use their editor. It simply provides a service to any writer who uses an editor that can produce an RSS feed as output. Another example, if Mastodon handled inbound feeds, you'd be able to follow someone on Bluesky from within Mastodon. I would love to see this connection made asap.</description>

			<description>LeBron James says he &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10076982-sources-lebron-james-considering-retirement-after-wcf-exit-20-nba-seasons&quot;&gt;might retire&lt;/a&gt;. Good move. He also says he isn't into basketball if he isn't in the race for a championship. See there's the problem, right there. There are 30 teams in the NBA. In any given year 29 of them will not win the championship. 28 of them won't even make the Finals. Yet their fans felt their seasons were worthwhile if they played the game with heart, if there's hope for next season. This is why I am not a Yankees fan or a LeBron James fan. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/10/20/winningIsntEverything.html&quot;&gt;love my team&lt;/a&gt; even when they lose, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when they lose.</description>

			<description>BTW, I understand where LeBron is coming from. When I started a software company in the early 80s, the business was tough and we almost went under quite a few times. But I couldn't lose. I couldn't face myself if it didn't work. So I &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; it work. But, after winning once, I relaxed and focused on the art of it. I've already won, now why did I get into this in the first place? I had something to say, which was more than about how I can win. I can also make beauty and break through and do new things with the medium I chose.</description>
