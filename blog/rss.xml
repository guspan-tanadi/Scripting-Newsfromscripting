			<description>The difference in quality between the two groups of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/&quot;&gt;Georgia senate candidates&lt;/a&gt;, Dem and Repub are like night and day. The Dems will use the power of the US government to be sure the Georgians get through the winter of the pandemic in as good shape as possible. The Repubs will not. It's really simple. And when they save the lives of thousands of Georgians, they will also be saving the lives of many thousands of people in every other state of the union. That's power! Thanks in advance to Georgia for helping us out. We won't forget.</description>

			<title>Home exercise in winter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have plenty of ways to get exercise in the summer, but winter has been a challenge. I don't like riding a stationary bike, I tried mounting my street bike on a Zwift device, and yuk, I didn't like the simulated racing, I don't ride competitively. And the street scenes were primitive. Unlike my regular real-world rides I always was impatient for the exercise to be over. When I'm riding outdoors, I feel very differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend suggested getting a rowing machine, and somehow that seemed better. But when I looked into the devices I started feeling it might be the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We just had five unusual warm November days, I rode all of them, outdoors, and was thinking that the difference may be the feel of the ride. Real bike rides you almost never are straight up and down. You lean one way then another, and shift your weight to different sides. Maybe that's the diff. Then I saw an ad for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bowflex.com/bikes/velocore.html/&quot;&gt;this Bowflex bike&lt;/a&gt; that leans! It looks in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DseC78ShNc&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; like it may be more fun to ride. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a bit about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1326968117579436037&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Megan McCarthy sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Megan/status/1326968332717789196&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; to a review of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reviewed.com/health/best-right-now/best-stationary-exercise-bikes&quot;&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reviewed.com/health/features/echelon-review-cheaper-spin-bike-good-peloton&quot;&gt;specific bike&lt;/a&gt; I asked about. I might get a Peloton, but it seems I might not have it until January. I'd like to start riding daily asap. But I'm concerned I'm going to spend a lot more money and still not have something I want to use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Includes in Little Outliner</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago a user asked that &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; support &quot;includes.&quot; I did a little investigating, and found that it already supports them. So I thought it might be a good idea to explain what they are and how they work, maybe other people will find it interesting and/or useful.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;C programming language&lt;/a&gt;. It had the ability to include one file in another. When you included a file, it was as if its text was present in the file doing the including. The C compiler couldn't tell the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what a C include statement looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;#include &quot;mycode.c&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In an outliner it works similarly. A node is an &lt;i&gt;include&lt;/i&gt; if it has a &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute with the value include, and a &lt;i&gt;url&lt;/i&gt; attribute that points to an OPML file with the outline to be included. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you expand an include in LO2, the text from the included outline is expanded below the node. You can edit the text, but none of the edits will be saved to the included file. You should think of it as read-only, even though LO2 doesn't enforce that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://instantoutliner.com/mi&quot;&gt;an outline&lt;/a&gt; that opens in LO2 that illustrates. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TimothyDSnyder/status/1326319545427107840&quot;&gt;A Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timothysnyder.org/bio&quot;&gt;Timothy Snyder&lt;/a&gt;. He says we should be out in the street protesting now. &quot;Coups are defeated quickly or not at all. While they take place we are meant to look away, as many of us are doing. When they are complete we are powerless. In an authoritarian situation, the election is only round one. You don't win by winning round one. Peaceful demonstrations after elections are necessary for transitions away from authoritarianism, as in Poland in 1989, Serbia in 1999, or Belarus right now.&quot;</description>

It came out in the middle of the election frenzy. When you choose the command, BingeWorthy looks through the database and finds people who like similar programs to you.

			<description>More exploration into the world of Fargo blogging. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/kimParkerBlog/fargo.opml?format=opml&quot;&gt;OPML source&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloatware.org/users/kim/&quot;&gt;Kim Parker's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Kim Parker is a fictitious person, a support person at a tech company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloatware.org/&quot;&gt;Bloatware&lt;/a&gt;. Her blog was the example I used in the docs for Fargo's CMS. Not sure why I used #attributes instead of using outline attributes, which are hidden and out of the way. But there you have it. A 2013 blogging system, does it differently than Old School. It's more like Frontier's CMS.</description>

			<title>A science fiction plot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A tyrant autocrat is elected POTUS because a lot of people voted for a third party candidate or thought the other candidate was a shoe-in so they didn't bother to vote at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people endured the four years, even though they suffered and many died, the country was looted and its government was dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But! Once the four years was up they voted the tyrant out, replacing him with a solid ethical president and vice president. The citizens relaxed and partied and got back to their business of staying alive during a raging pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But! While they weren't looking, the other party took over state legislatures. This was seen as a crafty foxy move because then they get to gerrymander House districts, which gave them an advantage that meant it was relatively easy for them to control the House. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But! They were even more crafty and foxy. There was a little-known feature of the Constitution that meant that controlling state legislatures meant they controlled who was president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The current president, the tyrant, played golf, as he normally does. People relaxed. &quot;See he doesn't have any nefarious plans!&quot; said the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;More in the next installment. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The sound is great and large, but the package is small, sturdy, nice to hold the way an iPhone is. I have it strapped to the handlebar of my bike which I've been riding the last four days because the weather is so good. One more day, tomorrow, then it's going to cool off again. Definitely not November weather in the mountains.</description>

			<description>Sometimes people are wrong. The presidential election is one of those cases. Trump simply wasnâ€™t doing the job. Thatâ€™s an objective fact. When we get a president who is doing the job, and we elected one, the system will start working. And we desperately need it to work. So no, Iâ€™m not esp concerned about the feelings of Trump voters. They were wrong. We saved their lives. Maybe theyâ€™ll never appreciate it, but we did save their lives regardless.</description>

			<description>OK we just had an election in the US, and we're doing the same thing we do after every election. Trying to figure out how 70 million people could (this time) vote for Trump after seeing him in action for four years. I had a lot of trouble understanding why people gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; a second term, that was a stop-everything moment for me. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.podcatch.com/manila/gems/un/cnNov3.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/11/03.html&quot;&gt;that day&lt;/a&gt;, to preserve the moment. But this time I think maybe we're asking the wrong question. Why are so many people depressed? I think you have to be pretty sad to vote for Trump. I think that's what it's an expression of, sadness. What could we do to make living more fun? I know it's a weird question, but maybe someone has an idea. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you're an NBA fan as I am, you know all about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA&quot;&gt;Inside the NBA&lt;/a&gt; on TNT. Charles, Kenny, Shaq and Ernie. They're funny, smart, irreverant, and when they get serious, have a deep understanding of basketball. I want something like that for politics. The cable shows are dull and repetitive. If you're not going to say much at least tell some good stories.</description>

			<description>The Democrats should do some marketing, and connecting with their users (ie voters). Based on what I'm reading about the polls, they have a crude and often incorrect view of what they think and what influences them, what they look for in a candidate. Just read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/how-democrats-missed-trumps-appeal-to-latino-voters.html&quot;&gt;Hispanic voters&lt;/a&gt; in south Florida and Texas voting for Trump, when the Dems thought they had their support. &lt;i&gt;Membership in the Democratic Party should mean something. &lt;/i&gt;Or maybe we need to start another party, not to run candidates necessarily, but to organize voters. Maybe the Dems would get the idea that they should &quot;acquire&quot; this party. That's how change often happens in tech, btw. Key point I've raised over and over -- political parties and social networks belong together. The current crop of social nets are optimized for advertisers. No surprise they've made a mess of political organizing.</description>

			<title>Throw an elbow Joe</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745665/characters/nm0817983&quot;&gt;Leo McGarry, a fictional character&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Bill Russell was getting eaten alive cuz they could never get him to throw an elbow. He didn't want to do it. So Red Auerbach told him to do it, one time, throw an elbow on a nationally televised game, you'll never have to do it again. You bet your ass they'll know the leak came from us.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed VP-elect Harris's speech last night. I was crying like a baby through the whole thing. Even though I'm not black, Indian-American or a woman, I'm a sucker for people rising through prejudice and achieving huge victories like that. I also like that she's from the Bay Area, specifically Berkeley, where I lived for a number of years, and still have friends who live there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Biden's speech was disturbing. Not because he said anyting other than what he was saying through the campaign -- he was totally consistent. But now we're on the other side of the election, and I don't think all the happy talk about working across the aisle will amount to anything, other than a sense by the Repubs and their voters, that yeah you can walk all over the Dems and there's never a price to pay.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another quote: I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Doctrine#:~:text=In%20this%20Address%2C%20Kennedy%20warned,in%20%22a%20struggle%20against%20the&quot;&gt;what JFK said&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5DODFhQ-H4&quot;&gt;inaugural&lt;/a&gt;, to the Soviets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The equivalent from Biden to McConnell today would be...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We noticed that Trump stopped getting his Cabinet officials approved by the Senate a couple of years ago, and McConnell never said a word about it. So the first round of my Cabinet appointments will be on the house, freebies, appointed without Senate approval. Then we can have a big bipartisan conference on how we want this to work in the future. And until then, the Senate is out of the advise-and-consent business. If you don't like it, ask Nancy Pelosi if she'll impeach me. Heh.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the Repubs will squawk, loudly, and take the Dems to court. And Biden, like Trump, will ignore what the court says, if they dare rule on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with oversight from the Senate. Cross that off the list too, until we come to some larger agreement about enforcing the norms that Trump and McConnell trashed over the last four years. Maybe the price is, dear Senate, that McConnell is censured and loses his party leadership. Or maybe we insist that he be sent back to Kentucky. I'm not kidding. What you all did is not excusable. We're willing to let McConnell take the fall, and then we can move on from there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But don't tell me how we're friends, we're not friends. McConnell came within a hair of turning America into a fascist dictatorship. He must've thought he'd get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs&quot;&gt;We must be worse than the Repubs&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 27. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Repubs walk all over the Dems. But if you love America, you have to vote Democratic, because the Repubs are crazy fascists. We have to teach the Dems how to be hardass motherfuckers, and insist that they have a head-on collision with the Repubs so they respect them, and in doing so, respect us.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It sure sounds like Biden is making the same insane mistake Obama did, believing that this election is somehow transformative, or that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; is transformative, and all of a sudden, because the US is in dire trouble (as usual when the Dems take over), the Repubs will transform. They only respect you if you drive straight into a head-on collision with them without hitting the brakes. You are the president, Mr President-elect, you have to be the badass. I'm hoping you know that and this happy talk is just a veneer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written before the election was called. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many things to observe in this marathon of an election night.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, it's nice that it isn't a nailbiter. We know the outcome. Unlike my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson&quot;&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who is beyond impatient for the networks to call the election, I'm glad that it's stretching out. I wish the 2008 election had been similarly extended so we could have had a chance to absorb the change gradually. Instead boom, he was elected, giving his acceptance speech, still gives me goosebumps, and we all went out to party in the streets. Now we're getting to savor the fullness of the moment. And the eventfulness of 2020 is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, Covid is raging. Growing exponentially. We're doing nothing to resist it. The example Trump set during the campaign, all those awful rallies, more awful because they were such good entertainment, is probably responsible for a good portion of the growth. I heard on the news that there's a high correlation between regions hardest-hit by the virus and those that voted for Trump. They see it as a conundrum, but it's obvious what the connection is. People who live in Trump Country don't see the virus as a threat. That's gotta be one of the biggest indicators. People who don't feel threatened by it are probably more likely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so here's something people don't like to say out loud. But obviously the Trump election was a reaction to the Obama election. The yin to the yang. People who don't like uppity presidents (ie blacks) probably don't care for presidents who don't know their place is in the home (ie women). They thought Trump was the perfect way to say Fuck You Try Again Assholes. Let Trump drive them crazy. Smart. It sure did that. So when enough people got tired of Trump the Dems offer up an affable white grandpa, he likes dogs! -- just the thing, but they snuck in just behind him a woman who happens to be black! We hardly noticed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At one point the other day, when it seemed clear that Biden was going to top it off, we realized oh shit it's going to be Vice-President Harris. She's really going to be VP. The glass ceiling is breaking as we speak. But you know what, the people in Trump Country noticed. They might've told the pollsters they were going to vote for Uncle Joe, thinking all the time that a black women wasn't their idea of someone who should be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Esp such an old heart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that there's some time to contemplate this before it's official.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that's good is it gave Fox some time to decide how to handle this. At first they were going to refuse to call Biden President-elect Biden. That would have been a catastrophe. In the meantime, they figured it out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1324918336988221441&quot;&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/a&gt;, last night, looked into the camera and told Trump to go gracefully. They gave him an out. You have to figure if he doesn't take it, they're going to go ahead and call Biden president-elect. We had time to negotiate this. This is kind of a miracle but hardly anyone noticed. Fox isn't going to help start Civil War 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nate Silver is openly trying to figure out what happened with the polls. He seems glad that this is being drawn out too. Consider maybe the electorate was a moving target, and the polls, with all their heuristics couldn't pick that up. Things were seesawing with Trump in October. First he's in the hospital, looking frail, sick with Covid, possibly dying. That can't have been good for his polling. Then he recovers, is full of energy, pumped up on steroids, holding his normal now murderous rallies, and the Dems were holding drive-in embarrassments. &lt;i&gt;He juiced his base in late October, and it worked. &lt;/i&gt;It got people to think &quot;Hey hun, the old Trump is back,&quot; the virus didn't get him, look at the fun, and they switched their vote. They could, because Trump told them not to mail in their ballots. I think, net-net, people are being too hard on the polls, and too hard on the statisticians at the networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Meadows getting the virus at this moment and spreading it while covering  it up is the perfect epilogue for trump as something other than a tragic punchline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fargo digging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For a project I'm doing, I wanted to see how &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; did calendar structures. This is what I found out. It's here primarily so I can find it again later through search engines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/myPublicProfile.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; from Fargo, that I used briefly in the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014 to edit my blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was interested in the attributes that Fargo used. I wanted to see what type attributes it used for calendars. I was surprised to see that it didn't use any. It did use a &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; attribute. And now I can see what it used that for, it was for the name of the file. It allowed you to change the text of the headline without affecting the name of the file the HTML rendering was saved in. This had come up as a question in some of the work we're doing with Old School. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For clues about Fargo, I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/blog/&quot;&gt;Fargo blog&lt;/a&gt; indispensible. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/fargoBlog.opml&quot;&gt;OPML source&lt;/a&gt; for the Fargo blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The news should reflect what the Trumps are really doing with the lawsuits. They're going to pitch state legislatures that the election was stolen and they should appoint different electors. The lawsuits just have to get press coverage and show up in opinion polls. They wouldn't have to flip too many states with Republican legislatures. For example: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan.</description>

			<description>Assuming Trump refuses to leave the White House, hereâ€™s the plan. Turn the White House into our equivalent of Leninâ€™s tomb. Seal it off but, everyone but Trump can leave, send him food and water and people can visit to see the imprisoned former president. When he dies embalm him.</description>
