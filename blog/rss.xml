			<description>In hindsight, it would have been smart if instead of starting the Space Force, the US had started the Health Force.</description>

			<description>This may be the last I write about Trump. Suppose Trump were a brilliant political strategist. On hearing of how awful the virus was, in January, he would have thought to himself, &quot;I just won re-election.&quot; How could that be you ask? Simple. He waits a bit until it's obvious to the press that it's an emergency then he gives a big Oval Office speech announcing the emergency and what we're going to do. It's exaclty what the CDC says to do. &quot;This is going to hurt,&quot; Trump reads off the teleprompter, &quot;but we'll get through it together.&quot; Then guess where his approval rating would be? 95%. Because that's how it works. We rally behind the leader in a time of crisis, even a douchebag like Trump. Who is more dumb than a sack of nails. I'm sure one of his advisors saw this as a political gift. All Trump had to do was listen.</description>

			<description>Everywhere you go people will tell you we don't like your type here. In my old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; in Queens, they said it about Jews, when we moved in. Many years later, same neighborhood, it was Chinese and Koreans. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Ulster County&lt;/a&gt; it applies to people from NYC. It's bullshit.</description>

			<description>In 2012, Obama liked to say the Repubs drove our economy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKv-dXHhtMs&quot;&gt;into a ditch&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dems would have to pull it out and dust everything off. This time, if Biden were to tell the honest total truth, the Repubs drove us off the cliff and not just the economy.</description>

			<description>I haven’t had any interaction on my Facebook posts in the last week. No comments, no likes, nada. It’s like it just ended. The people are gone, or Facebook algorithm isn’t showing anyone my posts. Meanwhile it’s rock and roll on twitter and on my blog. Later: Well it turns out, I have been posting mostly-private messages on Facebook since May 23. Not sure how it happened but only a few people were seeing them. I just posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1263656047175131&quot;&gt;something public&lt;/a&gt; and it's as if the lights turned back on. Now I'm going back through the last months' posts and changing the privacy setting on them. Whew.</description>

			<description>Driving on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike&quot;&gt;Masspike&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, going west, listening to the audiobook of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;People's History&lt;/a&gt;, when a phone call comes in. Looks like spam so I don't answer. Then the car's audio, coming from my fully updated  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FT5A2LL/A/refurbished-iphone-xs-max-64gb-silver-unlocked&quot;&gt;iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/&quot;&gt;CarPlay&lt;/a&gt; switches over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt; app, and plays an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/podcasts/the-daily/facebook-twitter-black-lives-matter-trump.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;The Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, an episode I didn't want listen to, and there's nothing I can do until I can stop the car and reactivate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/ep/apple&quot;&gt;Audible app&lt;/a&gt;, about 15 miles of driving. To be very clear, it should have resumed the book, which was interrupted, not start a podcast. This is the kind of software lunacy that never gets fixed. Next year they'll revamp the OS of the car, or the phone, or switch the processor, or get rid of iTunes or Cookie Dough or whatever, and more stuff will break, and the process will continue next year and the year after, and it will not have been worth it. At some point some adult will run Apple, someone who can't be bluffed on software, will tell the engineers to shut up and eat your vegetables, you can watch TV when you finish your homework. It's an analogy. You can figure it out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="Driving on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Turnpike&quot;&gt;Masspike&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, going west, listening to the audiobook of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;People's History&lt;/a&gt;, when a phone call comes in. Looks like spam so I don't answer. Then the car's audio, coming from my fully updated  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FT5A2LL/A/refurbished-iphone-xs-max-64gb-silver-unlocked&quot;&gt;iPhone XS Max&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/&quot;&gt;CarPlay&lt;/a&gt; switches over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt; app, and plays an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/podcasts/the-daily/facebook-twitter-black-lives-matter-trump.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;The Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, an episode I didn't want listen to, and there's nothing I can do until I can stop the car and reactivate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/ep/apple&quot;&gt;Audible app&lt;/a&gt;, about 15 miles of driving. To be very clear, it should have resumed the book, which was interrupted, not start a podcast. This is the kind of software lunacy that never gets fixed. Next year they'll revamp the OS of the car, or the phone, or switch the processor, or get rid of iTunes or Cookie Dough or whatever, and more stuff will break, and the process will continue next year and the year after, and it will not have been worth it. At some point some adult will run Apple, someone who can't be bluffed on software, will tell the engineers to shut up and eat your vegetables, you can watch TV when you finish your homework. It's an analogy. You can figure it out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;" created="Wed, 24 Jun 2020 14:03:07 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/06/24.html#a140307"/>

			<title>JavaScript and who made it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glitch/status/1275809005093429249&quot;&gt;Glitch asks&lt;/a&gt; a very interesting question.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you could rename JavaScript what would you name it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk this through.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First what is JavaScript. Let's make a list of things it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a single syntax that works in the browser and on the server. A lot of the built-in routines work in both place.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a vastly too-hard-to-learn language, but it's what we got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you were going to design one language that everything should be translated to, it would never be JavaScript, but once again, it's what we got. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every toolkit shows up as a package in the server runtime for JavaScript. It's the default platform. If you want to write software that integrates lots of back end services, JS is your best choice. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was created by the immediate competitive need of Netscape's visionary, and a future venture capitalist, combined with the longevity of a standard syntax that has grown a lot especially in the last couple of years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In most of the answers to &lt;i&gt;What Is It? &lt;/i&gt;you could summarize it by saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;. In every category, given a choice between elegance and simplicity, performance and ease of use, JavaScript picks the worst of the options. And since worse is better, that's good! That's why it wins. It doesn't worry about being better, does it work, if so, let's use it and go forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to the beginning when Marc Andreessen didn't (presumably) want Java to run away with the web. That's the position Java had, and they were pressuring Netscape to bundle it with the browser, and he didn't want to do it, but he had to have something to put in his place. Pretty sure that's why he asked Brendan Eich to write it,  the legendary &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/&quot;&gt;10-day project&lt;/a&gt;. So what was &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; product? Maybe that should be the name? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even though they weren't thinking of server-side language that JS would become, really JS is &lt;i&gt;the language of the web.&lt;/i&gt; That idea fits both the original vision and the current use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But that's not really a product name: Language Of The Web. LOTW. Nah doesn't really live well in the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would have just called it Netscape. It's so central to everything the company was doing, you could have said -- this is the reason we created the company. The web is the UI, and that's important, but the real power is the network behind it, and that network is defined by the language, and this here is the language. It would have given Java a run for the money, probably would have pushed it closer to Microsoft (that's a whole other story) but long term, it would have worked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW all that's left of Netscape today is -- JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They didn't do it then, but you could do it now and it would be cool and fun, historic, respectful and something people would talk about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had to drive today on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway&quot;&gt;New York State Thruway&lt;/a&gt;, south of Albany. It was a long enough drive that I had to stop to use the facilities. I dreaded going into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waze.com/livemap/directions/united-states/new-york/new-baltimore/rest-area-i-87-mile-127-new-baltimore-service-area?place=w.187564456.1875579027.457925&amp;utm_expid=.K6QI8s_pTz6FfRdYRPpI3A.0&quot;&gt;rest stop&lt;/a&gt;. Happy to report that everyone, without exception, was wearing a mask. I had another thought, watching a woman walk her dog in the special area set aside for that. I thought geez if the dog can pee outside.</description>

			<description>I asked a friend who’s Jewish, as am I, how he’d feel if a statue of Hitler was in the middle of his town. He said it’s different. It’s not. Imagine, after surviving the war, getting your freedom, the people you lived with, who controlled the town you live in, celebrated your enslavers.</description>

			<description>Today is WWDC day, and announcements from Apple. My longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheScottLove/status/1274898149161578504&quot;&gt;Scott Love&lt;/a&gt; says Apple should focus on the user experience. I say it's even more basic. What matters to me is how broken everything is. Every day it seems my flow is stopped because I have to find a way around something someone broke that broke something else. Stop deprecating, stop changing, let’s spend a decade fixing breakage.</description>

			<title>The N-word</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched a Dave Chappelle concert last night on Netflix. Great stuff. But. He says the N-word over and over. Even to talk about white people. It gets imprinted in your mind, that's just a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example, after watching The Wire, my brain starts using the N-word all the time as my mind drifts. God forbid the word should ever come out of my actual mouth. Someday it will and I will get excoriated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So maybe our black bros (another word DC uses a lot) could take this into account and maybe not use it so much, at least when the audience has a lot of white people in it. Just sayin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The weight of the world</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is how a president should look. With the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Finally, perhaps, it has dawned on him that he can't bluff his way out of this one.

			<description>BTW, I never made software for iOS. I remember clearly when I decided not to. The day they announced the iPhone. I was expecting it to run Mac software. I had a great scripting environment for the Mac. I thought this is it, the perfect platform for me. Then I heard it was going to be nothing like the perfect platform for me. Now, 14 years later, give or take, the big story in tech is that it's an awful platform for developers. Y'all should just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. Save a lot of time. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A bug in journalism is that it tries to put people in boxes. Your ideas only have value if you have credentials to back them up. This method makes reporters easily replaced by algorithms, and keeps us from hearing the most interesting  even eclectic idea stimulating ideas. Of course no one in journalism will hear this because heh I lack the proper credentials.</description>

			<description>The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/20/the-pandemic-is-accelerating-who-warns-of-dangerous-coronavirus-phase-video&quot;&gt;something to say&lt;/a&gt; that we all must hear, but they didn't get much coverage. We were all too busy focusing on Trump's shenanigans, as always. There should be a daily briefing with Dr Fauci, broadcast on all channels, treated as news, I don't care if he has to quit the government to do it. The WHO message is this -- the virus is spinning up to a new level, and it's going to cost us hugely to get it to quiet back down. This has to be said clearly and repeatedly with authority. In America the only one who can do that is Fauci. Without Trump, obviously. Maybe Wolf Blitzer, who clearly has a rapport with Fauci should take a leave from CNN to be his partner in this.</description>

			<description>Before yesterday's rally in Tulsa, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/21/21298169/kpop-fans-tiktok-tickets-trump-tulsa-rally-empty-seats&quot;&gt;TikTok Teens and K-pop fans&lt;/a&gt; organized to spam the registration page. So they had 800K signups, with room for only 19K fans. Only 4 million live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma&quot;&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. So the numbers were fishy. Even so the Trump campaign hyped them. They seem to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/06/20/trump-overflow-crowd-speech-phillip-sot-nr-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/a&gt; them. They must've wanted to. Ethan Zuckerman &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EthanZ/status/1274685979182485505&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it was activism, it was, and it's surprising how well it worked.</description>

			<title>Father's Day</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My dad, pictured below, probably around my age now, in Switzerland, having a snack of coffee and pie. My parents went hiking there every summer. They did a lot of traveling earlier in life, all over the world, but in the last couple of decades it was all about Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Professor Leon Winer, in his happy place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There ought to be an amendment. As soon as an incumbent president &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/nyregion/us-attorney-manhattan-trump.html&quot;&gt;tries to fire&lt;/a&gt; a US Attorney investigating him, he leaves office, and is automatically indicted for obstruction of justice. No bail. It's an admission of guilt, like taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;fifth&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
