			<description>Everything falls into place if you think of the Repubs as the white supremacy party. It isn't racism. Everyone has racism, but we check it, control it, if we behave badly we feel badly. A white supremacist feels should they be in control. Natural order. Master race.</description>

			<description>At least pause for a moment before replying and ask yourself why this person is saying Black Lives Matter. Of course they know and agree that all lives matter. But that isn't what they're saying. They're saying that Black Lives Matter not because they're more important than white lives or cop lives, which seems to be how you're interpreting it, but because a lot of black people are being killed and the justice system does not seem to care.</description>

			<description>I think we all know that if Trayvon Martin, for example, had been a white teen, and George Zimmerman had been a black adult man, the outcome would have been different. But because he was black, and black lives don't matter, Martin is dead and Zimmerman is free.</description>

			<description>There have been a seemingly endless series of graphic stories, many of them on video, of white police killing black people, and getting off. I suspect this has been going on all along, but now with the wide use of smartphones, we're actually seeing it, visually, as we couldn't have seen it before. Now it's not their word against a cop's. The video provides testimony that is impossible to refute.</description>

			<description>If you were black, and you saw this happening, you might be inspired to do more than say something like Black Lives Matter. Your rage and fear might overwhelm you. So the first thing I would say to a black person who said Black Lives Matter is thank you for containing the rage you must feel, that I would feel if I were in your shoes, that I feel in a small way on your behalf, at the cruelty and callousness of our system and culture. Then I'd ask if there was anything I could do to help.</description>

			<description>A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/25/flatDiscussionGroups.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; on flat discussion groups on the net. Mail lists, Facebook groups, GitHub threads, Clubhouse chatrooms. People in these flat structures always behave the same way over time. After 40 years of being part of online groups, I see there are no new tricks in the human species, these things always evolve the same way. That's what this podcast is about. Might be a chapter in a book someday.</description>

			<description>Over the years I've resisted characterizing the Trump voter because I was pretty sure it was more than racism, because we're all racist. It takes a special kind of racism to act on it the way they do. I think it's best described as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy&quot;&gt;white supremacy&lt;/a&gt;. All kinds of things freak them out but the one that they can't live with is equality for &quot;others.&quot; Strips their gears. Not negotiable. They'll &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mluckovichajc/status/1298027757990010881/photo/1&quot;&gt;tear the country down&lt;/a&gt; before they let that happen. As long as all they have to do is vote. They're not very strong, and as soon as hard times really hits them they'll crumble. They've lived sheltered lives for generations, feel entitled.</description>

This reminded me of when when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier#Publication_by_BuzzFeed_News&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed published&lt;/a&gt; the Steele Dossier, and the rage of other journalists that they had disclosed unverified information to the public, even though the dossier was being widely circulated in DC at the time. I was glad &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; took the side of the people. There should be little difference between what insiders know and what the public knows. Some things are so important, people should take risks, esp if they want the rep of being a patriot as Schmidt clearly does. Anyway it turns out &quot;collusion&quot; was too polite. The Trump campaign in 2016 was actually run by Russia. This is now an established fact. This should get huge headlines.</description>

			<description>I took my car to a special place that has techniques for cleaning awful smells out of cars. My car, a little over a year old with less than 10K miles may be a total loss because of the family of mice that colonized and then died in its air conditioning system. So I had to rent a car. When I got it, it was clear that it had been smoked in. So I asked for another car. Waited a half hour in the hot sun. The next car also had been smoked in. Impatient, I didn't ask for a new one this time. So I traded in a car that smelled of dead mice for one that smells of (to me) sickness. I haven't smoked since June 14, 2002. It's not a nice smell for me. There must be a lesson in this, but I'm not sure what it is.</description>

			<description>If Trump is re-elected, I think the country has to split in two. I don't think we, in the so-called blue states, can handle another four years of Trump. We'll have to find a way to opt out. I feel for all the people of color, immigrants and Jews in the red states. We have to provide for their migration. Either that or we rebel. But the Constitution, if it allows a man like Trump to be elected and then re-elected, is not worth preserving imho.</description>

			<description>Dear journalism people. If you had to subscribe to Starbucks to get a single latte, they wouldn't have a lot of customers. They unbundled. You pay for what you use. That's what journalism should do too.</description>

			<description>I'm working through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial.html&quot;&gt;Nice White Parents&lt;/a&gt; podcast from the NYT. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial-2.html?action=click&amp;module=audio-series-bar&amp;region=header&amp;pgtype=Article&quot;&gt;episode 2&lt;/a&gt; they're talking about efforts to integrate schools in NYC. They say it never happened. But, I remember, my family was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ps+149+qieems+ps+92+pairing&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/03/19/106947848.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0&quot;&gt;pairing&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ps149q.org/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ps92q.org/&quot;&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; in white &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens&quot;&gt;Jackson Heights&lt;/a&gt; and in black &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;. My brother went to the Corona school, and I stayed in the Jackson Heights school. Of course I was a kid, so I wasn't really aware of what was going on beyond there were more black kids in our class. It also occurs to me that we moved not long after this happened, further east, to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburndale,_Queens&quot;&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; where there were no black neighborhoods to pair with. I don't know what motivated my parents to move, and it's too late to ask them.</description>

			<description>Heard a report this morning on NPR, interviewing older Trump voters, and while they say his behavior is awful and he lies, and he's botched the virus response, they're still voting for him. Why? They don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, white supremacy. I don't think the Democrats are going to say this but it needs to be said. &lt;i&gt;White supremacy is on the ballot this year. &lt;/i&gt;It may be the single decisive issue. Not the virus, not the Constitution. But the right of whites to dominate. I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/135804.html?title=whiteSupremacyIsOnTheBallot&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is hard to explain, but imho important. I'm going to work on better ways to explain, but for now you have to read slowly, carefully.</description>

			<description>This morning I changed &lt;i&gt;racism&lt;/i&gt; in the title of yesterday's post to &lt;i&gt;white supremacy. &lt;/i&gt;I think that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going through now in the US. Totally unanticipated that the joy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2008/11.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; would be followed by such upheaval. The US wants to shed racism, or does it? I didn‚Äôt realize we were still having this argument until recently.</description>

			<description>Biden is too sweet. When Trump says he's somehow intellectually impaired, Biden could say all that he says, and  add a bit of morality. &quot;People in glass houses, Mr President.&quot;</description>
