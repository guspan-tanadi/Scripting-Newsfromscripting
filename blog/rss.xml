			<description>I still want an automatic blog indexer web app. I would pay you $50 a year to do this for my blog. Create a website that's organized like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/10/index.png&quot;&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; in the back of a book. It digests my new stuff every day (or hourly, even better), and adds each item under topics in the index.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I'd like to read everything I've written about the Voting Rights Act, for example, or Steve Jobs. But not as a search, as something I browse. Back when I used to read printed books, sometimes I'd spend hours reading a book via its index. A bootstrap. I'd love to help drive such a project. We need this.</description>

			<description>I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/08.html#a135424&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; something like this. Yesterday at the supermarket, I glanced behind in the checkout line, saw a woman who had pulled her mask down. She seemed very naked, as if she had pulled her pants down and you could see everything. Sexual. Very forbidden. A month ago, it wouldn't have been a thing at all.</description>

			<description>One thing that's needed is a canonical place to point about news that isn't behind a paywall. I want to point to something definitive from my blog for Defund The Police. All that Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=defund+the+police&quot;&gt;finds&lt;/a&gt; are news articles on paywalled sites, or ones infused with spyware, or ones whose archives won't last.</description>

			<description>The biggest problem in police in America are the unions. You want to reboot the police? Knock out the unions. Redefine them. Limit their power. Then the voters can pass new laws about police. Until then, anything Congress passes is powerless. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/reagan-fires-11359-air-traffic-controllers&quot;&gt;Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, when he took office, outlawed the Flight Controllers union. So you can do it. No more police unions. Police, you don't like it? You're fired.</description>

			<description>Trump, if he had any competence could have easily made himself indispensable. The virus was the perfect storm. Not only did he blow the initial response, he refused to do anything beyond that. Any other president would have an approval of 99% just for having a pulse.</description>

I heard it said if Joe Biden doesn't embrace it his election could be in doubt. That's fucked up.  It doesn't mean what it says. It's a really bad slogan, and if he were to say he agrees, it would lose &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; a lot of votes.</description>

			<description>Defund is not a good word. Whoever came up with the slogan, it may work in City Council meetings, but it isn't a slogan for the presidential election. This needs to be driven by the people, and that's what's happening. The Dems now have all the support needed to make change. Now let's see if they are independent enough to do it. Or are their strings to money too rigid?</description>

			<description>There was so much happening so quickly during the first days of the protests. I couldn't figure out what was going on in NYC. And that's just one city. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/podcasts/the-daily/police-brutality-protests.html&quot;&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; filled in some of the blanks, if you're confused I highly recommend it. It pays to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog_of_War&quot;&gt;The Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; every so often for a reminder of how confusing war is. In America, our military thought the Vietnam War was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory&quot;&gt;war against communism&lt;/a&gt;. On the other side it was a war for independence. We fought that war for years, at huge cost, and we didn't even agree on what the war was about. Think about that.</description>

			<description>In a late night &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressthink.org/2020/06/battleship-newspaper/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Jay Rosen tells the story of the editor in chief of the LA Times in the heyday of print news. He likens his publication to a huge battleship steaming along, and describes critics as swimmers throwing dead fish at the ship. Of no consequence. The ship will go where it wants to go, as fast as it cares to. Fast forward to the NY Times in 2020, being forced to listen to their reporters, a new class of critic. They say we might personally be hurt by this thing you did. And no one stops to notice that there are millions of other people who would be hurt, and the Constitution (which makes the idea of a news org possible), and a way of life. Not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/200607/p6#a200607p6&quot;&gt;all the tweets&lt;/a&gt;, op-eds, blog posts, no one sees the problem. In the analog of the LA Times editor, what matters is the ocean. Not the captain, or the deck hands, not the swimmers or the dead fish, or even the battleship. It everything. And that's what's so incomprehensible to an industry that has struggled to be blind to the people it's supposed to serve. Always inventing new distractions. Never showing up for the only job that matters, serving the people.</description>

			<description>Have there been interviews with police, rank and file, saying why they support the officers caught on video torturing and killing American citizens? I'd like to hear, in clear language, the other side of this discussion. So far no one is speaking, as far as I know.</description>

			<description>At Living Videotext, my first company, I used to pore over the regcards when they came back. After they were entered in the database they were cycled back to me a few months later, I would call a few and find out how they were doing with the product, and if they were really using it (I could tell) I'd ask what they wanted to see fixed or added. After a while there was a consensus, and they were usually the things I also wanted added or fixed (and they already had been, I was CEO and lead developer). I saw my job as using the product myself, and also listening to the other people who used it. Actually it was my favorite part of the job. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üöÄ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A case study in readable code</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just wrote a JavaScript function that pads a string with a character you supply, to a certain number of places. You call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would return:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;0008&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a useful thing to have around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now how would you write it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet you could do it in a single expression. It might be hard to understand, but in a way that's kind of cool. You have to be smart to understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However, as a less spectacular coder, I would write it in eight lines of the most boring code possible. For example, &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function pad (val, withchar, ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var s = val.toString ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;while (s.length &lt; ctplaces) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;s = withchar + s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (s);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can quickly read it and see what it does. I don't have to spend any time thinking about it, so I get on with my project that much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now this might strike you as inefficient. Look at all that code, and the looping. Oy. For fun, write a benchmark script. Call it a million times and see how long it takes. I'm pretty sure you'll see that it's fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It tooks 0.04 seconds to call &lt;i&gt;pad (8, &quot;0&quot;, 4) &lt;/i&gt;a million times on my iMac. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/07/oneMillionLoops.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Albert Einstein &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about unemployment?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough coverage is that the stock market is back to where it was before the pandemic.   How to interpret this? What message is it sending?  Get ready, because this is harsh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're unemployed, it says this. The stock market doesn't need you. Literally, that is its message customized for the unemployed. The market doesn't consider Depression-level unemployment to be a problem for the companies it values.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What about bad apples?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We could probably get by with a lot fewer police, something the police might not want to ignore. When they beat up citizens they are not only hurting the citizens, they're burning our money. We are literally paying them to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we can't find the bad apples, we could just start firing  police randomly. Maybe at that point, they'll see the value in helping find, remove and prosecute the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Simplicity is a virtue</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_marcba/status/1268092311587651584&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The value of having a standard language is simplicity for newbies. But it takes discipline to remove barriers, instead developers add them. Eventually (maybe now) the weight of the totality will force the whole thing to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW there are many other virtues of simplicity, not just limiting barriers for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a familiar pattern. When I first got into software, I learned C on Unix. Simplicity. Heavily factored. Less is more. Then I looked at the jobs available in the real world, and they had a stack like the one in the cartoon. I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal&lt;/a&gt; on the Apple II instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because on the Apple II, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Woz&lt;/a&gt; machine, less is more. To display a character just write it to a location in the machine's memory. Again, a fresh slate.   How many fresh slates would it take to get to networked apps? Lots. How many were actually needed if we had discipline?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One. But you have to have a culture where we only add features if we're adding functionality. I have a motto for this.  &quot;Two ways of doing something is worse than one, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've had to say this many times over the decades of my career, as other programmers added complexity to an already-too-complex system.  JavaScript *was* a good idea. Now it is a huge hairball because programmers keep wanting to solve the same problems over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maddow had a good point last night. If militia-like police are deployed by the government, without any identification, what's to stop civilians masquerading as police to start acting like government police? Maybe that's the point, if what you want is civil war.</description>

			<title>Listen to the critics</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Alan Kay &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now#:~:text=Jobs%20always%20admired%20Kay%2C%20who,the%20Dynabook%20built%20in%20Cupertino.&quot;&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt; the Macintosh is the first computer worth criticizing. Really eloquent, makes-you-stop-and-think type quote. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was raised by parents who reacted as if criticism was an attack. If you don't deflect it, you will be hurt. They taught me that. I learned later in life that listening to criticism is the key to success. Alan Kay revealed a truth. We criticize something because we want it to be better. We are invested in it being better. Listen because you want to learn how to be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software, we call such critiques &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/06/30/writingGoodBugReports.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;.  Some problems only happen on the users' machines. Or you may have learned to not do something that they do because they never learned not to do it. Or they use features in a way you would never think to, that seem natural to them. Or they don't read the docs (and btw, neither do you). People see facets of your creation that you can't see because your point of view is different from theirs. If you want to improve, if you want to see things that are possible that are invisible to you, you must pay attention to criticism and brush aside the fear it invokes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT and criticism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In all mess around the Cotton op-ed -- to me, a lifetime reader, subscriber and former partner of the NY Times, someone with a complicated long-term relationship, the most important flaw in the pub that is its unwillingness to listen to criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So there's a huge hole in the perception of the NY Times of the world it is contained in, the point of view of their community. What a loss, for all of us. We are smart, educated, thoughtful people. We, collectively, know and see far more than the people they employ. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been the opportunity of blogging and news -- a way to tap the minds of the world in a way that supports journalism. An opportunity news people gave up on before they even understood that the net gave it a new life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need journalism to be much smarter than it is. We know a free source of smarts. Use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Also we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/29.html#a135626&quot;&gt;more money for you&lt;/a&gt; if you can listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Men are never going to understand what it's like to be a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;White people are never going to understand what it's like to be black. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we can listen, empathize, and try to do what they ask us to do to help. That would be success imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I dreamed last night I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow&quot;&gt;John Perry Barlow&lt;/a&gt; riding a bike. We talked. I said wow I'm so surprised to see you. I told him to stay here and not try to find out what's going on in the world. I don't know why I said that, but it seemed real. He's been gone for a couple of years now.</description>
