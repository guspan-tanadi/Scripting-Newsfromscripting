			<description>I'm watching the new season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22in+treatment%22&quot;&gt;In Treatment&lt;/a&gt;. I love it even more than the first three seasons, which ended ten years ago. The star of the fourth season is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzo_Aduba&quot;&gt;Uzo Aduba&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the stars of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black&quot;&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/a&gt;. She played a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eyes_(Orange_Is_the_New_Black)&quot;&gt;nutcase&lt;/a&gt; in OITNB. Now she plays a shrink!</description>

			<description>Over the years I've had lots of friends, people I otherwise respect, who won't listen to sports stories. But sports is good thing to talk about, for the same reason they dismiss it -- sports is of no consequence. It isn't real. It's a human-created pseudo-reality. It doesn't matter. Basketball, to me, is like watching a great chess tournament, with athletic performance and chance playing a bigger role. If you see any meaning in a random event, you've found god. I loved talking with my uncle about this. His Church of the Non-Functional Probabilities. Like an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#3&quot;&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; during a World Series game in in 1989. &quot;The gods made a deal. the Baseball God said to the Earthquake God: 'we gotta stop this!'&quot; These gods aren't gods of war, or punishment of individuals, they are charged with keeping things mostly in balance. There are rules to baseball and earthquakes. When chance seems to be making a moral statement, that's god. Just a choice of terminology. You could call it anything really. God is the box we put all our imagined reasons for the weirdest coincidences.</description>

And it's also a demo of the NYT's new sharing technology. The link is a gift, which means I am giving it to you, as a NYT subscriber, I can make 10 articles a month free this way. I love that they had the guts to try this. Trae Young, the devil that beat the Knicks in round 1, got his ass kicked last night. And I love that he's taking it the right way. He has heart. “That’s all on me,” Young said. “I’ve got to be better at taking care of the ball and just do a better job of at least getting us a shot. Nine turnovers. I’ve got to do better, and I will do better next game.”</description>

			<description>I have another idea for the NYT if they like the way this turns out. Let readers pay to move an article outside the paywall permanently. Something like an NFT. For example we collectively give the Times $1 million, to make this article available to everyone for free forever. I wrote this idea up a few years ago, have to find a link.</description>

			<description>After writing the stuff about the GitHub API earlier, a solution was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/213#issuecomment-868277650&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out there may be a way to use GH now as a user-controlled storage system. I find this hard to think about, as I imagine it's hard to grasp reading about it, but I'm going to keep plodding along. The goal is basically do we get to have an open app ecosystem on the web, ever -- or is it a lost cause. Seems we're pretty close now?</description>

			<description>I can’t believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.nytimes.com/a-new-way-to-share-new-york-times-stories-3e66e8d7e620&quot;&gt;the NY Times uses Medium&lt;/a&gt; for stories about their development process. I was literally fooled, as a NYT member, when the site asked me to sign on, I thought it would be a NYT login. The Times has one of the most skillfully produced websites in the world, and these are the people who run it, they can't figure out how to set up a section to explain their own innovations? Something is wrong. In any case, we ought to have a place for these kinds of papers that has some plan to survive time. Medium could shut down any day and take its archive with it. The NYT has a responsibility here too, to set an example. When they lean on Medium for archival storage, what are they thinking?</description>

			<description>Okay following up on yesterday's bit about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/24/141650.html?title=githubAsAppStorageContd&quot;&gt;using GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as an app storage system, even though I know it's possible, LogSeq has it working, but I'm not good enough with GIT as an API to figure out how to make it work. I have to table this idea for now and move on. I'm going to use S3 in its place. I know how it behaves, I have simple code to write to it that works. Unfortunately S3 does not come in a user-friendly package, so it doesn't get us anywhere as far as user control of their data. I think this is an ethical mission for devs, akin to the &quot;First do no harm&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere&quot;&gt;edict&lt;/a&gt; for doctors. Don't lock your users in. I want to establish a norm here, for Tools For Thought, that users expect to be able to move their data around where ever they want. Not giving up on this. We've done it before, with RSS, for example. And podcasting still hasn't been siloized, amazingly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

And btw the guilty parties so far aren't doing any jail time. Not much of a deterrent.</description>

			<description>Speaking of which the other day the phone rings, I pick up, it's a robot from the gas company, something is very wrong, I need to call this number, which she recites, and goes on, never repeating the number. At the end they threaten that they're going to cut off my supply (which I know legally is hard to do, and btw I'm current with my bill). So I call. I get put on hold. We appreciate your pateince, another robot says. Your call is important. I'm sure. When an actual human comes on the line I am accused of being rude for telling her what her stinking company just did in the middle of my freaking work day. They want to know where the check is. I don't know. My credit is good. Maybe the check got delayed. I hear there are problems with the post office. God bless the robots. And by the way, email is much more efficient! Please.</description>

			<title>The glossary in Little Outliner</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you're new to &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, the glossary is a pretty unique feature that goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in 1995, and was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/downloads/Website%20Tutorial/GlossariesandFilters.html&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; as part of Frontier's website framework. It's a permanent fixture, very useful, and easy once you know what it does and how it works.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The glossary is a substitution table. When a term appears in text being rendered, the term is replaced with its value. So you could define an entry called &quot;my blog&quot; (the quotes are part of the definition) and its value would be a link to your blog. At some time in the future if your blog moves, just change the value of &quot;my blog&quot; and links to the blog will change too, when the text is rendered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; I use in all my pages. It's a public outline. It has to be public for it to work, so you shouldn't put private information into the glossary. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In LO2 a glossary is a two-level outline. At the top level are a set of terms the renderer will look for, and its subordinate text is what it will be replaced with.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/24/glossaryScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of part of my glossary, being edited in my outliner.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To use your glossary outline, here's what you do:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Make the outline public. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Choose the View OPML command in the File menu to get a link to the glossary outline. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put the URL on the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In an outline where you want to use the glossary, choose Edit OPML Head from the file menu, and add an attribute to the table. Its name is urlGlossary, and the value is the URL you have on the clipboard. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to use the glossary in your outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>GitHub as app storage, cont'd</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/23.html#a221440&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/174309.html?title=isGithubRawStorageReliable&quot;&gt;bits&lt;/a&gt; about using GitHub as a storage system for a community of apps.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea matches the as-yet unachieved ideal of using the web as an operating system, that for me goes back to 1994. It's the potential I saw when I first understood how HTTP works. Now in 2021, the one thing the web OS doesn't have is reliable storage for users that multiple apps can access to edit and render on the user's behalf. The same way you might have a text file on your desktop, that you write in a word processor (of your choosing, this is important) and send it over email, put it in a tweet, or a Facebook post, or print it. Or any of a million other uses. The key thing is the text file is yours. Not just for Mac or Windows, for everyone, anywhere. It's the wedge we need to be able to build a new world that's been technically possible for a couple of decades now. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's important that we're using GIT which is an open and often-cloned data structure. You could move your data to another GIT provider if GitHub proved too expensive, or their service was failing, or really any reason at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dropbox was getting close to this idea, but they pulled back. That's why I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, which used Dropbox for storage. But no other app could access Fargo's outline files. They couldn't even access public files, that's the feature they withdrew. They had reasons to change course, not faulting the company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LogSeq&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The main reason I picked up using GitHub as storage, again (I had experimented in 2017 with a GitHub-backed &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/english/&quot;&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt;) is that another app developer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; is going down this path: using GitHub as a place for users to store their data. Even better LogSeq is an outliner! And even better, they're supporting &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. So now it gets interesting. I can imagine a user opening an outline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; because it has a feature they need, and then opening the same file in &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; because it has features that Drummer doesn't. This is the nirvana we've been waiting so long for. And we're close to having it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;GitHub is tempting, but there appear to be problems when accessed through their API, as I am doing. For example, if I saved a file to a user's repo, it might take 20 minutes before the changed version showed up to other apps. There must be a cache somewhere in there. I don't have a clear statement of how GitHub works here, maybe it's out there, but I wanted to do a reality check. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;LogSeq says they use a Node package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git&quot;&gt;Isomorphic-Git&lt;/a&gt;. It has been reliable. But there are other problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/213&quot;&gt;started a thread&lt;/a&gt; on this. Maybe we can figure this out. Or maybe it's something we come back to periodically until it works. We'd love to hook up with people at GitHub, after we've explored all other options. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Revisiting Glitch, a year later</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/&quot;&gt;April 2020&lt;/a&gt; I gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+glitch&quot;&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a unique free Node.js hosting service, that cuts out a lot of the complexity in creating and managing network apps. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; project, run by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Dash&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt;, both people I've known for many years. Early bloggers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; is founder of Stack Exchange, Trello and many other projects, and now is super rich, probably a billionaire, after selling both his hits to big companies. I knew him when he was a normal ex-Microsoft NYC-based developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I succeeded at getting several apps running on Glitch last year, but it wasn't simple for me, an experienced Node developer. That's okay. I left them the apps there, and they continued to work. But when I tried to update my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; installation on Glitch to the latest version, all of a sudden I'm getting errors from Node that make no sense. Things that worked before. There have been hardly any changes in PagePark in the last year. I have no idea what the problem is. And I'm concerned it might take days to figure it out and get things working properly. And these are days I don't have. Trying to complete Drummer, my latest product release, and help users get going in the OPML ecosystem (which is why I was drawn back to Glitch in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I'm trying to figure out what's the best use of my time. Glitch is inexpensive, but not the least expensive way to run a server, if you don't want the server to go to sleep. It takes (it seems) a minute or more for it to wake up. Perhaps that's the incentive to get you to pay. I'd understand that. But their &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/pricing&quot;&gt;price&lt;/a&gt; is $8 a month, paid annually. I can host a server on Digital Ocean for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new&quot;&gt;$5 a month&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pay as you go. If you use the server for a week you pay for a week. And while I appreciate that Glitch is trying to make it easier by factoring and editing in the browser (good things to do!), Digital Ocean makes it as easy as possible to get started using standard Linux at the command line, and their docs are excellent, the best I've seen. It's what got me to switch from AWS in the first place (their docs are impossibly bad). I've been using Digital Ocean for years now, and the other thing I like about it is that my apps continue to work, they don't break them, as apparently has happened on Glitch (which is okay, not complaining, just making a decision).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then something amazing happened. After writing this post, all of a sudden &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;PagePark-on-Glitch&lt;/a&gt; is working. Fuck me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalism, academia, government and the corporate world all hire from the same talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They go to the same universities, get their news from the same sources. Corporate people take government jobs, then go back to the corporations. The people move fluidly in and out of each bucket. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you get the same story, the reality they believe in, developed over centuries, that is radically different from the reality most other people experience. The story recited daily at CNN, MSNBC, The New Yorker, NYT. The world changes, again and again, and the story they tell is how angry this makes them, and how everyone must snap back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;New technologies can make change possible, like the one we're using now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We would never have Trump if it weren't for Twitter. Imagine someone saying that sentence 20 years ago. It would pay to have that kind of imagination built into journalism, and it is available. The incumbents, like the Democratic incumbents, will have to be left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today we can't rely on journalism, not because of a campaign run by Russians or Republicans or billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They think the problem is that we don't see what they see, but I think it's the other way. They hold on to a normalcy that is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They can't see what they can't see.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Is GitHub raw storage reliable?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/213&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt; for this post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been building apps on the assumption that if you store something on GitHub, when you get the raw version of that thing, it'll be current. I was getting inconsistent results, so I decided to test that assumption, and it seems that it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; reliable storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you read an object immediately after writing it, you will not always get back what you wrote. It's not just a matter of waiting a second or two, sometimes it's wrong for up to 10 seconds (the delay I programmed into the test).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/6a59532e1a2d1d0a8e6120cf07b9af45&quot;&gt;the Node app&lt;/a&gt; I'm running to test this. It wakes up every minute and saves a file to GitHub with the current local time string. If I reload the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/misc/now.txt&quot;&gt;non-raw version&lt;/a&gt; of the page, it usually seems to have the current value. But if I reload the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/instantOutlines/main/misc/now.txt&quot;&gt;raw version&lt;/a&gt; of the page, it often does not have the correct value. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the app for the first half hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 1:58:13 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 1:59:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:00:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:01:00 PM, status == 200, good&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:02:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:03:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:04:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:05:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:06:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:07:00 PM, status == 200, good&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:08:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:09:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:10:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:11:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:12:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:13:00 PM, status == 200, good&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:14:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:15:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:16:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:17:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:18:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:19:00 PM, status == 200, good&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:20:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:21:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:22:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:23:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:24:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:25:00 PM, status == 200, good&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:26:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:27:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;everyMinute: 2:28:00 PM, status == 200, bad&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can see that more often than not the raw value is incorrect after ten seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm leaving the app running for a while, so if you want to verify this, you can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll post a note in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/213&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt; when I turn the app off. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My dialog with Joe Trippi continues</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/08.html#a152650&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; it was an open podcast, this time an open email. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;, I listened to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-gops-plot-to-white-wash-january-6th-conversation/id1530639447?i=1000526220530&quot;&gt;interview with Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt;. really liked the negotiating with hostages idea. It's true, they are hostages, and it made me stop and think because at first i thought you said hostage-takers.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Working to get Dems elected is not enough. The Democratic Party is in the way. It might be better to run ads attacking them first. To establish that something unusual is going on, that the Dems are weak and disorganized and not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's no way in a two-party system if one party disintegrates, that the other party doesn't also fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In order to compete with the Repubs, which we have to do, the Democratic Party has to be pushed into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need an answer to Donald Trump. It's not as Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high. That's wrong. we need to go lower. Sorry. This isn't church, you don't get to heaven by being pious.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Michael Cohen has some of what's needed. I really liked what he said about driving sign trucks through neighborhoods stating obvious truths that everyone knows that they never say on TV. It's a brilliant idea. He's a brilliant guy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't think the Lincoln Project is the right banner for you to fly under. No matter what they do they identify as Republicans. i don't know if you're a basketball fan but that's like saying the 76ers or Nets should lead us in our quest to win the title. (Both have been eliminated). They are brilliant advertisers, but they are not leaders because they have the Republican stink on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need someone strong, believable, and most important new.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, someone who has leadership qualities -- Stacey Abrams. I found when she endorsed Joe Manchin's election reform platform I had to go look at it. Because I trust her and believe in her intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Do a podcast with her Joe, ask her what we should be doing now. I'd listen to that one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Father's Day</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I dislike all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hoopla&quot;&gt;hoopla&lt;/a&gt; about Father's Day since I don't have one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father died in 2009. As they say &quot;after a long illness.&quot; Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I called the day he died &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html&quot;&gt;Father's Day&lt;/a&gt;. From that moment on I could remember my father the way I wanted to, and try to remember that the things I didn't like were given to him by his father and his father's father, all the way back to the beginning, which in our case was probably a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtetl&quot;&gt;shtetl&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the Ukraine or Belarus or Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The one thing we bonded on was outliners. My father loved ThinkTank. He was a huge evangelist for it, as a college professor in NY, and a consultant to large businesses on marketing and management, he preached the gospel of seeing what you think. I now realize he wanted me to do, then, what I see now that I need to do. I wish he was alive today to use the tools we're creating now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He didn't understand what I was doing when I was developing it, but he loved it after it was done. This might give tech adventurers some hope. Your parents might not understand what you're doing today, but when it's ready to go, they might become believers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sports philosophy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I say the difference between the Mets and other baseball teams is that the Mets have philosophy. Their philosophy is to have a philosophy, which is this: it ain't about winning. The Yankees, the other NYC baseball team, expect to win every year, which doesn't work most years, because despite how good the Yankees are, there are 29 other teams and in most seasons the Yankees, like all but one team, are losers. Their philosophy is not adaptable. The Mets philosophy only has upside. In the infrequent years they win, well, that's a bonus, an extra goodie. Like some rice to go with your red beans. Like a pack of rolling papers to go with your ounce of weed. Winning for the Mets is a nice thing, soon forgotten, when you revert back to the long-term philosophy of playing baseball, not winning at playing baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Nets lose, and that's just fine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who think sports are trivial haven't really thought it through, imho. Sports teach you how to think about things that are confusing in everyday life in clear terms with almost immediate outcomes. Sports is a training ground for strategic and philosophical intelligence.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the basketballl Nets were formed by players who cared not a whit about anything other than winning. They probably need to be reminded what team they're playing for (i.e. the Brooklyn Nets). Kyrie is playing for Team Durant, as is Harden and the others. Durant, who has already won championships, was bored, is a sour person, who on coming to NYC thought it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyknicksnews.com/kevin-durant-the-cool-thing-right-now-is-not-the-knicks/&quot;&gt;okay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2857179-nets-kevin-durant-says-the-cool-thing-right-now-is-not-the-knicks&quot;&gt;dis the team&lt;/a&gt; that everyone in NYC knows sucks horribly, epicly, a self-sabotaging monster of a basketball team that despite everything NY basketball fans love. Love. We love them KD. But we don't like it when players from Seattle, Oklahoma and &quot;Golden State&quot; (where ever that is) come to NY and tell us our team sucks. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; suck you asshole, and the only NYers who are going to root for your Nets are the ones who root for the Yankees. This Nets team was founded to win. Having lost, do they have any reason to exist? So today Knicks fans breathe a sigh of relief. There is a basketball god after all, and the Knicks still rule NY. When the Nets show some hubris, when they commit to a long-term relationship with NY basketball fans, then and only then will the deserve real NY fans, not the fake fairweather fans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This outcome, losing in the second round, was perfectly predictable. Maybe there should be a rule, once you win two championships you should retire, because from that point on there are no more thrills available to you, and like LeBron, destroyer of humble franchises in Miami and Cleveland (twice!) would do less damage if he just invested in VC-backed tech companies and forgot about bringing his sourness to basketball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sports teaches those of us who will never achieve the height of a Kevin Durant to appreciate what we have. This year the Knicks rose off the energy KD fed the team and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/13/124739.html?title=knicksClinchImEcstatic&quot;&gt;exceeded all expectations&lt;/a&gt;. Next year and the year after I'll root for the Knicks, god willing. But if they ever mortgage their future, as the Nets did, to get three vagabond superstars to try to win a title in one year, I'll be shaking my head and  will look for another hopeless cause to identify with until the Knicks come back to earth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today's project is really twisty. I have an OPML file that should always show exactly what's on the blog, but in OPML. That's different from a realtime update, because it only updates when I publish. I don't necessarily like being watched while I edit. It could get weird. It would have been simple to put it on S3 and give it a scripting.com URL, but I wanted it to be on GitHub, so it would be transparent about how it got to the client. And then there's the notification server, that gets a webhook call from GitHub when the OPML file updates. But that's not enough! The client apps, which are browser-based, hook up to the notification server via websocket, which it found the address of in the &amp;lt;head&gt; section of the OPML file. It's all very simple for the client apps, which is the point, but there are a lot of moving parts to debug on my end of things.</description>

			<description>A few days ago I asked for an idea of what the term &quot;garden&quot; meant when applied to a software product. I had seen it used in conjunction with various Tools for Thought projects. I also saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/holden&quot;&gt;Mike Caulfield&lt;/a&gt; talk about it on Twitter. I wanted to understand what it means. After reading his &lt;a href=&quot;https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/&quot;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; on the garden and the stream, I think I get it. My garden is various product and technology sites, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. The product sites for &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. There's even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.com/&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; for outliners of the 80s: ThinkTank, Ready! and MORE. And the stream? That's a blog! And podcasts, and RSS itself. OPML is more the language of the garden. These are useful words to apply to ideas we've been developing since the dawn of the web. It's good to have these words. I also thought of Chance the Gardener's idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgGvd1UPZ88&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_There&quot;&gt;Being There&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful comedy about how the world really works. Chance talks about tending his garden. People find great meaning in this, which is weird because he really is talking about his garden, not economics. It's a farce, a current-day, more thoughtful version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy&quot;&gt;Idiocracy&lt;/a&gt;, another great movie.</description>

			<description>I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/&quot;&gt;OPML checklist&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/#1624040113000&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; explaining what OPML is, and how it came to be the interchange format for outlines. I also added a link to the Instant Outlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; which was released after the checklist. Keep the garden properly tended. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, thinking about Ward Cunningham's &lt;a href=&quot;http://makecommoningwork.fed.wiki/federated-wiki.html&quot;&gt;Federated Wiki&lt;/a&gt;  project, if it understood OPML and had an outliner built in, that would make a pretty great publishing platform. Even better than a built-in outliner, an API by which any outliner could plug in. I'd love to help with that. I love designing and supporting APIs. Ward and I talked about this in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html&quot;&gt;meetup in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. I'm about to ship a new outliner, so it's a fresh topic for me in 2021. Lots of talk about integrating the output of one outliner into another.</description>
