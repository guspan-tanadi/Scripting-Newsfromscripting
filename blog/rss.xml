			<description>Every app should have a Bookmarks menu, for organizing all your work, esp writing and esp if you're writing publicly on the web and the documents are automatically accessible on the web. If you spot a mistake you want to make it as easy and quick as possible to fix the error.</description>

			<description>It's amazing that the Macintosh desktop doesn't have a Bookmarks menu. It was first released in January 1984, almost 39 years ago. Look at all the other crap they've added to the Finder, and the single most useful feature possible is missing.</description>

			<title>ActivityPub and Me</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a strong feeling that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; can be factored to a relatively simple programming interface with a few basic operations. Probably something equivalent to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; we had back in We Blogging Days of Yore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To find out if the intuition is correct, I'd have to do it, and it looks like a snake pit to me, and I expect I'd get lost in there for months, trying to find the right strings to pull to get interop with other apps that use ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would love to use such a package. I work in Node.js. I like clean and simple APIs with good example code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A feed management system</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks&lt;/i&gt; to users who helped me develop &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year it was just an idea that something new could be done for feeds. There were a couple of projects half-developed, one called FeedBase and an SQL version of my River series.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It all came together nicely as a social environment, something I think of now as a Feed Management System, as different from a feed reader. I want to do more with feeds than read them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway if you're using FeedLand, your participation has helped make FeedLand a success. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>One network is better than two</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was there when we moved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer&quot;&gt;mainframes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer&quot;&gt;micros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The real magic happened when they could both be on the same network. That came about 15 years after micros showed up. The web. Two worlds became one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today the text world was similarly bifurcated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a big line separating the web writing world into two parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The parts meant for reading via RSS&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The parts that can't be read via RSS&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But that is changing because the line has been crossed, by Mastodon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What they did is provide an RSS feed for each user.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There, the line is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's next?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One thing Twitter has over Mastodon, reading threads. When I get a reply on Mastodon, it's not easy to find what it's in reply to, and often and unpredictably is a context change, I get transferred to another website. I know this is the result of federation.</description>

			<title>RSS is federation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;RSS is a federated network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't need a license to be in the RSS network. No reviewers to decide if your feed violates community standards or is &quot;not secure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's also really fast -- the net itself is much faster than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Update on identity in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: If you use FeedLand you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/151&quot;&gt;register an email address&lt;/a&gt;, if you have not already done so. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over the last month I made it so you can log onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; with email in addition to Twitter. You still have to have a Twitter account to sign up, but if Twitter were to go down or disappear, if you had registered an email address with FeedLand you would still be able to log in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And note that since new membership is closed, everyone who uses FeedLand already has registered with a Twitter account, so there are no problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps at some point I will produce a version of FeedLand that only uses email for identity. I would do that now if I had 35 programmers working on this stuff, but it's just me, and I have to get back to what I'm good at -- making features users want, and inventing new shit no one else thought of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People seem to assume I'm like a VC-backed company and I want the most users I possibly can get. This is very far from the truth. I want &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; users, and no more. I need support from users, to make sure my new features work, and to make feature requests that make the product better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At some point perhaps I'll work with a company to make it a huge thing like Mastodon or WordPress, commercial to use, open source if you want to deploy your own. But it's not something I can do as a person. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Writers deserve better</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I chose Twitter for identity for my apps, a decision made in 2014, is that I hoped that a developer community would grow up around Twitter. I hoped that Twitter would take a chance on co-promoting products. It could still happen, but it seems unlikely now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had excellent experience with Apple in this in the 80s when their platform needed apps, and they empowered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boich&quot;&gt;Mike Boich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, et al, to help us deliver, and we, and a lot of other developers did. It was a win-win. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nothing like that has happened since then, as far as I know. You can try to raise VC money, but that means you become a platform and lock users in, and ultimately sell out and your product disappears. If you want real longevity there is no answer now beyond 1-in-a-million luck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm at a personal crossroads. &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent product, ground-breaking, imho just what we need. I'd like to continue adding features and fixing bugs and working with users and other developers. But over time as we get more users, my job increasingly becomes administrative and gruntwork. Taking me far away from my personal strengths and where I personally want to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Writing on the web could be much better than it is. I have always believed that the web was the ultimate writers platform. But if every means of distribution requires that you use their writing tools, it can't come close to its potential. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a paragraph from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/24/162940.html&quot;&gt;recent piece&lt;/a&gt;. I think it concisely explains what's wrong with our world, and how we'll know when it's working properly. It's short, just one sentence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109569601727623937&quot; style=&quot;color: inherit&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We'll know it's working if most people feel their best place to write is their blog, where the editing tools work just as they like them to, and there are no boundaries to where those ideas can be published.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You could substitute &lt;i&gt;blog&lt;/i&gt; for any other word you like. The point is writers shouldn't be forced to write in a tiny little box. We should be able to title a story, if it requires one, and leave out the title if it's not needed. I should be able to edit after I publish. We should always be able to link to other stories, or enclose a podcast. Simple styling, &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;, standard features of our writing tools since 1984, should be present in all our publishing environments. And publishing should never require the writer to become a clerk. None of this, in 2023, will be hard or even challenging, from a tech standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should be easy because it &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had all this before the web. It's so ironic that with the business models that evolved on the web, which should have been so transformative for writers, that we had to give all this up. And what did we get in return? As far as I can see -- nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>FeedLand update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new FeedLand feature -- you can now search titles of feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To start a search, choose &lt;i&gt;Search feeds&lt;/i&gt; from the first menu. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A dialog appears asking what you want to search for. Enter a string, and you're taken to a page with the search results. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few example searches you can try.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=new%20york&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=new%20york&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=blog&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=nyt&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=nyt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=bbc&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=bbc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=feedland&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=feedland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=scott&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=scott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=ken&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=ken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=feed&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=dave&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=dave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=john&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=john&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?search=rss&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?search=rss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be signed on to use the command, however, if you're signed on, there are checkboxes so you can see which feeds you're subscribed to and you can see the categories you've assigned them to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's an entry box at the top of the search page that allows you to search for more terms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The results can be sorted by title, how recently they've updated, and the number of people subscribing to the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can get more details about the feed by clicking on its title, and view the five most recent items by clicking on the grey wedge to the left of the title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/153&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; for comments and questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/27/searchScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Screen shot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html#6&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, and we're there again, 26 years later. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To anyone who wants to lead -- show us software that's fun and empowering, get us interested and excited. Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted. We're at a crossroads now, do we go back to the mess of the past or do we learn to enjoy the que sera of it all, and stop seeing threats everywhere we look?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So much of the energy is about defeating and destroying, so little is about creating. People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans. They forget that no matter how rich and intimidating each leader of our industry is, or would-be leader, none of them predicted the world we live in now, and by extrapolation they are powerless to control the world we will live in in 1997 and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'll do my part: here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

For example, when we released FeedLand in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/&quot;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon wasn't a big deal yet, and we didn't even know about their excellent RSS support. Now, a couple of months later, of course FeedLand works with Masto, no mods necessary because &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is a strong standard, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=moosebegab&quot;&gt;users are innovating&lt;/a&gt;, again -- outside the boundaries of either product, using features in one to connect to features in the other. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; becomes art!  When users do things with your product that make you say wow that could have been a whole product on its own.</description>

			<title>Advice for Elon Musk</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A bit of advice to Elon Musk, assuming this isn't all an elaborate act. I've been through what you're going through on a smaller scale, but no less intense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually CEOs of companies or leaders of movements aren't very accessible online. Think of Steve Jobs for example. There was always a lot of distance between him and users. Think of a guy on a stage whose presence is 100 times life size on a projection screen. Not someone you could walk up to and throw a pie at. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But you want to be in the mix, you get something from it. I understand, I do too. But then you have to be prepared for the pies in the face. And instead of calling the pie thrower a jackass, which he is for sure, just turn around and leave. &quot;Gotta go.&quot; Poof you're out of there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can't try to engage with them, show them that you're smart and well-intentioned, it doesn't work. You have to be less accessible. You can't just be one of the gang, that's something you gave up when you became the icon that you are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want some prior art on how to do it, look at how Jack Dorsey does it. I think he's basically a quiet person, so it's easy for him. You are not, you're an extrovert. But being quiet works for Jack. You command a very large enterprise. Your actions will have far more impact than your words. Interacting with the world as if you can make everyone love you, honestly none of them love you, or ever will. They just want to touch you. And some of them want to hurt you. Better to speak through what you do. None of them will ever come to their senses and realize what you want them to realize, whatever that is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, you need to clean up your act a bit, it's insincere to complain about people endangering your life when you do it to others. You may be super-rich but you're just a person. I think in some sense that's what you're trying to say. But you have to live within some of the constraints the rest of us live with. Using your huge following to create real problems for real people, that's just going to come back to you with just as much force. Better to not use your power that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Interacting with the world as if you can make everyone love you, honestly none of them love you, or ever will. They just want to touch you. And some of them want to hurt you. Better to speak through what you do. None of them will ever come to their senses and realize what you want them to realize, whatever that is." created="Thu, 22 Dec 2022 15:02:05 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/22/145420.html#a150205"/>
				<source:outline text="And btw, you need to clean up your act a bit, it's insincere to complain about people endangering your life when you do it to others. You may be super-rich but you're just a person. I think in some sense that's what you're trying to say. But you have to live within some of the constraints the rest of us live with. Using your huge following to create real problems for real people, that's just going to come back to you with just as much force. Better to not use your power that way." created="Thu, 22 Dec 2022 14:55:40 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/22/145420.html#a145540"/>

Instead, they moved a starter to the bench and started one of the young stars-in-waiting, and all of a sudden the Knicks are moving and grooving. Playing D that turns into O. Keeping their eye on the player &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the ball. Dishing and swishing. Posting and toasting. They're a joy to watch, esp since they kept the young dudes we love so much. It's an important life lesson, not just for sports (why I like sports so much). Sometimes greatness is almost there. And it looks like losing. And it takes one small change to make things click. And sometimes that change happens. This is why we love the Knicks. You can believe in them even when it makes no sense to.</description>

			<description>One thing Twitter could do is make it much easier for people to buy ads. Not just &quot;advertisers&quot; but people who want to blow a few bucks impulsively on ideas they want to boost. Like buying domain names, but without the guilt.</description>

			<description>It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109552732539219402&quot;&gt;nice&lt;/a&gt; to start over on Masto.

			<description>The new header &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/21/bigSurHouse.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; on the blog is of a $22 million house in Big Sur, CA. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/2060445714_zpid/&quot;&gt;Zillow porn&lt;/a&gt; for sure. On the darkest day of the year, it's kind of lovely to be reminded that it just gets better and better from here. Another interesting thought. My old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/425-Manzanita-Way-Woodside-CA-94062/181464824_zpid/&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; in Silicon Valley sold for $36 million this year. How about that. Blew me away. I sold it in 2003 for much less.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/20/voicemailToGuyKawasaki.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: An open voicemail to my longtime friend Guy Kawasaki, who wants to meet up with people on LinkedIn. I say come play with us on Mastodon. The difference is I can make software for you that plugs in beautifully on Mastodon, without limits, it's a &quot;platform with no platform vendor.&quot; I will never be able to make software for you that works in LinkedIn. Lots of analogies. And I am as usual far too long-winded.</description>

			<description>We've learned that you can't compete with Twitter on Twitter. I wonder how broad that is and where the lines are, if there are any. I also seems inevitable that Musk/Twitter will sue users, not just suspend them.</description>
