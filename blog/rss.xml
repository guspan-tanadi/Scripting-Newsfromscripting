A friend who is visiting was staying in a house where someone got Covid the night before they came to my house. We both took Covid tests, and both were negative. So I feel pretty good about dodging this. It's the first time I took a test. I play it very safe re Covid. I have too many risk factors to want to take too many risks, and as far as I'm concerned the pandemic is still raging. In the meantime, if you get Covid, get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/13-things-to-know-paxlovid-covid-19&quot;&gt;latest treatment&lt;/a&gt;. I can't imagine why someone who gets infected doesn't, but it happens apparently.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/everything-everywhere-all-at-once&quot;&gt;Everything, Everywhere, All At Once&lt;/a&gt; — watched last night, maybe I was too wiped out from a day full of adventure, but I couldn’t stay awake. Not imho a great movie though it received universal acclaim from critics and friends. I will try again.</description>

			<description>More on EEAAO -- I think what we're seeing here is that commercial movies have changed, they have to be action superhero type movies because they have to sell all over the world, and that's basically what the world likes. So they snuck a little &quot;I'm ok you're ok&quot; psychology into it, so it would have appeal for adults, kind of like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY&quot;&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; movie, but like The Matrix or Kill Bill instead of Iron Man and the Marvel Universe. It's like we stumbled into an alternate metaverse that wasn't intended for us, the response of its people would be basically OK boomer, time to move on. And it's no accident that the dialog is half English, half Cantonese. Two big markets for blockbuster movies.</description>

			<description>I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lbbonline.com/news/yves-saint-laurent-beaute-makes-a-daring-step-into-web3&quot;&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Makes a Daring Step into web3.&quot; Oh really. So I went to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.web3.yslbeauty.com/&quot;&gt;glorious web3 adventure&lt;/a&gt; only to find -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/15/web3DaresYou.png&quot;&gt;ooops&lt;/a&gt;. If it had worked I am told that I might get a YSL Beauty NFT. &quot;Acting as a recognition token of the community engagement, those 10K YSL Beauty Golden Blocks (ERC721 minted on Polygon with the Arianee Protocol) will unlock utilities throughout the year including a premiere launch, whitelisting for NFT drops and much more.&quot; I'm making a note of this here on my decidedly old school tech blog. We have so much to learn from their brave and daring experiment.</description>

			<description>I added a new feature to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallysimple&lt;/a&gt; package. Now it looks for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48138258/how-do-you-add-atomlink-with-rel-self-to-an-rss-document&quot;&gt;atom:link&lt;/a&gt; head-level element with rel=&quot;self&quot; and if it's present, it then adds the &lt;i&gt;href&lt;/i&gt; value to the feed object with the name &lt;i&gt;linkToSelf.&lt;/i&gt; Here's an example of a feed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.docuverse.com/feed/&quot;&gt;Don Park's blog&lt;/a&gt;, that has this element, and here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?url=https://blog.docuverse.com/feed/&quot;&gt;what reallysimple generates&lt;/a&gt;. I felt it was good to include this because this use of atom:link is pretty common, and I wanted to make a gesture, that this isn't about supporting any single feed format, rather it's about supporting what's out there and useful.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06/14.html&quot;&gt;6/14/2002&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;It's going to be a light day here on Scripting News. Lots of non-Internet stuff going on.&quot; In other words, I was going for a doctor's appointment to check out the problems I knew I had with my heart. They put me on a treadmill, didn't like what they saw, walked me over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Hospital&quot;&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography&quot;&gt;angiogram&lt;/a&gt;. Didn't like that they saw. A few days later I had heart surgery, and a week later I was back home, weak as a kitten, with lots of new meds to take, and a non-smoker. I felt like I was in the house of a dead relative, that's how profound the change was. In accordance with Bruce Sterling's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that you can make big changes when something big happens, a few months later I was more or less recovered, strong as a bull, determined to make good use of the time I had been given. A few months after that I had moved to Boston, was starting up blogging at Harvard, then BloggerCon, podcasting, and a new life. Lesson learned, don't wait for the bottom to fall out before making the changes you long to make. Also it's a lot easier to quit smoking if you're in a hospital for the first week. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Ted Nelson was a mentor for all developers of my generation. We studied his book and were both thrilled to find other people thought the same way we were thinking, before we came along, and pissed (a little) that we weren't the great inventors we imagined ourselves to be. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/06/19/thehypertextman.html#1&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; about Nelson in 1995. &quot;He saw the complete picture when I was only getting a glimpse at the parts.&quot;</description>

			<description>Calling tech products &lt;i&gt;web3&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;web5&lt;/i&gt; is a billionaire's way of pissing on everyone else in the usual territorial way. As if to say &quot;we can shit on the biggest open standard ever, and there's nothing you can do.&quot; Maybe so, but we don't have to buy what you're selling.</description>

			<description>I uploaded two more of the early Lydon podcast interviews to YouTube this morning: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITwEMOGdPsg&quot;&gt;Jim Behrle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDVdiEz0WE0&quot;&gt;Eugene Volokh&lt;/a&gt;. It's a bit of a slog. The next podcast has three parts, which means I guess that they have to be merged somehow into a single video.</description>

			<title>Jack, let the hostage go</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think capitalism, practiced honorably, is great. You make a product, convince people to buy it, make a profit, attain financial security, live well from a material standpoint. Good for you. But some of the most successful people in business don't stop there, they seem to get a thrill from destroying things for profit, especially it seems, things that don't belong to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A great example, the oil companies. They sell a product they know makes our planet uninhabitable. Eventually it will fall to all of us to clean up after them, but also thanks to them, not before lots of people die and our quality of life is dramatically downgraded. That's just one example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now a very successful tech entrepreneur, Jack Dorsey, a man who has made billions, and until now has had a reputation for caring about the impact of his creations on the rest of the world, has taken something that is not his, the idea of an open web that belongs to everyone, that is the actual technology that made it possible for him to be so successful. Instead of giving back, he proposes to dismember it, deposit what's left in his bank account, and build something in its place that of course is designed to make him even richer, and have more control, while saying it will do the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I never have understood why people who have made billions want more. It can't possibly do anything for them. They aren't smart enough to run the world, no one is -- I don't care how lucky you got, or how competitive, hard-working, even brilliant. No one is so smart that they can plan on a world scale how technology will work in the future. We can all put our ideas out there and let them mix with other people's and hope there are enough people who want to work with others (as opposed to destroying them) to actually do something good at a large scale. That's as good as it gets. There is no example in our past, when tech was much simpler, of a human who did anything more than add an idea or two to the mix. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So please Jack Dorsey, stop pretending you have invented the next web. No one knows if what you have invented, if you actually have invented anything, will be any good. It certainly doesn't deserve the name of the one technology that got us past all the greed and arrogance of previous generations of tech gods. Back off. I'll help you find a great name for what you're doing, and maybe we can even help each other create more useful tech. Maybe you can start listening more and stop looking inside yourself for all the answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Not only do they chop off the last 23 posts, and complain how there are no titles on the items, but they also suggest I subscribe to this feed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;, which has been defunct for (according to Wikipedia) &lt;i&gt;eight years.&lt;/i&gt; There are some things big companies do well, caring for things like RSS is not one of them.</description>

			<description>BTW, none of this would've been necessary if the browser devs had been willing to work with me, but that's been the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; -- people blazing their own trails for no good reason or possible gain instead of cooperating.

It just struck me that these music services are &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=napster&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, a lot better, and I found Napster to be one of the most empowering software products ever. In 2000, I was 45 years old, and had spent my life up to then unable to program music for myself. I couldn't afford to buy all the music I wanted, there was no software I could command to get me the song I wanted to listen to now. I knew I was cheating with Napster, but the music industry wasn't selling this product, and the music meant so much to me, I had to find out what that was. Now, 22 years later, they have managed to give me &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than what I wanted in 2000, at a reasonable price. Just wanted to say that I'm glad this loop is closed.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt; was a Beatle and should be credited as such. Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; came out, I've been seeking out Beatles experiences, and there's a huge difference between the music of John, Paul, George and Ringo before and after the breakup, and the biggest difference imho is what Martin added. There's a depth and beauty to Beatles music that none of the Fab Four had after the break. Listen to a Lennon song on Abbey Road, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45cYwDMibGo&quot;&gt;Come Together&lt;/a&gt;, and compare it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkgkThdzX-8&quot;&gt;Imagine&lt;/a&gt;. Both are great songs, some of the best music ever created. But there's a depth to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Together&quot;&gt;Come Together&lt;/a&gt; that just isn't there in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(John_Lennon_song)&quot;&gt;Imagine&lt;/a&gt;. That's Martin.</description>

			<description>I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/234&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about getting something like the code-displayer on GitHub to use in a package. I think I found one today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/&quot;&gt;highlight.js&lt;/a&gt;. It's not exactly the style of the display on GitHub (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/06.json&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), but it does provide syntax coloring which is one of the basic features. I want it for an app I'm doing to display the result of converting an RSS feed to JSON. I want it to look good, for devs to immediately understand what they're looking at.</description>

			<title>What is identity?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I use the term &lt;i&gt;identity&lt;/i&gt; in docs and when writing about technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An identity is a virtual person that belongs to you. You can have lots of them. For example I am &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;davewiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on Twitter, or &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/&quot;&gt;dave.winer.12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on Facebook, or &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on GitHub, which means I can create stuff under those names, in a way that (hopefully) only the real Dave Winer can edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's possible to use your identity from one system on others. When I say &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; I'm just saying that rather than invent a new name here, we're happy to use the name you're known by on Twitter. It's like using a passport from another country as your (different) country's passport.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; even if you don't use Twitter, you can quickly create an identity there, it takes about a minute to create an account, and then use that name &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Even if for some reason you don't want to create an identity on Twitter, if you have a Mac you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;desktop version&lt;/a&gt;. No identity required because your work is stored on your computer not mine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; write and maintain my own identity server. If I did that, that's basically all I would do. Think of all the fancy things Twitter does to support hundreds of millions of users. Think of what you expect of them. If somehow you get locked out of your account, you have to connect with a human somehow to get it back. They have it set up, skillfully, so you get a very small amount of human time, because otherwise the economics don't work. If I ran the identity system I use, I wouldn't be as efficient as they are and it's a thankless job, and I don't want it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's futuristic to use the same identity system as other developers. The more people use it, the better prepared we will be if there's a problem in the future with continuing to use Twitter. By using an external identity system I am inviting other developers to join me, so we can pool our efforts when we need to. Otherwise there's no hope that a common system could develop. It has been tried. But evolving this way is the only way imho that has a chance of working. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when I say &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; that means you log in to Twitter, they tell us what your name is, and then we know where to store your stuff so that only you can edit it. It really is a nice thing that Twitter does, and for now at least I can't imagine they have an ulterior motive, and if they ever do we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there. But we couldn't get there at all without using some kind of bridge here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have a comment or question &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/235&quot;&gt;post a note&lt;/a&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A Twitter hello world app</title>

I still might do that, but I decided for now to go another way, by writing the simplest program possible, an app that just posts a tweet that says &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of the app. It's separated into two folders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/tree/main/server&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/tree/main/client&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitterhello.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;run it here&lt;/a&gt;. I am running an instance of the server on one of my machines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is how I envision Twitter's backend working for developers. Just include the functionality in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/tree/main/server&quot;&gt;Hello World server&lt;/a&gt; in Twitter's server. Why should every developer have to write the same code, and run a server? All I want to do is write and run something quickly to try an idea out. And if it becomes popular, I won't have the skill or resources to scale my server, when Twitter is already scaling their server, and my server is doing nothing but communicating with Twitter's. A perfect opportunity for factoring. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obviously such a backend would have to do more than post a Hello World tweet. That's not hard to do -- I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davetwitter&quot;&gt;done it&lt;/a&gt; and am happy to share the code. I think that Twitter is an excellent platform for developers, and it would be much better if it got even simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitterHelloWorld/issues/2&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I was taking notes on the process that led to RSS 2.0 on 9/18/02. At first the project was called RSS 0.94, but after a while, listening to other developers, I changed it to 2.0. It's a long messy story, and by calling it 2.0 we said enough of the messy story. All we want is a feed syndication format that works, and that's exactly what RSS 2.0 is. It works. We got support from all the major news organizations, we already had the support of the NY Times. In the process of designing RSS 2.0, the BBC opened its feeds. And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09.html#When:10:25:22AM&quot;&gt;9/18/02&lt;/a&gt;, the spec was published. From there a small revolution happened, leading to the social media world we enjoy today.</description>

			<description>As you might imagine, in this excursion, there were &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of broken links. As always archive.org was the answer. But for UserLand-hosted sites, very often archive.org has a message about their crawler hitting our servers too hard. An awful lot of our stuff is lost. But I'm sure most of it is in Frontier databases, so ultimately is findable. I'm going to try to do just that with the important bits of the August-September work on RSS.</description>
