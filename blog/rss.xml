			<description>I read somewhere that when you look at someone's eyes, you're looking at their brain. I suppose this is true of every part of the body, but I've been looking at eyes differently ever since I heard this.</description>

			<description>Who's the most famous person you've met who introduced themself to you and you had to stifle a chuckle because of course I know who you are, but still appreciate the respect. For me it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Hawn&quot;&gt;Goldie Hawn&lt;/a&gt;. I rode up on an elevator with her twice. We lived in the same building in Manhattan. A real sweetheart. I was so honored.</description>

			<title>Miriam is great at summarizing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm having a great time with my new librarian assistant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://miriam.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically she's an AI chatbot that has ingested a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;files&lt;/a&gt; from my archive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did the writing, the development was done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;. I get to be a user here. Very relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the other day I very casually asked Miriam how the weather was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/06/askingMiriamAboutTheWeather.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px dotted silver; padding: 3px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Being software, she dutifully answered the question, by referring me to various times I had discussed the weather on Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We don't yet have a way to archive the results of queries, which will, when it's ready allow me to share the actual query with you, so you can take it off in different directions if you're so inclined. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A surprising take-away: I really like how she summarized my posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since Automattic also makes WordPress, which is used for blogging I thought this might be an interesting service they could offer. It could also be used to improve their feeds, esp if writers don't want to include full text. I know this is not a popular view, but I like sites that provide descriptions that are not full text, like the NYT. Much easier to skim. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Miriam's digest of my writing would make a good feed. Maybe this is something we should try. (BTW, I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; provide full text in the feed for all my sites.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to like about her summaries -- they are respectful of the reader. No &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait&quot;&gt;clickbait&lt;/a&gt; anywhere in sight. She's a librarian after all. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Using DALL-E to visualize Miriam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E&quot;&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; to draw &lt;a href=&quot;https://miriam.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt; for me. This is how I described her. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have a vast library of information nice people are interested in reading. So I have hired a librarian named Miriam. She has a standing desk, in front of a vast library of books, spreading out all around her. She has glasses and a very friendly but wise look to her. She wants to help. She has gray hair and bright eyes and a very big smile.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the first images.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/06/miriamByDolly1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I asked Dolly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/08/06/miriamByDollyBig.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;elaborate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Once it's up and running it will be the foundation for the web as an open platform for users and developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My personal timeline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until recently I was using Twitter as my identity service. I knew there was some risk, but as long as one of the original founders was still involved, I felt it was pretty safe. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then with new ownership, I had to quickly pivot to create my own identity system, based on email. It took four months from beginning to end to transition &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of my products that used Twitter identity were left to break. I wrote about this effort in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://roadmap.feedland.org/&quot;&gt;roadmap doc&lt;/a&gt; for FeedLand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Every developer needs the same service. And it's a mess for users that there's a new identity system for every app. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Users need storage. I have to provide them storage for their writing in Drummer, and in FeedLand for things like bookmarks, their personal feeds (ones they generate). Again, I have no interest in this. But I have to do it. And I am stuck paying for their files. &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; should be paying for them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And if my service should ever go off the air, they lose their data (I also provide ways for them to back up their data, but a lot of them don't do it). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No surprise there's almost no developer community for the web in 2023. The hurdles are pretty close to insurmountable.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Describe the service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An identity service as a business. Operated by a strong company with longevity and a track record for treating users and developers fairly. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth&quot;&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; interface for logging on. Can handle multiple identities per user, make it easy to switch from one to the other. For prior art, look at how Twitter or Bluesky do this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;No per-app storage. Rather functional storage. A folder for PNG images, a folder for OPML outlines, or Markdown files, graphs, spreadsheets, or whatever. And make it easy to form projects with files of whatever type. So a user can have 15 programs that use OPML files and decide which get access to the OPML folder. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a key point -- such a system enforces the need for interop. Teaches users they have a right to demand it. When users know this, good things happen in markets. (Example: Podcasting has not gotten siloized because users know they have a right to choice in listening apps.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competition?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dropbox got incredibly close to doing this, but punted.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Amazon should do this but for some reason hasn't. They have end-user identity working (their shopping system) and they lead everyone in storage as a service. Connecting the dots seems to be incredibly easy for them, but they haven't done it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Dave Winer, Human</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I started at Harvard in 2003, one of the first things I did was get my official ID card. When I got it, there was my picture. Underneath that was my name, and underneath that my status: Officer. It was a bit breathtaking. A few minutes before I was a schmuck. Now I was an officer at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I just had that kind of experience again. I went to my profile page on DALL-E, which I've been playing with lately, and there it said I was:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/05/daveWinerHuman.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid silver; margin-left: 35px; padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What an unusual perspective. Here's a place where saying someone is human is saying something. A familiar tweak I haven't felt in a while -- I am once again living in the future. 2023 has been like that for me, a lot of living in the past, and bringing it forward into the future, and then living in that future. I hope to do a lot more of that. Shoveling ideas from 20+ years ago that never got a chance into the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You know what we say about that..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I get this feeling sometimes when I start using a new keyboard, as I did this morning. It's a nice one, the same model as it replaces, which I just plain wore out. It will go to one of my other computers where it won't have so much work to do. Its profile would say: Dave's Keyboard, Keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tina Weymouth</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did some searches on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Weymouth&quot;&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/a&gt;, the bass player for the Talking Heads. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_BfWwbCrw&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with her husband, he said everyone's eyes were on her when they performed, I thought I was the only one. When I listen to a Talking Heads song with a strong beat (a lot of them) I think of her. That's what she represents, the driving power of the group is a woman. Try listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXdVgILd38U&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; and look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AB5stBgMSi6KCAVa4-pV7pTOKKxwIwrtQw:1691244562327&amp;q=tina+weymouth&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6mfb62MWAAxW2kIkEHQGiDhMQ0pQJegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1663&amp;bih=1151&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/05/tina.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Tina Weymouth, bass player for Talking Heads.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I converted them to Markdown, with the source hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/tree/main/docs&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, to make it easy for people to see the changes over time, and to make bug reports. I want to get more systematic in working on FeedLand. When you're reading a docs page, there's a command in the menu that opens the same page in GitHub. If you're a FeedLand user, you may want to read the new docs, it's always a good idea I find to review the docs of products I use. You often see things you didn't pick up on the first time around.</description>

As president he ruled like an autocrat, with contempt for the most American idea, that we pick our own leaders. So the jury will be asked to decide if he should go to jail for being an autocratic president. In other words, will the system validate itself. It's like asking a program to decide if it's functioning correctly. If the validator works, it should reject any argument that Trump makes. Sorry, you're going to jail because you tried to rob us of our right as citizens to replace you with Joe Biden. It's pure, brilliant, gets right to the heart of the matter. Is our system of voting real, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; we choose the president, or does our system crumble when it's violated by its top official. Finally we're asking the right question, making the correct accusation. And if it's decided the way it should obviously be decided our country says no to this bullshit, no matter what a bunch of our fellow citizens want. We had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution&quot;&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of the king.</description>

Finally, we've gotten around to insisting that this question be answered. And a jury of Americans will make the decision. How perfectly American.</description>

It's time for one of these pubs to have the guts to say out loud what the actual problem is with the Trumpsters like Aldean. They want to go back to when they could kill anyone with impunity. And btw, it doesn't matter if he &quot;really&quot; believes it or if it's a business model. It makes absolutely no difference.

			<title>They write themselves</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid08DaZVAx1dsi3zaAckQBZYu9UF3CmypwFB9s7ntEQJzKG5f7bqTfPsn6x5QwCEpYgl&quot;&gt;Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on this day in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My blog posts always &quot;just write themselves.&quot; If they don't I do something else. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For me, a blog post is just the culmination of something I've been thinking about or a story I've told in person a dozen times.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It has to pop to the top of my consciousness a dozen times or more before I'm ready to write about it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I blog therefore because I: 1. Think. 2. Tell stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I subscribe to the NYT</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to the NYT, probably the only newspaper in the US that tries to get away with charging you more for sports. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read less and less of their stuff, the only reason I keep it is that in some things they are authoritative for me at least, like TV and movie reviews. They'll probably start charging extra for that too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I am nauseated by the Daily podcast, used to be a big fan. I don't know what changed, me or them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
