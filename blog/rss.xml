			<description>If you're going to tell the story of the growth of podcasting, you can't leave out &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Podcasting was a mission that two people were on, myself and Adam Curry, mostly working in harmony, to find ways to get people to adopt this idea. We kept throwing ideas out there, and it wasn't until MCN in the summer of 2004 that other people got the idea that &lt;i&gt;they could do it.&lt;/i&gt; That was the breakthrough. You didn't need a big studio and money to produce good audio programming. That's what MCN did. It was as crucial to the growth of podcasting as Serial or The Daily were many years later. You can't write a truthful history of this without including this series. Luckily the &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>There's a lot to be said for no paywalls and no intrusive ads. Transmits a message. No fuss no muss. Sending out a link to them won't cause trouble for anyone. Over time that builds a brand. We should give out awards for that. #1 is Axios for sure.</description>

			<description>Nothing is more galling than people who never cared what you thought of them claiming credit for your accomplishments. Soon we'll all be dead and it won't matter. But in the meantime it means people aren't interested in my new work. So there is a cost.</description>

This is what it said.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The World Wide Web is not owned by any single person or organization. It is a decentralized system of interconnected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The Web is maintained and developed by a community of individuals, companies, and organizations, who contribute to its growth and evolution. The core technology of the Web, including the HTTP and HTML standards, is developed and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

			<title>Why the US is so rich</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Judging from the news, no one has figured out how to explain what defaulting on our debt means in human terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To do it, you'd have to explain why the United States is richer than any other country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not because we're smarter, or make better products, or have more natural resources. It's because the dollar is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; of the world. It's the safest place to store value. That means when we create a new dollar someone accept it as repayment of a loan. That's how our wealth is created and sustained.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, people are happy to be paid in dollars. They want to be paid in dollars. They like dollars because they remain valuable, because they trust the United States to repay the loan because &lt;i&gt;the US never has and never will default.&lt;/i&gt; That's the assumption. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We got a good thing! We should want to keep it! (I don't often use exclams on this blog, btw.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we don't pay back our loans, the safety thing blows up. It'll be gone. Then when we print a dollar to pay back a loan, they'll say no thanks, give us Euros. It's actually pretty simple. If you understand the rules of football, driving or poker you can definitely understand this.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People ought to learn what it means to be a reserve currency. And how it makes the US much richer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It means we can piss away huge amounts of money on the military, and let the super-rich get off with paying no taxes. That's where the difference goes. It's why we can still live in a Western way, with big cars and mortgages, and have the hugest miltary and fuel the growth of the super-rich all around the world all at the same time. It's not because we're a great country, it's because everyone thinks the dollar is safe.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't the military is going to suffer much when our unfair economic advantage is blown up by a default, I think the poor will. I think health care and education will disappear. I think the rivers and air will be polluted. We'll be sicker and more ignorant. Everything will work much worse. More shortages so prices will go up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To understand this all you have to understand is what a reserve currency is. Please news people, explain that. Help the people understand how this works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Yet it in no way interferes with the readability of the code. I've been doing it this way for 20+ years, so it's a pretty smooth process.

			<description>I finished bingeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/his-dark-materials&quot;&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/a&gt;. Utterly tedious. 99 percent speeches by people saying nothing and the music rising and sounding ominious as if something very profound was happening. The last episode was good for about 15 minutes then it got tedious too. Somehow I was snookered into watching one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_superhero_television_series&quot;&gt;superhero shows&lt;/a&gt; that are so popular now. It's all special effects. I'm sure they're impressive, and they made a big deal about how important stories are, too bad the show didn't have much of a fecking story. I give it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fhis-dark-materials&quot;&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; of ðŸ’©&amp;nbsp;and I'm rating myself a fool for sitting through it all the way to the end. Oy boy what a mess.</description>

			<title>Why ChatGPT is a good thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should be pleased that CNET is &lt;a href=&quot;https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai&quot;&gt;putting themselves out of business&lt;/a&gt; of being an authority on commodity info. That business isn't viable today much as being a travel agent isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots of what doctors do will be automated by ChatGPT too, and that's a good thing! They can give us more personal care. Their recommendations are also commodity, and rightly so. And I'm absolutely sure that the new way will save lives and make human bodies work better and live longer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fuckups of medicine pile up. By the time you're my age it's happened so many times it's a wonder I'm still alive. (That said medicine saved my life twice, so there's that too.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Worrying about side-effects like CNETs demo, is like people worrying about typesetters losing their jobs when desktop publishing came around. This is evolution and imho it's a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Uncle Arno's zettelkasten</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's this idea called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; that's been going around in the outlining world. It's like a &quot;second brain&quot; another term they use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thought is that if you get all the info and ideas out of your brain and onto a computer something magical will happen, you will attain a sort of super-humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why but I hate the term zettelkasten, but I love to say it. It sounds like something goofy and idiotic at the same time. It's not an English word. I do not like it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=arno+schmidt+zettelkasten&quot;&gt;look it up&lt;/a&gt;. I found that one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Zettelkasten&quot;&gt;early pioneers&lt;/a&gt; of zettelkasten was my ancestor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic but fringe German writer of the mid-20th century. He was my maternal grandmother's brother, my great-uncle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In his case zettelkasten made sense because:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He was German and zettelkasten is a German word so it isn't icky or pretentious.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He had a legitimate use for one, he was writing a complex novel with lots of characters and plots. And this was before personal computers, in the 1940s and 1950s, so he did it with index cards. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Around the time Uncle Arno died in 1979, I started working on my first outliner, which is the ideal tool for creating and managing a zettelkasten on a personal computer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've attached a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/24/arnoSchmidtWithZettlekasten.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of Arno with his zettelkasten.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The tech industry and Google</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/23/exxonLogo.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was chatting with a leader of tech, a person who has made huge money on the open web. I don't want to say this person's name because my goal isn't to shame them, rather to provide a rebuttal in public where it won't just go into the trash -- I hope -- where there might actually be some listening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Google owned the web when my friend's company was starting up, it's likely Google wouldn't have permitted their product to launch because they were competing with a Google product. But the web was an open platform, no one controlled who could deploy a web app, so my friend had a chance. But Google is now taking that power for itself and there's very little resistance. Right now Google and a number of other organizations are taking ownership of the web, but it's mostly Google. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt;, Google's first change to the web, now that they apparently feel they own it, will mean losing a lot of the archive of the web because it won't be possible to update those sites to comply with Google's rules for what constitutes a legal website. But the web is a fantastic archive medium. And losing the archives, that's not something a big company should be allowed to decide. It would be like saying Exxon could decide if beaches should be protected from oil spills. We'd never let them take that power, they would be stopped, they &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-oil-pollution-act&quot;&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt;. But there's Google, doing it in the Age of the Web, saying we own this and if you don't like we'll just shut you down. You know, like Apple and iPhone apps. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have to put up with this on corporate platforms, there's no choice -- but the web doesn't belong to them. And my friend, who really is someone I like on a personal level, is going along with it. We are opponents in this, and I hope he comes around and realizes that not only do we need the archives, we need the web to be an open playground for innovation. And having tasted this power once, you have to know Google isn't finished, it'll happen again, and again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And of course Google could just create something new and market it as being &quot;more secure&quot; and leave the open web alone. You gotta wonder why they didn't just do that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked Chatgpt &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat/f1631d0c-cb60-400c-8194-59745ec05b6f&quot;&gt;who owns the web&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Trump was a free man...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/22/trumpWasAFreeMan.html&quot;&gt;Jan 22, 2017&lt;/a&gt;, two days after Trump was inaugurated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump was a free man until he took the oath. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But once he assumed the office, and until he leaves, he belongs to us, the American people. I'm sure this is a new feeling for him. But we all must submit to something. The president submits to the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine what hell it must be behind the closed door that leads to the press room. The ranting and screaming, the tears and the &quot;there there's&quot; from his staff, the promises to get even. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But he will keep bumping up against the reality that now, we own his ass, even the ones who thought his campaign was crazy and dangerous. The people who voted for him thinking it left the rest of us powerless are in for a surprise too. The other politicians you elected care about what we think, because they need us to keep their jobs. The election is over, now they're worried about the next election. And like it or not, they need us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Harry Truman famously called the White House the &quot;crown-jewel of the federal penal system.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know how Trump will come to terms with this. We have an idea of what a president does, says, how he or she reacts to events. We just had eight years with a guy who never lost his cool over anything. The new president sees a report on TV saying he lost the MLK bust in the Oval Office and he loses it? He has a long way to go before he is our president. He may hold the office but he hasn't embraced it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another problem with people getting upset when something they depend on on the internet goes away, for whatever reason, is that it's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; going to go away, probably sooner than you expect. If you want things to be long-lived, then we need to make some major changes. And no one, absolutely no one, is working on making a long-lived net.</description>

			<title>RSS-spect</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hoping that people would see &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; as a key to decentralization, but it's hard to draw the picture because people have the wrong idea about RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had a similar problem explaining why a Pub-sub company should support RSS without thinking of it as a &quot;third party opportunity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pub-sub could use a &quot;really simple&quot; interface. You could send any kind of message with RSS, and the knowledge of how to find the new stuff in a feed is totally established in developer-land.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And that's what the Pub-sub people wanted. Ideas for new simple APIs. They look down on RSS as beneath them. I've seen &quot;serious&quot; devs do that over and over and it's a mistake. Simple is better, not trivial. Microsoft, for example, had something &quot;much better&quot; than RSS coming in the late 90s. Eventually they did get on board with RSS, to their credit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the answer is so obvious you can't even see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Twitter API still works. If that changes I'll let you know. Yes, they shut down the clients, but the people who make the clients should have known that was coming. It happened before. Every corporate platform vendor will defend their cash flow. If you bet otherwise, you're probably going to lose. If you don't like it, develop for an open platform or stay out of the platform vendor's path.</description>

			<description>After Davos, I went to Amsterdam, to write and enjoy the local herb. Back then it was the only place in the west where you could buy and consume the weed openly and semi-legally.
