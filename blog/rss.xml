I look at it and I see that even though I've never met them, somehow their feed ended up looking a lot like the feeds I make now, &lt;i&gt;20 years later.&lt;/i&gt; It's like there was this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers&quot;&gt;game of Telephone&lt;/a&gt;, and you'd expect by now, after passing through so many hands, esp people who were &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to break the chain, what came out the other end is correct. Thanks due in part to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt; who persuaded the Masto folk that feed items are not required to have titles. Finally we have a massive maker of feeds who I hope will force all feed readers to support this feature that has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;in RSS&lt;/a&gt; since v0.91. Item titles are optional. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/21/specshot.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;It's in the spec&lt;/a&gt;. In fact it's so important that I said it twice in two different ways in case anyone was confused. I think this is just a matter of programmers looking for an easy way out and most of them not being writers. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>i have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. Lovely car. After a year, I still love driving it. but it's funny -- no Nazis or smelly wanna be dictators show up in the passenger seat when I'm driving . I think Elon should get Twitter to run like a Tesla and in the meantime just stfu. I hope he knows what stfu means.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5HV0-sFbvw&quot;&gt;Video demo&lt;/a&gt;: I didn't want long posts to dominate the feed, so I came up with this approach, a down-arrow that reveals the full content, in place, without having to go anywhere else. It's this approach that would make it possible to have indefinite length posts in Masto or Twitter or whatever, without dominating the feed.</description>

			<title>Trump is all wrung out</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had to say this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1594372293723045888&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is making the same mistake that Kevin Durant did when he signed with the Nets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First thing he did after signing, he had a press conference where he dis'd the Knicks. I guess he was thinking there was some kind of rivalry. There wasn't. No one had any feelings at all for the Nets. A complete zero among NY basketball fans. And the Knicks, well we have a lot of heart there and for the most part it's an ache. The last thing we have any energy for is an idiot who has no idea of the place he's entered, and where we're at, basketball-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And Musk has no idea where Twitter users are re Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what led him to believe anyone had any more juice for Trump. Even the people who liked him are tired. He had a good run, as far as &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; go, but we're just tired. Not even remotely excited. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Trump is all wrung out. Even he knows it. But somehow that fact escaped Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One thing I love &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; about Mastodon is they are genuinely interested in my software. Unlike Twitter which could give a shit. Over there, wow, they think the idea of more toys from Dave with feeds and blogs, that's the best. I feel like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Richards&quot;&gt;Keith Richards&lt;/a&gt; singing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPvDUeaKwMc&quot;&gt;Happy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Jew Hate is all around us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, and still to this day, the word &quot;Jew&quot; was, to me, dirty. I didn't like to hear it. It smelled like rot and death and sadness. I had this idea before I was conscious, before I was in school. Yet I knew all along that I was a Jew. Where did I get it from? I guess I grew up in it. It must've come from my family and neighbors and schoolmates, even teachers, and on TV, in music and radio. Reading. Who knows. But it was there. It still is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that's why I don't use the word &quot;antisemitism&quot; any more. It sounds so technical, almost benign. Instead let's call it what it is -- Jew Hate.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Jew Haters practice their hate, they're moving the needle towrd Holocaust, which even though it's a very strong word isn't strong enough. It's genocide. The killing of an entire ethnic group, systematically, with the goal of eliminating all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't think anything we do can eliminate or even reduce Jew Hate. But letting it out of its box and into the public conversation as it has been lately, amazingly coming from black men, that despite what Jon Stewart says, that is not okay. It's not liberal to allow Jew Hate to be laughed at on SNL. Or to allow an NBA star to shout it from his million-follower Twitter account, or for a pop singer to say he wants to kill Jews, again on a million-follower Twitter account. When you do that, you invite all the other Jew Hate to come out and play. And once it's out, that means Jews are going to die. Once out, it might not be possible to stop it. Something to think about Jon Stewart when they take you and your family away for your final solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm old and tired and fed up with accepting that it's too dangerous to speak up about this. If no one else will, I guess, I will. If no NBA star will reassure me that the NBA is not filled with Jew Haters, I'm going to assume it is. I will never watch an NBA game without thinking that every black man on the floor hates me because of my ancestry and blames me for their misery and would like to see me and my kin killed in a horrible way. I don't wish that for them. But I also can't enjoy a sport where the participants feel that way about me, and they don't even know me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think you're liberal and a fair-minded person and just another Good American, it 's time to say something. Otherwise you're going to have to explain to your grandchildren what you did as it was happening again, only this time in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Further Tesla users spend tens of thousands of dollars to become users, and Tesla could brick their cars any time they want, and we're not connected to each other. Same with SpaceX of course. And even worse than that, most of Twitter's users are either journalists, bloggers, or podcasters. So there's that too. And every one of them is sure Elon Musk is fucking it up.

			<description>To all the old school bloggers, remember how you all used to hate me? This is how it works. It's very rare that in an online space people love the top person, if they are accessible. If they're aloof, hard to find, or speak in haiku, you love them. But if you can talk to them and they might respond, most of what you're going to say to and about them will be negative. I know -- I lived on the other side of that for a number of years. It was fucked up. Absolutely nothing I said would be interpreted as if it were said like a human, like themselves.</description>

			<title>FeedLand w/o Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have said they don't want to use FeedLand because it uses Twitter for identity. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I always forget to mention that you can access most of what's in FeedLand without logging in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, here's my feed list. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can go almost anywhere. You won't see the features that make it easy to subscribe to a feed, or add to your own personal feed, maybe one or two other things. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But most of the product does not require login.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to marry FeedLand to Mastodon via RSS and maybe later ActivityPub. In case you can't tell I love Mastodon. Everything about it so far. Maybe I wish ActivityPub were based on RSS, but I got over that when I saw how nice the software is. That's what really matters, that and interop and not locking users and developers in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FeedLand pushes RSS into lots of new places. RSS has been kind of stagnant for a long time. I decide to do something about that at the end of last year. The result is FeedLand.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Marrying Mastodon does not mean divorcing Twitter. I love Twitter too. People should stop being so chauvinistic about software. Mastodon will never be Twitter and vice versa. Each are their own thing. What matters is the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mastodon and RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The more I learn about Mastodon, the more impressed I am. It's a very nicely done piece of software. And unlike Twitter, they have RSS feeds for every user. Just add a .rss to the end of the URL and you get a nice feed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://mastodon.social/@davew.rss&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. When I look at the feed I see something someone put some love into. Or if it was a team, they worked well as a team. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do have a couple of suggestions to make, based on experience providing these feeds basically in all the software I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please give the user a way to change the channel-level title and description for the feed. The reason â€” my feed doesnâ€™t say itâ€™s from my Mastodon account, so when an update shows up in FeedLand itâ€™s missing that context. The user has a better idea of the context for the feed, how many other feeds they have and how this one relates to those feeds. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There also is a simple instant notification protocol in RSS 2.0 called rssCloud. Iâ€™d be happy to show you how to turn it on. Would increase immediacy of updates.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Thereâ€™s a simple way to link the feed to an account on Twitter, Facebook, etc. we should add one for Masto as well. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/11&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for this. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/issues/10&quot;&gt;discussion thread&lt;/a&gt; for this topic here. I'd love to work with the people who do this part of Mastodon to make this feature even better than it already is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's what my Mastodon feed looks like as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; in FeedLand and as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>All the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; emanating out of MastodonLand is blowing my mind. We're all part of the same freaking religion. This has been an incredible day, and I expect tomorrow to be even more so. I have a list of things I want them to look at. For example I think Mastodon's outgoing feeds should support &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; so we can get instant updates. I would be happy to show them how it works and help them do the adaptation. Basically all they have to do is add some info to their feed, and ping a special server when they update the feed. We take care of the rest.</description>

It factors out all the variability, and returns a consistent JavaScript object. Reading an RSS feed is as easy as reading a JSON file. I promise. No bullshit. And btw, it also reads Atom and RDF through the same interface. You don't even have to know what format the file is, all that is taken care of. The point is, reading an RSS file was too hard. So I spent the time to make it simple and easy.</description>

			<description>&amp;lt;item&gt;s in Mastodon feeds do not have &amp;lt;title&gt;s. It's time for all feed readers to not treat this as an error. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/16/itemsWithNoTitlesAreLegalRss.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates. Also repeating the text where the title goes is not useful or correct, and if your reader does that, it should be fixed. RSS is going places now, and if you don't go with it, people are going to notice.</description>

			<title>Follower counts on Masto</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do they play around with follower counts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At twitter they most certainly do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are people with millions of followers who were given those for being friends of the founders. I don't know if they still do it, but in the early days it was very observable. All of a sudden one day a person who had 200 followers had 10000 and then a million the next day. And many of them were nobodies, and a lot of them were journalists who wrote puff pieces about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We even saw a case where a journo was punished for writing a piece based on leaks from their board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was not a secret. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Artists don't hide</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been reading a lot of music history. When a new album came out, every musician would listen, in the first days. Theyâ€™d go to their shows. Listen and let it affect their own creative process.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Beatles went to a Jimi Hendrix show in London and heard him cover Sgt Pepper, a week after the album came out!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software years and years go by and no one looks. Can you believe a book about innovation in languages came out, and no chapter about Frontier. All the new ideas, still not in the vocabulary of designers, decades later, I hope not lost to history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think of themselves as friends of mine not willing to spend even five minutes to find out what FeedLand or Drummer are. The first has been out for a month, the latter, a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think youâ€™re practicing software art, but youâ€™ve got yourself cloistered and protected from outside influence, you are a pretender, not an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ask a Jewish boomer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a boomer friend who is Jewish, you might  ask what their parents told them about antisemitism and the Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that we will end up in the ovens is pretty well-ingrained from all those talks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when a comedian, singer or NBA player talks in dog whistles of their Jew-hate, it pretty much freaks us out. You may hear us laugh but inside we're revisiting our parent's fear and pain, and in their own way, love.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now a delicate subject -- when the singer, comedian or NBA player is black, this has a special sting because we heard the stories your parents told you about encounters with the police. It's an incredible perspective-shift. Some of us are listening and let it sink in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now maybe you can appreciate that &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; parents had the same kinds of talks with us. Our fear is not just of our own personal deaths, but genocide. In the Holocaust they came to kill all the Jews, whole families, neighborhoods. Everyone who was wearing a yellow star. They would line us up in front of ditches and shoot everyone. Then bring in another group and shoot them so their bodies fell on the bodies that were already there. This &lt;i&gt;actually happened&lt;/i&gt; to people of our parents' generation. This wasn't some plot to fool you. It fucking happened. It was only luck that kept them from dying this way, kept them alive so they could be our parents. And to warn us of things happening that are exactly what you are doing. We aren't stupid and we haven't forgotten. We know where you are taking us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I believe if this genocide happens in America they will  come for blacks too, so what you all are doing is not just morally indefensible, it's not going to keep you and your family out of the ditches and the ovens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be working together. I always kind of thought we were.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NBA and hate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a bit of Dave Chappelle's routine on SNL. Very funny how he points out there are a lot of Jews in Hollywood. (That was sarcasm.) I'm sure they're all assholes. No sarcasm there. I had some dealings with them in Napster days. I couldn't believe the ideas they had in defense of their profits. Really scorched earth shit. The sense of entitlement of these people is something to behold. But to be fair, some of them were Christian and while I didn't meet any I bet some of them were black too. That's more a disease of the entertainment business than it is of any one religion or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand most NBA players are black, obviously, and until now I thought they were pretty neutral about Jews. No reason to think otherwise. Until Kyrie Irving lets out the secret, tests the water. It's met with silence from NBA stars. Only LeBron James speaks out, saying he doesn't &quot;respect&quot; what Kyrie said and does not &quot;condone&quot; it. That's it? Was condoning it actually an option? That's all they have to say. Geez if it were a white person saying something equivalent about black people, or god forbid a &lt;i&gt;Jewish&lt;/i&gt; white person, the league would stop and they'd all wear armbands and have candlelight vigils and they (and we, the fans) would force them to divest from the NBA for life. And that would be right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when you deny the Holocaust you're crawling around in the pain of millions of descendants of Holocaust victims. I am only learning how profound that is, being a child of Holocaust survivors myself, after my parents have been gone for years, enough time to now feel the pain that I grew up in, very much inside me, a big part of my foundation. If you think you can ease the pain of being descendants of slaves by denying the Holocaust, well I don't believe you can, and it's not okay any more than it would be for us to deny that slavery happened, which is something today's Repubs very much are doing. We should be helping each other. I thought we were. But I see how mistaken that was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sensing that antisemitism is one of the foundations of the NBA by their silence, and Dave Chappelle is already known to be a total asshole (why was he hosting SNL). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect them to sanction Kyrie, I expect him to be reinstated, and the silent antisemitism to continue. But they let a little truth slip out. And while I was a huge fan of the NBA before, and felt good about it, because they were the one sports league that cared about people and fought against hate, now I can't stand to watch them knowing what I know now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I knew they were racist, btw -- from the way they treated Jeremy Lin. My fault for choosing to overlook that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Later, I heard more of the Chapelle monologue. Exactly as I thought. Blacks go deep into our pain and think itâ€™s power? Does he think the millions of children of victims of the Holocaust run Hollywood? And the silence of NBA stars is deafening. And NBC? Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Our feed peering service</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Built into &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is a way to move updates to feeds efficiently and quickly. We use the protocol that's built into RSS 2.0 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. I'm finding out that more people are supporting the protocol than I thought. Last time I checked all WordPress sites support it for example. micro.blog supports it. Since I'm spending more time there these days that was a nice surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I'm describing here are the feeds that users write in FeedLand, not the ones that FeedLand gets from reading feeds. This is a very new feature, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/yourFeed.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;These are feeds that emanate &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; of FeedLand. When I write about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twowayRss&quot;&gt;Two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt; -- I'm talking about FeedLand and hopefully many other writing products. I'm trying to show people how to do this, and why you would want to. If you make a feed reader you might want to include a simple feed writer.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; that's in the screen shot, above. You literally are editing a feed. Any feed reader can subscribe to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it has some extra features that you can use, notably -- the text is provided both as HTML in the description element, and in Markdown in the source:markdown element. The intention here is to seed the use of markdown in feeds, something I was writing about in the summer, when I was developing this feed editor. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to provide a websocket-based service for apps to hook into, to not only get new items in this format, but also updated items. I think since we're starting fresh on federation let's have realtime updating built in from the start. And Markdown support. All the while producing an RSS feed that all feed-reading software understands. No breakage. But a way to move forward. Back when RSS 2.0 was first specified in 2002, there was no Markdown. If there had been we would have built on it as we did with MP3 for podcasting. And while we're at it -- there's OPML in there so tools for thought integrate beautifully with RSS. (I haven't forgotten about OPML.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this is a heads-up. Not sure exactly what form this service will be in. But it will really be simple, that's for sure. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What I really want from AI is for it to sort all my writing into an index, like the index in the back of a book.  i've got 28 years of writing on my site, and there are definitely threads running through it, but i have never been able to visualize those threads. I want the AI to do an editorial job that would be insurmountable for a human. I know I've tried at times to work with editors on that, and they see the scope of it and just give up. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; btw -- if you have an AI and would like to try it out.</description>
