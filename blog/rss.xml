			<description>If I ran MSNBC we'd be asking at the top of every show -- When will Merrick Garland indict someone in charge of the Jan 6 coup, or when will he resign to make room for the person who will. And Biden will you fire Garland if he refuses? We've waited too long. Out of patience.</description>

For the first, I highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Color-Purple-Alice-Walker-audiobook/dp/B07LCSL8PS&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; which is narrated by the author. Want to understand how slavery works in the United States? How the culture it spawned is American culture? This is your book. Beautifully written story, a real page-turner, and a total eye-opener. Klara and the Sun is near-future science fiction, about artificial friends. It's interesting in a meta-way because the artificial friend in the book, Klara, becomes &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; artificial friend. Also beautifully written.</description>

			<description>I didn't watch a lot of movies this year, but my favorite, hands-down, was (of course) &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Don%27t%20Look%20Up&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Don't Look Up&lt;/a&gt;. It's more than a movie, it's an anthem, identifying the conclusion of our civilization one way or the other. We either overcome our need to be told simple bedtime stories and thus transform into something else, or we self-destruct. Either way, the past is not a template for the future. And they deliver the message in such an entertaining way! Maybe it's the last fun movie our species will ever create? People who judge the movie on its ability to entertain alone are totally missing the point. We have not only hit the wall, but it destroyed us. Now it's time to pick up the pieces, the best we can. As Dr Mindy &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/28/weReallyDidHaveEverything.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; at the end, &quot;We really did have everything.&quot; Note the past tense, and it's very true, in the movie and in our lives. The times of having everything is over. Now what can we salvage from the wreckage of our civilization?</description>

Same is true of software of course, and law, and pretty much everything that humans learn about. So what to do? Well, that's where blogging comes in. We need a combination of expertise and understanding of the scientific process, and the ability to communicate in a way that non-scientists can understand. So you can either teach journalists to be better at science, or give scientists the tools and training to be more effective communicators. There is a compromise possible -- merge the two. Bring expertise into the journalistic process, don't force science through the minds of journalists who dumb it down, or misrepresent it. This was the initial idea of blogging, it's why I went into academia in 2003. And why a person like Jarvis, who is a professor at CUNY and a pioneering blogger, is in an ideal position to start bringing about the needed change.</description>

She didn't start blogging this year, but this is the year I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=heather%20cox%20richardson&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;reading her&lt;/a&gt; daily posts, and I found them valuable and quite bloggy. I also loved her weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  But in one of the latest nightly posts she writes about &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=smoking%20gun&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;smoking guns&lt;/a&gt; as if we don't already know the extent of Trump's involvement in the January 6 coup. This general lack of courage on the part of the establishment press and politics is putting our future at great risk. The question isn't whether there's enough evidence to indict every member of the Trump Administration at the end of 2020 and early 2021, but rather why isn't the DoJ led by the supposedly courageous &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Merrick%20Garland&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt; doing anything to save the republic! When is it going to happen? And what are they afraid of. I think at the end of 2021 a blogger of the year should be grounded in reality. Our patience is long exhausted. Maybe a Civil War is inevitable. Maybe the original Civil War never ended. But I know this, I'd rather have the war while Abraham Lincoln (as played by Joe Biden) is president than &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis&quot;&gt;Jefferson Davis&lt;/a&gt; (Donald Trump). So let's say, for now, there is no Blogger of the Year for 2021. It should have been Heather Cox Richardson, and maybe if she stands up for the republic we can amend the record in 2022.</description>

			<description>In the last decade or so I modified my art from making software for everyone to making software mostly for myself. Some projects take years to complete, and some remain on the shelf waiting for their turn to be rolled out. But the best product I've ever made I think is &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. A project that I was thinking about for a few years, but when it finally came time to write the code, took about &lt;i&gt;two weeks. &lt;/i&gt;Of course I spent a fair amount of time in advance of those two weeks creating packages and techniques that made it possible. But it is right now by far my favorite writing tool. I have most of my writing for the last 20+ years available to me through search, with full text, and a usable UI, unlike the increasingly sparse and unusable commercial search utilities. This proves one thing, there's still a fair amount of unexplored territory in the web.</description>

			<description>My favorite community project of 2021 are the art curators on Twitter. There's a group of Twitter users who, on behalf of great painters throughout history, are posting their works to Twitter. I follow many of them, and have written an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader&quot;&gt;open source app&lt;/a&gt; that reads their feeds and stores the art in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/data&quot;&gt;GitHub-hosted database&lt;/a&gt;. Current count: 31,867. It's downloadable and ready to be used in a Mac screen saver. It's a wonderful thing. Sometimes as I'm browsing Twitter one of the works shows up and I stare at it and experience the art, and how observe contrary it is to the rep of Twitter as being a place for loudmouths, psychos, narcissists and insurrectionists. This is pure art and art about art. You can't hold art down, pave it over, commercialize it. Art has a way of popping up through the cracks and sprouting whole new experiences.</description>

Art has a way of popping up through the cracks and sprouting whole new experiences." created="Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:12:06 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/30.html#a151206"/>

			<title>Comfort TV</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a podcast yesterday about &quot;comfort tv&quot; -- binges that bring you a sense of well-being. That is imho what binges are about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First basic ingredient, &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=suspension%20of%20disbelief&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;suspension of disbelief&lt;/a&gt;. While watching the show, from the beginning of the first episode, you must be in the story, not watching tv, but relating to the characters in the same way you relate to real people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From that comes a sense of community, this is your tribe, you think about them the same way as if you were a wild pre-tech human, feeling attached to the other citizens of your village.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The feeling of comfort is the feeling of being home, hanging out with your tribe. A feeling the real world no longer gives us, so we create it artificially.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The smoking gun!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So interesting -- people who write for major media can't see the humor in Don't Look Up. It would require them to see their own filters, which are impossibly hard to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But here's a fact: Major media can't report bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: I saw a bit that maybe we've found the smoking gun for Jan 6. They've been speculating for months.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we saw the smoking gun on Jan 6, on C-SPAN. If they could remember &lt;i&gt;we saw the gun, &lt;/i&gt;they could make the story about what it should be -- why hasn't the DoJ indicted him yet? What's the hold up. That should be the top story on political news every night. Not where's the smoking gun. Trump is, if anything, a walking talking smoking gun. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The smoking gun. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you don't like the Jan 6 invitation to the MAGA mob to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3eC35LoF4U&quot;&gt;burn down the house&lt;/a&gt;, how about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIJU3M-kKhI&quot;&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt; of him trying to fix the Georgia election. That's looks like pretty good evidence to this non-lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you want to understand the mindset of VC, see the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Don%27t%20Look%20Up&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Don't Look Up&lt;/a&gt;, which is becoming an extremely useful landmark.

			<title>More glorp, the history</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;i've been following new threads for the last few weeks. as i hope you've seen we now have daytona, and it's made my blog much more useful to me. maybe more than anyone else because I have so many years of archives. lots to discover in there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i've also been hacking away at a project called glorp that takes outlining off in a direction that's new, like old school was new before it was connected to drummer. it's just as different, but unlike the drummer/old school combination, which goes back to 1997, the structure in glorp is new. you haven't seen this before.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;yet it has the maturity that old school had when it was first hooked up to drummer. because i made glorp for myself, in 2013, four years before old school. i was transitioning from an all-frontier environment to an all-javascript environment. and i needed a way to edit node projects in my outliner. so i tried an idea out, put S3 paths in the top level headlines of an outline, and underneath that at the second level, paths to individual files, and beneath each of those at the third level and below, the contents of the files. the way the text would be rendered was determined by the file extension. so you could mix .js files with .md files and .opml and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;this project came together remarkably quickly, it almost wrote itself. there aren't many things like that, but i'm reminded of how easy it was because in a few days i re-created it in electric drummer. it's a vital step to being able to move my entire work environment into linux, which i really want to do. the idea of using the same platform for development and deployment is very powerful. i've been there before, until the late 90s i ran my server on a mac and edited on a mac (steve jobs blew that up,  he never even knew what we had working). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;anyway i yearn to get back to that, and away from apple's culture that breakage is fine. for projects like mine which span decades, that attitude is poison.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ps: as you can see i've deprecated the shift key in all but the most necessary places. i used to find it easy to reach for a shifter, but these days i seem to prefer my fingers to stay closer to home as i type. i have no idea how this happened. i probably will fix this text before the mail goes out tonight, or maybe i won't. what's next? apostrophes? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Glorp, or outline as a file system</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;About eight years ago I sat down to write a bit of software that would let me edit numerous files in a single outline. When I saved the outline they would all update in the various places they were aimed. So with one click I could update a server and its user interface, scripts that run on the server, and a documentation website on GitHub. All the associated files would be in one outline. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=outline%20as%20a%20file%20system&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;outline as a file system&lt;/a&gt; model. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use it all the time for every project I do. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/27/nodeEditorScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It came together remarkable quickly in 2013, in Frontier. In the last few days I've rewritten the software to run in &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. The codename for the product is &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=glorp&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Glorp&lt;/a&gt;. I'm actually kind of falling in love with the name. When I wrote the initial version in Frontier in 2013 it was just for me. I called it &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=NodeEditor&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;NodeEditor&lt;/a&gt; because it was initially conceived as a way of editing Node apps. It has outgrown that name, it does much more than that now. Glorp will do for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I like it so far. I usually don't binge shows as they come out, I like to wait for the series to end, and then watch it at my own pace. But this is an exception. Anyway I watched episodes 4 and 5 last night, both were very good, esp the one that took place in the airport in the first days of the apocalypse.

			<title>The significance of Daytona</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep beating this drum until people hear it, get how significant Daytona  is. It's as if all this time we were driving on roads that only went in one direction. It took 27 years of blogging for me to get around to add a lane going in the other direction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it's not surprising we thought blogs were for getting attention. That's all the medium supported, really. Yes we added feeds, so it could be somewhat more efficient to squeeze the new bits out of a sea of blogs. But this is more fundamental. Even if no one else reads my blog, having an idea harvester and an archive of years of writing gives me something no one has had before. No one. The sad part is Google could have and should have done this years ago. I think that's why I had the mental block that kept me from pursuing this. I figured it must be hard. It wasn't. It's just a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=MySQL&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; database with the outlines loaded into them. And luckily I kept a pretty good archive, so over the period of a week or so I was able to load much of it into the database. I think I'll get the rest of it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep banging the drum. There's a lot more potential in the web as an intellectual environment. We need to get beyond the loud screams for attention, another purpose for writing publicly. Obviously it's not for everyone or even most people. But for the people who think, and want to accumulate their knowledge over time, this bit of tech has been missing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But first, if you've watched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1474288736477356035&quot;&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; of the movie, this review is not a spoiler. It's a farce, along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr Strangelove&lt;/a&gt;. It's LOL funny all through. The acting is amazing because they've got a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/24/cast.png&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; of the most wonderful actors of our day. It's hard for me to not love a movie that stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;. The movie is sexy and true. Yes, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/28/weReallyDidHaveEverything.png&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;, and we blew it -- in the movie and in real life. It's a critique of our response to climate change, and Covid, and even has a dig at Trump (the president's chief of staff played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Hill&quot;&gt;Jonah Hill&lt;/a&gt; is her son). I've already watched the ending twice, and I expect I'll watch the whole movie all the way through to the end at least once more. As to why the critics don't like it, the movie blames journalism for pretty much everything. I can imagine they must have realized doing so meant bad reviews, but they went for it anyway. If you're a climate change denier or a MAGA person, you probably won't like this movie either.</description>

Yes, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/28/weReallyDidHaveEverything.png&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;, and we blew it -- in the movie and in real life. It's a critique of our response to climate change, and Covid, and even has a dig at Trump (the president's chief of staff played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Hill&quot;&gt;Jonah Hill&lt;/a&gt; is her son). I've already watched the ending twice, and I expect I'll watch the whole movie all the way through to the end at least once more. As to why the critics don't like it, the movie blames journalism for pretty much everything. I can imagine they must have realized doing so meant bad reviews, but they went for it anyway. If you're a climate change denier or a MAGA person, you probably won't like this movie either." created="Fri, 24 Dec 2021 14:33:42 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/24/dontLookUp.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/24.html#a143342"/>

			<description>I'm now loading all the posts from 1997 to 2010 into the Daytona database. For all the time involved, it's amazing how consistent the format is. In the early part of the archive, most posts had no created attribute. Then starting around 2004 most did, but I think it was only until 2017 that they all did. So I had to revise the conversion script to synthesize them if they weren't there.</description>

If you haven't seen it, or you have and liked it, then don't read the rest of this post. I like story-telling in movies, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;the first Matrix&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, was one of the best movies ever, as a story. It's a puzzle. Red pill, blue pill, who is Agent Smith, and The Oracle, and why does Morpheus think Neo is The One. And wtf is the Matrix! It's a beautiful story, and the characters -- young Keanu and Carrie-Anne, Hugo Weaving, Lawrence Fishburne. In the 2021 version, they recast a bunch of them and spent huge amounts of time explaining why. Who cares. When I switched it off last night, the characters were still yapping about what changed and why. It reminded me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;, a movie whose plot didn't start until they finished re-introducing all the main characters. And then they had about 40 minutes for something unmemorable, even stupid. Anyway I will finish Matrix 4, if only because maybe there's something worthwhile there. And I know some people really liked it, I don't understand why, but I respect that. Maybe sequels like this shouldn't be made, or maybe no one has figured out yet how to do it. Or maybe all movies these days have to be all about action and narration without acting or plots getting in the way. Instead I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piano&quot;&gt;The Piano&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix, a wonderful movie, with almost no dialog, and no characters insisting that I hear their explanation for what happened. You get to figure it out for yourself.</description>

Just say hey this is a billionaire who, according to recent Supreme Court rulings, can turn the US into a fascist hell, and might be one of them who's doing it. You could film Ari calling his office and asking the receptionist if he could speak to the ruling class member who could be quietly pulling the strings. No talk of &quot;kill shots&quot; or the like. No mobs invading their offices or homes. Just let's find out who they are and what they've done that we know of that fucks us over. And call Elizabeth Warren and ask why she talks about taxes all the time, when that's not the actual problem.</description>

I started by reviewing the top level folders on scripting.com. I saw a folder called opmlArchive. In there were folders for the years 1997 through 2010. I opened them up, and saw folders with each of the months, 01, 02 and so on. Then I opened each of those, and there were OPML files for each of the days. And inside the OPML files, the source text for that day's blog. And they're pretty much exactly the same format as the format I use today. My CMS isn't called Old School for nothing. Anyway I'm just merging the daily files into monthly ones, to be consistent with the archive that I've been keeping on GitHub since 2017. In few minutes I'll be adding 12+ years of source text. And then after a bit I'll load all this into Daytona. My memory is so weird, I vaguely remember setting this up. I mostly just do things like that and forget them. What this tells me is if I hunt around on my hard drive, I'll find the editing tools I was using then. It's almost as if someone else did all this stuff.</description>

			<description>BTW, yesterday a Radio UserLand blogger asked me if there was a way to convert their blog archive to OPML. I'm sure we could do it, probably fairly easily. The thing to look for is a file called radio.root. It's the object database that contains everything, including your blog posts. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/227&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.</description>
