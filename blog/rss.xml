			<description>Still reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X&quot;&gt;Autobiography&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Malcolm X&lt;/span&gt;. He asks if you think it's a coincidence that the US &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&quot;&gt;dropped the bomb on Japan&lt;/a&gt;, a non-white country, instead of Germany, a white country. The official story is we used the bomb as soon as it was ready, but that could just be a story. He asks a good question, and many others. I wish we had more people around today asking questions like that.</description>

			<description>&lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bezos&lt;/span&gt; wants to move manufacturing into space. I had never heard that idea before seeing a quick interview today with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/07/20/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-launch-cooper-intv-sot-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt; of CNN and the two Bezos brothers, who look very much alike. The rich one is the guy in the dorky cowboy hat. He says some industries that use up too much of the earth's resources would be better in space. I started to think about what he might have in mind. Server farms run on solar energy, and cooled by the vacuum of space. Perfect. On the other hand, who would regulate his businesses in space? No OSHA, no unions, no taxes or laws. I bet they're all thinking about this, and I kick myself for not having thought of it myself.</description>

			<description>What's &quot;historic&quot; about &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bezos&lt;/span&gt;' trip today? The first human in space was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin&quot;&gt;Yuri Gagarin&lt;/a&gt; in 1961. The first American was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard&quot;&gt;Alan Shepard&lt;/a&gt;. Gagarin orbited earth once. Shepard went up and down, did not orbit.</description>

			<description>In &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Denmark&lt;/span&gt; they have a children's show about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillermand&quot;&gt;man with a huge penis&lt;/a&gt; that he uses to help people. At first it's a little shocking to this American, but why shouldn't we think of a &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;penis&lt;/span&gt; as something friendly and useful. I was brought up to think of my penis as something shameful, dirty, to hide, to apologize for. I can't imagine how I got those ideas, but they were and are there in my infant brain. Eventually we learn to have fun with our penises. Hopefully. Why not start as a kid? Thanks to &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;John Oliver&lt;/span&gt; for his incredible little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A51mJjFyG_w&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Reporters are pussycats</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;More confirmation that today's blockbuster news about Trump is about the crazy place we were in six months ago. I don't get reporters who think that's acceptable. Their job is to know (and tell us) what crazy place we're in &lt;i&gt;right now. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the military. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/14/donald-trump-reichstag-moment-general-mark-milley-book&quot;&gt;Joint Chiefs guy&lt;/a&gt; thought Trump might be doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire&quot;&gt;Reichstag fire&lt;/a&gt;. Great. So WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T HE PREPARE THE MILITARY TO KNOCK IT DOWN BEFORE IT STARTED AND SHIP THE INSURRECTIONISTS OFF TO GITMO. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO WITH TERRORISTS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When are some reporters going to get into the present and deal with today's truth. Stop praising the military for *saying* how fukced up everthing is. Praise them for keeping it from getting that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's hope Biden, first thing when he got on the job, sat down with the military and told them they fucked up big, and they better be prepared next time. I suspect he didn't because he hasn't fired any of these nincompoops. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to stop thinking like pussycats and start getting in front of this. We're getting our asses whipped every time, and we're the United States dammit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Coronavirus infections are surging in places with low vaccination rates. SARS-CoV-2 is continuing to mutate. Researchers have confirmed the delta variant is far more transmissible than earlier strains. Although the vaccines remain remarkably effective, the virus has bountiful opportunities to find new ways to evade immunity. Most of the world remains unvaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And so the end of the pandemic remains somewhere over the horizon.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

That should stop.

He's trying to kill more hundreds of thousands of Americans. And of course not just in America.</description>

			<title>OPML's building block -- the include node type</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a developer yesterday and the question came up, what about huge outlines? How does &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; handle those? That gave me a chance to tell the story about how i'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archiving&lt;/a&gt; Scripting News, and how include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+include+nodes&quot;&gt;nodes&lt;/a&gt; work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All systems have to evolve as projects get bigger -- you break it up into components and link them together in a single document. That makes the code more manageable, and makes it possible to reuse the pieces. Every serious system has to provide for breaking big things up into smaller, reusable bits. For example... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Node.js has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt;. You can include a package in an app, or in another package, with a require call, like this: &lt;code&gt;const fs = require (&quot;fs&quot;);&lt;/code&gt; Then you can refer to exported bits from the &quot;fs&quot; package in your app as if they were part of it, because they are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;programming language C&lt;/a&gt; has the #include directive: &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;standard.h&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The C preprocessor reads the file, and replaces the #include directive with the contents of the file. Includes can contain includes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_directive&quot;&gt;survey page&lt;/a&gt; explaining how inclusion works in other languages, such as Fortran, Pascal, PHP. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;OPML has &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html#inclusion&quot;&gt;include nodes&lt;/a&gt; which have a &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute whose value is include and a &lt;i&gt;url&lt;/i&gt; attribute which is the address of an OPML file. When the user expands an include node, the outliner reads the contents of the OPML file and inserts it as subs of the include node. To the user, if the net is sufficiently fast, and the file is a manageable size, they wouldn't need to know that it was an include node. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example. I archive my blog, which is written in an outliner, and saved as OPML, at the beginning of every month. I save the previous month in a repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and empty out the outline I edit. The CMS that builds the HTML rendering and the RSS version of my blog is able to jump month boundaries. So I have a convenient-size outline for editing, and everything else just hums along. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what if I wanted an outline of all my blog posts going back to May 2017? I would do that with include nodes. And just for fun, I did exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/005d8b83ea76fbb25df8627096cb75f7&quot;&gt;an OPML file that contains includes&lt;/a&gt; for each of the months of 2018, 2019 and 2020. If you have an outliner that can expand includes, then you can view all the writing for those years in one outline&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a real &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;mind bomb&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;racism&lt;/span&gt;. 18 minutes, for a brain explosion.

			<description>I have not been able to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki's podcast&lt;/a&gt; feed. The usual tricks aren't working. Here's his Apple Podcasts &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827&quot;&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; page. Usually if you give that URL to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getrssfeed.com/&quot;&gt;GetRSSFeed&lt;/a&gt; app, it returns with the address of the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; podcast feed. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; it took me. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2467377&quot;&gt;viewed the XML&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows me an HTML page? If anyone can figure out the URL of his podcast feed, please let me know. Thanks.</description>

			<description>Sometimes I get stressed, like everyone else. I have a technique for working my way through it. I ask myself this question: What would Dave do if he wasn't stressed out. Change the perspective. I'm now outside myself, am an observer of myself. Often I have no trouble writing down a few things. Then I do one of those things. If it works, I get into it, and an hour or two later I forgot why I was stressed.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1414945524101287938&quot;&gt;tweet about GitHub&lt;/a&gt; yesterday got a fair amount of attention. I'm glad, because the idea is powerful and works. Further if GitHub/Microsoft made this a business priority, it could be streamlined for end-users, and be a revenue source, and an incredible developer platform, beyond what it already does. I would love to begin a conversation with MS, privately if they want, to figure out what's possible here.</description>

			<description>I've been reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Malcolm-Told-Alex-Haley/dp/0345350685&quot;&gt;Autobiography of Malcolm X&lt;/a&gt;, and it's transformative for me. He's talking about whiteness from the point of view of a black man of my parents' generation. I can't agree with some of what he says, he's talking nasty shit about my people, and it's as oppressive as anything anyone says about blacks, even the stuff he quotes. Don't respond to oppression with more oppression. But overriding that is the bigger point, that the United States has been destroying the lives of black people since inception. I just spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&quot;&gt;18 minutes&lt;/a&gt; with the flipside of Malcolm X, a white academic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://documentarystudies.duke.edu/people/john-biewen&quot;&gt;John Biewen&lt;/a&gt;, explaining what it means to be white, in the same context as that which X describes, but from from the other side of the relationship. I think if you watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIZDtqWX6Fk&amp;t=1095s&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, it'll be the most transformative 18 minute video experience you've had in a long time.</description>

			<description>Good morning sports fans! The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbariver.com/&quot;&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; finals resume tonight, I'm actually going to miss basketball when it's over. But then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Summer_Olympics&quot;&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt; start, and after that my attention will finally turn to the Mets. I've got the rest of the year planned out. But the weather. Oy does it suck. I know there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/07/none-of-the-old-rules-still-apply-when-the-driest-city-in-the-us-faces-a-catastrophic-drought/&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1013446314/amid-a-mega-drought-a-water-shortage-will-be-declared-along-the-colorado-river&quot;&gt;droughts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html&quot;&gt;heat domes&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere, but here we're living in a constant state of deluge. I take my bike ride every day, rain or shine. I used to skip rainy days but this summer that's not an option because it rains every damned day, and not just drizzle, hours of downpour. And the thunder last night. Who could sleep through that. Not this sports fan. I just want some beautiful warm summer weather. On the other hand the new rose bush I planted really seems to like all the wetness.</description>

			<description>Toaster ovens are now called &quot;air fryers.&quot; That's weird, but I just bought one, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0AWSJX?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&quot;&gt;Cuisinart&lt;/a&gt;, as recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-fryer/&quot;&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;. I love it. I've been using it every night, and my eating has become more healthy, and also much tastier. Total win.</description>

			<description>Something very scary just happened. There's a bug in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; that it sometimes updates the wrong outline when an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;I/O&lt;/a&gt; update comes in. This can result in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=sarcasm&quot;&gt;hilarity&lt;/a&gt; when somehow the updates overwrite the file for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems there is no backup. It's a bug. And bugs hurt! I looked everywhere and kicked myself virtually for not maintaining a backup of this vital file. Every time I publish there should be a copy preserved. Well, it turns out that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; happening. I post the outline to the instantOutlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/outlines/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the power and elegance of GitHub, there's a snapshot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main/outlines/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;every update&lt;/a&gt;, going back to when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commits/main?after=8131158da2d286bb63af971a89c286e1e6f6c217+349&amp;branch=main&amp;path%5B%5D=outlines&amp;path%5B%5D=scripting.opml&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/845ff95bfb4be0f23decf8293c87bd1265f2e6a3#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/commit/3786362d531109220bafe8f62b9689692f03f92b#diff-89806a2beb32ade7fba211d2a60aa14df918ef736850ccfc08a615de0a7bfefc&quot;&gt;June 17&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>We're finding that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; people and I have the same values re software and users. In yesterday's Twitter thread, they asked what would be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1414588756389023744&quot;&gt;perfect storage system&lt;/a&gt;. I said: &quot;my answer, for now, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;. But it isn't perfect, it's what we can do now that meets the criteria for now and the near future (the vision, the direction I want to go in). I think we share that. We want users to be as independent as possible, and to empower all levels of technical interest. I don't want the responsibility of keeping the world's ideas online. I want that distributed with rock-solid interop.&quot; I think that's about as concise a definition of why I do things the way I do them. As I was sure they would, the Logseq folk agreed.</description>

			<description>The best approach to solving our problems is to spread the gospel of journalism, to everyone who wants to learn. Teach elementary school students.

			<title>How my apps do storage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a technical post, written in response to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1414472093589114880&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from Logseq. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/api.js&quot;&gt;the API&lt;/a&gt; I use to access my storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The names begin with &quot;tw&quot; because I use Twitter for identity, so initially thought of these as twitter ops.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you scroll to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/api.js#L1195&quot;&gt;bottom of the file&lt;/a&gt; you'll see a &lt;i&gt;nodeStorageApp&lt;/i&gt; function which is how my apps are organized to access the storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first implementation was in 2014, it was an NPM package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I came up with a smaller, more streamlined package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/appServer&quot;&gt;daveAppServer&lt;/a&gt; that I've been using for all my latest projects. Key point -- it supports the same API as nodeStorage. I like to do things that way. It's also a proof of concept that it's possible to put another server behind the API. This will probably be necessary at some point to augment or replace Twitter as the identity system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm very much thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/07/09/142855.html?title=drummerForPoets&quot;&gt;Drummer for Poets&lt;/a&gt; where not-very-technical users can run their own servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted you to know how I do storage. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
