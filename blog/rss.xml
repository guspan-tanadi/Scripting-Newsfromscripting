			<description>It would be great if Merrick Garland got the same media team that did the Jan 6 hearings to work on making the case of Trump's criminality to the public. That's really where the trial will take place, where the future of the country will be decided.</description>

			<title>Carnegie Hall vs Central Park</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I prefer to write on the open web rather than on Facebook is that if I get an Aha! idea about a feature, on my blog I can implement it. On Facebook I'm just a user. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was/is one of the great things about the web. Anyone can develop features for it. On Facebook, just their employees can. No wonder it never moves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When a company dominates an activity, they tend to invest elsewhere. Seems kind of perverse, but that's why markets don't always evolve to fill every niche. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to perform a new style of music in Central Park, you can. If you want to do it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Hall&quot;&gt;Carnegie Hall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Center&quot;&gt;Lincoln Center&lt;/a&gt;, you need to get the approval of a lot of rich people&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The idea of putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; into the world of the browser was a mistake. The world of news is another world altogether. The web tried, in every way to turn RSS into the web. And it was very unsatisfying for a reason, the web was designed for documents. Things that have lasting value. The news is different. It's ephemeral. You want to keep a record of it for sure, but yesterday's news has no value as news, because it's not new. It's like the difference between music and podcasts. Music you may want to listen to many times, to cherish, to attach memories to, if it's good enough, over your whole life. A podcast is one and done. Pfffft. Off to the bit bucket. It's value is over as soon as the next episode is out.</description>

Engelbart thought augmenting human intellect was his real life's work. I know because 1. he told me and 2. same with me. Augmenting human intellect sounds spacy, something only a genius could understand, which is why it's not a good term for something that's pretty simple. Using an outliner to take notes and manage a project is an example of the computer augmenting your intellect. Doing something for you that you are not as good at as a computer is. Using a spreadsheet to augment human intellect could mean doing what-if analysis on a projected balance sheet. Sharing a recipe on Facebook with a group of friends is another example. Remember, Engelbart was talking about this long before there were computers outside of research labs. What seems kind of obvious today was anything but obvious then.</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Away&quot;&gt;Breaking Away&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. First time. The idealistic teen bike rider who worshipped Italian cyclists learns that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJETB-MfpnQ&quot;&gt;everyone cheats&lt;/a&gt;. A hard lesson, one that I never learned, and keep bumping up against. Maybe bumping is too mild a word. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Yet another promising tech that is going to be fought over like social media before it, and web browsers before that and PC operating systems before that. Winner take all and users be damned. It's not too late to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; a rare exception, where no company can lock their users in, and keep them from switching, where every product has to do everything and therefore does nothing well, and no one has the incentive to make their products better and their users more powerful thinkers. As an elder of this industry, I can't stand by and say nothing, not that I could when I was just a young whippersnapper. For whatever reason I insist on my products being open to competition, and that makes it harder to win, and so be it. That's the way it should be! ;-)</description>

			<source:outline text="Reviewing the agenda for an upcoming Future of Thinking conference I realize -- if this really is the future -- we lost. Yet another promising tech that is going to be fought over like social media before it, and web browsers before that and PC operating systems before that. Winner take all and users be damned. It's not too late to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; a rare exception, where no company can lock their users in, and keep them from switching, where every product has to do everything and therefore does nothing well, and no one has the incentive to make their products better and their users more powerful thinkers. As an elder of this industry, I can't stand by and say nothing, not that I could when I was just a young whippersnapper. For whatever reason I insist on my products being open to competition, and that makes it harder to win, and so be it. That's the way it should be! ;-)" created="Mon, 08 Aug 2022 12:34:47 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/29/instantPot.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/08.html#a123447"/>

			<description>I usually exercise in the afternoon, but it's been so hot, so I did my Peloton ride first thing this morning. Then swimming, a nice breakfast with a tall glass of delicious ice coffee. The sense of well-being is overwhelming. I used to have this feeling all the time after working out when I was younger. Now it's harder to get there. It's nice to see if I do everything well, I can still do it.</description>

			<title>We should write a book</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should write a book on bug reports. There's so much to say. A case study. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A user is testing a fresh new feature. Released seconds before. He tries it out on his iPad and gets a blank screen. Tries it on his desktop machine, it works. He concludes there's an incompatibility with iPads and reports it as such, in great detail with screen shots. He follows the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/12/165429.html?title=howToAskForHelpWithSoftware&quot;&gt;1. 2. 3. format&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as the developer reads the report, right from the start, he's pretty sure that the user's theory is incorrect, that it has nothing to do with an incompatibility with iPads. He has strong reasons to believe this, because: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The new feature reuses already tested display code, there was nothing new there in this release. Almost all browser incompatibilities are display problems. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He had just seen the same behavior on his own machine, and the problem was that he hadn't done a hard reload, so some code files updated, others didn't. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The developer would like to know if there are any error messagess in the JavaScript console, being 99 percent sure there are. The user's report didn't include any info on this. They error messages are in the software for a reason, to help figure out what went wrong, to take the load off the user and the developer. To make these puzzles resolve faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're not in  a good place, because the developer is going to have to first convince the user to look elsewhere first, and users like everyone else, don't like to be told they're wrong. That's why we have to slow down. Don't rush to write a bug report. At least try it again, to be sure it reproduces. Think about what else can go wrong.Like it or not, the user has to participate in the debugging process, if they want the problem resolved reasonably efficiently in time, for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best bug reports are short. A bug report and lab notes are different things. By digesting your report into simple statements of fact, you get to challenge your own assumptions and might cause you to change your thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to think about it as likely your problem, not the software's because in my experience that's what's usually going on. In almost 50 years of being a programmer only once did I find a bug in a compiler, yet in my early years, I often stopped looking because I thought I had, only to find the bug later, in my own code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a weird thing, of the five boroughs of NYC, the oddball is Queens, where each neighborhood was once a town, and they kept it that way even when they all became part of Queens. So my parents' address was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens&quot;&gt;Flushing, NY&lt;/a&gt; -- not Queens, NY as it would have been if we were in Brooklyn, The Bronx or Staten Island (actually not sure about Staten Island, it's the forgotten borough, more part of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy than the greatest city in the world). Manhattan is the other weird case for a different reason. You send your mail to Manhattanites to New York, NY -- in other words fuck the other boroughs, Manhattan is the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; New York. In a city that's known for its self-centered arrogance, Manhattanites take it to the next level. Not only don't they acknowledge that the rest of the country exists, they don't even credit their fellow NYers.

			<description>A reader thanked me for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html#a141224&quot;&gt;tip&lt;/a&gt; about Olbermann. &quot;With Maddow only one day a week, it's nice to know there is still a good, daily source of my kind of Snark and News available.&quot; My response: You're very welcome. But I think when you listen to Olbermann you'll realize as I did that Maddow wasn't cutting it. She stepped back because she lost her edge, she must've known it. I also think the MSNBC management must have been forcing her to not say the whole truth. Olbermann for now at least is unchained. But his show is owned by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia&quot;&gt;big corporation&lt;/a&gt; so he'll probably eventually go stale too. But for now -- he's got it.</description>

There's more to the history of the Civil War as he tells it. What the Confederacy did by seceding from the Union was quite similar to the January 6 attempted coup, but after the Civil War, we (ie the United States) made the same mistake the Bidens are making. They wanted to bring the Confederates themselves back into the country. So really it was no surprise that slavery continued, it was just a bit more complicated. When we prevail this time, when Trump is dead and gone, and his successors are a bit easier to shame, we must have a purging. With force. No more trying to love the rebels back into the country. Deport them any place that will have them. Offer them to Russia or Hungary. You want em? We don't. If not, build huge prison camps in remote parts of America. Life sentences with no parole. These people should not feel after all is said and done that they are part of America. They didn't love it, they left it, tried to destroy it, they do not get to come back and enjoy the benefits of living in a free society. It's their turn to really feel the pain.</description>

When we prevail this time, when Trump is dead and gone, and his successors are a bit easier to shame, we must have a purging. With force. No more trying to love the rebels back into the country. Deport them any place that will have them. Offer them to Russia or Hungary. You want em? We don't. If not, build huge prison camps in remote parts of America. Life sentences with no parole. These people should not feel after all is said and done that they are part of America. They didn't love it, they left it, tried to destroy it, they do not get to come back and enjoy the benefits of living in a free society. It's their turn to really feel the pain." created="Fri, 05 Aug 2022 14:12:24 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/05/loxBagel.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html#a141224"/>

			<description>What made me think of this was a random experience while waiting for my order this morning at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utopiabagelsny.com/&quot;&gt;Utopia Bagels&lt;/a&gt; in Whitestone, NY. It's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Queens,+NY+11358/Utopia+Bagels,+Utopia+Parkway,+Queens,+NY/@40.7747863,-73.7984347,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a61da3d0acd:0xe857931aa5334a2a!2m2!1d-73.7937332!2d40.7802255!3e1&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; I grew up in. The people behind the counter looked nothing like the people I grew up with, coming from the current working population of Queens, one of the most diverse places in the world. The night before I had gone to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/edwin-diaz-gets-6-out-save-as-mets-beat-braves&quot;&gt;Mets beat the Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;. This year's Mets are unusually competent. Anyway there was a man there, in the crowded bagel store, probably in his early 80s, wearing a rent-a-cop uniform. I thought he was one of the few people remaining from my time there. He looked like a drinker and smoker. He could have been one of my childhood friends' fathers. He picked me out and asked if I knew what he thought. I said nothing. He said &quot;America matters, that's all.&quot; I mumbled quietly well we can agree to disagree. After that I avoided him, looked around, he and I were among the oldest people there. This, I thought, is the new Queens, we are part of the old (and I am long-gone, just back for the Mets game and the bagels). On the way out, on an impulse, I tapped his shoulder and said in a voice that I was sure he could hear, but not too loudly -- Black lives matter. I don't know why I said it, it probably only meant pain for this man. He is a human vestige. So old and obviously tired, but he still had to do a job probably no one else wanted. I think what he was really saying to me was hey brother, you look a bit like me, maybe we agree us white people matter. But he couldn't say it that plainly.</description>

			<description>I got a Lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel at Utopia Bagels and ate it on the drive home. It was heaven. I will remember that bagel as long as I live. Also the store gets its name from the street it's on, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway_(Queens)&quot;&gt;Utopia Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. It's just an avenue, not a major thoroughfare, not what in NY you'd call a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkway&quot;&gt;parkway&lt;/a&gt;. It winds north-south through this part of Queens. I always felt privileged to live near Utopia. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway_(Queens)#History_and_naming&quot;&gt;Wikipedia says&lt;/a&gt; where the name came from, an attempt to create a utopian community in Queens. There's no mention of Utopia Bagels in the Wikipedia article, but there should be. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I think Twitter, with Musk largely history, can become a stronger company than they've ever been. The way forward imho is to focus on the platform, so lots of apps can be made to run on it, not just one way to use its capabilities. Lots of user experiences. That's something none of the other social media platforms have let happen. Amazingly in 2022, while there are standards for images, movies -- everything but simple documents, with titles, unlimited length, simple styling, links and enclosures. That's where I'd like to see Twitter be the leader. Be the world-scale distribution system for simple text documents.  Lead by filling the void. No standards bodies. PS: I bought a small amount of TWTR stock a few years back and continue to hold it. PPS: I basically wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html#4&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt; for the Apple of 1996.</description>

			<title>Supercharger visit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I went to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;Tesla supercharger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought I could make it home with 6% to spare, but my Tesla insisted that I should play it safe and get a charge at the charger in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;bounds=41.866847319736465%2C-73.89163051440431%2C41.62811734881771%2C-74.28198848559572&amp;zoom=12&amp;filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop%2Cparty&amp;search=New%20Paltz%2C%20NY%2012561%2C%20USA&quot;&gt;New Paltz, NY&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out it was at a place I knew well, the Plaza Diner. When I was 17 I hitchhiked up to New Paltz every Friday that summer and often would end up there on my way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/05/plazaDiner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Plaza Diner, New Paltz, NY.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was amazed at how fast their charger runs. It almost felt like filling up a gas-powered car. I was also impressed that there was &lt;i&gt;nowhere to piss. &lt;/i&gt;How can you have a place like this with no way for a human to evacuate while the car fills up. I was tempted to just do it, but I held on and waited till I got home.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am generally critical of the substance and format of cable news, but — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bezgeMocFPU&amp;t=270s&quot;&gt;opening segment&lt;/a&gt; on Joy Reid’s show last night about women and abortion after Kansas was outstanding, deep, emotionally evocative, inspiring. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization&quot;&gt;Dobbs decision&lt;/a&gt;, however awful, enslaving and life-endangering of American citizens, has a silver lining. It can stir us to act in care of each other, across all supposed divisions, find the American within each of us. We are still unitable if you push us hard enough.</description>

			<description>If the Democrats enjoyed politics even a &lt;i&gt;little,&lt;/i&gt; we would be experiencing a huge wave of euphoria right now.

At first I couldn't think why that was wrong, but I just went down to the car (a Model Y) to set it up to work with the new Pixel 6 Pro I got yesterday, and remembered. When you're playing music on a phone in a Tesla, you have to use the UI of the phone to control the music. With CarPlay it's integrated with the display of the car, and it's simplified to be like a car control. And it's easy to switch apps, again using the UI of the CarPlay software, integrated into the car. It's so dangerous to do the same with the Tesla system that &lt;i&gt;I never do it unless the car is stopped.&lt;/i&gt; The difference is integration. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/03/141929.html?title=teslasMissingAppEcosystem&quot;&gt;wrote about this&lt;/a&gt; when I was first transitioning from CarPlay to Telsa, and it's a serious problem for Tesla that they don't have an app &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_ecosystem&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, and unless they do a deal with Apple and Google, they probably aren't going to have one. It's no small thing to build one of those, they might have done it when they had the electric car business to themselves, but that's already past.</description>

All the apps begin with Google followed by three dots. Hmm. Which one plays music? I can't tell. Didn't they user-test this stuff at all??

			<title>Software is like a building</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent ten years living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in that time, five huge skyscrapers went up within a few blocks of where I lived. All of them residential, all of them of record-breaking height for residential buildings in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They started as huge holes in the ground, then pilings were driven deep into the earth, and concrete poured to form a foundation. Then the steel frame was attached to the pilings and it started to rise, and floor after floor of steel were built on top of the previous floors. As the building rose, crews came in to put up the inner walls of the building, water pipes, electric lines, sewer, the elevators, phone lines, internet, the inner walls, and then they put up an exterior, and glass in the windows, and while they were adding new steel beams on the (say) 50th floor, you could actually see people in the lobby of the building. It was a holy mess, with construction crews everywhere, just a complete mess, even so you could see clearly the outlines of something familiar coming together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they kept building until the building was topped off, and all the various crews kept doing their jobs. There were no elevators above the 10th floor, everything still had to get to the top with a huge crane that was itself an engineering marvel. While all this was going on there were some demo units on the 5th floor and a rental office, all furnished, and one working elevator that was beautifully clean and functional, giving the &lt;i&gt;impression&lt;/i&gt; that the building was ready to be occupied, but the truth was that it was still a long way from being done. But it could be used, in a way, for its intended purpose, people could imagine using it to sleep, eat, work, play -- all the things an apartment building could be used for, but it's not yet an apartment building, it's a construction site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Building a big piece of software is a lot like this, The construction company wants to know if you were killed by a random piece of metal being hauled up in a crane, but if you say that the buttons on one of the floors in the elevator actually closed the door when they were meant to open the door, they thank you for the report, but they weren't listening. They have a big job still ahead of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

All of them residential, all of them of record-breaking height for residential buildings in North America." created="Mon, 01 Aug 2022 21:21:55 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/01/212147.html?title=softwareIsLikeABuilding#a212155"/>
				<source:outline text="They started as huge holes in the ground, then pilings were driven deep into the earth, and concrete poured to form a foundation. Then the steel frame was attached to the pilings and it started to rise, and floor after floor of steel were built on top of the previous floors. As the building rose, crews came in to put up the inner walls of the building, water pipes, electric lines, sewer, the elevators, phone lines, internet, the inner walls, and then they put up an exterior, and glass in the windows, and while they were adding new steel beams on the (say) 50th floor, you could actually see people in the lobby of the building. It was a holy mess, with construction crews everywhere, just a complete mess, even so you could see clearly the outlines of something familiar coming together." created="Mon, 01 Aug 2022 21:22:35 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/01/212147.html?title=softwareIsLikeABuilding#a212235"/>
				<source:outline text="But they kept building until the building was topped off, and all the various crews kept doing their jobs. There were no elevators above the 10th floor, everything still had to get to the top with a huge crane that was itself an engineering marvel. While all this was going on there were some demo units on the 5th floor and a rental office, all furnished, and one working elevator that was beautifully clean and functional, giving the &lt;i&gt;impression&lt;/i&gt; that the building was ready to be occupied, but the truth was that it was still a long way from being done. But it could be used, in a way, for its intended purpose, people could imagine using it to sleep, eat, work, play -- all the things an apartment building could be used for, but it's not yet an apartment building, it's a construction site." created="Mon, 01 Aug 2022 21:24:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/01/212147.html?title=softwareIsLikeABuilding#a212419"/>
				<source:outline text="Building a big piece of software is a lot like this, The construction company wants to know if you were killed by a random piece of metal being hauled up in a crane, but if you say that the buttons on one of the floors in the elevator actually closed the door when they were meant to open the door, they thank you for the report, but they weren't listening. They have a big job still ahead of them." created="Mon, 01 Aug 2022 21:23:42 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/01/212147.html?title=softwareIsLikeABuilding#a212342"/>
