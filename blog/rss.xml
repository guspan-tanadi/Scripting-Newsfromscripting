			<description>Now that Clubhouse-like rooms are available in so many places, will Clubhouse itself develop text features to match? An opportunity to start from scratch, something simple and minimal, unlike the sprawling text trees of Twitter and Facebook. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586&quot;&gt;position&lt;/a&gt; open here imho.</description>

			<title>Father's Day</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I dislike all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hoopla&quot;&gt;hoopla&lt;/a&gt; about Father's Day since I don't have one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My father died in 2009. As they say &quot;after a long illness.&quot; Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I called the day he died &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/03/fathersDay.html&quot;&gt;Father's Day&lt;/a&gt;. From that moment on I could remember my father the way I wanted to, and try to remember that the things I didn't like were given to him by his father and his father's father, all the way back to the beginning, which in our case was probably a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtetl&quot;&gt;shtetl&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the Ukraine or Belarus or Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The one thing we bonded on was outliners. My father loved ThinkTank. He was a huge evangelist for it, as a college professor in NY, and a consultant to large businesses on marketing and management, he preached the gospel of seeing what you think. I now realize he wanted me to do, then, what I see now that I need to do. I wish he was alive today to use the tools we're creating now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He didn't understand what I was doing when I was developing it, but he loved it after it was done. This might give tech adventurers some hope. Your parents might not understand what you're doing today, but when it's ready to go, they might become believers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sports philosophy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I say the difference between the Mets and other baseball teams is that the Mets have philosophy. Their philosophy is to have a philosophy, which is this: it ain't about winning. The Yankees, the other NYC baseball team, expect to win every year, which doesn't work most years, because despite how good the Yankees are, there are 29 other teams and in most seasons the Yankees, like all but one team, are losers. Their philosophy is not adaptable. The Mets philosophy only has upside. In the infrequent years they win, well, that's a bonus, an extra goodie. Like some rice to go with your red beans. Like a pack of rolling papers to go with your ounce of weed. Winning for the Mets is a nice thing, soon forgotten, when you revert back to the long-term philosophy of playing baseball, not winning at playing baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Nets lose, and that's just fine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People who think sports are trivial haven't really thought it through, imho. Sports teach you how to think about things that are confusing in everyday life in clear terms with almost immediate outcomes. Sports is a training ground for strategic and philosophical intelligence.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the basketballl Nets were formed by players who cared not a whit about anything other than winning. They probably need to be reminded what team they're playing for (i.e. the Brooklyn Nets). Kyrie is playing for Team Durant, as is Harden and the others. Durant, who has already won championships, was bored, is a sour person, who on coming to NYC thought it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyknicksnews.com/kevin-durant-the-cool-thing-right-now-is-not-the-knicks/&quot;&gt;okay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2857179-nets-kevin-durant-says-the-cool-thing-right-now-is-not-the-knicks&quot;&gt;dis the team&lt;/a&gt; that everyone in NYC knows sucks horribly, epicly, a self-sabotaging monster of a basketball team that despite everything NY basketball fans love. Love. We love them KD. But we don't like it when players from Seattle, Oklahoma and &quot;Golden State&quot; (where ever that is) come to NY and tell us our team sucks. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; suck you asshole, and the only NYers who are going to root for your Nets are the ones who root for the Yankees. This Nets team was founded to win. Having lost, do they have any reason to exist? So today Knicks fans breathe a sigh of relief. There is a basketball god after all, and the Knicks still rule NY. When the Nets show some hubris, when they commit to a long-term relationship with NY basketball fans, then and only then will the deserve real NY fans, not the fake fairweather fans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This outcome, losing in the second round, was perfectly predictable. Maybe there should be a rule, once you win two championships you should retire, because from that point on there are no more thrills available to you, and like LeBron, destroyer of humble franchises in Miami and Cleveland (twice!) would do less damage if he just invested in VC-backed tech companies and forgot about bringing his sourness to basketball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sports teaches those of us who will never achieve the height of a Kevin Durant to appreciate what we have. This year the Knicks rose off the energy KD fed the team and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/13/124739.html?title=knicksClinchImEcstatic&quot;&gt;exceeded all expectations&lt;/a&gt;. Next year and the year after I'll root for the Knicks, god willing. But if they ever mortgage their future, as the Nets did, to get three vagabond superstars to try to win a title in one year, I'll be shaking my head and  will look for another hopeless cause to identify with until the Knicks come back to earth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think I've updated the home page of Scripting News a hundred times this morning trying to get five systems to work together. Interop is hard, at the first time you get things working, and as long as you don't &quot;fix&quot; things you hope it keeps working. Knock wood.</description>

			<description>Today's project is really twisty. I have an OPML file that should always show exactly what's on the blog, but in OPML. That's different from a realtime update, because it only updates when I publish. I don't necessarily like being watched while I edit. It could get weird. It would have been simple to put it on S3 and give it a scripting.com URL, but I wanted it to be on GitHub, so it would be transparent about how it got to the client. And then there's the notification server, that gets a webhook call from GitHub when the OPML file updates. But that's not enough! The client apps, which are browser-based, hook up to the notification server via websocket, which it found the address of in the &amp;lt;head&gt; section of the OPML file. It's all very simple for the client apps, which is the point, but there are a lot of moving parts to debug on my end of things.</description>

			<description>A few days ago I asked for an idea of what the term &quot;garden&quot; meant when applied to a software product. I had seen it used in conjunction with various Tools for Thought projects. I also saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/holden&quot;&gt;Mike Caulfield&lt;/a&gt; talk about it on Twitter. I wanted to understand what it means. After reading his &lt;a href=&quot;https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/&quot;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; on the garden and the stream, I think I get it. My garden is various product and technology sites, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. The product sites for &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;. There's even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.com/&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; for outliners of the 80s: ThinkTank, Ready! and MORE. And the stream? That's a blog! And podcasts, and RSS itself. OPML is more the language of the garden. These are useful words to apply to ideas we've been developing since the dawn of the web. It's good to have these words. I also thought of Chance the Gardener's idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgGvd1UPZ88&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_There&quot;&gt;Being There&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful comedy about how the world really works. Chance talks about tending his garden. People find great meaning in this, which is weird because he really is talking about his garden, not economics. It's a farce, a current-day, more thoughtful version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy&quot;&gt;Idiocracy&lt;/a&gt;, another great movie.</description>

			<description>I updated the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/&quot;&gt;OPML checklist&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/#1624040113000&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; explaining what OPML is, and how it came to be the interchange format for outlines. I also added a link to the Instant Outlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; which was released after the checklist. Keep the garden properly tended. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, thinking about Ward Cunningham's &lt;a href=&quot;http://makecommoningwork.fed.wiki/federated-wiki.html&quot;&gt;Federated Wiki&lt;/a&gt;  project, if it understood OPML and had an outliner built in, that would make a pretty great publishing platform. Even better than a built-in outliner, an API by which any outliner could plug in. I'd love to help with that. I love designing and supporting APIs. Ward and I talked about this in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html&quot;&gt;meetup in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. I'm about to ship a new outliner, so it's a fresh topic for me in 2021. Lots of talk about integrating the output of one outliner into another.</description>

			<description>We need something like the Lincoln Project — pointed, simple, hard-hitting advertising, with the aim of removing the insurrectionists from Congress, now, or at least in 2022. It’d  be fine if the LP people are involved, but they need Democrats and independents, not just Repubs.</description>

			<description>Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/thursday-17-june-2021/33980/&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; for the link to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://aeon.co/ideas/coding-is-not-fun-it-s-technically-and-ethically-complex&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/waltervannini?lang=en&quot;&gt;Walter Vannini&lt;/a&gt; that explains how coding is not &quot;fun.&quot; It's a good read.  One way to experience how much there is to &quot;coding&quot; (a terrible word for what devs do) have a look at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/demo/code.js&quot;&gt;completed piece of code&lt;/a&gt;, and see if you can make sense of it. Even someone who knows the language it's written in will have a hard time, unless it's written with readability in mind, and even then, not without a lot of head-scratching. It's not like anything else you've done, and if someone tells you it's fun and easy and interactive, please ask them if they have done it. The answer is no, because no one who has ever completed a piece of software that other people use would say it's anything other than a slog. The rewards can be great, don't get me wrong, but you have to invest a lot of yourself before you get them.</description>

			<description>NYT did something interesting: &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060848652&quot;&gt;Gift articles&lt;/a&gt;. Every subscriber, they say, can share up to 10 articles per month that don't count toward the number of free articles non-subscribers can read. I thought I was giving this a try earlier when I clicked the gift icon, but looking at the link it generated, there's nothing special about it. I'll try again. They don't say on the site when this feature was added, I just heard about it today. A quick news search turned up nothing.</description>

			<description>When is journalism going to start asking when the DOJ is going to charge Trump with insurrection? They seem to be stuck, for years, reporting what everyone knows. Trump tried to use the DOJ as if it were his personal lawyer. He didn't accept the results of the election. Had no respect for democracy. We saw and heard the speech he made to the people who would go on to invade the Capitol, there's the smoking gun folks. You can stop looking for it. We keep letting Trump slide, and it keeps getting worse. Unless journalism decides it's time to start asking the obvious question, we're going to stay stuck. The question, on the off chance it &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; obvious is this -- when are you going to make Trump pay for his crimes against the country? Tax evasion is cute, we want to see him pay for trying to overthrow the government.</description>

We saw and heard the speech he made to the people who would go on to invade the Capitol, there's the smoking gun folks. You can stop looking for it. We keep letting Trump slide, and it keeps getting worse. Unless journalism decides it's time to start asking the obvious question, we're going to stay stuck. The question, on the off chance it &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; obvious is this -- when are you going to make Trump pay for his crimes against the country? Tax evasion is cute, we want to see him pay for trying to overthrow the government." created="Wed, 16 Jun 2021 13:35:47 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/16.html#a133547"/>

			<title>Dark mode Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed is that most of the new outliners are dark mode apps. White text on black background.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until recently it had never occurred to me that my outliner should have a dark mode too, so I've been working on that for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; in the last few days. Getting pretty close to having it working, then I have to go back and review everything to see if a bit of color here and there would be nice. I notice that other dark mode apps make use of color in an accenting way. I like that. You almost don't notice it until you look for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dark mode Drummer &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/16/drummerScreen2.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me just say CSS is the most awkward possible way to do this kind of programming. I yearn for QuickDraw, the UI tech we used in the 80s on the Mac. Everything was straightforward and done in a real programming language as opposed to CSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeremyzilar?lang=en&quot;&gt;Jeremy Zilar&lt;/a&gt; turns off the router at his family house at 5PM. At first my mind rebelled. I remember growing up in a world with no internet at all. I was part of the bootstrap that we now live in with internet 24 by 7. Internet-connected everything. But then I realized if say President Biden ordered that the internet be turned off in everyone’s home every night at 9PM,  for even just one hour,  it might  be  enough to wake us from our collective stupor.</description>

			<title>Do it for the users</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the 00s we had a series of conferences called BloggerCon.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of new things about this series, one of them was they were user conferences. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies could sponsor if they wanted, but they didn't get anything in return other than thanks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't get any sponsors for the first one, but after that, sponsors saw that the thanks was worth enough to want to help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to be a user conference? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It means that the interests we rep are those of the users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you had a users conference for journalism, the journalists could come, and they could speak, but only as users of news. They couldn't talk about problems they have being journalists, which is 100 percent of what happens at journalism conferences. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There needs to be room for the users, somewhere, to get together and decide what they want from the tech. Not to be told what they want by an industry that is a bit short on vision, esp positive visions for users.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today opportunity is opening up that I hoped would happen in the 90s when I tried to push the idea of using outliners to build web structures, starting with blogs. Something that smart users understand, techies aren't impressed, but people who think really are turned on by the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We called the company UserLand, the one that made the outliner that could build websites. When we had a decision to make about products, the first people we thought of were the users. How could a company called UserLand do otherwise? :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I want to say to the users, now, is this -- don't let yourself be locked in to one vendor. Let's not repeat the mistakes of Facebook, Twitter, Medium, Substack, etc. These companies provide a free service, and in return you get to be the product. Let's hold out for something better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The economics of software today are such that you can get a lot of value for virtually no money. The cost of production is zero, and servers cost virtually nothing to run (you can find services that give you free servers, not sure why, but it's a good deal, because you're free to move to other services). I pay for my servers, I use Digital Ocean, they provide a good service, and the prices are amazing. For less than I pay for cable TV, I get seven really good Unix servers that run all my stuff. I would have killed for that kind of deal just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today we're in technology heaven, made into a hellish place by bad ideas from tech. You should always be able to move to another service. If you find that's not possible get out before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's build this layer of the internet right, based on what we learned from the mistakes of the past. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;Instant Outlines&lt;/a&gt; toolkit. Over the last few days I've been tweeting and blogging like a fool about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines#simple-use-case&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; importing and exporting outlines from one app to another isn't enough. We can do much better. In the background I was working on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines&quot;&gt;new toolkit&lt;/a&gt; for developers who want to be part of a network of outline producer and consumer apps based on OPML and web sockets. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/demo/code.js&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; of course, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/instantoutlinesrepo/demo/&quot;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; to prove it works. All my outliners support the feature as well, it's the basis for sharing outlines. This is my vision for an open ecosystem based on outlining. It's a big part of what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;dreamt&lt;/a&gt; of when I started UserLand in 1988.</description>

			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/in-treatment&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; watching In Treatment, but season 3 is mostly cringe-worthy. The writing is awful, and the various plots are ridiculous, though Debra Winger is pretty great. It's a very simple concept, they must've gotten bored with it (?) and tried to turn it into some kind of mysterious love affair between patient and doctor and then doctor-as-patient. Also too many patients have miraculous turn-arounds, and it's not clear why. They seem to be charmed by Paul, but we know Paul ain't charming! Oy. I'm slogging through season 3 knowing there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/in-treatment-review-hbo-season-4-uzo-aduba.html&quot;&gt;new season&lt;/a&gt; already in progress, with a new shrink played by a familiar actor, and I want to watch it so I don't want to skip anything.</description>

			<description>Proof by induction. If a statement is true for 0, and if it being true for n implies it's true for n+1, then it's proven for all positive integers. When we let Dubya off for his sins, and when we didn't restructure the banking industry after the crash in 2008, we set the stage for it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/no-consequences-for-trump-garland-biden.html&quot;&gt;happen again&lt;/a&gt;, only worse. And Trump isn't done with us yet. He's the weird case of a former president who hasn't relinquished power. He hasn't learned how to use it yet, but he'll get more effective in his new role.</description>

			<description>This is important. In the conversations I've had recently with users and devs in the nascent Tools For Thought community, people talk in terms of importing and exporting outlines, but this emphatically is not good enough in 2021. We need a live connection. So when you hook your outline up to a rendering server,  the connection persists. When you make a change, the worker app on the server has the changes and is ready to re-render, without you doing anything. I can't manually import a file every time there's a change. Web sockets are built into all browsers, it's simple and standardized tech. Let's use it.  There's at least one public storage system, GitHub, that supports real time notification. Again, let's use it. Instead of going back to the beginning each time a new generation comes along, let's start with the work and knowhow of previous generations. I'm here to help.</description>

			<description>Long ago, when RSS was starting to boom, I was often surprised when a new product came out and I didn't hear about it until it was announced publicly. The one I remember best was FeedBurner. You'd think that they would want my endorsement, and to give them a chance to answer technical questions before the press started asking them. Maybe they had a developer story? Or maybe I could have helped with a design decision? At that time Scripting News was pretty well-read in the developer community. It always felt like they must have been hiding something, but if they were I never found it. Yes FeedBurner centralized a technology that was good because it was decentralized, but I don't think my saying that would have hurt them. What was even more strange is I had friends at the company, people from the blogging world and from other RSS devs.</description>

			<title>Is JSON better than XML? No.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been all around this one. I can and often do save both XML and JSON versions of RSS and OPML. Truth is almost no one uses the JSON versions. The reason is simple. If you already have support for the XML version, what's gained by adding support for JSON? And everyone has to support the XML version, because HTML, RSS and OPML are all out there &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; in the XML format, for all practical purposes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, to the supposed advantages of JSON over XML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JSON is supposedly more readable than XML, but if you look at what people actually put on the wire, it's not true. There are no rules about whitespace, tabs, newlines, spaces in either format. Developers save files without including whitespace, thinking this makes their apps more efficient, when any gain has to be miniscule, esp with compression. It's bad engineering not to try to make your data files readable, imho, but it's also the default practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JSON is supposed to be easier to process, but that also is not true. First you have to support the XML versions because that's what's out there. So even if it were monumentally more difficult, you can't avoid supporting XML formatted data in your code. Adding a second version makes your code more complex not simpler. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If your development runtime doesn't have a package to serialize and deserialize XML as easily as JSON.parse and JSON.stringify, then do a good deed for your fellow developers, write it and release it as open source. That's a simpler and more ecologically sound way of alleviating any angst about XML. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The old famous programming adage applies -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:If_it_ain%27t_broke,_don%27t_fix_it&quot;&gt;if it ain't broke don't fix it&lt;/a&gt;. XML works. It doesn't matter to users if you use XML or JSON. If you want to make the world a friendlier place, use indentation and newlines in your data. Either XML or JSON can be readable if you put in a little effort. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fighting autocracy with marketing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Joe Trippi's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1523896927?i=1000525032434&quot;&gt;latest podcast&lt;/a&gt; focused me on realistic next steps fighting Republican autocracy. Here are my comments in a bulleted list. I wrote this quickly, so think of it as a memo, not a manifesto. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Joe, glad you're hooked up with the Lincoln Project people. They were doing well marketing against insurrection until the 2020 election.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The task they set themselves up to do is done. They were trying to convince Repubs it was ok to vote for a Democrat. That was great for the 2020 election but it's a small part of the campaign that should be running now.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They (or someone) must be ready to position the next huge insurrection event, with online advertising, in real time as it's happening, and in the immediate aftermath. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If such an operation were in existence on Jan 6, we wouldn't have had to wait for the DOJ to tell us what happened (they never have). Now, no amount of marketing will change that the events of Jan 6 are fuzzy and uncertain in our minds, even though in fact they aren't. No one focused our minds on the criminality of the president. We've never gotten an account of what the president was doing during the insurrection, yet the new administration must have that information? Why are we not running ads demanding that the information be released. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So we remain confused, no one has taken charge of communicating about that event. That's how the human mind works. It's why when Barr lied about the Mueller Report his spin stuck, even though later we knew he was lying. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The question the new Lincoln Project should always be raising: &quot;Why is this traitor still in Congress? Repeat that theme over and over. Point the finger at the traitors, make them pay a political price for their insurrection. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When one of them does something really insidious, demand that they be removed from Congress right now. Put the question into the reports in NYT, WP, CNN, MSNBC, et al.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jan 6 was not the last act of insurrection. Any day now there will be another. We must be ready to communicate about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If such a marketing channel existed, ordinary people like me will be able to do something instead of sitting around worrying and thinking no one will hear me so why bother. Our contribution will be in dollars to run ads, and feet marching in protest. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Marketers are in a position to do a lot of good. I think Lincoln Project should change their name and add Dems and independents to the project. It can't just be former Republicans at this point. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;From now on campaigns &lt;i&gt;never shut down.&lt;/i&gt; Tattoo that on your forehead. It's a mistake we're still making and it must stop. The need to communicate about events is persistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Blogging from an outliner</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to blog from an outliner, I suggest the first step is to get the outline data to flow out of your editing tool in OPML, and then write your publishing software to build the blog from the OPML.

			<description>Joe Trippi did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1523896927?i=1000525032434&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/08.html#a152650&quot;&gt;my podcast&lt;/a&gt;. This time I listened all the way through. I like that Joe is open to other points of view. This is an important time for that. I'm also glad he's talking with the Lincoln Project. I'm going to think about this for a bit and then respond.</description>

			<description>I have a two-monitor Mac. Sometimes when I move my mouse in the Dock at the bottom of my main monitor, it moves to the bottom of the other monitor. All of a sudden I have to stop, launch the  Preferences app, open the Dock panel, click the Right button then the Bottom button, and now the Dock is back where it belongs. It seems the problem could be easily solved by putting a Lock icon on the Dock tab, as they have on other panels. I can't imagine why they thought a mouse gesture should do something so radical as move the Dock.</description>

			<description>I'm putting together a new hub for Instant Outline notifications using GitHub as the intermediary. Today is a docs-writing day. The code is working, knock wood, praise Murphy, etc. Doing some searches I found an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/opmlHowto/dave/editorOpmlOrg/instantOutlineTool.html&quot;&gt;Instant Outline tool&lt;/a&gt; I did in 2009, using FriendFeed in roughly the same manner I'm using Twitter and GitHub this time. Let's hope this time it gains traction. I've been waiting for people to play with on this stuff, this is one of those things you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; do on your own.</description>
