			<description>I was talking with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+dave+jacobs&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; last night and we got around to what should be done with &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;. The only thing to do when a tech company gets too big, is to force them to unbundle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling&quot;&gt;Bundling&lt;/a&gt; is how their size becomes a problem for us. So, for example, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; owning the dominant search engine and the dominant browser means they're inevitably going to turn the web into a perfect way to continue to own search. That's all that's going to matter to them. But the web has more to do. Google doesn't care. Facebook has also been successful at strangling the open web, forcing all writing on the net to flow through them. Or at least keeping it from flowing outside of them. If Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/18/1269.html&quot;&gt;fat ass&lt;/a&gt; wasn't squatting over the web, there would be a lot more movement. That might not solve the problem of Nazis ruining the world, but at least it gives the rest of us a chance to organize and solve the other vexing problems we have to deal with. RIght now all we're tasked with doing is making Zuck even richer, and even Zuck must be bored with that by now. The task for FB is to make it easy for the rest of us to run our own FB's and stay in touch with the people who use his FB. That's what happens when you get as big as they are. And it's far from an unsolvable problem. In fact they already have all the software written.</description>

			<description>One of the saddest things I've ever heard is Jeremy Lin saying &quot;I think the NBA has given up on me.&quot; I would say to him, they had reasons to give up on you when you were 18 and every year since then. That's the way the world works. Assholes climb the ladder, and then think they can stop listening.</description>

			<title>All those windows on the 4 train</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An asshole NYT columnist once asked if I was too old to understand the latest technology. I was so offended, I didn't think to just answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The answer is unknowable. I think I understand a lot about tech, because I've spent my entire professional life trying to. I also have created some of the technology that young people feel so proud of understanding better than older people. I think I understand podcasting, for example, as well as any young-un.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once when I was a kid, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/The+Bronx+High+School+of+Science,+75+W+205th+St,+Bronx,+NY+10468/@40.8102893,-73.9598169,12z/data=!4m17!4m16!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f39fba19f047:0x456fa7ab9f9bae18!2m2!1d-73.8914555!2d40.8779882!2m1!5e1!3e3!5i1&quot;&gt;commuting&lt;/a&gt; to high school in the Bronx from Queens, I was struck by all the apartment houses whose windows faced &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(New_York_City_Subway_service)&quot;&gt;the 4 train&lt;/a&gt;. Mile after mile. Countless windows facing the train. And behind them more buildings and more windows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Behind every window was a family, with all their challenges, accomplishments, pride, love, beliefs, bad habits, histories, everything. It gave me an idea, how could you possibly think you understand all that's going on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, 50 years later, I think the thing is to be open to learning from other people's experiences, and don't presume you understand anything better than anyone else, because when you do that, you close yourself off to learning from them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would say to that NYT asshole that it's the disease of your profession to think you don't have to listen anymore. It's also the disease of programmers, doctors, professors, everyone who gets somewhere in life, to think they've arrived at the top and they have a full understanding of everything they need to understand. That asshole could learn a lot from an asshole like me. All those years, he didn't. And that's not just his problem, because so many people listen to him, it's our problem too. Because he's not as informed imho as he could be. .&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why we use Twitter identity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email last night that said the person felt I had been hypocritical in using Twitter for identity for Drummer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I don't think I was hypocritical. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use Twitter for identity because they have a nice API that scales, and they have kept it open for this kind of use for many years. In all that time, they didn't change their mind because of new management, didn't deprecate anything, it just keeps running reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Are you sharing some information with Twitter? Yes, a little, but not as much as you might think. They certainly never see your outlines. They don't know how many times you log in, that information doesn't pass through to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We don't keep any information on that ourselves. I don't care. I'm not in any business at all, and certainly not in the business of knowing how much you do whatever you do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They don't know your location, btw -- if they know a location, it's the location of the server, which is at Digital Ocean. I'm not even sure where they keep their servers. That information it seems to me is of no value.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want them to know &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; about you -- just create a fake account for this purpose.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also I want to build features around Twitter. It's a fact of life. It's there. It ain't going anywhere. If I chose not to use it for identity it wouldn't hurt them one bit. I'd have to write an identity server myself and I already have plenty of things to do trying to keep Drummer users happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Net-net -- I don't see a problem here. 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/12/quote.png&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of what I wrote for The Future of Text, kind of says it all, everything I've discovered and built on in my career. I guess it's the answer to the question: &quot;What's possible with computers that most people don't know about.&quot; They posted this in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheFutureofText/status/1447969903571505161/photo/3&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; at the same time I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1447971032053293066&quot;&gt;posting one&lt;/a&gt; about how we fixed the big problem with JavaScript in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. I love JavaScript because it's the closest thing we have to a universal language. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; to thank for that (no sarcasm!).

It's not hard to factor all that out. Every other language does it. There is absolutely no reason JavaScript has to leave all that mess visible to the programmer who wants it hidden.

I want to write straight-line code and let the runtime handle the synchronization. That's worth trading off some speed for, but I don't see why it should require that. And it's the way comptuers are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to work, imho. If I didn't say anything most devs probably wouldn't even notice it's there, they still might not, that's how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation&quot;&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; it feels. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A frequently asked question -- where is &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and how much does it cost? Hopefully the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; answers the first question. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; answers the second. &quot;You can use Drummer at no cost.&quot; Further: &quot;Much of the software is open source.&quot; Why is it so inexpensive and will it always be that way? I don't have big plans to take over the universe. I just want to make sure that outlining, web scripting and easy, fluid blogging are not lost arts. I have been very lucky in my career, so at this point, money, at least the kind of money it takes to operate Drummer, is not an issue. So let's have fun and see where it takes us! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

That link opens in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt;, even if you're not logged in, and updates when there are new features or fixes. I would be honored if you leave that outline open in Drummer while you do your work, that way I can instantly inform you of new stuff. The file's icon will turn to green when there's news. It's the best channel I've had as a developer to users of my product. We've been using it in the Drummer test community. It really works. Instantly updating outlines are called &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml&quot;&gt;instant outlines&lt;/a&gt;, btw.</description>

			<description>And now, we can start talking about Drummer in concrete terms. Finally. The first thing you should try in Drummer is to write a few blog posts. Follow the first part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;Blogging howto&lt;/a&gt;, do the Hello World post. Then write some more, about whatever you like. Learn how to write publicly in Drummer first, in other words. It's the best demo we have right now, today, in Oct 2021, of the power of outlines for public writing.</description>

			<description>Another note and then I'll wait till tomorrow. In this case the Docs are a big part of the product. Back in February, I decided this time, rather than leave the docs as an afterthought, or hire someone else to write them, I would do it myself. For a couple of reasons. This could be the last big product ship I do in my career. Docs were always treated as an afterthought. I want to try, just once, making it not an afterthought. To let the docs have enough time to become something I'm proud of, and something I can invest more time in, like the software, after we ship. Instead of staying away from them, I wanted to reach in, and do it up. As a result I've done enough writing for a book this year, you'll see it not only in the docs linked into the sidebar of the docs pages, but also in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.readUrl&quot;&gt;DocServer pages&lt;/a&gt; for each of the built-in scripting verbs. Lots and lots more to say.</description>

			<description>I'm shopping for a refrigerator. I've spent some time with various web interfaces, on Home Depot, Consumer Reports, Loew's, Best Buy, Amazon. They're all pretty bad, and could make a simple improvement that would completely eclipse the others. Here's the idea. I have a fixed space to put a fridge, and it's unusually narrow. I wish the designer of the house had left more space but it is what it is. Now, they make fridges in this shape, but they don't always have them in stock, esp now, when the supply chain is so disrupted. Here's the feature, it's a very Doc Searls-like thing, btw. I want to say hey Home Depot, this is the space I have. Let me know when you have a fridge I can buy that can be delivered within a couple of weeks. Instead they send me links to their website for refrigerators (at least they remembered that I'm shopping for one, so has Amazon) but they make me start over from scratch every time. That really sucks. Esp if they, at the moment, have a fridge that fits my very easy requirements. It would also be good for energy savings, because my current fridge is not running efficiently at all.</description>

			<title>The other side of Agile</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend and sometime collaborator Andrew Shell is part of a program to write 30 posts in 30 days. Yesterday he wrote a piece about his career, and I got an idea for him, that I initially posted in a comment on Facebook, but wanted to include here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Andrew -- i had an idea for you. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First imho it would be a shame to ignore all the experience you have with software, both as a developer and a user.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You could do something great by focusing on the interface between users and developers. A lot has been done about how programmers can be more effective when they listen to users (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt;), but as far as I know nothing about the other direction -- how users can learn to communicate more effectively with devs to get what they want and to influence the future.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a branch off what I keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1447084856962424832&quot;&gt;coming back to&lt;/a&gt; -- we don't teach how to write great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bug+reports&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;. It can be an incredible literary form, different from any other and they can be very human, because imho it's all about empathy. The user wants the dev to be empathetic with them, and the devs want empathy too, not just because it's more economical, but because it's because programmers are people too! A fact sometimes overlooked, perhaps. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, best of luck with your exploration Andrew.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, as far as I know Andrew is posting these ideas on FB and Twitter, as screen shots, but I don't see where they're posted on the web. If they are, I'll add a link here. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Maybe other devs can make software without users, but not me. I need the feedback. I imagine it's like being a musician playing on a stage with no audience. Two users, in particular, have made the greatest contribution, Anton Zuiker and Ken Smith. Neither are devs. Anton works at &lt;a href=&quot;http://antonzuiker.com/&quot;&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; as a research communication specialist. Ken is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://clas.iusb.edu/english/faculty/smith.html&quot;&gt;English professor&lt;/a&gt; at Indiana University. Both are bloggers, both are intelligent, persevere, and put up with my demands (ahem). I need good bug reports, and they are learning, and the bugs are being fixed, and some have been quite vexing, as I've rewritten major parts of Drummer. I know it's been frustrating at times for them. I hope this is just the start of a wonderful new community. I know a bunch of other people are using Drummer, but Ken and Anton have been most actively helping the developer and that's very much appreciated.</description>

			<description>BTW, Anton got on my case about a bug in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links tab&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News not updating often enough. He noticed this because the same thing was happening on his Drummer blog. This got me off my ass to fix the problem. So if you're a fan of the Links tab here, rejoice -- it works about a million percent better thanks to Anton. This is the power of users who actually care, and pitch in to help.</description>

			<description>It's a fitting moment to flip the switch, because &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; will open the doors for a new &lt;i&gt;fluid&lt;/i&gt; style of blogging, based on outlining. To create a post, you click the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/07/bigplusicon.png&quot;&gt;big plus icon&lt;/a&gt; and start typing. When you're ready to publish, choose a menu command. No more slogging your way through Wordpress menus or a static site generator. It all happens in a second or two. And making a change to your blog is as easy as making the change in your outline, and publishing -- again -- just one command and a couple of seconds. Welcome to the world where &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; meets publishing. Blogging at the speed of thought. Where nothing gets in your way.</description>

			<description>If we &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;, the damage to the US economy will be permanent. It won't just be a recession, because we eventually get out of recessions. Poverty will explode. This time the US really will become a third world country. And it won't just cause chaos in the US, it'll be world wide. The media should start explaining what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; is, how the US dollar is basically the only one, and what advantages it gives us (they're huge). Increasing the debt limit costs us nothing, not even money because we can print the currency we repay our debt with. All the Repub hype about economics is, like everything else they say, a lie. The US isn't a family on a budget, it's the foundation on which the world economy runs. Look at it this way, if your family could repay its debt by writing numbers on a piece of paper, would you worry about how much you owe? That a simple version of the reality for the US and our dollar.</description>

The tech industry organized the people around its values, which they were very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/people-at-obamas-tech-dinner-2011-2&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; about. The Dems could've done it. Any news org could have. I begged them to do it, publicly and privately. Everyone who's complaining now, news people and politicians, punted, had no idea what FB did was possible, didn't listen when they were told. If they wanted their values represented, they should have done it themselves. That's how this works.</description>

			<description>How about if we put together say $5 million offer to give to Sinema and Manchin if they vote for the big reconciliation package? If the bigco’s can bribe them, why not the people? It’ll end their careers of course, but at least they’ll have some money to soften the blow.</description>

Watching this video takes me back many years, to when we were young and full of hope and right in the middle of the whole thing. I had the same realization he had, that you can make the world conform to your ideas rather than the other way around. It may feel like things stay constant, but they're always changing. And the people who made the rules were no smarter or better than I am. I still hope to be able to pull a few more rabbits out of my hat.</description>

			<title>Facebook is us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rant! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The bullshit about Facebook keeps coming. It's not a fucking autocracy, it's a carrier. You could say everything you say about FB about a city like NY. All the companies selling cigarettes were once hq'd in NY. The mayor of NY must be a cancer criminal, right? Such idiots. The journalists have no sense of perspective on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;what Facebook is&lt;/a&gt;. It's hundreds the size of a city like NY. So much happens there. It's created mostly by the people who use it. It's what remains of all the great ideas of networking in the 90s and 00s. A ton of good stuff happens in FB, and a bunch of nasty shit, because -- because &lt;i&gt;Facebook is us&lt;/i&gt; -- it's human. Get a fucking grip pundits. You're making asses of yourselves. I tried watching CNN last night. All these people fighting for their own continued existence and to hide the depravity of journalism are desperate to blame FB for fear someone might blame them. I was expecting to see McNamee (longtime friend) on TV last night, thankfully maybe he's gotten a bit of perspective himself, and realizes it isn't &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; about Zuckerberg. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How to radically restructure &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Separate the users and the content from everything else.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now figure out what that means and we have a plan. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>So if Facebook is evil, why isn’t Apple evil too, because there couldn’t have been a Facebook without the iPhone. The answer is neither is evil. They're both big companies, no better or worse than companies in other industries.</description>

			<description>The tech industry was and is so much about self-promotion, selfishness, that there's no way for people who know the history, how we got here, to explain in that context, what Facebook is, beyond all the things the press says about them, and the distilled evil they represent. They are a product of tech, and there was some good in the foundations we built for them to use. And that good is in their product, whether or not they know it, or anyone believes it. It's still there. And if you use it, you must know that. We have the ability to share deep ideas here, not just screaming &quot;look at me&quot; -- maybe this is the time for tech to grow up, before the generation that built the foundation for FB is gone.</description>

			<title>Steve Jobs as Frank Lloyd Wright</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This piece was originally &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/06/myThoughtsOnSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on October 6, 2011, the day after &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/span&gt; died, ten years ago tomorrow. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, my little software &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; was lucky to be invited to work on Apple's new computer in development, the Macintosh. Back then Apple wasn't as secretive as it is today. Everyone knew something was coming. We knew what it was called, but no one was saying what it was.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gladly signed the agreement, and to this day I remember my first glimpse of the Mac. I arrived at a building on &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10460+Bandley+Drive,+cupertino,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.328093,-122.033772&amp;spn=0.034364,0.027509&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=10460+Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;vpsrc=6&quot;&gt;Bandley Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Cupertino some time in August 1983, and was met by Mike Boich and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/span&gt; from the Mac team. As we walked to the conference room, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a beige plastic box that was small and upright. And personal. How it said that to me, in just a glimpse, I have no idea. Is that a computer? Another thought popped into my head: It said &quot;I'm new.&quot; And that was something because back in those days everything was new. And it was personal, for me. All this from a fraction of a second look.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Before that I had been an Apple II developer for a number of years, and was a devotee of Apple's products, though I also loved IBM's PC. There was a sense that we were all creating a new world, we all loved our work -- and Jobs and the people he nurtured at Apple, were leaders. I was on stage during the rollout of the Mac at Flint Center on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/01/dayintech_0124&quot;&gt;January 24, 1984&lt;/a&gt;. We shipped our product later that year and went on to have one of the first hits for the Mac. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I want to tell a different story. Not a personal one, because I did not have a personal relationship with Steve Jobs. However, I built products that made it to market through his platforms. And in doing so, my vision was shaped by his. And later, with podcasting and RSS, I got to influence the direction of his products.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish Jobs had been a blogger, had written about his design process, so I could quote something. But he was the opposite of a blogger. Jobs was a mass communicator. No one in my generation has mastered the art as Jobs did. Today, with the outpouring of feeling on the net, are people mourning the man, or the phenomena he could unleash, just by saying &quot;One more thing.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And he was a designer, even though people seem to be overlooking that in their remembrances, calling him more of a visionary. He got down in there and made small but very important design decisions about his products. Ones that had wide impact, for better, or worse. And often they weren't things his products did, rather things his products didn't do that defined them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Mac was full of them. No cursor keys, so you had to use the mouse to navigate. I doubt if money was the reason, though leaving out the cursor keys probably saved a bit, and allowed the other keys to be bigger. It also meant Apple had to design its own keyboard, because they all had cursor keys. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No hard drive. No expansion slots. No fan. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A standardized user interface. This was very controversial with software developers such as myself. We felt what we did was user interface design. What would we do if the UI was already designed. New ideas sometimes don't get accepted right away by everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there were the almost-great ideas, like having networking built into every Mac starting with the Mac Plus. At the time networking wasn't even an option on IBM PCs. The networking, while a bold and great idea, didn't have the impact it should have had because the programming APIs were impossibly difficult. Had they been easy the Mac would have been the web, and we could have saved 20 years of incremental upgrades to turn the web into what the Mac was in 1984. #&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And at times Steve forgot where his ideas came from, or seemed to. He tormented Bill Gates, probably in jest, that he was stealing his ideas from Apple, when they both stole from Xerox. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had some personal interactions with Jobs, but they weren't very special. I doubt if he knew who I was. He called me once, out of the blue -- to rant about the stupidity of people at Apple. This was in 1997 just after coming back. Even today, after all these years, I have a hard time saying I agreed with him, and I didn't say so in the conversation, I just stayed silent. He doesn't suffer fools quietly, that's for sure. Ooops, he didn't. Hard to think of him in the past tense. Why did he call me then? I have no clue. #&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One more thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the first rush of memorials, people are comparing Jobs to Henry Ford (industrialist), Thomas Edison (inventor) or Walt Disney (media). But there's also a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright&quot;&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt; in there. All these men had imperfections, and greatness. But Wright's were, imho, more Jobsian than the others.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He's so wonderfully prickly and famous for bursting into any house he built un-announced - just come in with a troop of people and show them the house, rearrange the furniture. He would even sneak into the houses to rearrange the furniture when the owners were away,&quot; T.C. Boyle wrote of Wright, but it also describes how early Mac developers felt after demoing their products for Steve. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To both Jobs and Wright the people who used their products were not as important as the computer or the building. More than the thing itself, what mattered to Wright, and I think what mattered to Jobs is the integrity of his vision. In a way it was a shame that the vision had to be instantiated.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jobs has also been compared to Leonardo Da Vinci, but I think that's something for historians to say, a couple of hundred years from now. Honestly, even comparing him to Ford or Edison is a bit over the top, because their achievements are understood with a hundred years of perspective. We are all contemporaries of Jobs, so our judgment isn't historical. He had a lot of impact on our lives, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a historical impact.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course that's what made their ideas so great and influential. Among the many Jobs quotes worth remembering, and quoting -- Artists ship. I agree. And when you ship, along with the vision, comes reality. And then you learn and ship again.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There might still be Jobs shipments to come. We don't know what's in Apple's pipeline. But his thinking and vision, his person, will influence others and drive them to greatness, for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="In 1983, my little software &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; was lucky to be invited to work on Apple's new computer in development, the Macintosh. Back then Apple wasn't as secretive as it is today. Everyone knew something was coming. We knew what it was called, but no one was saying what it was." created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:22:47 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2011/10/06/mac128.gif" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#a142247"/>
				<source:outline text="I gladly signed the agreement, and to this day I remember my first glimpse of the Mac. I arrived at a building on &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10460+Bandley+Drive,+cupertino,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.328093,-122.033772&amp;spn=0.034364,0.027509&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=10460+Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;vpsrc=6&quot;&gt;Bandley Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Cupertino some time in August 1983, and was met by Mike Boich and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/span&gt; from the Mac team. As we walked to the conference room, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a beige plastic box that was small and upright. And personal. How it said that to me, in just a glimpse, I have no idea. Is that a computer? Another thought popped into my head: It said &quot;I'm new.&quot; And that was something because back in those days everything was new. And it was personal, for me. All this from a fraction of a second look." created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:24:25 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#a142425"/>
				<source:outline text="Before that I had been an Apple II developer for a number of years, and was a devotee of Apple's products, though I also loved IBM's PC. There was a sense that we were all creating a new world, we all loved our work -- and Jobs and the people he nurtured at Apple, were leaders. I was on stage during the rollout of the Mac at Flint Center on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/01/dayintech_0124&quot;&gt;January 24, 1984&lt;/a&gt;. We shipped our product later that year and went on to have one of the first hits for the Mac." created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:25:03 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#a142503"/>
				<source:outline text="But I want to tell a different story. Not a personal one, because I did not have a personal relationship with Steve Jobs. However, I built products that made it to market through his platforms. And in doing so, my vision was shaped by his. And later, with podcasting and RSS, I got to influence the direction of his products." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I wish Jobs had been a blogger, had written about his design process, so I could quote something. But he was the opposite of a blogger. Jobs was a mass communicator. No one in my generation has mastered the art as Jobs did. Today, with the outpouring of feeling on the net, are people mourning the man, or the phenomena he could unleash, just by saying &quot;One more thing.&quot;" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="And he was a designer, even though people seem to be overlooking that in their remembrances, calling him more of a visionary. He got down in there and made small but very important design decisions about his products. Ones that had wide impact, for better, or worse. And often they weren't things his products did, rather things his products didn't do that defined them." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="The Mac was full of them. No cursor keys, so you had to use the mouse to navigate. I doubt if money was the reason, though leaving out the cursor keys probably saved a bit, and allowed the other keys to be bigger. It also meant Apple had to design its own keyboard, because they all had cursor keys." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>

				<source:outline text="A standardized user interface. This was very controversial with software developers such as myself. We felt what we did was user interface design. What would we do if the UI was already designed. New ideas sometimes don't get accepted right away by everyone." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="And there were the almost-great ideas, like having networking built into every Mac starting with the Mac Plus. At the time networking wasn't even an option on IBM PCs. The networking, while a bold and great idea, didn't have the impact it should have had because the programming APIs were impossibly difficult. Had they been easy the Mac would have been the web, and we could have saved 20 years of incremental upgrades to turn the web into what the Mac was in 1984. #" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="And at times Steve forgot where his ideas came from, or seemed to. He tormented Bill Gates, probably in jest, that he was stealing his ideas from Apple, when they both stole from Xerox." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/04/142142.html?title=steveJobsAsFrankLloydWright#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I had some personal interactions with Jobs, but they weren't very special. I doubt if he knew who I was. He called me once, out of the blue -- to rant about the stupidity of people at Apple. This was in 1997 just after coming back. Even today, after all these years, I have a hard time saying I agreed with him, and I didn't say so in the conversation, I just stayed silent. He doesn't suffer fools quietly, that's for sure. Ooops, he didn't. Hard to think of him in the past tense. Why did he call me then?

			<title>Radical ideas for political pubs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1444705859582533635&quot;&gt;Idea&lt;/a&gt;. For a few weeks, assign a reporter to read the Twitter comments for all the stories, but don't announce anything. Look for people who write intelligent comments with new ideas that people in your circle never come up with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are out there, might take some effort to find them. Recruit new ideas. We need you to do that. Be a contrarian. In journalism the assumption is that comments are disgusting. Take an opposite view for a short period of time, and see objectively if there aren't some diamonds out there in the middle of all the crap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another radical idea for political pubs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear blogs are back? They call them newsletters now. They all have RSS feeds, of course. How about gathering a list of all the newsletters people on your staff read, publish the list, and run a river of all their letters, when they come out. A way of revealing your sources in a new dimension. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Build relationships with the smartest of them. Become known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connoisseur&quot;&gt;connoisseurs&lt;/a&gt; of political thought. How could that hurt your pub? Pay special attention to ones that criticize your specific publication. Always listen to your most passionate users, that's how you improve over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I read about how Biden's popularity is dropping, I wonder if there's any reality to this. If it were really a troubling sign that means in the next election, Americans will do what Germans did in 1932, we'll vote into power a fascist party, and open the US to concentration camps and mass exterminations of our own citizens. You may think this is wild, but before Covid the idea of 700K Americans dying of a disease that was largely preventable, because of disinformation from the government itself, that would have seemed like a paranoid delusion. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/&quot;&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to preserve that perspective.
