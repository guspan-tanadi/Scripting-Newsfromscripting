			<description>I've been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_(book)&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan&quot;&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great book, but already dated. The missions he talks about for the future have already happened. Our understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has greatly increased since 1994. Now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens&quot;&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; has visited, so much &lt;a href=&quot;https://stfc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/features/10-things-we-ve-learned-from-cassini-huygens/&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; is known. Sagan of course is not alive to do this for us. But it seems someone should. Next up I'm going to re-read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage&quot;&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; has a feature that LO2 doesn't have -- Bookmarks. Here's how they work. There's a Bookmarks menu. When you choose the first command, Add Bookmark, a dialog confirms that you want to bookmark the current outline. If you click OK, the bookmarks file opens in a tab, and a link to the file you had open appears as the first item in the list. You can move the link where ever you like, and change the text. If you look in the Bookmarks menu, the changes are reflected. The menu can be hierarchic. As you have probably guessed the file is an outline, like any other outline. But it has this special UI. There are a number of other features like this. Anyway, Bookmarks are tricky because of the way asynchronous code works in JavaScript. If bookmarks.opml isn't already open, you have to wait until it is open to create the bookmark link. If you don't, weird things can happen. Now that I've changed how tabs work internally, this feature is broken. It drives me crazy because I depend on Bookmarks, and I'm starting to use Drummer for real work now. So today I must get this problem solved. I'm not getting up until it works. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, it's not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; true that no outliner I've shipped has had a Bookmarks menu. &quot;Electric Outliner&quot; has one. But I haven't exactly promoted it. I use it to write my blog, in fact I'm using it right now to write &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/17.html#a133713&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It has had a Bookmarks menu for years, and I've been able to manage lots of complex projects more easily because of it. EO is an Electron-based outliner that runs on the desktop. There will be a desktop version of Drummer, using lots of what's in EO, hopefully. It's possible we did a bookmarks feature for Frontier too. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/autowebdocs/menusharingwalkthru_148.html&quot;&gt;menu sharing&lt;/a&gt; is something like Bookmarks. My memory sucks. Sorry.</description>

			<description>Today I learned that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_attr.asp&quot;&gt;jQuery attr&lt;/a&gt; function, if you pass it a function, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jquery-attr-method/&quot;&gt;calls the function&lt;/a&gt;. This. Is. A. Bug. It blew my mind when I figured out what was going on. Phewwww. That's the sound of my mind being blown. Back to work Davey.</description>

			<description>I've been trying to watch the news on MSNBC and CNN, but it's really hard to get into. Their product transformed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Trump%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and now that he is gone, or so it seems, knock wood -- what's left for them to cover? Here's what I suggest. This requires that you put the heat on Biden and Judge Garland. First I've heard it said that January 6 could happen again, which I think is too meek. It &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; happen again. And until the prosecutions begin, the news should be filling in the details the same way they were covering every detail of the Trump crime scene when he was in office. Who are the leaders? Their names, pictures, backgrounds, are they free, awaiting trial, on the run? These people, and the politicians that are covering for them, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-senators-voted-against-bipartisan-bill-anti-asian-hate-crimes-2021-4#sen-tom-cotton-of-arkansas-1&quot;&gt;six sentators&lt;/a&gt; who voted against the Asian hate crimes bill, to name a few, are vying for the position of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/06/howToPreventAnotherTrump.html&quot;&gt;The Next Hitler&lt;/a&gt; of the United States. We need a bunch of good enemies. And why aren't the Bidens prosecuting them. We need some bodies in cells for January 6, now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸŽˆ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>So, instead of watching the news from 6PM to 10PM every night, as I did during the Trump years, I've been reading books, watching the Mets and Knicks, watching British movies, also the Godfather I and II. On the whole this is a better deal. More variety, it's more personal, much less repetitive, and besides the Knicks are playing entertaining basketball, and that's more than I can say for whatever sport they're playing on MSNBC.</description>

			<description>On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; front, I decided to rewrite the tab code to use JavaScript closures. Much simpler code and hopefully more easily extended to add new functionality. But right now the app is a mess. I learned some new jQuery tricks with custom event handlers and triggers. You can have a very isolated function with persistent and private storage but you can still make calls into it, for the times when the outside world needs to know something about what's inside.</description>

			<description>An unusual day is one where It's almost 6PM and I haven't posted anything to the blog. This is one of those days. I think I actually have to update at least once a day for the nightly mail app. Not sure what it would do if midnight came and there was nothing new. I don't really want to find out. Everything's fine, in the middle of a pretty heavy bit of development so my focus is there. See you tomorrow! ;-)</description>

			<description>I have to say, a consistent theme in my career has been, I create something, through a lot of work and trial and error, and years later it's out and people like it. And then people say thanks for doing that, now I'll take over. The first time I saw that in a huge way was with OPML. It came a couple of years after RSS's success, and a lot of people assumed OPML would be big and they could get rich if they owned it. I had a colleague at Harvard even tell me literally he was going to take over now. Those were the words he used. He had no idea what OPML was! I thought this is the height of ridiculousness. It got so awful I just dropped the project, to let them all fail, which is exactly what happened. These things aren't designed to get anyone rich. There is no lock-in possible so nothing to charge money for. How stupid can you be. Obviously, I learned the lesson that people can be very very very stupid. And unbelievably, larcenously, greedy. (BTW, the guy from Harvard was already very rich. He did not need more money. I had been to his house.)</description>

			<source:outline text="I have to say, a consistent theme in my career has been, I create something, through a lot of work and trial and error, and years later it's out and people like it. And then people say thanks for doing that, now I'll take over. The first time I saw that in a huge way was with OPML. It came a couple of years after RSS's success, and a lot of people assumed OPML would be big and they could get rich if they owned it. I had a colleague at Harvard even tell me literally he was going to take over now. Those were the words he used. He had no idea what OPML was! I thought this is the height of ridiculousness. It got so awful I just dropped the project, to let them all fail, which is exactly what happened. These things aren't designed to get anyone rich. There is no lock-in possible so nothing to charge money for. How stupid can you be. Obviously, I learned the lesson that people can be very very very stupid. And unbelievably, larcenously, greedy. (BTW, the guy from Harvard was already very rich. He did not need more money. I had been to his house.)" created="Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:39:50 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/05/loveRss.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/14.html#a153950"/>

			<description>So many more examples. Like the VCs and RSS. They all lost all their money because they thought a format can be owned. None of them were interested in where I thought the products were, they all created the same product, badly -- and failed. Podcasting, more of the same. My partner, Adam Curry, thought I was just a programmer, and therefore &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility&quot;&gt;fungible&lt;/a&gt;. I am a programmer, for sure -- but I think about things in a different way, there's a part of the stack almost no one else gets into. I see new media before it exists. I work at it. You can't just hire someone to do what I do. That's why my consistent drumbeat is Let's Work Together. Instead of stopping here, there's much more to do and no one gets to do it all. The interchange format isn't ownable. But most people don't get that, and when they bet money that they can, they lose it all.</description>

			<description>Drummer is going to be the anti-silo, as Frontier was. What this meant for Frontier is when we saw a new protocol, our first impulse was to implement it. I wanted it to be able to communicate with anything. A silo'd outliner would instead usually not to support a protocol, and implement everything itself. Watching Roam, I'd say they are a half-silo. When it comes to exporting content from Roam they seem to be fairly liberal. They don't want to implement their own blogging software, for example, they'd prefer to export to a static site generator. But, they are fairly closed to allowing other editing tools to be able to push content into their graph. I wanted to see how at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/days&quot;&gt;some of my writing&lt;/a&gt; here on Scripting News, in outlines, would look in their graph. As far as I can tell, it might be possible to do, but it would require a lot of work by hand, and no one has time to do that. It would make more sense imho to support some kind of standard interchange format. Luckily, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/&quot;&gt;created one&lt;/a&gt;, in the 00s, for just this purpose, and it's pretty broadly supported. Anyway they certainly don't make it easy. They really want me to use their outliner. I'm sure it's very nice, but I already have one. Anyway, like all recent text products and services, you're pretty much locked into using their editor.</description>

			<description>Follow-up to yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/206&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/&quot;&gt;WordPress still has an API&lt;/a&gt;, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; to interface to it, and even better, they still have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface&lt;/a&gt; and support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_MetaWeblog_API&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt;. So it should be possible to have WordPress support in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and use the outliner to create and edit posts on a WordPress website, and who knows where that goes. What's especially cool about it is that in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/&quot;&gt;December 2019&lt;/a&gt; I released a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt; of XML-RPC in the form of a client and server for Node, in JavaScript of course, and a client that runs in the browser. So now there's a good reason to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; support to Drummer, which I totally want to do.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/206&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: Is there a way to post to WordPress from an external app? If it has an API, I'd like to get support in the first release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It's an important connection. For years they had an XML-RPC interface. I think that's gone now. Has something replaced it yet?

			<description>Earlier this month I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/04/174604.html?title=theLostAppsOfThe80s&quot;&gt;The Lost Apps of the 80s&lt;/a&gt;, wondering where the depth of early PC writing tools went. Also spreadsheets, databases, graphics programs. There were huge numbers of them. The reason imho is Microsoft and not just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars&quot;&gt;Browser Wars&lt;/a&gt; which threw all of software into chaos for a number of years. There's another reason, and it might have happened even if the web hadn't come along. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office&quot;&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;. So quickly I forgot. It used to be that a word processor cost $495 as did a database, spreadsheet, and various other software. When you added up the retail prices it could easily come to $2000. Then one day, Microsoft bundled &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word&quot;&gt;Word&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel&quot;&gt;Excel&lt;/a&gt; and a few other apps, for the price of a single productivity app. And over the years, they added more software to the bundle. This alone might have reduced the productiving software business to one vendor. The competitors couldn't afford to do what Microsoft did, they didn't have the royalties from the OS to support their price-cutting in apps. So that's another theory on where the apps went. Today, that's no excuse. Writing tools would have a different purpose today, writing for the network, rather than for printing. Different requirements.</description>

			<description>I just found a 1991 piece by Steven Levy at MacWorld about Frontier, which was still in development at the time. Really interesting read because now, only 30 years later (heh), I'm doing a smaller version of the same idea, not on the Mac but on the open web, once again using standard protocols to connect apps. It starts on page 51 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://vintageapple.org/macworld/pdf/MacWorld_9108_August_1991.pdf&quot;&gt;this PDF&lt;/a&gt; of the August 1991 MacWorld.

			<description>What neither Levy or I understood, at the same time in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee was working on the world wide web. Frontier's importance in bootstrapping the web as a content management platform, via blogging, RSS and podcasting, was where the real growth would come. It would require a pivot, of course. The Mac &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; entering middle age, as Levy postulated. But a new shiny thing that worked really well with the Mac was coming along and would soon change everything. The same vacuum that existed on the Mac at the time, now exists on the web. There is no simple-enough scripting language designed for power users to integrate the functionality of many and disparate apps. Why do I like this so much? I guess I'm just a pipes and wires kind of guy. And I think lots of new media will emerge from the ecosystem we'll create here.</description>

			<description>Embarrassing mistake. Yesterday, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/10/142746.html?title=shouldNetflixHaveASchedule&quot;&gt;longish piece&lt;/a&gt; about bingewatching, I gave Kazuo Ishiguro credit for writing the novel Howardâ€™s End.  He actually wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day&quot;&gt;Remains of the Day&lt;/a&gt;. There is a connection. Both were made into movies starring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson&quot;&gt;Emma Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins&quot;&gt;Anthony Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;. I corrected the piece, but here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/theError.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the error. BTW, interestingly, I received an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/netflixemail.png&quot;&gt;email from Netflix&lt;/a&gt; last night suggesting I watch Howard's End. Is it a coincidence, or does their algorithm read my blog? That would be amazing if it did. (I'm sure it doesn't but it's an incredible source about my interests.)</description>

			<description>BTW, for people who are trying outliners for the first time, may I suggest my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. It's browser-based, easy to use, has lots of features, isn't world-encompassing, just a way to make lists, plan stuff, think into your computer screen. It's free to use, no gotchas, and the outlines are in a standard format, and there's a command to download all your work to your local system, for backup or to use in another outliner. So there's absolutely no lock-in. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A thread re NYT and the tech web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1380915375383138311&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from my Twitter account..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was having a discussion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; about the difference between online media brought to us by the tech industry, and the world of the NYT and other journalism orgs. Here's a concise version.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The NYT et al present packaged stories and opinion. The presenters are vetted, conform to standards that are understood, but not well documented. (This is all my opinion btw.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The online tech media presents largely unpackaged stories, with little or no vetting, and the standards are hard to implement because the systems are so vast.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're opposites. Night and day. And in conflict, but imho they need not be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've long felt we need hybrids. Probably unknown to most people at the NYT, there was a time, between 2002 and 2005, or so -- when I personally worked with them on this stuff. So I had a strong opinion about what they should do. They did half of what I asked, and that was pretty bold, and very successful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other half they didn't do. It would have brought a lot more voices into the NYT, but they would have been vetted, by the reporters of the NYT, simply by quoting them in a NYT piece. So they couldn't avoid the vetting if their stories had sources. And the thought was that anyone who is a source for the NYT is worth listening to and could use a platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would have come out of it is something like what Substack is today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know how that experiment would have turned out, but I believed in the idea. Unfortunately it was immediately turned down. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My main contact at the NYT at the time was Martin Nisenholtz, so you can confirm this with him if you like. The first half of the deal resulted in the RSS standard for distributing news. Another little-known fact, imho RSS would have failed without the support from the NYT. Their trust in my small company was amazing, and we took good care of their brand and rep in the wild world of the web. This was in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There's also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of how we found the cache of NYT syndicated content. That's what led to the deal we made a year later for RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Should Netflix have a schedule?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I decided to cut the cord and turn off the TV service from my cable provider, Spectrum. I returned my settop box, which I had never actually installed, because I used their Roku app instead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I subscribed to YouTube TV so I could watch news and some sports. It concerned me that they didn't have MSG or SNY for the Knicks and Mets, but there wasn't much sports last year anyway, with the pandemic and lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went without HBO because I was getting that from Spectrum, and I binged on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and a few other services from time to time, but those were the main ones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the Knicks season started. I could see from the highlights and news that this season they were actually an exciting team, very unusual, I wanted to watch, so I set out on a lengthy search, because the information out there is so poor, only to learn that there is literally no way to get MSG and SNY, the broadcasters of Knicks and Mets games, without Spectrum. The local sports teams are not available to cable-cutters, at least not where I live. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I wrote about this on my blog, I got lots of emails saying that this service or that would give me what I wanted. I even tried using Spectrum's &quot;streaming&quot; service, which you can order online, but none of them had the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I decided to undo the grand cable-cutting experiment, called Spectrum and got back on board with the cable TV service, got a new settop box, which will never be unpacked and will stay in a closet, and happily watched the Knicks during this very interesting, exciting and fun season. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But this piece is about HBO, not the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now as a Spectrum user, I can use the HBO Max app. I've paid to access it. And at the same time, HBO appears in the Listings in the Spectrum app. So I added them to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/10/spectrumListing.png&quot;&gt;favorites&lt;/a&gt;. So now when I have to choose between something to watch, HBO is one of the choices. And the big difference here is that they pick what to offer me, just like the old days. They have a schedule. And guess what, I watch a lot more HBO this way than I did when I have full choice over what to watch through the streaming app. This is the point of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example. Last night just before Ari Melber comes on at 6PM, I got bored with the usual stuff on CNN and MSNBC, so I looked around, and saw that The Godfather had just started. I switched to it, and there's Don Corleone sitting behind his desk with the cat in his lap, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6LKszIrDzo&quot;&gt;listening to Bonasera&lt;/a&gt;, the undertaker, completely blowing his pitch to the Don. It's a riveting scene. So much to watch. The performance of it. Comparing it to the boring plays they act out on CNN, for months, is ridiculous. One is a masterpiece, the other is completely lost, worthless, not even good for passing the time while playing games on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I watched The Godfather all the way to the end. I didn't get up once. It was the best couple of hours I had spent on entertainment in years.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Browsing on HBO Max, I would never think to click on The Godfather as I'm bored looking for something to watch. I think other people have observed this too. Most of my time on these apps is spent looking for something to watch, as opposed to watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of scheduled broadcasts is actually very appealing, to my surprise! I thought for sure the revolution was permanent, that we would always be programming our TV-watching experience for ourselves once we had the chance. But there are real problems with that approach. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How do I know if something is good? I have no idea. And to find out, I have to search for the title on Metacritic, see the total score, and then skim the reviews. A lot of typing and waiting and reading, so I don't do it very often. Much faster just to go on to the next one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I might have heard of a show or movie I want to watch, but I have no idea if it's playing somewhere I can access. For example, I was looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_(film)&quot;&gt;Remains of the Day&lt;/a&gt;, because the story was written by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Ishiguro&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972841445/klara-and-the-sun-is-a-masterpiece-about-life-love-and-mortality&quot;&gt;book I had just read&lt;/a&gt; and loved. Amazon has a big advantage here, you can get almost everything, but mostly they are not included in the video bundle, so you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remains-Day-Anthony-Hopkins/dp/B00BZBDMWQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=remains+of+the+day&amp;qid=1618151573&amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;pay extra&lt;/a&gt;. I figure I'm already paying enough to all the streaming services, I should watch something that's included, and eventually Howard's End will show up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I guess I'll pretty much always watch The Godfather, Babe or Kill Bill 2 when given a chance to. There are actually a lot of movies like that. And now, unlike the past, there are no commercials, and they leave the sex and violence in. And the Knicks, which I watched instead of Maddow, oy! What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/rj-barrett-doesnt-blink-in-clutch-knicks-moment/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. The ups and downs, tragedy and heroic play, the back-stories, the history -- all in just an hour. MSNBC, comparitively, is transparently nothing. The best they have is a powerless Congressperson who is ridiculously and obviously corrupt and popular (maybe) on Fox who has been caught. Nothing is at stake. They can't explain why anyone should care. They need a new purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Then the Knicks season started. I could see from the highlights and news that this season they were actually an exciting team, very unusual, I wanted to watch, so I set out on a lengthy search, because the information out there is so poor, only to learn that there is literally no way to get MSG and SNY, the broadcasters of Knicks and Mets games, without Spectrum.

				<source:outline text="So I decided to undo the grand cable-cutting experiment, called Spectrum and got back on board with the cable TV service, got a new settop box, which will never be unpacked and will stay in a closet, and happily watched the Knicks during this very interesting, exciting and fun season." created="Sat, 10 Apr 2021 14:33:28 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/10/142746.html?title=shouldNetflixHaveASchedule#a143328"/>

				<source:outline text="Now as a Spectrum user, I can use the HBO Max app. I've paid to access it.

So now when I have to choose between something to watch, HBO is one of the choices. And the big difference here is that they pick what to offer me, just like the old days. They have a schedule.

				<source:outline text="An example. Last night just before Ari Melber comes on at 6PM, I got bored with the usual stuff on CNN and MSNBC, so I looked around, and saw that The Godfather had just started. I switched to it, and there's Don Corleone sitting behind his desk with the cat in his lap, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6LKszIrDzo&quot;&gt;listening to Bonasera&lt;/a&gt;, the undertaker, completely blowing his pitch to the Don. It's a riveting scene. So much to watch. The performance of it. Comparing it to the boring plays they act out on CNN, for months, is ridiculous.

				<source:outline text="Browsing on HBO Max, I would never think to click on The Godfather as I'm bored looking for something to watch. I think other people have observed this too.

					<source:outline text="How do I know if something is good? I have no idea. And to find out, I have to search for the title on Metacritic, see the total score, and then skim the reviews.

					<source:outline text="I might have heard of a show or movie I want to watch, but I have no idea if it's playing somewhere I can access. For example, I was looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_(film)&quot;&gt;Remains of the Day&lt;/a&gt;, because the story was written by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Ishiguro&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972841445/klara-and-the-sun-is-a-masterpiece-about-life-love-and-mortality&quot;&gt;book I had just read&lt;/a&gt; and loved. Amazon has a big advantage here, you can get almost everything, but mostly they are not included in the video bundle, so you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remains-Day-Anthony-Hopkins/dp/B00BZBDMWQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=remains+of+the+day&amp;qid=1618151573&amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;pay extra&lt;/a&gt;.

				<source:outline text="On the other hand, I guess I'll pretty much always watch The Godfather, Babe or Kill Bill 2 when given a chance to. There are actually a lot of movies like that. And now, unlike the past, there are no commercials, and they leave the sex and violence in. And the Knicks, which I watched instead of Maddow, oy! What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/rj-barrett-doesnt-blink-in-clutch-knicks-moment/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. The ups and downs, tragedy and heroic play, the back-stories, the history -- all in just an hour. MSNBC, comparitively, is transparently nothing. The best they have is a powerless Congressperson who is ridiculously and obviously corrupt and popular (maybe) on Fox who has been caught. Nothing is at stake. They can't explain why anyone should care.

With the filibuster in place the only power he has is to keep the filibuster. If he sticks with that he might as well switch parties now. However, if Biden and the Dems sold the voting plan that the Repubs will certainly block, if 90 percent of West Virginians supported the reforms, I would imagine that Manchin &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; change his mind.

			<title>A Drummer example</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; script that lists the earlierst Twitter users in an outline.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's the script:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var flfirst = true;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.insert (&quot;Early Twitter signups&quot;, down);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;for (var i = 12; i &lt; 25; i++) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var name = twitter.getScreenname (i);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.insert (name, (flfirst) ? &quot;right&quot; : &quot;down&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;flfirst = false;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.go (left, 1);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The list it generates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/09/twitterUsersList.png&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the script works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It inserts a headline in the current outline, &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt; from the bar cursor headline, with the text &quot;Early Twitter signups.&quot;   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it loops of users whose ids are 12 to 24. I picked 12 because I had figured out from an earlier script that it was the first-listed user. And 24 is a random value I picked out of thin air. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For each user, it calls the Drummer verb twitter.getScreenname, which takes one parameter, the id of the user whose name you want. Then it inserts the name either to the right or down from the cursor depending on whether this is the first user we're inserting. That's how &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/op/insert&quot;&gt;op.insert&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend from Frontier, works. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When it's done looping, it moves the cursor to the left, onto the &quot;Early Twitter signups&quot; headline we created. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It leaves the list expanded. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The killer feature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's so humble you might actually miss it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even though the script makes a dozen asynchronous calls to Twitter, it's written as if it were synchronous. No weird code structures, you just write it as you think of it, and the system translates it into the complicated stuff, for you. Do I have to explain why this is good? Any time you can let the computer do the complex stuff for you is time you save, and errors you don't make. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

No weird code structures, you just write it as you think of it, and the system translates it into the complicated stuff, for you. Do I have to explain why this is good? Any time you can let the computer do the complex stuff for you is time you save, and errors you don't make." created="Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:21:04 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/09/141443.html?title=aDrummerExample#a142104"/>

			<description>I watched the beginning of President Biden's press conference today. Both VP Harris and the president gave very good talks.  Sometimes their cadence is wrong, they speak in typos,  and other times (like today) I say YEAH that's right, that's how you do it.</description>

			<description>After watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03.html#a131856&quot;&gt;The Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt;, I've listened to the album a few times, from beginning to end. They said it's a concept album, but it isn't really. There are four songs that are in keeping with the Sgt Pepper theme, but the rest are Beatles songs. A few that could have been from the pre-Pepper Beatles. But the album made another statement that did mark a turning point: We're going to try new ideas. We're really going to do it, not just talk about it. We're going to use the remarkable place we're in to innovate. Further, this isn't about fame or wealth, it's about creativity, human expression. For the rest of their careers, as a group and individuals, they continued to try new ideas. And they inspired a generation of us to believe in our own ingenuity as much as any tech hero did, more I think (though I wasn't inspired by them, I was of them). The beauty of Pepper is the lives of the people who created it and their ability to influence.</description>
