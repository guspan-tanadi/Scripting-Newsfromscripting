I believe it's possible to create a single, simple, easy to understand API that covers the core of all social media APIs. Analogous to what TCP/IP did to flatten the differences between network protocols forming the internet in the 1970s.</description>

			<description>If the non-Twitter networks want to compete, get rid of character limits. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/15/fattweetscreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1669314484488290304&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; to Twitter earlier today. 613 characters. I could not post that to Mastodon or Bluesky, their character limits are too restrictive.</description>

			<description>Did you wonder why there were no Jan 6 crowds at either of Trump’s arraignments? Isn’t it obvious? Any would-be insurrectionists saw the Jan 6 folks get tried, convicted and put in jail. That makes the whole thing real. Americans of 2023 are soft. We’re the ones who got tax cuts from Bush while we were at war. We had no draft, no price controls. War was okay as long as we could ignore it. We’d rather have others make the sacrifices for us. We like to own guns to support our fantasy that we’re badasses, but truthfully we’d rather watch the revolution on TV than go to jail, esp for a crybaby snob like Trump.</description>

When you achieve a certain amount of wealth, you are declared a winner. A champion. There's a ceremony where you get a medal and a special kind of credit card that allows you entry to the VIP room wherever you go. In that room you have free drinks, the most comfortable chairs, fantastic snacks, for you and a guest. Everywhere you go people are required to salute you. All the benefits. You eat the best food, sit in first class, and you live in a very nice house or apartment where all your neighbors are also champs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that, sounds great right, but what do you give up? You can't make any more money. That's it. Your earning days are over. You won. Now find something else to do. You can't have more than one house, one car -- no private jets, you can't own sports teams or CNN. You have to live like a human being, not consume more than double what a non-champ consumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like socialism or communism, deal with it. Because when you own 12 homes and fly around in your private jet, and consume hundreds of times more than you can possibly use, you're putting the continued existence, of all of us, in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: You get free guitar lessons too, and a nice guitar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🎸&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My advice on quitting smoking -- get someone to lock you in a room where you can't get a cigarette for a solid week. That's the hardest part of quitting, getting over the physical addiction.</description>

I was stuck trying to figure out how to encode some text in a sticky corner. I had tried the first two methods I usually use, and neither worked. I was about to give up and back out of the feature when I thought to explain the problem to ChatGPT and ask for a suggestion, and it included pragmatic issues like it really mattered to me that I not have to bring another toolkit into the mix. It suggested something I hadn't considered, a third way, and it worked, and I can move on. How do you put a value on that kind of contribution? It's like a programming partner that knows everything basically and is always there to help out and doesn't charge for their time. Pretty amazing.</description>

I'm not, I like that it's small, and I also like that there are no peers yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some part of me thinks the future of social networks is small, that we've seen how unwieldy they can be when they grow too huge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think we have to work on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;cross-platform API&lt;/a&gt; like the one we had with blogging. It didn't take long to create, and it was supported everywhere. WordPress still supports the API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of every social network having their own API is workable if and only if we can put a layer on top of them that makes it possible to communicate with all. It'd be analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite&quot;&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt; and the start of the internet. Peering is everything and then data formats. We have good &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; for that too.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All we're waiting for is people to work together. It doesn't have to be everyone, just people who want to build something bigger than one particular brand of social network.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm doing a Bluesky thread writer and publisher. Here's an example of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bingeworthy.bsky.social/post/3jxy72dbzxy2r&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; it published just now. I had ChatGPT write a story about the many kinds of bread in the world and pushed that out as a thread of nine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/12/threadCenterScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; at the end of business today. This was the first Node.js app I wrote for Twitter back in 2014, it was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/06/twitterLovesLittlePorkChop.html&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you remember. Now it's the first app I wrote for Bluesky. Should have it usable in a day or two, knock wood. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@shoq/110516792922874801&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon what role &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; played in developing RSS, since he is often credited with co-developing it. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/110520163594030698&quot;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;There was a lot of confusion about what RSS was until RSS 2.0 came out and the NYT adopted it. There was a thread based on RDF, and Aaron was credited as a contributor to that. I would ask those people what he did. I never worked with him. I saw some of his posts on their mail list and met him a few times at conferences. He was a precocious young person, obviously smart, but he didn't seem interested in what I was working on. That's about it.&quot;</description>

			<description>A small favor from ChatGPT, now when I'm working on a writing tool (basically always) I don't have to use my own writing for test cases. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/06/11/summer-love-s-everlasting-imprint.html&quot;&gt;here's&lt;/a&gt; &quot;150 words about the freshness of summer and how the best memories of love and happiness are summer memories.&quot;</description>

			<description>In general on social media if someone posts a bit that's an oft-repeated bit of wisdom from the cable networks, I delete it, esp if it's from someone I don't know. I could watch MSNBC if I wanted to. No need to practice such idiocratic punditry online, imho of course ymmv.</description>

			<description>Looking for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/flickr/00932.html&quot;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:scripting.com+aaron+swartz&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, I came upon an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/flickr/&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my Flickr photos created in 2019 that I had no recollection of making. But I did write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/01/20/185927.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. Good move. There's a button that takes you to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/flickr/04074.html&quot;&gt;random&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/flickr/00311.html&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Background noise not news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/10/bear.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I read a story the other day, sorry I don't remember where, that Netflix tries to produce movies and series that you can put on in the background while you surf the web, or watch TikTok or YouTube or tweet or do other mindless stuff. A friend calls this &quot;screen lifestyle.&quot; I am a member of that club. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hear complaints about MSNBC and how their shows are just somewhat irritating mindless crap, the same bullshit you pay attention to with a small fraction of your mind to divide your time with other mindless crap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I once got in trouble at a meeting in a scholarly environment when someone said to me, accusingly, that I listen to NPR to get the best information. I said no -- I listen to it because it relaxes me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC gives us what we want. We can be sure if we tune out for 5 minutes or 20, we won't miss anything because they never said anything new while we weren't paying attention. As soon as some news comes out, as it did the other day (Friday?) they revert to the usual mindless nonsense so as not to disturb us tuning out. The run the big headlines -- BREAKING NEWS -- so we can feel justified leaving it on, as if we're part of the news, but the panel is just telling each other jokes and laughing foolishly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard someone say that Friday Night Lights was that kind of show. For me it's the first ten or so seasons of Law and Order. It's the perfect programming for a tuned-out mind. I know the shows so well, I can often recite the lines as the actors speak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all know the species is over, we're not planning on doing anything about it, we just want to zone out passing the time waiting for the societal grim reaper to collect us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Who is privileged?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/20/mrSmith.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The last time I took a trip by airplane was right after I moved to the mountains in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/&quot;&gt;April 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I went from Albany to Austin to speak at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/&quot;&gt;journalism conference&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas. I resisted the invite, telling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/rosental-alves/&quot;&gt;genial professor&lt;/a&gt; who organized the conference that the audience would hate me, but he didn't accept that. He wanted me to come because it was the 25th anniversary of my blog, and by some counts the 25th anniversary of blogging. He wanted to celebrate, and after a while I couldn't resist, so I went. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was in the last days of #metoo when being a white male was something to be ashamed of, but I am not a person who takes that on. I am confident and sure of myself, that's the way I am. I asked my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, an ex-reporter at CNN and former colleague at Harvard to interview me, figuring that she knew me well and it would be a good interview, and by showing we had a good relationship maybe the criticism would be somewhat restrained.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I expected a few people in the audience tried to invalidate everything I said as if I was boasting -- saying basically of course you accomplished some good stuff because you had all the advantages. What I wanted to tell them and didn't manage to get across is that all the advantages couldn't make what I did easy, because when you do something outside of a big company, the people who work in big companies and other institutions resent it, and try to stop you, and they usually do stop it. But every once in a while, if you persist and think and listen and learn you can sneak one in, as we did with the new media (blogs, feeds, podcasting, social media) that came from our work. I felt it would be good if they heard the story because people should know how new things actually happen, rather than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/07/121413.html&quot;&gt;bullshit stories&lt;/a&gt; reporters tell. But this room of reporters wasn't having it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had it to do over, I would have asked that we have a breakout session later where we could talk about all our privilege. Every person in that room slept in a comfortable clean bedroom the night before, was nicely dressed and clean. The vast majority had excellent educations and made good salaries with benefits, far above the standard of living of most people around the world. In other words before you point the finger, make sure you're not deflecting. And anyway, what's the point. You can learn from anyone, even people with much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;more power&lt;/a&gt; than you have and even if you don't like them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But you don't get do-overs, except in your imagination. Here we are over four years later and I'm still wishing I had thought it through better before-hand, because I expected what I got, and was left without much to say that convinced anyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Live and learn. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Blaming Mr Fubar</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A follow-up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/08.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's posts&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn't really as depressed as it might have seemed because I have a way of dealing with everything seeming to be totally &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/06/09/fubar.html&quot;&gt;fubar&lt;/a&gt;. I have at least three approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, if there's nothing I can do about something I give myself the choice of not worrying about it. I'm just one person in a world of billions, and I basically have no power over any of the messes I was writing about yesterday. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Second, I remind myself that it always feels like everything is about to unravel. I was born in 1955, ten years after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy&quot;&gt;first nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; was used in war. When I was a draft-age teen, the Vietnam War threatened to become the first world wide nuclear war. We're still here, proving that maybe it wasn't as bad as it appeared at the time. (If you think that was bad, my parents' generation had to run for their lives from the Nazis and their Holocaust.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/20/shrek.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;And a third reason -- the young folk blame my generation, which is stupid, there are all kinds of boomers, people who marched for peace and to save the earth (I was one of them) and people who thought abortion was evil and there is no climate change, and we're all in it for ourselves so let it be. Blaming something as abstract as a generation is a way of shifting responsibility from yourself. Young people of today -- you're the ones who have to live with the world we're &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; creating now, why aren't you doing something about it? When you find the answer, you'll then understand why we didn't either. The human species appears to have been willfully driving off a cliff for my whole life, and as far as I can tell nothing will stop it. If you know what we can do, speak up and let's do it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So with all that in mind, today I'm going to drink some coffee, roll up my sleeves and write some software that helps dig us out of a hole I do understand and feel I might have some impact on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Namaste y'all! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Have we given up?</title>

We've done it all, the human species. Fought against all kinds of extinction, and for a while we won. It's like in sports, once you've won the championship, the second time it's getting pointless, and by the third or fourth you really should hang it up. Thinking of LeBron James or Steph Curry, as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well we won. Our species was trying to dominate everything and we did it. Now we have no purpose, and while we may not be conscious of this as individuals or collectively, it plays out in our having no idea what we should do. So we pass the time watching Netflix and Twitter, Youtube and Tiktok. Arguing about meaningless bullshit. Passing the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we had evolved to be a truly motivated species, we would reinvent ourselves, but we aren't that. We're a stupid selfish individualistic species, evolved to survive in a kill or be killed environment. We have no goal, no purpose, no meaning, so we might as well hang it up and that's what we're doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing we did solve incidentally, no more character limits on Twitter! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Journalism is pretty bad</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;How bad is journalism? Let me tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A journalist claimed to have given podcasting its name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He didn't. It's a lie. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But he somehow got it on the Wikipedia page for podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And there it stayed. And every reporter writing a story about podcasting, saw it, and liked it, and copied it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a journalist himself he knew how it works. They don't actually check anything, they just copy and paste. And get paid by the word.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So all the bullshit you hear about how ChatGPT has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=APwXEdd1lEnOFoALc-jJ66NhNLR6wk5Xuw:1686140931210&amp;q=ChatGPT+hallucinations&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-zPu5lLH_AhXrkYkEHc0wA9wQ0pQJegQICRAB&amp;biw=1358&amp;bih=1058&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;, from journalists, covers up the fact that most of what journalists write is complete bullshit. They aren't factual or verified, they just copied something from another journalist, who copied it from a different journalist. They're full of shit, so much so that the journalist knew his lie would never be outed. Even if it were true, it wouldn't be news, but usually what they write contains little or no truth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These same journalists will never say anything bad about Apple btw, even when they offer up a completely ridiculous product for a market that doesn't exist. Everyone gushes, oh it's so great, when no one even the CEO of the company would be caught with the thing on their head. They do this because they won't get invited back if they don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Best advice, if you have a question, ask ChatGPT, far more likely it's correct than some random journalist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;podcasting actually got its name&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://internationalpodcastday.com/podcasting-history&quot;&gt;International Podcast Day&lt;/a&gt;, which is cited as an authority by Google, says there is a dispute about who did what re podcasting between Adam and myself. We have our differences, that's for sure, but I'm not aware of any dispute about how podcasting was created and productized and promoted to turn the idea into a medium. I've always been clear that Adam came to me with the idea, at first I didn't listen, then I got it, and set about implementing it in software. And then creating podcasts, and promoting. We both did a lot of each of those things, but the software was my job, and the development of the standard format. I've never heard Adam dispute any of that. I think they should take that bit about disputes off their description esp since it's being quoted as an authority. And please take Hammersley off the credits. That makes the whole thing stink. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: There are journalists I trust. For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt&quot;&gt;Monica McNutt&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure she wants to rise, and she deseves to, but I'm pretty sure she says what she thinks and doesn't worry about access. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_G._McNeil_Jr.&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; is another, which was why I was so disappointed when he was a victim of NYT internal politics. A real journalist should be forgiven for failing to pander adequately, we &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; our journalists like that, not that the NYT culture cares what their customers want. There are actually many more and everyone has to do a little pandering, and the lines aren't always totally clear. But as the podcast naming fiasco indicates, most journalists don't care about the truth enough to check their &quot;facts.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

My answer, for the record: &quot;Not even slightly interested, but I suppose that could change.&quot; One of the reasons I'm skeptical is that I have imperfect vision. I seriously doubt if a headset would work for me, given that my left eye is pretty bad, and my right eye is normal. Pretty sure they're for people with good balanced vision. I haven't heard that question asked or answered, for any of the headsets. Another concern is how heavy it is. As you get older you learn that stress on your body accumulates over time. For example, I can't use a full-size iPad. I used one for years, but it wore out my left arm so now it's too painful, but I can use an iPad Mini, without problems, so far. If you're putting some kind of new weight on a human head, what will that do to your neck over time? Your back? These kinds of problems tend to cascade. And I can't help but wonder if there isn't another way to achieve what they're doing without putting extra stress on our necks? And honestly I'd prefer to have a new Mac that ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; would really excite me. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<source:outline text="A friend asked if I was going to get &quot;one of these headsets&quot;? My answer, for the record: &quot;Not even slightly interested, but I suppose that could change.&quot; One of the reasons I'm skeptical is that I have imperfect vision. I seriously doubt if a headset would work for me, given that my left eye is pretty bad, and my right eye is normal. Pretty sure they're for people with good balanced vision. I haven't heard that question asked or answered, for any of the headsets. Another concern is how heavy it is. As you get older you learn that stress on your body accumulates over time. For example, I can't use a full-size iPad. I used one for years, but it wore out my left arm so now it's too painful, but I can use an iPad Mini, without problems, so far. If you're putting some kind of new weight on a human head, what will that do to your neck over time? Your back? These kinds of problems tend to cascade. And I can't help but wonder if there isn't another way to achieve what they're doing without putting extra stress on our necks? And honestly I'd prefer to have a new Mac that ran &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; would really excite me. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 06 Jun 2023 12:49:08 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/27/todd.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/06.html#a124908"/>

			<description>Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; post, maybe the last, for a while. At some point I'm going to re-watch the whole series, and then might have more observations. Anyway -- people who think that Roman and Kendall have no hope, well I think the writers gave them some cause for hope -- because when they controlled the company for a short period, each showed they were competent, not at running the enterprise, but a small part of it. Kendall was able to sell a complicated and kind of ridiculous idea. And Roman, when he had a clear goal, was able to manage it, and pulled it off. Neither were the kind of person who could run a sprawling enterprise like Waystar, for that you probably had to be Logan. If the two guys team up and manage something much smaller and more focused, they could possibly pull it off, once they get over not being their father. They &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; revert to where they were at the beginning of the show, as some people say, when Kendall was a drug addict and Roman was a pure &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmuck_(pejorative)&quot;&gt;schmuck&lt;/a&gt; blowing up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sVB_BcbLlUs?t=35&quot;&gt;rocket&lt;/a&gt; to try to impress the father. They both get a fresh start now that dad is dead. That is a big difference for men, when your father dies you get a chance to come into your own in a new way, I speak from experience.</description>

			<description>When I was little, maybe first or second grade, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/06/grandpaAndLittleDave.jpeg&quot;&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt; bought me a handheld &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_radio&quot;&gt;transistor radio&lt;/a&gt;. It was the 1960s. I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow#Radio_work&quot;&gt;WABC&lt;/a&gt;, the Beatles and all the great new rock and roll. My grandpa said I’d see so many amazing things in my life. To him the radio was a futuristic miracle, like AI today. Anyway I just asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ7uXX9K7Sk&quot;&gt;You Can’t Hurry Love&lt;/a&gt; by the Supremes, one of the songs I listened to on the radio he gave me 60 years ago. I realized just now he was so right, I have indeed seen many amazing things in my life.</description>
