			<description>WordPress added a tweet-streaming feature, described in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/wordpress-can-now-turn-blog-posts-into-tweetstorms-automatically/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; article. I followed their directions, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bullmancuso/status/1316064421844865024&quot;&gt;published a thread&lt;/a&gt;, based on a post &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/12.html#a144048&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The post also &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2020/10/13/where-is-your-soul/&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress.com, so it elminates the need for a separate app that turns a thread into a post. Makes me wonder if Substack and Medium are going to add this feature. Also does WordPress support email bulletins?</description>

			<description>I object to the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/podcasts/the-daily/abortion-rights-amy-coney-barrett.html&quot;&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Why The Left is Losing on Abortion.&quot; Once again it's a horserace. Winning and losing. And the subject is wrong. I guess &quot;The Left&quot; is losing but really it's the people of the United States who are losing. This is a terrible disease in American discourse and until we train ourselves to stop ignoring ourselves and realize that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are the government, and insist that our journalists do the same, we will all keep losing, left, right, center, all of it.</description>

			<description>BTW, a Supreme Court justice is part of the government, and therefore governs, and since we are the government, the justice represents us. Who among us do Alito, Roberts, Kavanaugh, Thomas and Gorsach represent? Not me, not anyone I know. Probably not many Trump supporters either. So should we really be adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedsoc.org/&quot;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt;? This is the way journalism should be approaching this story, imho. But who am I. Just a voter, citizen, taxpayer. According to our rulers, insignificant.</description>

			<description>I was talking with a friend the other day, just rambling about software and how I'm not terribly focused and I'm kind of okay with that. They asked what would you like to work on if you had your way. No question about it -- outliners. We have lots of unfinished business. But it still remains a boutique category, and I'm not succeeding at getting my outliner to get enough use to get to critical mass. Other people, newcomers (from my point of view) have gained traction, like Roam and Workflowy. What I really want is to combine outlining and blogging (i.e. fluid online writing). Then I think we'd be inventing a new kind of communication on the net. I have lots of technology for that, but what I'm missing is users. This idea goes all the way back to the beginning of blogging in the mid-90s. Eventually we caved and made a blogging tool that worked the way people expected. I don't want to try to raise venture capital and start a company. I've done that before, and it just takes me away from what I love to do. It isn't my calling. And at my advanced age, there's no time for doing work that isn't what I'm meant to do.</description>

			<description>I have a couple of hours to kill today in Kingston, but it's pouring rain outside. In the old days I'd bring a laptop and hang out in Starbucks or the library. But now that we have Covid, I think I'm going to be listening to podcasts in my car. Oy. I'll have a nice latte of course from Starbucks. But I'm not going to hang out inside and risk getting killed. (Update: Better idea. I'm almost finished with Season 3 of Borgen. I think I'll download it on my iPhone and watch that. Blogging is amazing. Sometimes you figure stuff out.)</description>

			<description>I'd be impressed if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1315979874427904001&quot;&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; urged us to join a social network for voters, one that would continue to influence (both ways) after the election. From there, we could be informed of how to vote. And so much more. It would be as revolutionary as the Declaration of Independence.</description>

			<description>When you think about how Trump became president, it could be that from now on we elect people to play the role of president, more than &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the president, and maybe they should be separate jobs. Seems a good defensive move, in case this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the future, would be to start a few shows with characters who are powerful &lt;i&gt;Democratic&lt;/i&gt; ideals for president. We have Martin Sheen, but he's a little old, and he is doing Trump-like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3yi41gfgA&quot;&gt;cheezy commercials&lt;/a&gt; now for cheap drugs. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geena_Davis&quot;&gt;Geena Davis&lt;/a&gt;. She played the first (and only?) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;woman president&lt;/a&gt; in a TV series in the US.</description>

			<description>Is your ballot property? If someone steals your vote, have they &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfist.com/2020/10/12/california-gop-putting-out-bogus-ballot-boxes-in-at-least-three-counties/&quot;&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; your property?

			<description>I was writing enthusiastically about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Clubhouse%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, then I stopped writing, because I stopped using it. At first, for no particular reason. I wasn't finding conversations that interested me, and when I started them myself, usually &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/02/173236.html?title=clubhouseAfterAMonth#a174138&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/a&gt; happened.

It was depressing to find out that fighting for equality, to the extent that it works, would not end the hatred for my people. After that I looked at every conversation there differently. Never spoke again. I still have the app, am still a member, so this all could change, but I thought it was good to update.</description>

			<description>I woke in the middle of the night with an idea. What if your soul, my soul, if all our souls exist in a different dimension from our bodies? We can't physically find our souls with microscopes or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-an-mri#1&quot;&gt;MRIs&lt;/a&gt;, or electron microscopes, perhaps because they aren't visible where those tools exist? Reminds me of an experience I had many years ago at an outdoor bar in Austin. There was a big tree in the middle of the stage. They had built the stage around it. There was a band playing, something lively and Texan, and I was thinking, I wonder if that tree even knows we're here. Can it sense the music, and the people, and the beers, and the relaxed mood? And if it can, what must it think is going on? So it's possible that our souls may not even be in another dimension, they may only exist in a manner that our senses can't detect. Or maybe we can only detect them as feelings, as intuitions, as middle-of-the-night dreaming epiphanies?</description>

			<description>The mistake we keep making, the voters, is not organizing in a way that we stay organized after the election. So the parties and the press revert to ignoring us. You can see the next year take shape, awfully, even if Biden wins.</description>

			<description>The Repubs do something awful. The Repubs do it again. The Repubs say the Dems will do something to fix the awful things the Repubs did. The press goes for it. Court packing is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillary’s Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary’s Emails&lt;/a&gt; of 2020. Journalism is fed the question by Repubs, ignoring what a 6-3 majority means for the people. If you’re not careful we’ll spend the rest of our sad lives living in Trumpocracy.</description>

			<title>Watchlist feature for BingeWorthy</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnL1eMCKQgk&quot;&gt;Quick video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the new BingeWorthy &lt;i&gt;watchlist.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you see a program you want to watch, look for the + icon in the upper left corner of the program box. Click it. The program is added to your watchlist, displayed just below the box. The icon changes to a checkmark. Click again, it's removed from the watchlist and the check icon changes to a + icon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The icons are weird, imho, but they are the ones Netflix uses for their watchlist, and Amazon Prime video copied them. So I went with Netflix's icons. As usual thanks to Font Awesome there was no work to finding the icons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a few more projects in mind for BingeWorthy. This one was a relative quick hit, took three days from beginning to end. Of course when I started I thought it would take one day. I think there might be another API layer possible for SQL databases that would make such a job much quicker, but I'm not ready to approach that yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Inline videos on Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Added a new feature today to the blog. Still have to check it out in the nightly email. I can now include videos inline, which is a feature I've wanted for special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Below is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwcD8ftY0Mg&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; I took on a country road as some bikers roared by. It seems like I must have been standing there waiting for them, but it was a coincidence. They are really awful, incredibly loud, you can hear them for ten minutes as they go up and down the hills in and out of the valley. I'm not sure why they don't use their mufflers or if their bikes have them, but they really do disturb the peace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway here's the video.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I just realized that Joe Biden may be &lt;b&gt;The Politician from Nowhere&lt;/b&gt;. I can't think of a single issue that he's associated with. Oddly I think that's exactly what we need from a president in 2021.</description>

			<description>New blog feature. There's now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/06/bidenHarris2020.png&quot;&gt;Biden/Harris ad&lt;/a&gt; on the home page of my blog. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingDesktop.png&quot;&gt;desktop browser&lt;/a&gt; it's in the right margin. It was tricky on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingOnPhone.png&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;, so I just had the ad overlay the page, at .5 opacity. You can still read the text underneath it, but it's better if you scroll it out of the way. A blog version of a lawn sign. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/friday-9-october-2020&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; quote my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; on breaking up tech monopolies. He calls it radical. It's the kind of judgment courts issue all the time. Look for ways to set things right.  Make everyone whole. The web should have remained open. Google and Facebook didn't respect that. So undo what they did. It's the way a programmer looks at things, and imho that's the right way, because it's tech we're talking about setting right. Usually they don't consult techies in these things, however.</description>

			<description>I hope Trump does his rally in Florida tomorrow. His supporters should see him in his all his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekChFdIe00&quot;&gt;Captain Queeg&lt;/a&gt; paranoia. Explaining the strawberries and how no one listens to him. Calling for a former president who many of them voted for to be put in jail, or perhaps worse. Maybe some of them will be shaken out of their entertainment stupor and realize this is the president of the United States, a formerly great country that is being flushed down the toilet because people in the middle of the country feel unappreciated, bored and purposeless.</description>

			<title>Packing the court</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The court at 6-3, if it gets to that, will be far out of sync with the people they're meant to govern. This has to be resolved somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution doesn't say what we should do, but it isn't up to the Dems, and I wish Harris had said that in the debate, it's up to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people will demand it, as soon as it becomes apparent that the court as configured is going to reverse Roe v Wade.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, if it is a huge win for Dems, they will be mandated to do something else. Change the Constitution so we have a democracy, not something that can be so easily hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press has a lot of gall trying to pin the Dems to &quot;packing&quot; the court. The press are citizens too, and voters, and have an interest in how the country works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They should ask themselves, before trying to make a controversy, in alliance with the Repubs, do they accept a 6-3 conservative majority?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This circles back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/theViewFromNowhere.m4a&quot;&gt;View From Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;. Now is the time for the press to stop and think, am I in favor of the United States? That is not too big a conflict of interest to carry. Then you should be careful when you try to create controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember how the press set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillary's Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; thing. Don't back us into a corner. We're going to have to reconfigure the court if the Repubs do what they plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will have to do it. President Biden will do it for us. Stop ignoring the people. We are the government. We really are. That will be more clear at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, this time I tried to watch the debate, but gave up after a few minutes. Pence lies and spins. I find it insulting to be lied to that way. And then he talks over his limit, way over. Then you realize he's setting it up so that when he starts answering the question he was asked, it's already past the time limit, so the moderator keeps interrupting him with &quot;Thank you Mr Vice President.&quot; Until finally he stops. At her request. That was enough for me. I heard about the fly on Twitter, and thought that was interesting. Probably the fly was a messenger from the alien robot spaceship parked in synchronous Earth orbit, relaying messages from the Home Planet to the robot Pence. Or a robot supplying a booster for Pence's adderall and steroids cocktail. Possibly Ruth Bader Ginsburg reincarnated as a fly? The mind drifts to other topics and there was a hellacious windstorm going on outside, so I quit early. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001509.html?title=26YearsBlogging&quot;&gt;26 years&lt;/a&gt; ago today. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKKLIrOGfUo&quot;&gt;the song&lt;/a&gt; for that occasion. I was so much older then I'm younger then that now. Of course when I woke up I had no idea. Totally spaced it out. Thanks to my friend Geraldine, one of my constant readers, for pointing it out. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>
