			<description>Do you wear a mask with a slogan or image?   If so, what do you wear? Include a picture if you can. ;-)  What's the best mask you've seen? Maybe the national mask should have an American flag on one side and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt; on the other. Redefine unity as including all Americans. And let's win this together. Love America. All of America.</description>

			<description>American &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/american-exceptionalism-was-our-preexisting-condition/2020/07/22/158f5ab0-cabc-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html&quot;&gt;exceptionalism&lt;/a&gt; was our preexisting condition. Very well-put. We were accustomed to bringing chaos to foreign lands, but the combination of Covid and Trump brought the war home. We thought we were immune. Above it all. Exceptional. Why else would we have the chutzpah to elect a gross and obvious incompetent as president. We're lucky it was just Covid-19 and not Eboloa, we'd all be dead by now if that happened during Trump.</description>

			<description>Good progress on the new BingeWorthy. The big difference in this version is that you can submit programs, no need to go through me. How it works. Find the page for the show on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/&quot;&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;. Choose the &lt;i&gt;Submit a program&lt;/i&gt; command from the &lt;i&gt;Main&lt;/i&gt; menu. Enter the URL of the page. The server reads the file on Metacritic, extracts the Facebook and Twitter metadata from the page, using the title in our database. I just want to be sure it's a real program, keep out the spam. I have some ideas for new UI's. But the main goal, as before, is to learn about worthwhile streaming programs.</description>

			<description>Trump is such a fool. Trying to invent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/politics/migrant-caravans-trump-immigration/index.html&quot;&gt;domestic enemy&lt;/a&gt;, but we already have one, killing 1000 of us every day. And itâ€™s his job to fight the virus. Instead he attacks moms and blames Black people.</description>

			<description>On Maddow last night, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ho&quot;&gt;virologist&lt;/a&gt; interviewed. The biggest mistake the US made is not going into total lockdown. We should still do it. Travel should be stopped until the rest of the country catches up with NY metro area. We will get re-infected if they don't.</description>

			<title>Object initializers in ES6</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A situation that comes up a lot in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+javascript&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; code: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var tvShow = {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;id: id,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;title: title,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;network: network&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you type it you think geez there's got to be a better way, and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of JavaScript, there is.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var tvShow = {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;id,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;title,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;network&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since usually the only thing you're going to do is pass it off to a subroutine to save it in a file or database, you could do it this way:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;saveShow ({id, title, network});&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the old more cumbersome notation you probably wouldn't do this, but now I find I do, esp if there is only one property to initialize. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line is I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/22.html#a134842&quot;&gt;don't mind&lt;/a&gt; two ways to do something if the new way is a simplified version of the old way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Portland could send a handful of plain clothes cops to DC to arrest the temporary acting secretary of Homeland Security. Grab &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Wolf&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; off the street, into an unmarked car with DC plates, fly him back to Portland, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/10/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-justice-department/index.html&quot;&gt;lock him up&lt;/a&gt;, and put him on trial for kidnapping. He's a nice looking guy, he'd probably look great in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Penitentiary&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The virus will kill many thousands, very soon. It's running uncontrolled through the population. This is what Trump does so well, change the subject.</description>

I hadn't thought of this before, but it's time to raise an issue with the World Court, in preparation for (we hope) trials for crimes against humanity. That's the scale we're operating at right now. We need to fight the pandemic. Our government is using it as a weapon against the people.</description>

			<description>The tech industry is like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_selling_pharmaceutical_products&quot;&gt;pharma&lt;/a&gt;, they only make products that have huge financial upside. That means there are lots of drugs for cancer, arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic diseases, ones that might not kill you right off, but require lifetime use. This is like virality and lock-in in tech. Tools that don't bring in other users, or get you addicted can't make a ton of money. They might be worthwhile though, they might help someone figure something out that saves humanity, for example.</description>

			<description>The reason came to me in a dream. The politicians and their masters arenâ€™t saving our lives because thereâ€™s no money in it for them. But pharma sees big bucks in a vaccine and even more in a treatment. I hear the vaccine might require a booster every few months. They must love that. Every human on the planet would need it. Think of the enormous cash flow for the holder of that patent.</description>

			<description>I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW-Madison&lt;/a&gt; for a visit a few years ago and got a tour of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://discovery.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;new building&lt;/a&gt; created to generate &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.wisc.edu/tag/patents/&quot;&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;. But it didn't appear it was used for much. Extravagant and luxurious. Very unlike a typical utilitarian campus building at a large state school. I learned they built it to recruit a professor who generated billions from patents, and I guess they felt was likely to continue to do so. The money apparently flows to the university, but the professor gets to work in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal&quot;&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt; of campus buildings. Not sure. But it was &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; impressive, and surprising.</description>

			<title>A new coding construct?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a language design question, not a coding question.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This bit of code comes up all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if (callback !== undefined) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;callback ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to try to come up with a clean way to say that so it would still be obvious what's happening, but would save you from having to check it so often.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically I want to call the callback if the caller specified one, otherwise, do nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just putting that out there, not offering a solution to the puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Later...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How about this syntax&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if possible callback ();&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; might be a new keyword that's something like a &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; but not as serious. In other words, don't get upset if this doesn't work. On the other hand, it's not much more concise than the original expression, and it doesn't say anything about what you expect not to work about it. Really for anything other than &lt;i&gt;undefined&lt;/i&gt; I probably want an error to be thrown so I can find the problem and fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not an Applescript type person, I think programming can't be a spoken language, but I also don't go so far as to say programming is like linear algebra or differential calculus (both of which I took in college). I like words that mean something when I read them, both in human language and programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another random thought, not a big fan of using &lt;i&gt;let&lt;/i&gt; as a new kind of declaration. I imagine they chose it because that's what BASIC used, but why would a nice Algol-like language use BASIC as prior art. I actually like how we did it in Frontier:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;fileloop (f in &quot;tmp/&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;local (fname = file.fileFromPath (f))&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;file.rename (f, string.upper (fname))&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;fname is only accessible in the body of fileloop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;local&lt;/i&gt; is the keyword for declaration. It says fname is declared here, in this scope, and it is only accessible here.  I think it does a better job of explaining itself than &lt;i&gt;let. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even later...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Allen Wirfs-Brock suggested via email, that JavaScript already has this feature, he sent a link to the docs, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it. I said how the hell do you pronounce that? That's where the comment about linear algebra and differential equations came from, above.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well he started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs/status/1284945363531493376&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter asking how people pronounce this feature that as far as I can tell does not have a name? It's an instant classic of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/15/21325708/twitter-hack-global-security-crisis-nuclear-war-bitcoin-scam&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2020/07/16/more-than-just-a-twitter-hack/&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the risks associated with Twitter, hacking and misinformation, after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/former-twitter-employees-sleuthing/index.html&quot;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; of last week. There's an even bigger risk. Twitter itself could be bought for 1/2 of $28 billion, the company's valuation according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/&quot;&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; price. That's a fraction of the net worth of a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2020&quot;&gt;billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. And you could probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout&quot;&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition, so you would need much less than $14 billion to pull it off. Basically Twitter itself, legally, is very insecure. We're depending on something a bad actor could take over, legally. I've been writing about this for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. I hope other people tune into it before it actually happens. (Do you think Peter Thiel hasn't thought of it? Don't be naÃ¯ve.)</description>

			<source:outline text="People are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/15/21325708/twitter-hack-global-security-crisis-nuclear-war-bitcoin-scam&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2020/07/16/more-than-just-a-twitter-hack/&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; the risks associated with Twitter, hacking and misinformation, after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/former-twitter-employees-sleuthing/index.html&quot;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; of last week. There's an even bigger risk. Twitter itself could be bought for 1/2 of $28 billion, the company's valuation according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/&quot;&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; price. That's a fraction of the net worth of a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2020&quot;&gt;billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. And you could probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout&quot;&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition, so you would need much less than $14 billion to pull it off. Basically Twitter itself, legally, is very insecure. We're depending on something a bad actor could take over, legally. I've been writing about this for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. I hope other people tune into it before it actually happens. (Do you think Peter Thiel hasn't thought of it? Don't be naÃ¯ve.)" created="Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:21:46 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/18/twitter.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/18.html#a142146"/>

			<description>Biden is now getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-warns-of-russian-election-meddling-after-receiving-intelligence-briefings-idUSKCN24J02N&quot;&gt;intelligence briefings&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, someone is actually reading them. I bet his staff is planning on how to address each of the issues. Anyway, for now he says both Russia and China are interfering with our election and he says what you'd hope a president would say. BTW, &quot;meddling&quot; is the wrong word, meddling is what a Jewish mother does. What Russia did in 2016 was an act of war. Americans are dying because of what they did.</description>

			<description>I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;  to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;. I like it because it's clean and simple. They gather reviews of lots of pubs, rate them on a scale of 1-100, and they give the movie or show a rating based on the average. A show with an 80 or higher is must-watch.</description>

			<description>I was talking with a friend yesterday about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen&quot;&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt;. We both felt that he had been unfairly &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woody+allen+condemned&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt;. And yes the word &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/woody-allen-memoir-canceled-hachette-outrage-1202216039/#!&quot;&gt;applies&lt;/a&gt; to his experience. He's one of the great film makers of our time. The movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(1979_film)&quot;&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; came up in our discussion, I saw it was playing on Amazon, so I watched it. What an incredible movie. People forget that Allen wrote the movie, so any flaws you see in the main character, and they sure are there, were put there &lt;i&gt;by him. &lt;/i&gt;In the end you feel his heartbreak at having been so dismissive of Mariel Hemmingway's character, she was so much more wise than him, even though she was so much younger. I had forgotten that Diane Keaton was in the movie. It's a masterpiece.</description>

			<title>Simple is not stupid</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people seem to think I'm realllly stupid. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think it's because I strive for simplicity in my work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened right from the start, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt;. I factored it for years, until it was super easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The others said they could do it in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Heh. They couldn't&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the next version, we added a blindingly complex feature, cloning. It was actually also pretty simple, but when you demo'd it, you could see their minds exploding. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hooo, what was that? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Technology. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ohhhh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to impress them if you want them to believe you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Biden appears to be doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html&quot;&gt;what I hoped he would&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to suck in as much of the Republican Party as possible. Yesterday I saw AOC pointed out that the Dem Party is a conservative party. That's cool, so maybe we'll end up with 3 or 4 parties out of this instead of 2. And we can have governments that aren't all one or the other. We keep doing and undoing, with little consistency in American govt over the decades. Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. Biden is the single most comfortable Democrat for Repubs. Good. Let's have a unity government that isn't completely nuts. Let's get used to compromising and working together. Let's have some goals, and not drift from them. I know it's a lot to hope for.</description>
