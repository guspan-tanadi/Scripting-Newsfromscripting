			<title>Rule 1: No breakage</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+userland&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, a company I founded a long time ago, we had a rule called Rule 1. It said simply: No breakage. It meant you couldn't change the environment such that apps that ran in version N did not run in version N+1. It meant you took longer to release a new version because once released, you had to live with it forever. This rule came from bad experiences when we did things that broke users and developers. Since we were both the developers of the platform and users of the platform we had a realistic perspective of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was once having a discussion with someone who wanted to implement a successor to Frontier, intending it to be compatible with Frontier, in some way, but right at the beginning said he was going to make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity&quot;&gt;case-sensitive&lt;/a&gt; where Frontier is not case-sensitive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to debate anyone who thinks this is anything but insane. I'd win the argument re Frontier for two reasons: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. Frontier is not case-sensitive, and &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. Rule 1, no breakage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As we were originally developing the environment in the early 90s, we didn't give this much thought, but at the last minute a beta user it pleaded that it would be a tragic mistake to make it case-sensitive, so we changed. Never regretted the decision. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To programming neophytes, a language is case-sensitive if HelloGoodbye is a different name from helloGoodbye. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rule 1 was not a joke, it was dead serious. I was sick of programmers who choose to break users and developers. I had worked with a deprecator, for years, and learned the hard way that a development process that permitted user breakage was not much of a process. Eventually the users will go somewhere where they aren't always having to start over because a programmer changed their mind about how something should work. Sometimes breakage happens, all rules have exceptions, but you have to work really hard to avoid those situations, and usually there's a way to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When a language goes out of its way to say Rule 1 demands no breakage, not Rule 27, or Rule 18b, but Rule 1, the first, the one that all other rules follow, well you can't break that rule and still say you're doing the thing you say you're doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jake Savin, a UserLander and friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakesav.in/2011/08/18/hey-firefox-thanks-for-forcing-me-to-switch-to-chrome/&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Rule 1 in the context of Firefox, which most definitely is not a Rule 1 product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rule 1 was mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kernel.scripting.com/faq#whyUseTheGpl&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; announcing Frontier's release as open source in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned Rule 1 in re arguments about whether it mattered &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09/29.html#rule1&quot;&gt;if RSS broke publishers&lt;/a&gt; and aggregator developers. I insisted on Rule 1 there too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rule 1 came up in a piece about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/11/152423.html?title=reallySimpleJavascriptDay3#a153245&quot;&gt;Really Simple JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Stop scapegoating Birx</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/health/live-news/covid-pandemic-doctors-cnn-special/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN's two-hour special&lt;/a&gt; last night, with interviews with some of the doctors from the last administration on what went wrong. All of these people sold us out to some extent, including Fauci, just by staying in their jobs. None of them admitted last night that they were as complicit as they were. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Birx&quot;&gt;Deborah Birx&lt;/a&gt; takes the fall for everyone, and that's wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People say what if Birx had quit, with a statement about how the Trump administration was botching it, that could have made a difference. But it couldn't have. Anyone who was paying attention knew what Trump et al were doing, including news people. Yet they made the story every night about how Trump and his minions were screwing up. If you report that every night, as they did, it stops being news pretty quickly, and becomes a copout, a coverup of the cowardice of journalism. Tell me something that isn't common knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the press wanted to make a difference, they could have changed the story from &quot;Trump Sucks&quot; to &quot;This is what we need to do today.&quot; They could have found a way to tell us where the virus was storming and where it was quiet. They could have, instead of coasting along in neutral, tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&quot;&gt;save lives.&lt;/a&gt; For some reason they didn't see this as their job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another idea. They could have led the charge to impeaching Trump. Here's the story: Trump is killing us, now wtf are we going to do about it? Had Wolf Blitzer said that I would have plotzed on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They could have done what Trump was supposed to be doing, but (guessing) they were too scared to step out of their comfortable role, which is ironically what people hypocritically accuse Birx of. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But last night it was good journalism on CNN's part, &lt;i&gt;now,&lt;/i&gt; to sit all these people down, while they're all accessible and their memories are fresh and the pandemic is still ongoing, to get them on the record. It's not an autopsy yet, as they were saying it was, because the story is not over, the patient is still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The key failures in this pandemic so far have been the government and journalism, imho about equally. I'm glad we are starting to be honest about what happened in government, we probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/28.html#a153234&quot;&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; will be open about what's going wrong in journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Arnett/e/B06VVR3DX6%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share&quot;&gt;Nick Arnett&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. He used to be a tech journalist, but in recent years, he's become a public service person. He has been on the front lines of fighting fires in California. Most he's recently has been working in Oakland, helping people get their Covid vaccinations at the Coliseum. This morning he asked for help on Facebook. They needed a simple app that could tell them when 15 minutes and 30 minutes were. These are the amounts of time people have to wait before leaving, to be sure that if they have a bad reaction to the vaccine, that they can be helped by medics. Makes sense that in the middle of everything else they have to do, adding 15 and 30 to the current time is a bit much to ask. I said I would be happy to do it. Just a small JavaScript project. I was glad to help. The result is this site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://timeshifter.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;timeshifter.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible other vaccinators could use it, if so please pass it on.</description>

			<description>From the Something-Users-Don't-Understand-But-Could Department. Developing software is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. It's analogous to building a bridge. Start by pulling a wire across the river. Use it to pull up another wire. When you have enough wires, bundle them to create a thicker wire, and use it to pull up something bigger. Eventually you have two thick cables going across the body of water. Use the cables to pull up a roadway. Build on-ramps and off-ramps and toll booths. But you can't build things out of order, and sometimes things are added earlier for features that won't be added until later in the bootstrap process. People who have evolved products know about this. And you never see it more clearly than when you're building your second  or fifteenth or 200th bridge. By that point, you figure, if the users really wanted to understand they could, because they're teaching classes about it in universities.</description>

			<description>We should dream about what if the tech companies wanted to build a more customizable network, one that works better for users, not advertisers. The answer to every one of these ideas is: &lt;i&gt;They'll never do it.&lt;/i&gt; That's what makes it fun.</description>

			<description>As I'm developing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/24/161331.html?title=drummersKeyInnovation&quot;&gt;Frontier-like product&lt;/a&gt;, I'm remembering how much I didn't like some of the developers we attracted. We used to believe in the goodness of everyone, but forgot the humanity, and that as a community grows, eventually you attract &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who try to make your life miserable. The pressure of dealing with these people literally made me sick. I got better as soon as I stopped. We've learned a lot about moderating community systems since then. So I'm going to keep my promise to myself, this project is mainly for me, because I want it, and I love the idea of other people using it, and helping each other, and that includes me, but when they start abusing me, I'm turning them off without a second thought.</description>

			<description>If I could make everyone listen to one episode of one podcast it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/08/25/546127444/episode-790-rough-translations-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. It's from 2017 and explains how Ukraine dealt with Russian fake news attacks. Everything Putin is doing in the US, he did first in Ukraine. Ukraine, like us, had high ideals about free speech and censorship. Eventually they came to the correct conclusion. At the first sign of trolling, shut them down. In the US today we should have no misgivings about having deprived Trump of his global platform. Let him build his own. It'll work much better. People will only have to hear from him if they want to.</description>

			<description>One reason I ask questions about the process by which people want to deprive a person of their life, is that it's come to the point where they want to erase an accomplished person because they don't like his ideas, or the questions he asks. When I read the accusations, I cross out all of those, give them no weight at all. It's fine if you don't like his ideas, now mind your own business. Why do I care? A couple of reasons. Offensive questions and foreign ideas help me think through my own values, and sometimes I find a way to compromise, and sometimes I even change my mind. I don't mind discomfort. I check to see if I'm in any danger, or if anyone else is, and if the answer is no, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Live%20and%20Let%20Live&quot;&gt;live and let live&lt;/a&gt;. The second reason is that some people find &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; ideas offensive. I write every day. I don't know why but this has great value to me. I can imagine a mob of internet &lt;s&gt;assholes&lt;/s&gt; people deciding that my ideas are too offensive to be permitted. If I can imagine that then I have to question it when it's happening to someone else. It's called empathy.</description>

			<description>When I lived in California people would always ask &quot;Why is he like that?&quot; The answer may simply be that I'm from New York. NYers are just as likely to tell you to fuck off as to say good morning or have a nice day. They mean basically the same thing. It's like &quot;namaste&quot; -- the divinity in my being acknowledges the divinity in yours. When you're in California you have to tone it down, a lot, or they'll kill you with passive aggressiveness. NYers are more transparent. You don't have to guess how they feel about something as much.</description>

			<description>I regret turning off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postingandtoasting.com/2021/3/26/22351476/knicks-106-wizards-102-grind-them-down&quot;&gt;Knicks game&lt;/a&gt; last night with two minutes left in the 4th quarter. They were behind by too many points, and they weren't playing well. I figured this game is gone. I was surprised the starters were still playing. Much later I saw fan exclamations on Twitter, that seemed to say the Knicks had won. They did. I've learned my lesson. This season's Knicks are special. They win games they have no right winning. The roll over Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beale like they were the rookies and the Knicks were the team packed with franchise players. It's like the 2015 Mets, perhaps. I honestly don't care if the Knicks make the playoffs. They have such heart, such love for themselves and each other. It's pure joy to watch them play.</description>

Much later I saw fan exclamations on Twitter, that seemed to say the Knicks had won. They did. I've learned my lesson. This season's Knicks are special. They win games they have no right winning. The roll over Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beale like they were the rookies and the Knicks were the team packed with franchise players. It's like the 2015 Mets, perhaps. I honestly don't care if the Knicks make the playoffs. They have such heart, such love for themselves and each other. It's pure joy to watch them play." created="Fri, 26 Mar 2021 14:37:37 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/26/rjBarrett.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/26.html#a143737"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Spectrum%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; isn't finished with me. Yesterday they turned off my TV service. Not clear why. But after a long day's work I had to have four separate phone conversations with their reps, over three hours, to get it working again. I paid my bill, etc. They just have no idea what they're doing imho. Anyway, Spectrum is making me buy an AppleTV in order to watch the Knicks. The AppleTV will stay in its box and go into a closet, where I will pay a monthly fee for it. I already have two AppleTVs, and I don't use either one. Too many remotes, too many different UIs. Once i get over the sheer waste of it, the price is actually competitive. YouTubeTV costs about the same, w/o the AppleTV. And YTTV does not have the Knicks. Where I live there is no other way to get the Knicks. I actually think this is true for the entire NY area. And before you tell me about Fubo, they don't have the Knicks either.</description>

			<title>What's going on</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A truth that comes home regularly, every generation, no matter how smart they think they are, has their share of idiots. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every generation thinks they know what's really going on, when they're young, only to realize in a few years that they have absolutely no idea what is going on.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The maturing process all the way to the end is about steadily realizing this truth, more and more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't really know about the end yet -- I'm just extrapolating. It could be that the actual end is a revelation and at that point you really do know what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KC7uhMY9s&quot;&gt;special treat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Drummer's key innovation</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on yesterday's news about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, its key innovation is that you can write JavaScript code that's much simpler because it does not need to use callbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dns.getDomainName (dns.getDottedId (&lt;a href=&quot;http://liveblog.co/&quot;&gt;liveblog.co&lt;/a&gt;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This works even though both DNS operations do I/O.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are using JavaScript's threading, we are not blocking the CPU. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A programmer in any other language will be scratching their head wondering what's the big deal. I know. I've been saying that for years. If Python can do this, I don't see why JavaScript shouldn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: JavaScript as spec'd &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; do this. But we were able to make this work with a very simple pre-processor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is a callback?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I looked around for a decent explanation of JavaScript callbacks, but they take too long to get to the point, or they never explain what they are. Maybe it's too hard to explain? I've been writing a lot of docs lately, so let me try! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Callbacks are used when an operation is going to take a long time and your program wants to do other things while it's waiting. So you create a function to run when the operation is done, and provide that function to the slow operation you're calling with the intent that it will call this function when it's done. Thus it is a &lt;i&gt;callback&lt;/i&gt; function. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;fs.readFile (&quot;notes.txt&quot;, function (err, filetext) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;if (err) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;console.log (err.message);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;else {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;console.log (&quot;The file contains &quot; + filetext.length + &quot; characters.&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;});&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;console.log (&quot;Hi mom!&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look in the console, you'll see:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hi mom!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The file contains 28 characters.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example of a real world callback. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After you upload a video to Facebook, you'll get a dialog when the upload is done saying this is going to take a bit of time to process, so we'll let you know when it's done. In the meantime you can read stuff. When the video is ready, you get a message saying you can watch the video now. That's the basic flow of a callback. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>When Medium shrugs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; has been around since 2011, getting pretty close to ten years, and in that time, they have switched business strategies many times. The appear to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81&quot;&gt;done it again&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/#a210323p19&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. So here's another opportunity to take stock of writing on the web, and where we have been and what could change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, I got a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1374541139970260996&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; from Jay Rosen thanking me for pushing him to keep his own web presence, to not depend on any of the platforms. It's gratifying to see a longtime friend doing so well with this approach.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Jay then sent me a link to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jabberwocking.com/why-have-blog-audiences-declined-over-the-past-decade/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Drum asking why blogging has declined in the past decade. I think there's more to it than what Drum says, that the disappearance of Google Reader, while it certainly hurt the cause, is only part of the puzzle. The problem is that I can't write on my blog and share it with the popular publishing platforms without limiting what I can do with my blog. If you add up all the limits of Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader and Medium, then you can't blog at all because their requirements are contradictory. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One requires titles and two don't allow titles. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Facebook doesn't support the basics of blogging, links, simple styles, podcast enclosures and (again) titles. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Medium supports most of what you would want them to support but doesn't allow updating, so if you make a change you have to do it by hand. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;None of them want to peer with blogs. They all insist you do your writing with their tools of greatly varying quality, and some are reallllly bad. Even the new hope of writers everywhere, Substack, requires you to use their editor. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So, trying to keep this short as possible, in 2017 I gave up trying to peer with any of those services, and went back to writing my blog the way I like to write, and the lights came back on. It works again. So the moral of the story imho is to forget about peering, and just blog the way you want to, and I think we can all be happy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I mentioned Google Reader in the list of limiting environments. Oddly, even though it's long gone, it is still controlling how we blog. They didn't support the full RSS spec, they don't handle posts without titles. And all the replacements for Reader copied their limits, so even though it's gone, it's influence is still strong, contributing limits to blogging that weren't here before they came and went. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is Twitter's character limit protecting Medium? If so, please now would be a good time to change course. Twitter is only increasing in importance. I would love to seem them make a deliberate effort to do all that RSS can do in transporting web writing, so we can start building again, from a sane base. As much as I love Twitter, its constraints are still unbearable. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;One more thing. We're still waiting for independent writers to take the lead here, as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/18/141318.html?title=itsNotReallyAScam&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; last week. &quot;Until the writers lead here, you're going to keep having your hearts broken and the tech for writing on the web will continue to go nowhere.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been doing a lot of work on web scripting for the last few months. Put everything else aside. I think I'm ready to create a small subset of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; that runs in the cloud. Basic components are outlining of course, twitter and a cloud-based file system. Scripts run from a user-editable menu as they did in Frontier. Still major things to work out, it's probably months away. But I might start sharing little bits of the work I'm doing, to get discussions going, esp with Frontier alums. The language is JavaScript, but here's the thing -- we don't need callbacks for asynchronous operations, it flows just like any other language. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; figured out the escape from callbacks, that was what convinced me that you could make a scripting system based on JavaScript. BTW, the codename for the project is Drummer.</description>

			<description>One curious thing from working on Drummer: I like working on verb docs. I find it relaxing, satisfying, rewarding. I just realized why. I'm writing a book. At the top level the structure is rigid. I like working within such a structure. By verb docs, I mean docs like what you &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/file/exists&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/&quot;&gt;DocServer&lt;/a&gt; from Frontier, which is still running, btw. The difference is this time I'm writing the docs. Last time I didn't have the energy to do it, but now it's the structure for my review of various aspects of the system. Reading the verb docs you'll know I went through that verb's functionality before release. Of course I'm also documenting the bugs.</description>

			<description>In my experience, most programmers don't care how things came to be the way they are. I'm different, I always want to know the story. I find this the most fascinating thing about us humans, how do we synthesize ideas, build on other people's work. More common is people try to ignore the past, esp if it interferes with their success.</description>

			<title>NFTs contain a good idea, and it's not the money</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't care for the money in NFTs, I don't really believe it's there, but what I do want is an alternative to patents to get people credit for their innovations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Patents have really screwed things up, but no one has ever picked up on the idea that we could have something like patents, but without the tarriff. I want people to know whose work they're using. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once I made enough money, I stopped trying to put barriers on where my ideas could flow. But as a result, I rarely have been able to finish an idea before a big company comes along and takes it over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a bad system, no way to win. If you have to join a big company to be creative, well you can see from that how little creativity there would be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What great musician or artist worked for a company like Google or Microsoft? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The potential of NFTs is it could document how ideas entered the world. I'd be fine if we took the money out of it, also the blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why is everything shit in America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Everything should be great in America, but it isn't. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FIrst watch this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/seyitaylor/status/1373646185311969285&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from a 60 Minutes interview with Fed chairman Lewis Powell on how he creates money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misperceptions about how money works, even among educated people, is that we have to pay for projects by raising taxes. The fact they're missing is that the Federal Reserve creates money. So we don't have to raise taxes to provide relief to victims of disasters. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When they say the debt is something our children and grandchildren will have to pay off, that's not true either. We can pay the debt by printing money. If we owe you $100 who's to say if we got that money by taxing Americans or simply by giving you new money we created for that purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Money has to start somewhere, and unlike a household budget, the US government has an infinite supply of it. Basically the only country with the power to create new money that can be spent everywhere is the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The United States is unique because our dollar is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt; for the world. So if say Egypt owes money to India, they pay them in dollars. If a small country is reserving some money for a future project, they store it in dollars. Our currency, unlike all others, is in demand all around the world. Which means we can give them dollars we just printed and they will send us goods that cost real money, because of course when we printed the money, it was real, simply because we printed it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We are the richest country there is, it's not &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=hyperbole&quot;&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;. And yet we have one of the worst benefit systems for our people in the world. If people really understood how this works (just re-read this piece) they would be enraged about how health, education, infrastructure, everything basically, in the US, is shit. You see this when you travel to Europe. A sense that everything is first class. And they don't have the economic advantage that we do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, why is it this way, such a rich country that lives so poorly? Some of it is the rich self-dealing, grift, the 1%, inequality, etc -- but a lot of is the dysfunction of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The quality of life for Americans hasn't been a priority in Washington, at least not until very recently. There is cause for hope of that changing. Just don't believe the politicians when they say something good for the people has to be &quot;paid for.&quot; Tell them you understand how it works, and the exact opposite is true, it does not ever have to be paid for. We, the United States, can buy whatever we want. And we need to start doing that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1373215191031222274&quot;&gt;long thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter today where people from Microsoft are reminiscing about the days when they put Netscape down, and then got in trouble with the DoJ. I remember those times differently, and very well. Microsoft was in no danger. They could have let Netscape grow, it never would have hurt them. For all of Netscape's bluster about &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14610341&quot;&gt;device drivers&lt;/a&gt;, they had a really bad codebase, and a chaotic team that while blessed with a product that the web was growing around, had a long way to go before they could compete with Microsoft.</description>

For all of Netscape's bluster about &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14610341&quot;&gt;device drivers&lt;/a&gt;, they had a really bad codebase, and a chaotic team that while blessed with a product that the web was growing around, had a long way to go before they could compete with Microsoft." created="Sat, 20 Mar 2021 21:39:20 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/16/mrWhiteBreakingBad.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/20.html#a213920"/>

			<description>Microsoft could played a senior role, and &lt;i&gt;helped&lt;/i&gt; the rest of us add all kinds of editors and databases to the web, and at least try to bring across some of the GUI innovations of the 80s. Instead all that was lost. Today, decades later, because of the chaos Microsoft brought us then, the editors on the web still suck. They are really inferior. Far less useful than the editors we had before the web. What if Microsoft had chilled and brought together the best minds from the PC era and asked some basic questions like how are we going to make the web better for everyone, at least as good as what we had before. What a time that would have been to do just that. But they acted like spoiled children. Andreessen et al could be excused, they really were basically children then. Gates had a dream of world domination forever, or at least until he was tired of it. So selfish, narcissistic, and so wrong. And the gloating and self-importance today, they still don't, even in retirement, understand that they held all of us back, that's why they failed to continue to dominate. Holding back progress is not ultimately a good strategy for world domination, esp at the leading edge of technology.</description>

			<description>BTW, I think Microsoft knew very well that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/01/90s-startup-terrified-microsoft-got-americans-go-online/&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt; was falling apart all on its own, but they used the device drivers crap to convince reporters that they were terrified of Netscape. Maybe they even sort of psyched themselves up for it, probably because they were bored. Who knows, but what could have been, and how much time we wasted, for their vanity.</description>
