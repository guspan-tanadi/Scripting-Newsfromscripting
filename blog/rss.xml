			<description>With better production tools and AI, and integration between them, it'll be possible to produce TV series about current events within weeks, then days, then perhaps almost instantaneously.</description>

			<description>When I was planning the third &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;, I realized at one point that I could, if I wanted, have every &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;discussion leader&lt;/a&gt; of every session be a woman. I didn't go for it, felt like a stunt. Discussion leaders are like editors or teachers. They choose people to speak. We tried to discourage people from raising their hands (hard to enforce). The discussion leader is also empowered to move the mike to another person via a monitor (a human being, usually a student), who &quot;owned&quot; the mike. That's why things kept moving. I didn't choose DLs based on their fame, though I admit sometimes I gave into that, I chose people who could think on their feet in a classroom setting. So I often went with teachers, if one was available. There was a rule that vendors couldn't talk about their product. That became an issue at BloggerCon III at Stanford because Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurs will whore their product no matter what you say. BloggerCon was a users conference. We need to get back to that. Not just marketing events, but where users get together to talk about what they're doing and what they want.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment#Season_4&quot;&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt; of In Treatment became unwatchable. I skipped the last two episodes with Colin. I came close to skipping the other patients, and the two episodes about the therapist and her boyfriend and drinking were most unwatchable, but since one of them was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvline.com/2021/06/28/in-treatment-recap-season-4-finale-brooke-eladio-colin-laila/&quot;&gt;finale&lt;/a&gt;, I watched it, and hated it. The season started off so good and the actors, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzo_Aduba&quot;&gt;Uzo Aduba&lt;/a&gt; are fantastic. I don't know who the writers are, but the characters they created are just foils for speeches on social issues. I don't mind, if there's some art to it. Something to think about. But they're at the level of decade-old Twitter rants, I've heard it all so many times before. At least with Twitter I have a mute button. The concept of the show is very good when there's suspension of disbelief. While this season started out great, in the end the story was bleh, and the telling of it cringe-worthy.</description>

			<description>I haven't been to NYC in two years, even though I live just two hours north of the city by car. The last couple of days my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sanforddickert.com/&quot;&gt;Sanford Dickert&lt;/a&gt;, who now lives in London, has been walking around the city with his iPhone on a stick, broadcasting his travels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sanford/videos/975431809884849&quot;&gt;over Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, conversing with people who speak to him in the comments. I tune in when I can when he does it in London, but this week I've been feeling homesick for NYC. It's still there, but also quite empty. I hadn't counted on that. Those streets are just begging for me to ride on them by bike. Hotel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kayak.com/hotels/New-York,NY-c15830/2021-07-07/2021-07-10/1adults?sort=rank_a;map&quot;&gt;rooms&lt;/a&gt; are still pretty cheap, a nice hotel goes for about $150 a night. I probably should go down for a few days before the summer is over. I do miss the city, which is surprising to me. I no longer have family there, maybe that's why I'm staying away?</description>

			<title>A sustainable web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see my former colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain&quot;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; about making the web future-safe. I'd love to work on this with him and others. I don't think the way we're going about it has much of a chance of working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we'll get better results sooner if we go for a sustainable web. That will require new financial structures and organizations that have longevity built into their models, for example, universities like Harvard. Insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say I want to give someone $10K to keep some of the domains I've registered going for say 100 years. And I give them say 10GB of static content. Add another $10K.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Set up systems to keep the archive of the static content up to date. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let it be cloneable so many vendors can provide this service for a fee, and let app devs create automatic flows on behalf of users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems it should be possible from there, if enough people and organizations pay money for longevity, at least it's a start.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One day on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Street&quot;&gt;Houston St&lt;/a&gt; in NYC, while I was visiting at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/footer/map.html&quot;&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of years, I was standing around, waiting for a student, not doing anything, daydreaming a bit, and all of a sudden there's a gorgeous, dark-haired young woman wearing a black dress, standing immediately in front of me. This is the kind of woman you see in Manhattan, perfectly made up, wearing a black dress that perfectly fits her body. They congregate here, somehow knowing this is where they should be. She is a Master of the Universe, can instantly command the attention of anyone she wants. And this godess wants to speak to me.&lt;i&gt;Me?&lt;/i&gt; What. It couldn't be. Must be a mistake. But in an instant, I realized this was the student I was waiting for. Of course she was talking to me. But in that split second my reaction was instinctual, not intellectual, a whole story had played out. I thought of this story the other day, while looking out of my house at a green mountain far in the distance, a field in the foreground, a stand of trees, a huge bird of prey flying overhead. Everything verdant, alive, ideal, perfect as a young confident aloof woman in a black dress in Manhattan. As impossible to describe as a whole. That I could be in such a place, that this scene had assembled itself with me in it, me. Me. How did this happen? At my advanced age, I'm just beginning to understand that I am part of this world.</description>

			<description>I'm really confused about what's up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/29.html#a131345&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, they clearly aren't archiving this blog in any meaningful way. I write this blog with history in mind. I put things here and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; because I want to be sure historians in the future will find at least one link to this stuff. If archive.org isn't backing it up, that's a big problem. And it raises an even bigger question -- what else aren't they archiving? And how do they decide what to archive and not to archive? Do they run the JavaScript on a page to get a rendering? If not, there's a huge amount of our knowledge that isn't being recorded. Are they trying to be neutral or do their friends and people who donate get preferential treatment?</description>

			<source:outline text="I'm really confused about what's up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/29.html#a131345&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, they clearly aren't archiving this blog in any meaningful way. I write this blog with history in mind. I put things here and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; because I want to be sure historians in the future will find at least one link to this stuff. If archive.org isn't backing it up, that's a big problem. And it raises an even bigger question -- what else aren't they archiving? And how do they decide what to archive and not to archive? Do they run the JavaScript on a page to get a rendering? If not, there's a huge amount of our knowledge that isn't being recorded. Are they trying to be neutral or do their friends and people who donate get preferential treatment?" created="Thu, 01 Jul 2021 12:37:40 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/02/taylorOnTucker.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/07/01.html#a123740"/>

			<description>I just did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22monthly+ritual%22&quot;&gt;monthly ritual&lt;/a&gt;, backing up June's blog, in OPML, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/06.opml&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, archive.org has &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;one snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the repo, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20201122120542/https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;11/22/2020&lt;/a&gt;. Anything after that is not in their database. (On further examination it seems the only took a snapshot of the top level of the repo, so it doesn't serve as a backup of the content of the blog.)</description>

			<description>The conclusion: archive.org, no matter how good it is and how ethical the people there are, is a last-resort way to backup the web. It can and should get better, but if we want to create a historic record of any kind about this era, we're going to have to be much more deliberate about it, even competitive. There are nothing but holes in our approach, all the way down to the architecture of the net itself, and at every level above it. We've created a very temporary way to record history. And like everything else, we aren't doing anything about it.</description>
