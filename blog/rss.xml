There's a lot of talk in the webs about locking them out. Big words but &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open&quot;&gt;not much power&lt;/a&gt; behind them. They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is -- who's being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn't mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn't one of them. You have to &lt;i&gt;think. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>But here's some good news. There's no guarantee that Facebook will be successful on terms that matter to them. Unless a half billion people use their service, it's probably not worth continuing, for a company the size of Facebook. Podcasting has withstood countless attacks like this, and has always been left standing as unsullied as ever. But podcasting is &quot;really simple&quot; and the benefit of federation is well known &lt;i&gt;to users.&lt;/i&gt; That's been what's kept it from being pwned by bigco's all these years.</description>

			<description>Also it'll be interesting to see how much of ActivityPub Facebook supports in their product. When Google Reader came out for RSS their trick was to break RSS by not supporting a key feature. This did huge damage that we're still dealing with long after Google is gone.</description>

			<title>The old weblogs.com feeling</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is we can all look at each other's feed lists to get ideas about what to subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was playing with ideas, looking at a bunch of different people's collections, and I saw in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1&quot;&gt;John Naughton's feed list&lt;/a&gt; a reminder of a centerpiece of the early blogging world, weblogs.com. You could quickly see which blogs had updated recently so you knew there was a reason to go there. It was the beginning of what eventually became Twitter, Google Reader, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over time as more blogs came online, it got diluted, we had to come up with something better and luckily &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; came along, and without much thought we switched over to that and weblogs.com fell into disuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20021123211136/http://www.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;archive.org snapshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/18/weblogsComScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of weblogs.com from November 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?username=jjn1&quot;&gt;Naughton's list&lt;/a&gt; I had the old weblogs.com feeling! These are all people I'm interested in, but I don't have them in their own category anywhere, so I never see it like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With a bit of coordination it would be pretty cool to have a FeedLand page that tracked a bunch more Old School bloggers who are still blogging, or give ones who aren't a reason to restart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/18/feedlistscreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Partial screen shot of Naughton's list shortly after this item was posted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>W3C and my RSS spec</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The W3C has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;my RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt; on their website. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/17/bottomharvarddoc.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;original document&lt;/a&gt; it says: &quot;The author of this document is Dave Winer, founder of UserLand software, and fellow at Berkman Center.&quot; Below that is a Creative Commons license which says: &quot;The content found on this site is made available under the terms of an Attribution/Share Alike Creative Commons &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All of that is missing from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/17/screenshotw3cdoc.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;W3C's copy&lt;/a&gt; of my spec. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/17/bottomharvarddoc.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the bottom of my spec. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/17/screenshotw3cdoc.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the bottom of their copy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's pretty obvious that it's my writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My name has been removed, as has the original license. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's wrong. They &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; fix that. My recommendation, just point the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;original document&lt;/a&gt; and forget about hosting a copy. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;Harvard website&lt;/a&gt; is not going anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sell Reddit to its users?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reddit as a business is going down a user-hostile path. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I had this idea, I wonder if a compromise is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They want to do an IPO. Why not sell it to the users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A tech company run for the benefit of its users. What an idea! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If ever there was a site that the users should own it's Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reddit could reboot as a non-profit or public benefit corp. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Run intelligently to keep costs to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get help from a foundation perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the things I did this morning was carefully read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API docs&lt;/a&gt; I wrote in 2002. This became a widely supported standard almost instantly on publication. There was a demand for it. At that time, being compatible at an API level was a competitive issue for blogging software. A must-have feature.</description>

			<description>Did you wonder why there were no Jan 6 crowds at either of Trump’s arraignments? Isn’t it obvious? Any would-be insurrectionists saw the Jan 6 folks get tried, convicted and put in jail. That makes the whole thing real. Americans of 2023 are soft. We’re the ones who got tax cuts from Bush while we were at war. We had no draft, no price controls. War was okay as long as we could ignore it. We’d rather have others make the sacrifices for us. We like to own guns to support our fantasy that we’re badasses, but truthfully we’d rather watch the revolution on TV than go to jail, esp for a crybaby snob like Trump.</description>

When you achieve a certain amount of wealth, you are declared a winner. A champion. There's a ceremony where you get a medal and a special kind of credit card that allows you entry to the VIP room wherever you go. In that room you have free drinks, the most comfortable chairs, fantastic snacks, for you and a guest. Everywhere you go people are required to salute you. All the benefits. You eat the best food, sit in first class, and you live in a very nice house or apartment where all your neighbors are also champs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that, sounds great right, but what do you give up? You can't make any more money. That's it. Your earning days are over. You won. Now find something else to do. You can't have more than one house, one car -- no private jets, you can't own sports teams or CNN. You have to live like a human being, not consume more than double what a non-champ consumes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like socialism or communism, deal with it. Because when you own 12 homes and fly around in your private jet, and consume hundreds of times more than you can possibly use, you're putting the continued existence, of all of us, in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: You get free guitar lessons too, and a nice guitar. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🎸&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My advice on quitting smoking -- get someone to lock you in a room where you can't get a cigarette for a solid week. That's the hardest part of quitting, getting over the physical addiction.</description>

I was stuck trying to figure out how to encode some text in a sticky corner. I had tried the first two methods I usually use, and neither worked. I was about to give up and back out of the feature when I thought to explain the problem to ChatGPT and ask for a suggestion, and it included pragmatic issues like it really mattered to me that I not have to bring another toolkit into the mix. It suggested something I hadn't considered, a third way, and it worked, and I can move on. How do you put a value on that kind of contribution? It's like a programming partner that knows everything basically and is always there to help out and doesn't charge for their time. Pretty amazing.</description>

			<title>For now, small is beautiful</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;People are concerned that Bluesky is so small. I'm not, I like that it's small, and I also like that there are no peers yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some part of me thinks the future of social networks is small, that we've seen how unwieldy they can be when they grow too huge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think we have to work on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;cross-platform API&lt;/a&gt; like the one we had with blogging. It didn't take long to create, and it was supported everywhere. WordPress still supports the API. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of every social network having their own API is workable if and only if we can put a layer on top of them that makes it possible to communicate with all. It'd be analogous to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite&quot;&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt; and the start of the internet. Peering is everything and then data formats. We have good &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt; for that too.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All we're waiting for is people to work together. It doesn't have to be everyone, just people who want to build something bigger than one particular brand of social network.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm doing a Bluesky thread writer and publisher. Here's an example of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/bingeworthy.bsky.social/post/3jxy72dbzxy2r&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; it published just now. I had ChatGPT write a story about the many kinds of bread in the world and pushed that out as a thread of nine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/12/threadCenterScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; at the end of business today. This was the first Node.js app I wrote for Twitter back in 2014, it was called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/06/twitterLovesLittlePorkChop.html&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you remember. Now it's the first app I wrote for Bluesky. Should have it usable in a day or two, knock wood. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@shoq/110516792922874801&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon what role &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; played in developing RSS, since he is often credited with co-developing it. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/110520163594030698&quot;&gt;what I wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;There was a lot of confusion about what RSS was until RSS 2.0 came out and the NYT adopted it. There was a thread based on RDF, and Aaron was credited as a contributor to that. I would ask those people what he did. I never worked with him. I saw some of his posts on their mail list and met him a few times at conferences. He was a precocious young person, obviously smart, but he didn't seem interested in what I was working on. That's about it.&quot;</description>

			<description>A small favor from ChatGPT, now when I'm working on a writing tool (basically always) I don't have to use my own writing for test cases. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/06/11/summer-love-s-everlasting-imprint.html&quot;&gt;here's&lt;/a&gt; &quot;150 words about the freshness of summer and how the best memories of love and happiness are summer memories.&quot;</description>

			<description>In general on social media if someone posts a bit that's an oft-repeated bit of wisdom from the cable networks, I delete it, esp if it's from someone I don't know. I could watch MSNBC if I wanted to. No need to practice such idiocratic punditry online, imho of course ymmv.</description>

A friend calls this &quot;screen lifestyle.&quot; I am a member of that club. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hear complaints about MSNBC and how their shows are just somewhat irritating mindless crap, the same bullshit you pay attention to with a small fraction of your mind to divide your time with other mindless crap. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I once got in trouble at a meeting in a scholarly environment when someone said to me, accusingly, that I listen to NPR to get the best information. I said no -- I listen to it because it relaxes me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC gives us what we want. We can be sure if we tune out for 5 minutes or 20, we won't miss anything because they never said anything new while we weren't paying attention. As soon as some news comes out, as it did the other day (Friday?) they revert to the usual mindless nonsense so as not to disturb us tuning out. The run the big headlines -- BREAKING NEWS -- so we can feel justified leaving it on, as if we're part of the news, but the panel is just telling each other jokes and laughing foolishly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I heard someone say that Friday Night Lights was that kind of show. For me it's the first ten or so seasons of Law and Order. It's the perfect programming for a tuned-out mind. I know the shows so well, I can often recite the lines as the actors speak. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We all know the species is over, we're not planning on doing anything about it, we just want to zone out passing the time waiting for the societal grim reaper to collect us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Who is privileged?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/20/mrSmith.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The last time I took a trip by airplane was right after I moved to the mountains in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/&quot;&gt;April 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I went from Albany to Austin to speak at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/&quot;&gt;journalism conference&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas. I resisted the invite, telling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/rosental-alves/&quot;&gt;genial professor&lt;/a&gt; who organized the conference that the audience would hate me, but he didn't accept that. He wanted me to come because it was the 25th anniversary of my blog, and by some counts the 25th anniversary of blogging. He wanted to celebrate, and after a while I couldn't resist, so I went. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was in the last days of #metoo when being a white male was something to be ashamed of, but I am not a person who takes that on. I am confident and sure of myself, that's the way I am. I asked my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, an ex-reporter at CNN and former colleague at Harvard to interview me, figuring that she knew me well and it would be a good interview, and by showing we had a good relationship maybe the criticism would be somewhat restrained.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I expected a few people in the audience tried to invalidate everything I said as if I was boasting -- saying basically of course you accomplished some good stuff because you had all the advantages. What I wanted to tell them and didn't manage to get across is that all the advantages couldn't make what I did easy, because when you do something outside of a big company, the people who work in big companies and other institutions resent it, and try to stop you, and they usually do stop it. But every once in a while, if you persist and think and listen and learn you can sneak one in, as we did with the new media (blogs, feeds, podcasting, social media) that came from our work. I felt it would be good if they heard the story because people should know how new things actually happen, rather than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/07/121413.html&quot;&gt;bullshit stories&lt;/a&gt; reporters tell. But this room of reporters wasn't having it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I had it to do over, I would have asked that we have a breakout session later where we could talk about all our privilege. Every person in that room slept in a comfortable clean bedroom the night before, was nicely dressed and clean. The vast majority had excellent educations and made good salaries with benefits, far above the standard of living of most people around the world. In other words before you point the finger, make sure you're not deflecting. And anyway, what's the point. You can learn from anyone, even people with much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;more power&lt;/a&gt; than you have and even if you don't like them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But you don't get do-overs, except in your imagination. Here we are over four years later and I'm still wishing I had thought it through better before-hand, because I expected what I got, and was left without much to say that convinced anyone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Live and learn. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="The last time I took a trip by airplane was right after I moved to the mountains in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/&quot;&gt;April 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I went from Albany to Austin to speak at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/&quot;&gt;journalism conference&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas. I resisted the invite, telling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://isoj.org/rosental-alves/&quot;&gt;genial professor&lt;/a&gt; who organized the conference that the audience would hate me, but he didn't accept that. He wanted me to come because it was the 25th anniversary of my blog, and by some counts the 25th anniversary of blogging. He wanted to celebrate, and after a while I couldn't resist, so I went." created="Fri, 09 Jun 2023 13:57:46 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/20/mrSmith.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/09/135738.html#a135746"/>
				<source:outline text="This was in the last days of #metoo when being a white male was something to be ashamed of, but I am not a person who takes that on. I am confident and sure of myself, that's the way I am. I asked my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_MacKinnon&quot;&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, an ex-reporter at CNN and former colleague at Harvard to interview me, figuring that she knew me well and it would be a good interview, and by showing we had a good relationship maybe the criticism would be somewhat restrained." created="Fri, 09 Jun 2023 14:06:38 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/09/135738.html#a140638"/>
				<source:outline text="As I expected a few people in the audience tried to invalidate everything I said as if I was boasting -- saying basically of course you accomplished some good stuff because you had all the advantages. What I wanted to tell them and didn't manage to get across is that all the advantages couldn't make what I did easy, because when you do something outside of a big company, the people who work in big companies and other institutions resent it, and try to stop you, and they usually do stop it. But every once in a while, if you persist and think and listen and learn you can sneak one in, as we did with the new media (blogs, feeds, podcasting, social media) that came from our work. I felt it would be good if they heard the story because people should know how new things actually happen, rather than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/07/121413.html&quot;&gt;bullshit stories&lt;/a&gt; reporters tell. But this room of reporters wasn't having it." created="Fri, 09 Jun 2023 14:10:46 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/09/135738.html#a141046"/>
				<source:outline text="If I had it to do over, I would have asked that we have a breakout session later where we could talk about all our privilege. Every person in that room slept in a comfortable clean bedroom the night before, was nicely dressed and clean. The vast majority had excellent educations and made good salaries with benefits, far above the standard of living of most people around the world. In other words before you point the finger, make sure you're not deflecting. And anyway, what's the point. You can learn from anyone, even people with much &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html&quot;&gt;more power&lt;/a&gt; than you have and even if you don't like them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 09 Jun 2023 14:03:15 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/09/135738.html#a140315"/>
				<source:outline text="But you don't get do-overs, except in your imagination. Here we are over four years later and I'm still wishing I had thought it through better before-hand, because I expected what I got, and was left without much to say that convinced anyone." created="Fri, 09 Jun 2023 14:05:14 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/09/135738.html#a140514"/>

			<title>Blaming Mr Fubar</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A follow-up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/08.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's posts&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn't really as depressed as it might have seemed because I have a way of dealing with everything seeming to be totally &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/06/09/fubar.html&quot;&gt;fubar&lt;/a&gt;. I have at least three approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, if there's nothing I can do about something I give myself the choice of not worrying about it. I'm just one person in a world of billions, and I basically have no power over any of the messes I was writing about yesterday. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Second, I remind myself that it always feels like everything is about to unravel. I was born in 1955, ten years after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy&quot;&gt;first nuclear weapon&lt;/a&gt; was used in war. When I was a draft-age teen, the Vietnam War threatened to become the first world wide nuclear war. We're still here, proving that maybe it wasn't as bad as it appeared at the time. (If you think that was bad, my parents' generation had to run for their lives from the Nazis and their Holocaust.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/20/shrek.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;And a third reason -- the young folk blame my generation, which is stupid, there are all kinds of boomers, people who marched for peace and to save the earth (I was one of them) and people who thought abortion was evil and there is no climate change, and we're all in it for ourselves so let it be. Blaming something as abstract as a generation is a way of shifting responsibility from yourself. Young people of today -- you're the ones who have to live with the world we're &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; creating now, why aren't you doing something about it? When you find the answer, you'll then understand why we didn't either. The human species appears to have been willfully driving off a cliff for my whole life, and as far as I can tell nothing will stop it. If you know what we can do, speak up and let's do it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So with all that in mind, today I'm going to drink some coffee, roll up my sleeves and write some software that helps dig us out of a hole I do understand and feel I might have some impact on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Namaste y'all! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
