			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/podcasts/the-daily/dejoy-postal-service-trump.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about Trump and the USPS. They present something as theory that I'm pretty sure is fact, that Trump is trying to and quite possibly succeeding at making the postal service incapable of doing its part in the November 3 election. Also, they got an important fact wrong, if this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/trump-mailboxes-sorters-usps-2020-election-louis-dejoy-20200816.html&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The author of the NYT story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater&quot;&gt;Luke Broadwater&lt;/a&gt;, said that disabling by-mail voting would not hurt Democrats more than Republicans. On the other hand, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png&quot;&gt;Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt;, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. &lt;b&gt;Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. &lt;/b&gt;So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction.</description>

			<description>I finished John Barry's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. I would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend it, if your goal is to learn as much as you can about the pandemic itself. In the afterword, Barry explains why the book isn't really about the pandemic, it's about how scientists collaborate. He used the pandemic as an example. I had pretty much already figured that out. So much information about the lives of the individual scientists. It went on and on. I skipped whole chapters. Now, I like a good story as much as anyone, but nothing about his tale made me care about them as people. And that isn't why I picked up the book. I want to learn as much as I can about influenza pandemics, because I'm living in the middle of one. To his credit, the book was published 15 years ago, long before Covid-19. I'm going to keep looking for a book that focuses on the science.</description>

			<description>BTW, then as now the government lied about the disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has since had his reputation somewhat cleaned up, was apparently not a very great president. Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video&quot;&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu. He theorizes that the terrible deal that Germany got was due to Wilson's flu, and if he had not gotten ill, maybe Germany wouldn't have gone fascist? The same story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/woodrow-wilsons-case-of-the-flu-and-how-pandemics-change-history&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker earlier this year. He also says the flu resulted in Wilson's stroke and disability. Perhaps a cautionary fact for our current president. Also interesting that there is no mention of &quot;influenza&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for Wilson! Amazing. I wonder how Trump's epitaph will read? I expect Covid-19 will be prominent.</description>

It went like this. &quot;I had to take my car in for service because an animal died in there.&quot; As far as I know only Randy Green caught it. I told her it was there to see if she was paying attention. I lied. It was there because I'm a space cadet. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Mouse invasion</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I've had two of mouse invasions in my car. One where a mouse chewed through a vent in my air conditioner, and the latest where a family of mice made a nest in the air conditioner and then proceeded to die! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ay ayay.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had the mouse family cleaned out by the local Subaru dealer, but the smell lingers, and now I have to figure out what to do. It's not a nice problem to have! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I know some are in dismay because the Democrats are appealing to Republicans, but they are doing the right thing. It's so much more important what we agree on than what we disagree about. We agree in the Constitution and government of laws. Right now, in 2020, that's what matters most. Later we can re-divide on issues, but right now, we have to organize for one thing: America.</description>

			<description>America is like Microsoft, I hope. They were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+microsoft&quot;&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt; in the 90s. Trying to destroy everything they didn't create. Later they calmed down, not deliberately, but it happened anyway. Now Microsoft is a big machine without much personality. Which is fine.</description>

			<description>I was sure that last night's virtual DNC was going to suck, but quite the opposite, it was riveting, great political TV. I can't wait for tonight's episode. Michelle Obama, the closer, was masterful. I hadn't heard anything from her since her last DNC speech. Imagine what watching Trump has been like for her. She knows how demanding the job is. She was generous with Trump and said he wasn't up for the job. Such an understatement. And she threw his &lt;i&gt;It Is What It Is&lt;/i&gt; line back at him. Kind of what you might say giving Trump's eulogy (since that's what he had to say about 150K American deaths he's responsible for). Great speech. Now tonight we get Bill Clinton. He gives great DNC. I've heard him speak in person a few times. Get ready. It's going to be something. But. The most powerful speech of the night was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrDMEvvNzU&quot;&gt;Kristin Urquiza&lt;/a&gt;. In case you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it, because there's one line in it that will stay with you, but you should hear it from her, the way she says it. Her father, a Trump supporter, died of the virus. The speech isn't long. Be sure not to miss it.</description>

			<title>Adams Farms in Kingston</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two reasons to live in this area. Blueberries and Adams marinara.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My mother would have turned 88 on Thursday. She was always on my case to eat more blueberries. She would be happy to know that I am. Esp this time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I live in blueberry country. It's peak blueberry season. I bought these at &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/locations/kingston/&quot;&gt;Adams in Kingston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries in season.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every place has one of these groceries. In New Orleans it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.langensteins.com/&quot;&gt;Langenstein's&lt;/a&gt;. In Menlo Park, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.draegers.com/&quot;&gt;Draeger's&lt;/a&gt;. In Woodside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertsmarket.com/&quot;&gt;Roberts&lt;/a&gt;. In the Hudson Valley -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/&quot;&gt;Adams&lt;/a&gt;. They make a lot of their own stuff. They get the best products. They have a farm where they grow a lot of the produce they sell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now we have peaches and all kinds of berries, local grown, fresh and delicious. In September that's when the apples arrive. Huge boxes of them. It's something to behold. New we have blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I'm telling you, their marinara sauce is the best. I know Adams is not an Italian name. But somehow they figured it out. Very fresh and delicious in every way. Previously my favorite marinara was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/San-Marzano-Pomodoro-Marinara-Sauce/dp/B00CXA1J14/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw-O35BRDVARIsAJU5mQUhOqC-6Uu6FYC5Tmcpcida0mGpAZxQZKZrdG5feJIzaeQsshg62_0aAp9uEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=232499064174&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=7378444453978147064&amp;hvtargid=kwd-383386643679&amp;hydadcr=4846_9629179&amp;keywords=san+marzano+marinara&amp;qid=1597765390&amp;sr=8-3&amp;tag=googhydr-20&quot;&gt;San Marzano&lt;/a&gt;. Very good. But Adams is better imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Adams marinara.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Interesting how people see the post office as a business to be killed because it didn’t return a profit, yet we gave $500 billion to private for-profit companies, no strings attached, and got nothing in return, all secret.</description>

			<description>I'm going to watch the DNC tonight, but there's great competition in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-playoffs-bracket-2020-standings-projections/15owf3ue8ug1g12k7jgud2b11w&quot;&gt;NBA playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, which starts today with games between the Nets and Raptors and then the Sixers and Celtics, two hot matchups. The basketball has been &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; this summer. I'm also super excited that &lt;a href=&quot;https://sportsnaut.com/2020/08/nba-world-reacts-to-carmelo-anthonys-dagger-to-send-blazers-to-playoffs/&quot;&gt;Melo made&lt;/a&gt; the playoffs, finally, with his new team the Portland Trailblazers. I knew all along that he wasn't a team leader, like LeBron or even Damian Lillard who leads the Blazers. He's a Hall of Fame supporting player. Too bad he was miscast all those years as an alpha. Imagine if Melo had been LeBron's sidekick. At least he's found a happy home now, and that's cool.</description>

			<title>NYC will rise again</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was first starting out as an entrepreneur in the early 80s, I had an Apple II product, and Apple was in serious trouble, judging by the stories in the press. I asked my lead investor what to make of it. Should we not ship our Apple product and port to the IBM PC? He asked what Apple's sales were. About a billion dollars. He said you can safely continue, companies with a billion dollars in sales don't disappear. He was right, of course. A year later they shipped the first Mac, and we were on board for the boom in 1986. Had we switched in 1983, we would have missed the boom, and been lost in the crowd of second-tier PC companies. On the Mac we had a chance to rise to the top, and we did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point of this story is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt; has 8 million people. Most of them are staying. Many of the people with the means to leave are leaving. The business environment in NY will change. All that office space will be used for something. Nature abhors a vacuum. And NYC will have a lot of space, to be used creatively, we expect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, the virus will weaken, like a hurricane as it moves inland. It won't go away, but the major damage is done as it makes landfall. At least judging from the 1918 pandemic. It was two years of hell, but the worst of it were the first waves, as it circled the world. In all likelihood that will also be the pattern of Covid-19. And remember, they never got a vaccine for the 1918 virus. It seems like we will have one, or more, and they will blunt the damage the virus does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that NYC is dead -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/nyc-is-dead-forever-heres-why/&quot;&gt;that's&lt;/a&gt; just opportunistic linkbait. That's who the author is. Famous as a promoter of himself. There isn't a whole lot of thought or science behind his theory that NYC is over. As with billion dollar PC manufacturers in 1983, cities of 8 million don't just &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/16/132137.html?title=horrorFilmPlot&quot;&gt;disappear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like the world we left behind in March of this year, however, the old NY &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; gone. But there will be a new New York. There probably isn't another city on earth so capable of reinventing itself. In the two generations my family has been in NYC, the city has already reinvented itself a few times. My mother, herself an immigrant, lived to have her world disrupted by a new wave of immigration. It's a good thing, even a great thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And humans are a resilient species. We get accustomed to new realities very quickly. We'll do fine. And NYC will rise again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A couple of things they changed in the iPhone UI, not sure how recently. To get the app switcher to come up, double-tap the home button. To take a screen shot, click the power button and the home button simultaneously. I will never remember these, but at least I will be able to find them on scripting.com. The problem with the way Apple changes this stuff, when you search for it, you find the old method. To get the new method you have to have as many followers as I do on Twitter. This is a bullshit way to run a platform, Apple.</description>

			<description>I had a little dinner party at my house in the country last night. People do this here. But not in the time of Covid. I haven't had a gathering at my house since last winter, but last night we chanced it. These are lovely people who I speak with them frequently online, but it was so much better to eat and imbibe in person, outside, under the stars. With the animals and bugs. Ideas flowed. We made new jokes, new memes. I promised to do things that I have since forgotten. What I will never forget is how much I enjoyed their company.</description>

			<title>BingeWorthy 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just flipped the switch, now the  new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy for TV&lt;/a&gt; has replaced the previous version. I think it's reliable enough to use going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you had an account on the original BingeWorthy, you should have one here as well. Most of what you did on the old BW has been ported to the new one, automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Notes on the new version. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your prefs start over. So you should visit Settings, in the system menu, the one you use to log in via Twitter, at the right edge of the menu bar.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also, any ratings added in the previous version after August 5 are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; preserved. That's when I ported the data.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is no concept of a private profile in this version. Your ratings are public. So people can walk a web of programs and people, as a way to look for new programs to binge, as well as finding people with similar tastes. Another form of serendipity. Finding out a close friend hates a program you think the best.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can share anything you can see, and most of it can be read without logging in. For example, here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my ratings&lt;/a&gt;. And here's the page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-sopranos&quot;&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/a&gt;. You can do a lot of surfing from those two links, wtihout logging in. You must log in to do your own ratings, of course. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can add programs to the database without my approval. This is a huge deal, because it's what kept the first BW from growing. People would recommend programs I knew nothing about. Which meant I had to discuss each one, and that grew really tiresome. After a while I stopped looking at the suggestions, realizing it was a deal-stopper for the product. First you have to find a page for the show on Metacritic. Then paste the URL of the page into a dialog in BingeWorthy. Look in the menu for &lt;i&gt;Submit a program.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've learned a lot about programming SQL since doing the fit BingeWorthy, so I have been able to streamline the server, factoring, producing a new package, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davesql&quot;&gt;davesql&lt;/a&gt;, which anyone can use, and it'll make other projects I have that use SQL easier to upgrade and maintain. The two major ones are River6 and feedBase. I plan to revisit each of those products after BingeWorthy settles down. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Docs for now are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/184&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt; we've used for support. Ask questions there, report bugs. Eventually I'll rewrite the official docs, and put that on this.how, and point to that instead. Consider this version beta, the product is almost done, but we're watching for problems, and expect to find them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The version number is 2.0.0. Like an odometer rolling over. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I just flipped the switch, now the  new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy for TV&lt;/a&gt; has replaced the previous version. I think it's reliable enough to use going forward." created="Sun, 16 Aug 2020 15:58:52 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/16/155847.html?title=bingeworthy2#a155852"/>

					<source:outline text="There is no concept of a private profile in this version. Your ratings are public.

					<source:outline text="You can add programs to the database without my approval. This is a huge deal, because it's what kept the first BW from growing. People would recommend programs I knew nothing about. Which meant I had to discuss each one, and that grew really tiresome. After a while I stopped looking at the suggestions, realizing it was a deal-stopper for the product. First you have to find a page for the show on Metacritic. Then paste the URL of the page into a dialog in BingeWorthy. Look in the menu for &lt;i&gt;Submit a program.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Sun, 16 Aug 2020 16:02:22 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/16/155847.html?title=bingeworthy2#a160222"/>
					<source:outline text="I've learned a lot about programming SQL since doing the fit BingeWorthy, so I have been able to streamline the server, factoring, producing a new package, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davesql&quot;&gt;davesql&lt;/a&gt;, which anyone can use, and it'll make other projects I have that use SQL easier to upgrade and maintain. The two major ones are River6 and feedBase.

			<description>I can't believe liberals are such cowards, idiots, so ignorant, such petty snobs -- they are eviscerating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader&quot;&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt; for having the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=temerity&quot;&gt;temerity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RalphNader/status/1294040427004399618&quot;&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; to read an &lt;a href=&quot;https://nader.org/2020/07/31/ralph-nader-letter-to-aoc/&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; he wrote to her, about causes she fights for. He has advice about organizing, something he knows about, has had enormous success with. I actually read his &lt;a href=&quot;https://nader.org/2020/07/31/ralph-nader-letter-to-aoc/&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, which is something I expect most of his critics didn't, because if they did, they would stop and think and maybe just maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=get+a+grip&quot;&gt;get a grip&lt;/a&gt;. For liberals, Nader should be considered a pioneer of the stature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. He successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed&quot;&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; to reform the auto industry, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Laura__Antonini/status/1294307355232894978&quot;&gt;so much more&lt;/a&gt;. I bet when AOC reads Nader’s letter, she will respond because she’s the real deal, as is Nader.</description>

			<description>Underlying all the bitterness, the liberals are angry that Nader elected Bush. That's the crazy part of their argument. The people who elected Bush are 1. The people who voted for him and 2. The Supreme Court. Illustrated in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIE0cT54yU&quot;&gt;beautiful scene&lt;/a&gt; from The West Wing. Josh, to Amy who is working for a third-party candidate. &quot;He's taking the president's votes,&quot; says Josh. Amy responds: &quot;Listen, I'm not indifferent to this situation, but that right there, that's the crazy part of your argument. They're not his votes.&quot; She's right. Nader ran for president. Gore lost (technically he gave up). Get over it.</description>
