			<description>From watching Severance twice, I now know why, when Helly goes out through the exit, trying to escape, she immediately comes back through the same door she went out from. It wasn't metaphysical. There's a simple explanation for it.</description>

			<description>Tell someone they did something good, or they look nice, or they're a great friend. Or give them something nice to eat. I just realized it's so rare that we do this. Everyone's looking for a nice word of praise or reassurance. We treat our pets better than our human friends.</description>

			<title>A more concise brain dump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Key point -- Twitter has been going nowhere for its whole life, just drifting, aimlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The companies Musk leads do not drift.

			<title>Let a thousand Twitters bloom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A rambling brain dump about Twitter and Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Self-moderation is going to be a huge deal. Maybe something like self-driving Teslas. Which the driver controls, btw. It isn't a passive thing. If a Musk company can do that, yeah I think they can give users more control over the bullshit they have to deal with on Twitter. The thing is Twitter has been stuck since 2006 when it started. They hired people to make the system run reliably, which is fantastic, hat's off, but it needs a few more things to be able to realizae its potential as a world-scale notification system for all kinds of networked writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe to make something workable you have to start something new, not in a half assed way.. Or maybe a no-bullshit capitalist like Musk can make it come about from the chaos of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people have no idea how software works and is made. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Twitter-like webservice at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;. With better docs and a JavaScript API that doesn't require developer to run a server (big deal). Effortless install on Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let a thousand Twitters bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interop baked in from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look, Elon made buying a car a completely online experience, moving around huge amounts of money and metal and an explosion in demand. Buying a Tesla was like buying a Mac in 1984 or an iPhone in 2007, except they're doing it 365 days a year for years. And buying a StarLink is just as easy and just as much of a sensation. If this is easy to do why do so few companies do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if Musk was trying to buy my bank, I'd be all for it. That's how bad their software is. All banks have shit software, btw, near as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you think he can't run Twitter when he can run StarLink and Tesla, please. And why should Twitter be stuck in the mud like it has been since inception. It desperately needs some fixes, and at a minumum must be made easier to peer with. Developers can do all the work if they just add a few simple features that they probably already have implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was an Apple dev in 1997 when Jobs came back. Musk is like Jobs in that he won't be scared to make the big changes that are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're lucky a guy like Musk is hanging around and willing to take on this job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And as usual the journalists see a teeny little corner of the picture and are screaming about that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Speaking of McCartney, I learned recently that he co-wrote the fantastic Elvis Costello song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-rF4COOd9c&quot;&gt;Veronica&lt;/a&gt;. It's definitely got the McCartney feel to it, another spin perhaps on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y&quot;&gt;Eleanor Rigby&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a good song to Peloton to, btw, imho.</description>

			<description>I love all the Beatles songs, but get the most, these days, out of John Lennon's songs. I learned that Lennon only partially completed his songs, leaving a lot of the work to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt;. Keep that in mind when you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt; (my favorite Beatles song) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8&quot;&gt;Strawberry Fields&lt;/a&gt;, as examples. The orchestral bits are pure Martin.</description>

			<description>I have the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; for a blog. I'm sure there's better search software out there, but no one else has the sheer quantity of blog-writing over so much time in a searchable index. There are bits missing here and there, and I'm determined to fill those bits in -- but the archive goes from October 7, 1994 at 11:27AM to the present day. A lot of stuff happened in that time, and some of it happened right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I hope someday it proves to be a useful resource to people studying this period, with the usual caveat, assuming the human species survives. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Because the weather has been delightful here the last few days, I'm afraid I got no work done this week. I basically gave up today and spent time in the sun, reading, listening to music, went for a walk, did some shopping, took a long nap in the afternoon. I guess I was overdue for some downtime. It is a wonderful time of year, winter truly is over. We will still get some coldish weather, no doubt, but the glory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains&quot;&gt;Catskills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon. It's the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; place to be in the summer.</description>

And while my Knicks are not in contention this year, it does have the feel of an unusually good year. One reason it's so cool, no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/2022/04/06/lakers-eliminated-from-playoff-contention-suns-loss&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;! Hopefully at some point he'll stop trying to form superteams and finish his career with humility and grace, away from contention. I am rooting for teams with stars who have never won a championship, notably the Phoenix Suns and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also glad to see the Warriors are back in the mix with the same big three and no Kevin Durant, who I will be rooting &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; every time he takes the court. I hope Boston blows the Nets out so that embarassment for the great city of New York is over for another year. Maybe they want him back in Oklahoma? I'm interested to see if James Harden can get it together to have a good long run, and while he has never won a championship, hmmm, I don't know. He played on the Nets this year, and for that reason I question his motivations. I do not like artificially created superteams designed to win championships. And of course they rarely do. So hopefully that chapter of the NBA will be over. One thing for sure &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/09/1363.html&quot;&gt;sports is not arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;, esp not basketball.</description>

			<title>Musk's Twitter, first comments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to be optimistic about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-14/elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter-for-54-20-a-share&quot;&gt;Musk's Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/14/muskLetterToTwitter.png&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; comes to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, none of the CEOs of Twitter going back to the beginning were &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;natural bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. Musk is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When he was joining the board, I thought that was good because having a user on the board of a tech company is pretty unusual, and would be a good thing. Having a user as the CEO -- even better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there's too much religion in the UI of Twitter. Musk's ideas have been pragmatic. On the right path, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a customer of Tesla and StarLink, and both companies appear to be run well, and what they do is imho harder than running Twitter, which basically is the kind of service the tech industry is good at running.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My main concern with Musk as the new owner of Twitter is that Trump will be back. I think it was proven beyond any doubt that Twitter can be grossly misused, and the company has to be ready to stop its service from being used in such a harmful way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Free speech is not an absolute -- the old Shouting &lt;i&gt;fire&lt;/i&gt; in a crowded movie theater &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt;. Trump used Twitter to organize the overthrow of the US government and almost succeeded at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am also concerned that Musk will curtail the Twitter API, which is incredibly useful and under-exploited by the company and its users. I've built a lot of tech on top of the API, and would miss it if it were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I am a shareholder of Twitter and would prefer to continue to hold my stock. I was holding it as a long-term investment. Not interested in selling it at this time. Was hoping for a much larger return.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some early morning thoughts on this topic, sure to be much discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update #1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A reader asked why I was concerned that Musk might curtail the Twitter API. Basically, because I've seen things like that happen over and over in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been through this before with Apple. When Steve Jobs returned he shut down Mac internet devs, by bundling open source versions of what our products did, somewhat. Enough to kill our markets. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When a new owner comes in and finds projects with serious staff that aren't generating revenue and have no clear purpose, they at least think about dropping them. Great example, again with Steve Jobs -- not that I disagree with what he cut, he just made huge cuts in some things that were really good and unique for a tech company, like their internal library. Most of what he cut were boondoggles, some of which competed with independent products that were better than Apple's. In other words they were spending money to hold back the market. Foolish. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update #2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;warned in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter's price was too low, and that a Republican backer like Shelly Adelson or the Koch Brothers could buy it and make it run like Fox News. It's a good thing they didn't because for sure Trump would still be using Twitter to organize his coup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who responded said it'd never happen because Twitter's balance sheet was too weak to justify an acquisition. They missed that not all of Twitter's value shows up on its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've mostly stayed away because the community was pretty flamey. But so much time has passed, we could use some new developer tools, and namespaces based on how feed publishing has evolved over the 20 years.</description>

			<title>Sources Go Direct, explained</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sources Go Direct is a concept I've been promoting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources+go+direct%22&quot;&gt;long time&lt;/a&gt;, without a simple one-page explanation of what it means. Here's my attempt to solve that problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The term focuses on the flow of news. Before the web news flowed from sources to reporters to readers. Some readers were sources of course. And sometimes reporters were sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/07/fdBox.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+disintermediated&quot;&gt;disintermediated&lt;/a&gt; news reporting as it did to other things. It's a fancy word that means that people went around the intermediaries. So travel agents which used to be a big thing, were replaced with Expedia and Kayak. We got information about real estate from Zillow. And the sources of reporters got blogs, and then Twitter accounts, and started going directly to the users of news. Of course there still are travel agents, and when I bought a house recently I used an agent to help me, but I did a lot of researching myself on Zillow. And there are still reporters, of course, and they use the tools that sources use, that's how they get the information they pass on to their readers. We're much better informed these days about lots of things. Some info we get through intermediaries and some we get directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the late 90s and into the 00s, we needed the term Sources Go Direct to focus our reporter friends on the role bloggers were playing. They jumped to the conclusion that we were trying to be reporters. Most of us were not. We had expertise we wanted to share that wasn't getting out through journalism. So we took matters into our own hands as soon as the technology gave us the means to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was making Mac software in 1994 and reporters were saying there was no new Mac software. I wanted  to correct that misunderstanding, so I started what eventually came to be called a blog, and then podcasting. All to get around a clogged bottleneck of news flow about something that was important to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/dave.rss.png&quot;&gt;using .rss&lt;/a&gt; because RSS is due for a bounce-back. It's got a strong foundation, and it has a simpler mission than the crypto folk -- simply, to get news to the people.</description>

			<title>StarLink setup</title>

As a user, once it's set up, you're just using wifi. I ordered it as a backup for my land-based net connection from Spectrum, which sometimes goes out where I live in the mountains in upstate NY. StarLink is made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacex.com/&quot;&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, which like Tesla, is a company run by Elon Musk. Anyway, I read how simple it was to set up, so I opened the box and put it together myself and it worked. These are my notes from the setup.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a guy who normally does installations on my house, but I couldn't wait so I set up StarLink myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's incredible how it unboxes. No instructions, none are needed.  Here's what you get:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dish: Three parts, a dish, a stand and a pipe that connects the dish to the stand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A wifi router with jacks for power and a cable that connects to the dish.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A 100 foot cable to connect the dish to the router. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I did, what happened&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put the dish outside, plug in the router, connect the dish to the router and turn everything on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I didn't get a video, but the dish moves itself around to find the clearest view of the satellite. It's out of a scifi movie. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But the app on the iPhone still says Booting.. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I imagine it's getting an over-the-air update?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where we're at...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can connect to the wifi from all my devices, they just don't connect to the internet yet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Update: now instead of booting it says searching.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Will keep you posted. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/gatheringdata.png&quot;&gt;Gathering data&lt;/a&gt; on obstructions.

			<title>What if writers had choice</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for one or two service providers who are ready to offer users a choice of writing tools. To not force them to use &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; writing tools, their storage, and at best, offer a way to back up their writing. As a writer I want to use the tools I like best, and perhaps send them out through more than one channel. I don't want to be locked in, and forced to transcribe my writing for every possible service I might use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see someone like Substack or Medium, for example, who says &quot;Write your stuff in your favorite writing tool, export it in Markdown, and give us the link. We'll take it from there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That way you could:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use a tool that fits your writing style perfectly.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Developers would be incentivized to create such tools.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You could use more than one service, say use Substack to manage your mail list, and Medium to manage your web presence, and Facebook for discussion among your friends, Slack to discuss among your work colleagues. (BTW, Slack has a good enough API to do this already.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Great archival services could come about because they could be one of the services you cc on your writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Service providers could make custom toolkits to make it easy for tools to adapt to this interface. No need to master their whole API when all your users want is to shoot a story over for publication, indexing, rendering or storage.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Who knows what else will come about. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It takes two vendors to define a standard, and then there would be reason enough for all to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's amazing that we have this incredibly powerful network, but the business models of service providers protect their services by not allowing writers a choice in writing tools.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Like walking into a store. Or just driving their car. The camera is looking at the driver, then focuses on what's happening outside, to get your mind to consider that. It's at this point that you know that something momentous and bad is about to happen. In some movies it's a car crash. Or the star gets shot. Or someone runs in front of the car. There are some movies where the director doesn't prepare you for The Bad Thing, and if it's done well it can be very disturbing (if you've seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=The%20Departed&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;The Departed&lt;/a&gt; you know what I mean). Anyway, today I was walking in the springtime garden outside my house, with all the debris from fallen trees and branches. It was a rough winter. And I become conscious in a way that happens sometimes. It's uncomfortable because you connect to your animal-ness in a way that's a lot more real than usual. I always get nervous that something momentous and bad is about to happen. The feeling of consciousness in the moment and the movie-maker's technique are the same thing, and it's why you have the feeling of dread watching the movie, and in real life. Only in the movie the bad thing always happens and in real life (so far) it never does.</description>

			<description>BTW, I have experienced momentous and bad things, and have never had this kind of super conscious awareness preview. My 18-year-old uncle driving his car at 60 mph on city streets in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmhurst,_Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, going through a stop sign. A car coming the other way smashes into ours. No seatbelts. Our car spins around, my head crashes into the window, breaks it. I get out of the car and run around a few times and then pass out. Broken collarbone. I don't remember any of this, I didn't experience it, consciously. I was told this is what happened and what I did. There was no fear, presumably because fear wouldn't have helped me survive?</description>

			<description>In the 90s when I was studying massage, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeru.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;teachers&lt;/a&gt; wanted us to be in this hyper-conscious mode always, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I think. I rarely attain that. Most of the time I'm in my movie. Maybe that's why the awareness of my personal presence in a scene in my movie is so alarming.</description>

You just have to change the number in the URL to open a different year. I picked 1997 because that was a big year for innovation. The basic ideas of blogging were starting to become pretty obvious.

			<description>I found the archive of all the DaveNet stories going back from 1994 to 2004 in OPML, the format that the Daytona database uses, including the titles and publication dates. I'm going to spend a little time gettomg it in shape, and then upload the database and all the OPML text to the GitHub repo. A bit of restoration work. I love this, there's a lot of good stuff here. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/davenetInOpml/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for this project.</description>

			<description>I had a small package delivered today via Fedex containing a SIM that I was going to use in my phone. But the package was opened, and there was nothing inside. This seems to be happening a lot these days. Hackers get jobs at Fedex or UPS and grab stuff as it's in transit. PS: Fedex &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/09/fedexApologizesForAnyInconvenience.png&quot;&gt;apologizes&lt;/a&gt; for any inconvenience when they should be apologizing for completely failing at the job they were hired to do.</description>

			<description>I've been working my way through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;, in Season 3 now. It's funny the first season was given so-so reviews, but the critics were agog with Season 3. I think it's the other way around. The last season is a real drag. Repetitive, silly, not sexy at all. Where the first season had me laughing out loud with my chin permanently dropped at all the innovation that worked.</description>

It's a blogging system I wrote in 2015 and 2016, after learning Facebook, and liking a lot of the features in it, and thought they should make their way back into the blogging world. That was the idea. It's a full-featured blogging system, written in JavaScript with a Node.js backend, intending to be a revisit to the ideas in Manila, which came out in 1999, hence the name of 1999.io. But -- I decided to stop building on it in 2017, because I wanted to use something else. The thing about 1999.io, is it made a compromise with Google Reader and the RSS readers that followed it. All posts had titles. And they were meant to be multi-paragraph things, and it had no provision for short titleless posts. I was trying to surrender to the mass decision that blogs had a certain form, but it wasn't my form. That led me to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, which was a return to the blogging system I used before Manila, based on the editor being an outliner. That meant leaving 1999.io behind. But it's still there. And someone out there is using it for something. I don't have any plans to work on it or use it, but does still appear to work. Here's a Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for 1999.io on this site, in case you're interested in exploring.</description>

			<title>Dreamweaver is on an evolutionary path we left behind</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; and lead developer of WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1511382286641508352&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; something interesting on Twitter on April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing how much development, how many startups, and how much funding is going into rebuilding Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver as a web app. (Gutenberg included.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about evolution and how we never go back, only forward. The great example is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Mentallicaa/videos/191445391404751/&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the evolution of the human eye. The eye originated when our ancestors lived underwater. They don't work well in the air, but it's done. We can't get a better eye. Evolution has finished the eye. Look at all our eyes, every animal on earth has watery eyes. You don't notice it until you look for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this same idea applies to the evolution of software. The theory says FrontPage and Dreamweaver will never fit well into the writing and publishing environment of 2022 and beyond. The evolutionary fork that took us off that course was when Apple made the decision in the late 80s to make networking virtually impossible to write software for. It was such a tease, because Macs all had builtin networking hardware, and the wires were easy to set up and inexpensive. They wanted all Macs to be connected. But for some reason the APIs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inscrutable&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I banged my head against those APIs for years. I gave up when I saw how easy HTTP was to develop for. If Apple had the same insight for software that they had for hardware, if they factored their APIs so that networking could easily be added to any application, as it is on the web, we'd be evolving off a base with a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/ImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf&quot;&gt;well-documented GDI&lt;/a&gt; and a well-defined graphic user interface, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that made sure all software worked the same, as opposed to the user interface chaos of the web. The two worlds are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antithetical&quot;&gt;antithetical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, simple networking was more important than a simple and consistent graphic interface. It's why &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; took off, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; did not (in the UserLand universe). And why Dreamweaver and Frontpage have faded out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;plain text&lt;/a&gt; rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge imho is to swing back to writers, not people who need a lot of stylistic control of text. The people who valued WYSIWYG were the first owners of laser printers. In a world where most people are using smart phones, there isn't that much you can do with wizzy tools that shows up for the reader. Today's writers need the UI to get out of their way, and make it easy to create more complex and useful structures for notes. I think this is the way forward. And we should of course keep improving and simplifying the underlying network protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
