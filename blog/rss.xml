Now I will use mine. I thought they would, of course, have ported &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports&quot;&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/a&gt; to the Switch as the first thing. Kind of like MacWrite and MacPaint. I never bought any other software for my Wii. The fact that I could play tennis in my living room, or golf or go bowling -- that's all I ever wanted. I imagine the new Sports will do a bunch of things the original couldn't, they've had fourteen years to work on it.</description>

			<description>If the Dems had a passion for humanity they’d ratify &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Size_of_the_court&quot;&gt;twenty&lt;/a&gt; new Supreme Court justices this year, and pass a law that  limits the term of a justice to ten years. I am not a lawyer but I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/Allow-Me-to-Retort-Audiobook/B09TCG7PMK&quot;&gt;a book written by one&lt;/a&gt; and this is what the author recommends.</description>

			<description>I'm working on a piece of software built around a single closure. The data type that's at the center of the user experience. When you create it as a closure, it is very easy to tweak it up. Every instance of a closure is a little world unto itself. You have to set up protocols for the outside world to speak to the object. That's good because there can't be any other interactions. When debugging you just have to look there. And when there are no deeply hidden bugs, its deliciously easy to work on. But when you type &lt;code&gt;[feedItem, theFeed]&lt;/code&gt; when you really meant &lt;code&gt;{feedItem, theFeed}&lt;/code&gt;, and your eyes are imperfect as mine are, and you tend to see what you expect to see in debugging, and miss the little subtle mistakes. Whether you use square or curly brackets makes all the difference in the world. It can turn rich structures into &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. And all the debugging code in the world doesn't help until you see the square brackets are where there should be curly ones. I think this is a lot like Wordle. The pattern has to be seen by the subconscious. You don't move on until you've solved the problem. But unlike Wordle you get as many tries as it takes.</description>

			<description>BTW, written explanations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;closures&lt;/a&gt; always read like gobbledygook. Here's what I would say. A closure is an &lt;i&gt;instance&lt;/i&gt; of a function, as opposed to a &lt;i&gt;call&lt;/i&gt; to a function, but they start life as a call. If when you call the function, it still has work to do, in the form of local functions that run every second or minute, for example, or to respond to messages from the outside, such as a click on an object it created (and is linked into the DOM), or an HTTP request, then all its data sticks around. And it's private to the function, no one else can get at it. That helps you keep the overall program simpler, there are fewer things that can go wrong.  Now as I read this I'm not sure I got it, but it's close. I guess the thing is I've never written an interpreter for a language that has closures. In my experience that's when you really understand a piece of machinery, when it stops being magic -- when you've implemented it.</description>

			<title>The problem with Worldle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Wordle-clone for geography is &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;. At first it looked promising, but in the end, it's usually either impossible, there are huge numbers of tiny island nations in every ocean and sea on the planet, or totally obvious like today's &quot;puzzle,&quot; an instantly-recognizable landmass for probably everyone with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;, no spoilers so I didn't solve it for you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A user said he’d be more inclined to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; if i planned for it to continue to work after I stop working. First, yes I did plan the best I could. All your files are in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;open format&lt;/a&gt; which can be read by most outliners. You can easily and quickly download all your files with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/general.opml#1634478289000&quot;&gt;single command&lt;/a&gt;. You should do it frequently. If you want Drummer to keep going, help out next time there are new features, get involved in testing. Anyone can do it. It should be possible for me to introduce a new fix or feature and find out if there are any problems within a few hours. That's what the process needs from users, at least to be somewhat viable going forward.</description>

			<title>Today's Wordle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I sat down at the breakfast table to solve the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=wordle&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; puzzle for the day. I was sad to solve it in less than a minute. Now what to do? Guess I have to get to work! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- I find that only my subconscious mind can solve the puzzle, to actually see the solution. I can analytically arrange for the clues to be available to my subconsciousl but the word pops into my conscious mind in an instant. I have no awareness of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually I'm sure when I have the answer. Today I wasn't even sure the correct word was actually a word! What a nice surprise when all five letters came up green and then did their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdSa5kJb-yw&quot;&gt;little dance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/02/wordle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/27/businessmanWithAGun.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I hate April 1 on the web and esp in news orgs, whose &lt;i&gt;business&lt;/i&gt; is posting stuff that's true. I tend to take things literally as I read them, and puzzle my way through strange news, until it hits that I've been burned. I waste a fair amount of time on April 1 wading through this nonsense. The only thing you can do is let people know in advance that if they troll you with one of these things, if it's on a system where I can block you, that's what I do. If it's a news org, I try to remember never to trust anything they write, because they clearly have no respect for their own mission. So I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1729710617236336?comment_id=1729845797222818&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/fbwarningaboutapril1garbage.png&quot;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1509848417098518534&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; establishing this rule, and wouldn't you know it, some people actually post &quot;jokes&quot; there. Mostly it's harrassment. Bitterness I guess. They don't like life, so they drop little turds on message threads to get attention. Yes I block them. Yes, it's tiresome. There is a certain amount of overhead to maintaining one's integrity. If you say you're going to block someone, you have to actually do it. Kind of like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGfvV3Syud8&quot;&gt;second to last scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men_(film)&quot;&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/a&gt;, if you remember it.  I got here the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/gotHereTheSameWayTheCoinDid.png&quot;&gt;same way&lt;/a&gt; the coin did. Gotta do what I gotta do.</description>

			<source:outline text="I hate April 1 on the web and esp in news orgs, whose &lt;i&gt;business&lt;/i&gt; is posting stuff that's true. I tend to take things literally as I read them, and puzzle my way through strange news, until it hits that I've been burned. I waste a fair amount of time on April 1 wading through this nonsense. The only thing you can do is let people know in advance that if they troll you with one of these things, if it's on a system where I can block you, that's what I do. If it's a news org, I try to remember never to trust anything they write, because they clearly have no respect for their own mission.

			<description>I end all my Peloton workouts, while I do a few cool-down laps, with two songs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azdwsXLmrHE&quot;&gt;Radio Gaga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt;. They're my reward for taking care of myself, which is of course its own reward.</description>

			<description>I heard a BBC reporter ask a Ukrainian official if they would attack Russian military in Russia. What kind of question is that. Of course they would. It's a war. Russia attacked Ukraine. All of Russia is a fair target for the Ukraine military.</description>

Niches are defended by lack of interop. You can see categories being born with limited interop, features vendors can say deliver interop, it would be hard to argue, but they don't deliver much practical interop for users. That's why the tech industry was so ho-hum about RSS. Where's the fun for them if they can't lock users into a niche product and then another and another? As a technologist, what gets me excited about computer networks are all the combinations users can make, but that works only if there's &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of interop.</description>
