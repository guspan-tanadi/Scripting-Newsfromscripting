			<description>Just got an email from Google saying they made all kinds of improvements to Bard, their AI chatbot. So I asked if they could search my blog. Sure, just give me the url, the bot said. I did, and then it told me &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/15/bardchat.png&quot;&gt;my blog is not a blog&lt;/a&gt;. Okay this is not a good start.</description>

			<description>There's so much movement in social media and AI, it's impossible to keep up with a fraction of what's going on. Totally stripping my gears. Meantime I wonder when will someone combine the two. A social media world with AI's as part of the community. Maybe it already exists, maybe that's what Twitter has become? No, not possible, hmmm, or is it? Don't freak out. Funny thing is there's a Kurt Vonnegut book with this as part of its plot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html&quot;&gt;Breakfast of Champions&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the main character, Kilgore Trout, is informed that he is the only real person, that everyone else is a robot sent there to test him. I think that's how it went. But if you're reading this you must know that I'm a robot myself. Oh the humanity.</description>

			<description>I've moved my archive of ChatGPT queries to a new domain -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html&quot;&gt;ai.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;. So the URLs will be shorter and perhaps the intent will be clearer.</description>

			<description>Apparently, all of a sudden, with almost no fanfare, the Bluesky folks have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app&quot;&gt;released their code&lt;/a&gt; under the most liberal MIT License. I assume this means we will immediately see more nodes, and anyone can have a Bluesky account? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/261&quot;&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; if you have a server up and running.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IURpPKUbZ_Y&quot;&gt;Demo of Firesky&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/15/social-media-firehose-access.html&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt; for Bluesky. It quickly scrolls all posts on Bluesky through a vertical window. New messages appear at the bottom and scroll off the top. From there, the author, John Spurlock has added, with my help, RSS feeds from the same stream of posts. So you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=%40davew&quot;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt; in your feed reader. This is important for two reasons: 1. At this time Bluesky is still private, so if I give you a pointer to something I wrote there, you won't be able to see it. The feed gets around that restriction. 2. Because Mastodon also has RSS feeds, I can read both social nets with the same API. It gives us a common language, and is the next step in bootstrapping RSS support in all social media apps. Once that happens, we, writers and readers, will be able to use our own writing tools, and give readers choice of where to read. This is the key feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, ie applying the philosophy of podcasting to text. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible, it requires users to want it, insist on it. We're getting a bit closer to that today.</description>

			<description>I know Facebook is supposedly evil, but it has been a constant for me, because i can communicate with friends I've had for decades as if we still lived in the same city we used to, even though many of them have moved back to where they came from (as I did). I don't think Facebook is any more or less evil than any other system where I'm a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster&lt;/a&gt; spinning a wheel and someone else is going to make billions off of the collection of hamsters.</description>

			<title>The holy grail of social media</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks designed for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Facebook, Google stood in the way of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it’s all reforming now, not the way people thought it would just a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to assume there will be more change in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why are new social nets so nice?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I ran a BBS in the early 80s, we’d get hacked from time to time, and usually they’d wipe the database, which left us with a fresh start, and for a while everything would be nice and simple, until it got all clogged up again. So there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_lining_(idiom)&quot;&gt;silver lining&lt;/a&gt; to getting hacked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another phenomenon that might be at play. Remembering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clubhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, the voice-only twitter, was wonderful until it became a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2017/08/origins-juggernaut-jagannath/&quot;&gt;juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; then it was filled with spam and influencers, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/14/understanding-comradery.html&quot;&gt;comradery&lt;/a&gt; that people loved at first was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So Twitter is old and clogged. Its rules are more or less set in stone. A new network, where there isn't much of a caste system, or it can be avoided, has more potential. People are on somewhat of a level playing field. The trolls haven't gotten organized yet. Whatever it is, Bluesky is nice. But it will get clogged too, and they should prepare for that by being more open to different uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing they're all missing is that these are writing environments first, so studying writing on computers would make sense. If they did, they'd instantly get some important new &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; for features users would love that could sustain them once the newness wears off. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There are so many things wrong with Bluesky. I've started to list them on Bluesky itself, but I seriously doubt any people on the team will pay attention. What we need more than anything are social networks that don't bury their heads in the sand and try to do it all themselves. They're making the same mistakes Twitter made, but 17 years later, with the benefit of hindsight that they are not using. And they re-invent old things, when the world solved those problems a long time ago. For example, they handle links the same way I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815211629/http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News format&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. Great, it was a good idea, but it didn't happen that way, instead we use HTML. How could they believe that it will work this way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;Prior art&lt;/a&gt;. Please. Yes I like the user interface because it is so much like Twitter it's like comfort food. But that isn't enough. We liked a lot of things for a while, but then the limits will catch up. Again what we need is what's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec. &lt;b&gt;A social network that works for writers&lt;/b&gt;. I put that in bold because no one seems to be able to hear this. Okay back to life, I'm done with pissing in the wind for today. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>One of my gripes with Bluesky is that I can't post a pointer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://staging.bsky.app/profile/davew.bsky.social/post/3jvmjxtgpdu2m&quot;&gt;something I wrote there&lt;/a&gt;, because unless you have a Bluesky account, you won't get there. It's a publishing tool no? The root of the word publishing is 'public.' Please.</description>

Paraphrasing what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/&quot;&gt;Les Moonves&lt;/a&gt;, former CEO of CBS said about Trump in 2016. &quot;[Trump] may not be good for America, but [he's] damn good for CNN.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can raise the price of ads with Trump. That's obviously what CNN hopes to do. Trump, who has been deprecated by Fox, needs a mainstream outlet. There's no mystery why all the people in the town hall audience were Trump supporters, that obviously was a Trump condition. He probably chose the reporter, the questions, and came prepared to get talked about, which appears to be happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't see it, I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/10.html#a122516&quot;&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; when he was on. I tried listening to MSNBC last night talk about this and was nauseated. They're treating it as a news event. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much all there is that's newsworthy about the event imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think we should work together to create a great library of Hello World apps for all social networks, regardless of our feelings about their value. Some people value Nostr, some like Bluesky. I know people who believe in Twitter. Why should our software care? I want to make all these systems equal in some way. It's a good time to be inclusive, imho. Hello World-level interop is a good place to start.</description>

Obviously I've known about it for years. There have been some really egregious outbursts, like the time I was invited to Mozilla to explain &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; from my point of view and it was an ambush. The source of the hate in some cases must be jealousy -- I guess they feel constrained by having jobs inside shit companies that they feel that limits their creativity. They must think what I do is easy, and if only they had the freedom to create whatever they want they could do what I do. I've seen that in action. I also write publicly and I try to be interesting in the way I write, partially because I write to amuse myself, but I also try hard not to make it personal. I don't mind telling Jack Dorsey, for example, to sit down, because he's a very public figure and his actions have big consequences. Just one example. I also feel free to say that I think the culture of Silicon Valley is poisonous. The rest of the world seems to have caught on to that idea. Or some people just don't like me as a person. But that's no excuse to behave awfully. I find that when I do something awful, I hurt myself more than the other person. I learned that a long time ago, so I try hard not to do it. I empathize with them a bit, they feel pain and try to give a little of it to me. Something like this just happened on Bluesky. A &quot;joke&quot; about exactly what I'm writing about here. I thought about responding to it on Bluesky, but instead blocked the troll and respond here instead. You should care about how you treat people, especially people who your peers have decided it's okay to hate on. You don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to behave badly. And if you do that's your choice, it's not something you can blame them for. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A lot of immature people running wild. A frat-house atmosphere. And saying Mozilla is shitty is not much of a distinction, most if not all Silicon Valley companies are shitty. I think the underlying cause is that there are far too many programmers. If we had better (and fewer) platforms and tools then individuals could make their own software, they wouldn't have to work at companies. I'm certainly a test-case for that.

I finally found a way that works. Before starting, go to the old iPad, and in Settings, choose a command that prepares the iPad for the transfer by backing it up to iCloud (I don't remember what the command was, but they make it easy to find because they apparently remember you're trying to do this). The iCloud service is free for this purpose. Then wipe the new iPad and when it boots up, it'll offer an opportunity to use the iCloud backup. By choosing this, you remove the old iPad from the update. This is important because if it isn't involved, it can't time-out. Then let it update the OS (you don't have a choice) and once that's done, let it go ahead and use the iCloud backup. This means you have to stick around while it's updating the OS, a process that takes about 1/2 hour. The good news is, after that, it will do the transfer without any more interaction. I came back a few hours later and the new iPad was exactly like the old one. It remembers all your passwords, so you don't even have to enter them again. I think Apple could make this work better by writing some docs that tell you to do basically what I've said here, and save the users a lot of time, and since I already returned a new iPad because I couldn't get this to work, they would make real money from making this work better. I bought a &quot;renewed&quot; iPad which costs considerably less than a new one, and none of this money went to Apple. BTW, I think &quot;renewed&quot; in my case meant a new iPad in shrinkwrap, from a couple of years ago, that was never sold for some reason. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I've been using Bluesky, it's more inviting to Twitter users than Mastodon. But most of that is cosmetics. The Mastoverse could be made easier. Factored. Facelift. I don't think it would necessarily be hard, but it might be politically controversial. Most important, there needs to be simple-to-use toolkits that support the common API between all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;A/Pub&lt;/a&gt; apps, so every developer doesn't have to reinvent the interface. API calls that look exactly like what the user does, create post, edit post, reply to post, view replies, get timeline, etc.</description>

It insists on installing a new version of the OS before proceeding. While that is happening the original iPad times out. When I try to restart the transfer, it hangs. Come back hours later, still hung. Then I tried to get the new machine to restore factory settings but it wouldn't accept my password, after a long wait. Tried it three or four times and thought maybe it needs wifi turned on to do this. It does. Okay now, with the new machine restored to factory settings, it has started the new OS install again. I started this at 7AM, now it's almost noon. I did do other stuff. My wifi is fast btw, so installing a new version here should be fast relative to other setups. But after all this time I don't believe I'm any closer to having the transfer of data even start. It's starting to look like reinstalling all the apps and data by hand would be faster. (Update: He's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/10/installNow.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of where the new iPad gets stuck. That little star thing is spinning. I tried clicking on &lt;i&gt;Install Now&lt;/i&gt; and nothing seems to happen. I'm just going to leave it there and come back in a couple of hours.)</description>

			<description>Podcasting is for places your eyes are doing other important things. Driving, walking, running, watching stuff. This is why YouTube is not a great place to serve podcasts from. The positioning is wrong. YouTube requires use of your eyes. I know it's not technically a requirement, rather it's a positioning thing. I wouldn't serve dinner from a baseball glove even though technically I could.</description>

And what do I see? Well it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/08/blueskyScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;looks&lt;/a&gt; just like Twitter. The colors are the same, as is the layout of the entire window, and the formatting of each message. In the 90s lawyers would have gotten involved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.#:~:text=Apple%20claimed%20the%20%22look%20and,bars)%20was%20not%20as%20important&quot;&gt;violations&lt;/a&gt; of look and feel, it's that close. I don't follow very many people there, and I don't know how I would do that quickly enough for it to color my impression. There's so much more on Twitter. As much as insiders are repelled by the new Twitter management, and I'm one of them, I think most people who use Twitter are far above that, to them it's just noise, and life goes on as always. There was a very interesting episode of Succession last night, and there are lots of good memes on Twitter. I haven't seen anything on Bluesky. But as quiet as Bluesky is, it makes Mastodon look even quieter. Ultimately we join these networks for companionship, it's a trip to the water cooler, or a walk around the block during a workday, or while watching a sports game. The new services have a steep hill to climb. The focus on technology has largely been a distraction in that context. What matters, as always, is not the tech -- but the people. And Twitter is still far ahead of the others, despite all the wishful thinking to the contrary.</description>

			<description>It's great to see people using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;JavaScript implementation&lt;/a&gt; of XML-RPC, released in 2019. There appears to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/20&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with integer parsing in Java on Linux vs Windows. I'm ready to update the package if we can get to the bottom of what the issue is.</description>

			<description>I wish GitHub would let me write an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; renderer for them, so when it encounters a file with a .opml extension, it gets the HTML text from my driver. There's at least one OPML file in every one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;my repos&lt;/a&gt;, containing the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/source.opml&quot;&gt;project source&lt;/a&gt;. I edit all my code in an outliner. This is an art that should get exposure. It'm not exactly a nobody in software development, I've been developing this style for a long time. And tools to go with it. Anyway, back to work &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>One thing I don't like about Mastodon is that I get so many comments from people who feel superior to those who use other systems. It's always bullshit. Just like people who used Macs felt superior to Windows users. Just an example. The world likes to judge the quality of people based on superficial bullshit like that. If you reply to something I post saying you're superior because you use (whatever) I will think you're an asshole, so just skip it. I might even say it to you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
