			<description>When I was starting out in tech, after getting a degree in computer science, I was drawn to PCs because the adults hadn’t gotten there first. They were still simple. If they had kept their stuff simple, I might have invested on their platforms. The web after all these years is still really simple if you ignore Google and use common sense. It’s still possible to see the web as unspoiled as it was at the beginning. Just ignore Google and it’s all good.</description>

I have reserved a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drumkit.org/&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for it. There's nothing there at this time but a placeholder. &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/&quot;&gt;Gary Teter&lt;/a&gt; came up with the name in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/2021/10/30/060526.html?title=moreDrummerThingsIpadEdition&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. When I read the post, I was pretty sure this was the name. I love how it connects to the name of the product, and it conveys the utility of having a language in a product such as Drummer. It also reflects the duality of the product. You can beat the drum in Drummer by writing, if you're a poet, and if you're a plumber, there's Drumkit. It's also nice because it leaves open the option of the language existing outside of Drummer, but no one will miss that the language &lt;i&gt;came from&lt;/i&gt; Drummer. That's important I've found. I left similar clues in RSS and in podcasting. I think naming a product is a community thing, the best names don't come from one person's mind. Gary understands a lot about what I'm trying to do with the language, how else could he have devised such a perfect name. He can be proud, much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;Dannie Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; can be proud of coming up with the name we eventually used for what we were calling audio blogging, even though there's a British journalist who falsely claims to have coined the term. Already the Drummer community has made a great contribution to Drummer. Many thanks! 🥁</description>

			<title>Morning ramble</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I signed up for Twitter Blue for $2.99 under the mistaken impression that it got me through paywalls. Okay it doesn't do that. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to pay $100 a month, but even so I will not use Twitter as the primary way I read news. Not ever going to happen, I already have news reading tools that blow Twitter out of the water. Sorry Jack. I've been working on this stuff for a long time (just like you).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So we're still a really long way away from having rational networked news. Yet the deficiencies of news are what's killing us as a democracy and a world power. It isn't Facebook, that's just a diversion. Most people are falling for it. The problem is that the news system is sick. We talk about inequality in terms of how much money people have, but what about inequality in terms of the information they have access to. I pay for better news that poorer people can. But even with that I'm still  impoverished. News people are lazy. I can't believe they weren't all trying to get a real ticktock of Trump on January 6, starting on January 7 (give them a few hours to get over the shock). But I hear from the Washington Post that they thought they had an innovative idea to look into this in October! Holy shit. Is that what they think news is. Oy we are so lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want news like they portrayed it in Hollywood when I was young. The shit where they go out to get the story that brings down the empire. The biggest story of 2021 is what was Trump doing, who was he calling, what threats was he making, when the insurrection was actually going on. I read the WP story. It's really weak. We should know a lot more by now. And this was happening all through the Trump presidency. The news was resetting expectations constantly, noting that Trump wasn't a normal president over and over. Well we figured that out thanks, now how about telling us what he's actually doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all information impoverished, just pretending we're informed, but in our hearts all of us knowing we have no idea what's being done to us in our own name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why GitHub, for poets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the plumbers fully appreciate the value of hooking up a writing tool like &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; to the default place in the world for posting code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We can do a lot of renderings of outlines in Markdown, which is the writing language favored by GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Watch out, because the docs on GitHub are about to get an upgrade, the same kind of lift blogging gets from writing with an outliner.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Docs are even more structured than blogs.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay that's the plumber's rationale.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For poets, think of GitHub as a great arena where all kinds of sports are played, except in this analogy the sports are ideas and docs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until now there hasn't been a great arena for poets. There's only been such an arena for programmers, and that's very new. GitHub didn't exist as the great programming idea arena until maybe the mid-teens. Maybe it's just now starting to come into its own.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Certainly a big publishing platform like Facebook and Medium had the opportunity to do this, but the too quickly pivoted to business models, and that had a chilling effect at making it a great arena for ideas. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Amazon, amazingly, had the best opportunity to create such an arena, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/18/enduserStorageFromAmazon.html&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to do it, openly, but they wouldn't do it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What does such an arena need? Not a whole lot actually.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A simple user authentication method. The technology for this is called OAuth. It's what everyone uses. It's what GitHub uses. Twitter does, Facebook, Slack, on and on. The important thing about this method of authentication is that YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT.  You use it, you don't even think about it. It makes sense to you. So right off the bat, you're ready to join in. I can put a command in a menu to &lt;i&gt;Log on to GitHub&lt;/i&gt; and you won't be surprised at all by what it does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only other thing it needs to do is storage, and GitHub does that, very powerfully. Have a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader&quot;&gt;ArtDownloader&lt;/a&gt; project for an idea. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/10/artdirectoryscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;huge amount&lt;/a&gt; of art there. It's great stuff. Hook it up to your screen saver, and enrich your life. It's free for you, and guess what, it's free for me too. GitHub says fine, we'll host it, you don't even have to ask. You can create your own repos. I promise you, it's not hard and we can probably even make it easier, given enough time. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why is it such a great arena?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Because you can point other apps to the arena you write to using Drummer, and they can do stuff for you with that data. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a fucking platform. It's free. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another thing it is -- based on an open standard -- GIT. So we're not getting locked in the trunk here. We are free to leave. We are depending on their API which their competitors will hopefully clone. They'd be idiots if they didn't. They probably already are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is where I like to work -- at the edge of possibility. We might be able to bootstrap something wonderful here. I am certainly optimistic myself based on the intelligence and curiosity of the people who are using Drummer. And their collegiality. That's the most important ingredient. I've had all this stuff for years, outliners, code that writes to GitHub, scripting interpreters, etc etc. But having all of it in a package that is used by enough smart people, to help start the bootstrap, that's like the sourdough starters everyone was trading in the early days of the pandemic. You can have all the ingredients, but if you don't have people to play in the arena, nothing interesting is going to happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

We used to call this a &quot;scriptable app&quot; on the Mac, when apps were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker&quot;&gt;Filemaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress&quot;&gt;Quark Xpress&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)&quot;&gt;Finder&lt;/a&gt;, stuff like that. Then when &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; moved to the web, the apps were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&quot;&gt;MSIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHTTP&quot;&gt;MacHTTP&lt;/a&gt;, then Google and &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, then WordPress and Twitter. Along the way came new protocols -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;.

I made this a priority to have one really good scriptable app when Drummer came out. Now I'm working on the second biggie. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a143815&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that GitHub could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS&quot;&gt;MS-DOS&lt;/a&gt;. What I meant is that it's basic low-cost storage for everyone with a GitHub account that's about as easy to work with as MS-DOS was. For early adopters, what we used to call power users. It's an amazing resource. And that made me think of MS-DOS because both are owned by Microsoft and storage is basically what MS-DOS did, and btw, MS-DOS is the one product they didn't use as a weapon when they were trying to usurp the web, so it has a nice taste to it, still. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/7&quot;&gt;started a thread&lt;/a&gt;, on GitHub of course, narrating what I've got working. Watch this space.</description>

			<description>I put about twenty &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty&quot;&gt;Tom Petty&lt;/a&gt; songs on my iPhone and have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmFxgEGKH0&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; on and off. The thing about Tom Petty is his songs are the kind that you sing in your head all the time days and days awake or in dreams. To have twenty Petty tunes co-resident means you're living the Tom Petty lifestyle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMyCa35_mOg&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt; for it to pass, but kind of hoping it doesn't. It's kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling&quot;&gt;Rickrolling&lt;/a&gt; but with really good music.</description>

Oy. I knew Scott when he was our chief product marketer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; back in the 80s. He was part of the team that shipped ThinkTank, Ready and MORE. When we sold to Symantec, Scott went to NeXT where he was on the rollout team for their product. His heart was in outliners. He went on to start Aquaminds, which he explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Love&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt; on Quora. Scott was a brilliant creative funny friendly and vulnerable human. He put his heart into everything he did. His boss, before he worked for me, Alfred Mandel, called him Nudgie. When I heard that I started using that name for him too, until I realized it might not be the nicest thing. Recently Scott and I reconnected on Twitter. In a private exchange he said he liked the name. I'm sorry his life was so short. His enthusiasm and big heart and super active mind will be missed.</description>

			<description>Scott and I had dinner many times, and often traveled together on business. We always joked about how we were going to take on the then-dominant tech company IBM. It was either Boca or Bucha, which was short for Bucharest, where we were surely headed if we failed to defeat the mighty IBM. We'd talk about catching the red-eye to Bucharest. I don't know why it was then (and still is now) so funny. Bucharest was a pretty awful place at the time, run by an even worse dictator than IBM -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Ceaușescu&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Slavery formed us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm reading two books at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Zookeepers-Wife-War-Story/dp/039333306X&quot;&gt;The Zookeeper's Wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin&quot;&gt;Uncle Tom's Cabin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One about the Holocaust, the other about slavery. The pairing has me thinking about the differences. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been the year for me of reading about slavery. It has really been an eye-opening experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One observation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; was unthinkably horrible, but it wasn't slavery, the oppressors were trying to anihilate us, not enslave us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was over in five years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism is permanent, but it is not slavery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/15/400-years-since-slavery-timeline&quot;&gt;lasted&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;400 years&lt;/a&gt;, and imho it isn't over yet. It had a chance to form the whole culture of not just the US as some of our European friends sometimes imply, all white people everywhere are indicted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other differences, but the thing most Americans don't get is that slavery is deeply rooted and it isn't over yet. And if we want it to be over, it's going to require a near-universal conscious decision to end it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/6#issuecomment-962586664&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.client&quot;&gt;http.client&lt;/a&gt; does headers, and at first I said no, but then when I dug in, I realized yes, it does, for non-proxied calls, and with a simple addiiton it should work with proxied calls as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made the change in the released web Drummer, so theoretically it should work now. I don't have something immediately available to test with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're expecting to do HTTP-related programming from Drummer, this is something you should pay attention and if possible participate in. This is an important verb, and it's important to get it right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>JavaScript in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/?tab=blog&quot;&gt;Gary Teter&lt;/a&gt;, whose name I recognize from the Frontier community, I think -- has been writing eloquently about JavaScript and Drummer. I'm learning a lot reading how the product reflects off his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I agree totally about the potential for JavaScript which is being wasted by the way the language is being driven. We should be trying to coalesce it, not drive it apart into a bunch of incompatible languages. Reminds me of something &lt;a href=&quot;https://rms2.tumblr.com/post/35571080444/andrew-singer&quot;&gt;Andrew Singer&lt;/a&gt; who started Think Technologies (a company that should be remembered btw) -- in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have another chance to coalesce JavaScript. Drummer's language, which Gary has a name for btw, one that I like, removes the one imho sin of JavaScript that keeps it from being a scripting language. And I'm trying to hone a broad verb set, and writing good docs for them, and just in general slowing down and getting it right, looking at prior art, and not deprecting things that matter (like &lt;i&gt;request&lt;/i&gt; in Node.js, what a terrible idea!). It's all been very mindless. But JavaScript's universality is as important as say RSS's. It should be focused and developed. Yes, I am that ambitious for the language in Drummer which may soon have a name. 😇&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Poets and Plumbers. Users and developers. We're all smart, and love to learn, but in different areas and with different results. We multiply each others' work by learning how they think, what they care about, how they explain things. I've heard devs say that users just don't get how this works, only to realize later that their view is valid, and understanding it was key to creating tools they would love. That they would say &quot;this works like I think.&quot; When a user says that to you, believe me, it's the best feeling ever. An aside, my own father said that to me about ThinkTank. That was a big moment. So listening and trying to understand can produce fantastic results, and it goes both ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The other day &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber&quot;&gt;Gruber&lt;/a&gt; read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1453349951665287168&quot;&gt;Infoworld review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1983/05/17/169857.html?pageNumber=51&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1455673711634300930&quot;&gt;wondered&lt;/a&gt; about the &quot;Pascal operating system&quot; they referred to. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pascal.hansotten.com/ucsd-p-system/&quot;&gt;UCSD P-system&lt;/a&gt;. Without it I would not have been able to build an app as rich as ThinkTank that ran on the Apple II. UCSD was an orders of magnitude more memory-efficient than BASIC or assembly language, very important for a machine with just 48K for application code. And the P-system had overlays. Which meant if something didn't have to be in memory all the time, it could be swapped in when needed. Most Apple IIs only had floppy drives in those days, so it was slow and a pain in the ass, but a lot faster than quitting the program, inserting another disk and launching another app just to edit the text of a headline. What I learned as a result of Gruber's inquiry is that the P-system was one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling&quot;&gt;James Gosling's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;inspirations&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

We're all proof of that, btw -- but for most of us, no one ever thought we were anything more than a human being.</description>

I guess a lot of families have it, but I think we had more than most because before my uncle and myself, we were the first in our family to be born in the US, everyone emigrated, running for their lives from the Nazis, and coming close to not making it. They were all survivors, and had traits of people with severe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, untreated because this was the 60s and 70s, before they even knew such a thing existed in any formal treatable way. Anyway, I must've had a heavy family dream last night because I woke up feeling upset, unsettled, unloved -- all the feelings I knew very well in childhood.</description>

			<title>My GitHub projects</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have been trying to find a magic connection to GitHub. It seems too good a resource to not use in some first class way. Here are a few of my GitHub reading and writing projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/publishScriptingOpml&quot;&gt;publishScriptingOpml&lt;/a&gt; -- A simple server that copies scripting.com's OPML to the instantOutlines project on GitHub, when pinged. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; -- The source for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davegithub&quot;&gt;davegithub&lt;/a&gt; package that reads and writes to and from GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolNightly&quot;&gt;oldSchoolNightly&lt;/a&gt; -- A script that runs on the same machine as my CMS, that uploads JSON, OPML, RSS and HTML files from Scripting News to the repository on GitHub, every night.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/githubpub&quot;&gt;githubpub&lt;/a&gt; -- A Node app that serves from GitHub repositories over the web.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlToGitHub&quot;&gt;opmlToGitHub&lt;/a&gt; -- A Node app that reads an OPML file, converts it to Markdown, and uploads it to GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark&quot;&gt;pagepark&lt;/a&gt; -- My general-purpose Node web server can serve from a GitHub repo.

			<title>I ❤️ HTTPS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A user said they were surprised that I encouraged people to use HTTPS with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; blogs, even though I &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;speak out&lt;/a&gt; against Google trying to force HTTPS on the open web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are very different things!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want people to use my software in every way that makes sense, and if you're generating web content, which Drummer most certainly &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml&quot;&gt;does&lt;/a&gt;, HTTPS is one of the things people want to do. I support this. Let me say that slowly: I. Support. This.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, I use HTTPS myself. I am glad my bank uses it. And the health clinic I use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I object to is Google trying to take ownership of the web. I love that the web is the platform with no platform vendor. We're all guests here and that includes big companies like Google. And guests don't make the rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know some people run their lives such that they won't work with other people who don't see the world &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; as they do -- but I am not one of those people. Emphatically. I preach working together. It's my mission more than anything else. I am against walls that keep people out. Except with my private info, then I like them. See how that works?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
