			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written before the election was called. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many things to observe in this marathon of an election night.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, it's nice that it isn't a nailbiter. We know the outcome. Unlike my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson&quot;&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who is beyond impatient for the networks to call the election, I'm glad that it's stretching out. I wish the 2008 election had been similarly extended so we could have had a chance to absorb the change gradually. Instead boom, he was elected, giving his acceptance speech, still gives me goosebumps, and we all went out to party in the streets. Now we're getting to savor the fullness of the moment. And the eventfulness of 2020 is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, Covid is raging. Growing exponentially. We're doing nothing to resist it. The example Trump set during the campaign, all those awful rallies, more awful because they were such good entertainment, is probably responsible for a good portion of the growth. I heard on the news that there's a high correlation between regions hardest-hit by the virus and those that voted for Trump. They see it as a conundrum, but it's obvious what the connection is. People who live in Trump Country don't see the virus as a threat. That's gotta be one of the biggest indicators. People who don't feel threatened by it are probably more likely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so here's something people don't like to say out loud. But obviously the Trump election was a reaction to the Obama election. The yin to the yang. People who don't like uppity presidents (ie blacks) probably don't care for presidents who don't know their place is in the home (ie women). They thought Trump was the perfect way to say Fuck You Try Again Assholes. Let Trump drive them crazy. Smart. It sure did that. So when enough people got tired of Trump the Dems offer up an affable white grandpa, he likes dogs! -- just the thing, but they snuck in just behind him a woman who happens to be black! We hardly noticed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At one point the other day, when it seemed clear that Biden was going to top it off, we realized oh shit it's going to be Vice-President Harris. She's really going to be VP. The glass ceiling is breaking as we speak. But you know what, the people in Trump Country noticed. They might've told the pollsters they were going to vote for Uncle Joe, thinking all the time that a black women wasn't their idea of someone who should be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Esp such an old heart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that there's some time to contemplate this before it's official.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that's good is it gave Fox some time to decide how to handle this. At first they were going to refuse to call Biden President-elect Biden. That would have been a catastrophe. In the meantime, they figured it out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1324918336988221441&quot;&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/a&gt;, last night, looked into the camera and told Trump to go gracefully. They gave him an out. You have to figure if he doesn't take it, they're going to go ahead and call Biden president-elect. We had time to negotiate this. This is kind of a miracle but hardly anyone noticed. Fox isn't going to help start Civil War 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nate Silver is openly trying to figure out what happened with the polls. He seems glad that this is being drawn out too. Consider maybe the electorate was a moving target, and the polls, with all their heuristics couldn't pick that up. Things were seesawing with Trump in October. First he's in the hospital, looking frail, sick with Covid, possibly dying. That can't have been good for his polling. Then he recovers, is full of energy, pumped up on steroids, holding his normal now murderous rallies, and the Dems were holding drive-in embarrassments. &lt;i&gt;He juiced his base in late October, and it worked. &lt;/i&gt;It got people to think &quot;Hey hun, the old Trump is back,&quot; the virus didn't get him, look at the fun, and they switched their vote. They could, because Trump told them not to mail in their ballots. I think, net-net, people are being too hard on the polls, and too hard on the statisticians at the networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Meadows getting the virus at this moment and spreading it while covering  it up is the perfect epilogue for trump as something other than a tragic punchline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fargo digging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For a project I'm doing, I wanted to see how &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; did calendar structures. This is what I found out. It's here primarily so I can find it again later through search engines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/myPublicProfile.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; from Fargo, that I used briefly in the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014 to edit my blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was interested in the attributes that Fargo used. I wanted to see what type attributes it used for calendars. I was surprised to see that it didn't use any. It did use a &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; attribute. And now I can see what it used that for, it was for the name of the file. It allowed you to change the text of the headline without affecting the name of the file the HTML rendering was saved in. This had come up as a question in some of the work we're doing with Old School. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For clues about Fargo, I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/blog/&quot;&gt;Fargo blog&lt;/a&gt; indispensible. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/fargoBlog.opml&quot;&gt;OPML source&lt;/a&gt; for the Fargo blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The only time we have to listen to other Americans is when we vote. They can keep talking, that’s their right. But I can choose not to listen. There’s a limit to respect. I don’t listen to people when all they have to say is how they hate me.</description>

			<description>The news should reflect what the Trumps are really doing with the lawsuits. They're going to pitch state legislatures that the election was stolen and they should appoint different electors. The lawsuits just have to get press coverage and show up in opinion polls. They wouldn't have to flip too many states with Republican legislatures. For example: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan.</description>

			<description>Assuming Trump refuses to leave the White House, here’s the plan. Turn the White House into our equivalent of Lenin’s tomb. Seal it off but, everyone but Trump can leave, send him food and water and people can visit to see the imprisoned former president. When he dies embalm him.</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;While the campaign was still on, I didn't want to criticize the Dems for their rallies, which were basically impossible to watch. They must've been even worse to be a speaker at. You take a gifted campaigner like Obama, who could get into a lovefest with an audience, he had so many good lines like Don't Boo, Vote. The crowd would boo just to get him to say it! Or he'd say &lt;i&gt;Fired up! &lt;/i&gt;and everyone would scream &lt;i&gt;Ready to go! &lt;/i&gt;Even watching the rallies on TV would get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin&quot;&gt;love chemicals&lt;/a&gt; to flow through your blood. But the drive-in rallies, while the idea seemed cute and innovative, as an idea, were, in practice, embarrassing. I kept wondering if the Dems could have done something like what the NBA and MLB did, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportscasting.com/theres-a-surprising-amount-of-tech-behind-the-nbas-fake-crowd-noise/&quot;&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/09/05/baseball-fake-crowd-nosie&quot;&gt;crowd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/the-invisible-crowd-inside-the-nfls-fake-crowd-noise-system/2381799/&quot;&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone knew they were fake, but you didn't mind. Even though a basketball game with no crowd noise is actually kind of nice, as at a small college game, not having a crowd cheering and booing at the right times during the NBA Finals and the World Series would have been awful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the Repubs cut the corner, and went ahead and had viral-spreading events in the form of end-game political rallies. And they were wonderful. Trump, like Obama, really is in his element in those rallies. Once, because of a stubborn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaaltv.com/rochester-minnesota-news/president-trump-campaign-rally-rochester-october-30/5911428/&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_Minnesota&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, he had to give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/10/30/trump-rallies-in-rochester-with-spillover-from-250-capacity-showing-support-outside/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; to a socially distanced group of 250 people, and his heart wasn't in it, and he left early. So the Repubs cheated. I think that's where a lot of his votes came from. If the campaign had ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsGqrLkmFMU&quot;&gt;Trump on the balcony&lt;/a&gt;, febrile, gasping for air and weak, pulling of his mask, then we would have gotten the Biden/Harris landslide that the polls predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The really awful part is that the pundits, idiots, one and all, are ignoring the context of this election. As if it were a normal election where the candidates were playing on something of a level playing field. They weren't. The Repubs sacrificed hundreds of lives, and thousands of peoples' health and helped spread the virus that was already spreading uncontrollably. They weren't rallies for the presidency as much as they were rallies for the virus. Come get sick, and btw, also see the president dance. The people would have come out, just as much, for Obama and his mantras, or him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXcNgCr0nk&quot;&gt;brushing the dirt&lt;/a&gt; off his jacket, or just looking like the stud he is. Or Biden telling stories of his lost family, and how great America still is, and how it'll all come back as soon as he's in the Oval. But they didn't, and that was the right thing to do. And the pundits, who really do need to be fired, are ignoring the whole thing, and pretending the Dems are out of touch, when they were totally committed to the reality that there is a deadly pandemic that is happening at the same time as the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a replay of what happened in the final days of the primary, when people were mourning the loss of E Warren, and the impeachment was booting up. The virus was already the Big Story, but everyone was putting it off until they could get around to it. Same thing now. When we come back to the pandemic we will notice that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/us-coronavirus-100000-daily-cases&quot;&gt;100K new cases yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time record. But until we all focus on it, full time, and take our medicine, for real, we will never get out of this mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe next week the news can somehwat get back to reality.  And if the Biden win doesn't prove to be a mirage, we can all breathe a sigh of relief that the Orange Monster will be going back to where ever they will have him. I hear Florida voted for him, good -- he's theirs now. No backsies. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Trump probably impressed the rest of the Republican Party by turning out so many voters, and keeping Congress competitive, even if he did have to spread a lot of virus to do it. Rallies make for better television if you don't mind killing hundreds of rally-goers, and making thousands sick.</description>

			<description>Funny thing, James Carville, who I love, has now been wrong about the last two elections. In 2018 he said it wouldn't result in Dem control of the House, and it did. And this time he predicted 2020 would be a landslide for the Dems, and unless some mistake has been made, not so.</description>

From there, you can click on the names to see their ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You may get ideas for new binges from this, or may find people you know who have similar tastes. At least you'll have something to talk about next time you get together. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/193&quot;&gt;post them here&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How did you spend your night? I watched MSNBC, love Kornacki, you can have the rest of them, but I hated whenever the sound came on saying &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.9em;&quot;&gt;IT'S TIME TO CALL SOMETHING&lt;/span&gt;. It was always something like Kentucky or South Dakota, Vermont or New York. At one point I wrote on Twitter we're on the roller coaster now. That feeling of this is being done to me, I don't like it but at this point I have no choice, I'm on for the ride. I watched as Kornacki flipped over the counties in Florida, a remarkable number of which I was familiar with either from having been there or listening to any number of podcasts instructing me what to look out for. Very depressing. Oh shit. This feels like 2016, I said -- as did everyone else watching the returns. I started nodding off around 9PM and finally decided to go to bed at 10, and woke up at 1AM, and went looking to see how things had turned out and I literally screamed out loud when I saw Trump was ahead in Wisconsin. Oy oy oy. So here we are. And where is that exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well, Biden is very likely to win. And that is good news, even though they're already spinning on the webs that it would have been better if we won the Senate and lost the presidency, which is such utter bullshit. People are so stupid. Getting rid of Trump was job #1, and it seems we will get rid of him. No I didn't watch his campaign rally in the White House, and yes, I have heard it quoted, and yes, he is trying to be a dictator, and no doubt his voters will listen and believe him, and will drive their cars around running people off the road, and they might even kill people, but we're already dying in great numbers, so what the fuck difference would that make. Here's what getting rid of Trump means. Goodbye Bill Barr. Hello Paris Climate Treaty and let's get back together with the Iran deal. Let's start playing to win in international trade instead of just abdicating and sounding tough. And btw, let's get the babies out of those prisons, find their parents or at least get them into a home-like situation. And then think about all the things Trump won't be able to do if he's just a private citizen. Yes, he can be a first class asshole, and have rallies, but he will also be tried and probably convicted and go to jail. And for sure McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do, but think of it this way, Biden will block everything McConnell wants to do, something Trump didn't do. So fuck you and your fancy theories about wishing Trump were still president and McConnell would be Minority Leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's something I write every time a Republican wins, even though this time a Republican didn't win. We need to organize on a permanent persistent basis. It's not enough to ask for our money and phone banking at election time. We the non-elites have to be part of governing. You don't get to just ask for our money every four years and then say thanks now go away. We need to be part of this. Luckily we have this great technology that enables this, and we need to use it. Howard Dean was on the right track in 2004, but there was no follow-through (and of course he didn't even get nominated). Facebook and Twitter et al aren't the only models. We can create new media where people get to participate and where spamming means nothing. Today's networks are set up in a way that makes the most money for advertisers. We can set up networks that are great for governing and organizing. Until we do things will just keep getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was depressed at 10PM and 1AM but by 6AM I was over it. I'm ready for the next season in the great drama of American politics.&lt;i&gt; Let's have fun! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>My parents weren't perfect, but they had democracy down. Each year my mother or father would take us voting with them. We went into the booth, watched while they flipped the switches in the old style voting booth, and then pulled the big lever that opened the curtain, logged the vote and we went on our way.</description>

			<description>When I was 17 I was too young to vote, but I really wanted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;McGovern&lt;/a&gt; to win. I was campaigning for him, going door to door &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Rockaway,_Queens&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; ever the campaign sent us. My father didn't have a strong opinion, so he let me have his vote. One of the nicest most memorable gifts he gave me.</description>

The characters are great because they all remind me of someone dear to me. It's not Le Grand Binge, it's more like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuse-bouche&quot;&gt;amuse-bouche&lt;/a&gt;, something to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate_cleanser&quot;&gt;cleanse the palate&lt;/a&gt;, before going onto more serious fare. Right up there with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock&quot;&gt;30 Rock&lt;/a&gt;, another of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my favorite&lt;/a&gt; shows. I'm still in Season 1 on Better Things. Savoring each episode because it makes me feel good, in times when feeling good isn't the norm.</description>

			<description>All the commercial publishing services are broken in one way or another. Twitter has a character limit. Substack makes you use their editor, Facebook has no links, styling or titles.

			<description>Back in 1994 I had what was then a revolutionary idea. That a software developer could write about the world just like a columnist does. Not after stopping being a software developer, but as &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of being a software developer. People really didn't understand.</description>

			<description>When they say Trump has a 10% chance of winning the election, that means, precisely, that if they had 10 elections just like this one, Trump would win one, and Biden would win nine.</description>

			<description>I use my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt; app on my Mac to keep local folders in sync with locations on S3. It works flawlessly, and performs a function I used to use Dropbox for, until they dropped their public folder feature.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1323089156185214977&quot;&gt;Ben Smith thinks&lt;/a&gt; Twitter may buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;, viewing it as Twitter Premium. Let's hope we can do better. Start by getting rid of the character limit in Twitter so we don't need to invent new channels just to distribute essays. Twitter can already do photos and video. People do all kinds of hacks to distribute writing. Let's re-legitimize it. Also can you imagine how pissed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)&quot;&gt;Evan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter co-founder and founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, would feel if Twitter bought Substack? Leaving Medium out in the cold. It's long been assumed the reason Twitter didn't relax the character limit is because of Medium. As we say in the blogging world, oy.</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dtone612/status/1322899801743261696&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; really grabbed me. &quot;I intubated a relatively healthy 86 year old man with covid in the ER at 4:30 this morning. He was alone, I was the last person he spoke with and he was confused. He’ll likely die in the ICU, alone. I don’t make any extra money for that.&quot;</description>
