			<title>Default is another word for run</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The US government is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1700s/1791_First_Bank/&quot;&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That means you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond#United_States&quot;&gt;deposit money&lt;/a&gt; with the government, and it will pay you interest.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people put their money in the government bank, even though it doesn't pay the highest interest, because unlike all other banks, it's thought to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Savings_Bonds#:~:text=They%20are%20considered%20one%20of,of%20the%20United%20States%20government.&quot;&gt;safest place to put money&lt;/a&gt;. When you want it back, to spend, or give to a relative or friend, or invest in stocks, the odds are nearly 100% that you will get the money.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why do people feel that way about the US government bank? Because it's one of the core values of the US. The first treasury secretary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/alexander-hamilton-debt-national-bank-two-parties-1789-american-history-great-courses-plus-180962954/&quot;&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, set it up this way. In all the years since 1776, through a civil war, depressions, two world wars, the United States has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; met its obligation to return money to lenders. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now sometimes terrible things happen, and a bank can't give money back to depositors. What happens then is: 1. There's a run on the bank by depositors and the bank fails. Depositors lose their money, or 2. Some larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposit, and the run stops, because confidence returns among creditors. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;larger institution&quot; often is the United States government, because it is the most solvent bank in the world for the simple reason that we are the only entity that can print money that will be accepted everywhere in the world. It's an incredible privilege to have. Imagine if you could buy anything you want just by writing a check. It wouldn't matter if you &quot;had&quot; the money, because you can print the money. It's as if the check itself were worth money. It's why all the comparisons to smaller countries like Greece are ridiculous. Greece can print money if they want to, but people will only accept dollars not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma&quot;&gt;drachmas&lt;/a&gt;. We can have anything we want and as much of it as we want and all we have to do is invent the money to pay for it! (Obviously if we abused this privilege in a way that seriously hurt the world economy there would be a problem, so we don't do that.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay, now suppose one day, just for the hell of it, the government decides to try defaulting, for some reason that's hard to fathom. Remember, we have the ability to pay the bills. It's as if you told Visa or MasterCard that you weren't paying your bill, but please don't ruin my credit rating because I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; pay, it's just that I don't want to. By defaulting I mean, a depositor goes to the bank and ask for their money, and the teller hands them a card that says &quot;Sorry no money for you.&quot; Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt; in Seinfeld. As a depositor you would be very angry and you'd tweet about it to tell everyone what happened, and they'd all go to the bank and demand their money, and voila, you have a run on the bank. That would probably be the first thing that happened after a default. Everyone who had money on deposit with the US government would demand it back so they could put it somewhere that wasn't managed by lunatics. But because we're defaulting we give everyone the &quot;No money for you&quot; card instead of their money. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What normally happens in a bank run, a larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposits, can't happen here because there is no institution larger than the US government. So what happens? No one knows. But it won't be good, that's for sure. We got a small taste of it in 2008 when a relatively small bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers&quot;&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, was over-extended, and a run resulted, and as a result other banks who had money in Lehman, couldn't get it, they started defaulting, and the economy of the &lt;i&gt;whole world&lt;/i&gt; froze. Shipping stopped. Airlines couldn't fly. It was a very scary time. The US government started writing checks, huge checks, and we just got through it by the skin of our teeth. But again, this time, it's the US government defaulting and no one can play that role in this meltdown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If we're lucky, and people believe they can trust China or the European Union, they might write off the assets they have stored in the US, and never use our bank as the safest place to store value, because we all lost so much in the run that followed the default. We'd start storing value in Chinese or European currency. And the US would become an ordinary country, with no special ability to print money that everyone accepts. It won't be a recession in the US, instead we will see an invisible support for our economy disappear in an instant. Some of it already disappeared, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades#Background&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; we flirted with default. But if we actually default, the US economy will become much less potent. We no longer will have the ability to print money to pay our bills. Now some people will tell you that's a good thing, but they're the worst kind of idiot. It's like saying it's better to be homeless because you don't have to pay rent. We won't have an idea how our lives are elevated by this privilege until we lose it. It's been there for our whole lives. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/07/soupNaziSeinfeld.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soup_Nazi&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt; in Seinfeld. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are some inaccuracies here. I am not an economist. But I think I do correctly understand the big picture. We learned a lot about it in 2008 and after. This isn't something you want to screw around with, but that's what we're doing anyway. It's even more insane than what the British did in Brexit, and that's hard to do! So let's not do it. Call your Congressperson, especially if they're Republican, and let them know you understand what they're doing and you will work tirelessly against their re-election if they don't withdraw their support, immediately, for default. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Nor does mine. Here's why I think that. Most of my relatives had strong opinions and stated them often and did not welcome dissent. My father and mother. Both grandfathers. My maternal grandmother. Uncle Ken. They all had opinions about everything. Sometimes they even changed their minds, to their credit. And one hid something about himself that I learned later from Wikipedia (amazingly my maternal grandfather was a communist, still not sure I believe it, Wikipedia is often full of misinfo). Anyway the point is that all the people I listed are now dead. If anyone cared about their opinions when they were alive (I don't think anyone did) they certainly don't care about them now. Soon enough you and I will be dead. So go ahead and have the opinions if it makes you happy. But if it makes you miserable, as it often did for my relatives, consider not bothering because simply does not matter. And the stupid thing is we've built our networks around the idea that opinions matter. Think of all the wasted bandwidth and server space. Maybe it'd be better if the AI bots win. At least they don't repeat themselves all the time with complaints about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti&quot;&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt; and whatnot. BTW I loved all the people I listed above even if I didn't enjoy their opinions very much.</description>

			<title>Ideas for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I were in trying-to-work-with-Twitter mode, I would suggest...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Along with the monthly fee, add a certain number of API calls to every user who pays. Then devs could make products for them, without having to pay Twitter. Make the thing self-funding so individuals could play not just corporations. Twitter is more of an end-user thing than a corporate thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For  $1 more per month, include some JSON storage for the user, accessible to the apps they grant access to, thus moving into an area AWS should be in but refuses to go. Storage that goes with identity for people not just techies. A retail-ized version of Amazon S3. It will be an &lt;i&gt;enormous&lt;/i&gt; business. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'd comp devs who make software, and give them a special icon so people know to ask them for features. Incentives. Think like a businessperson not a school marm. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You want to really clean up?  Co-promote the developer products and share revenue. It doesn't cost much to buy developer love.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: As a free addon for users, give each paying user an RSS feed, a good one. I will help you do this really well, no charge.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The mother of all bank runs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Defaulting on the national debt will be like the crash of Lehman Brothers in 2008, only a lot worse, because we were able to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/06/prowess-definition.html&quot;&gt;prowess&lt;/a&gt; of the US dollar to prop up the banking system when Lehman fell. There's nothing that can prop up the dollar that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is not about the economy being strong or weak. It's about whether we have an economy at all. Not just the US but the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Emphatically: There is no economy without the dollar playing that role. it's not a matter of weak or strong, it's about the &lt;i&gt;existence&lt;/i&gt; of an economy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of economics that's more like physics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me put a different way. If it weren't for the US government bailout that barely worked little old Lehman Brothers would have crashed us into a new global dark ages. That's what they meant by &quot;too big to fail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The US is a big fucking bank. If it crashes there's no one to bail it out. Welcome to your future, no health care, transport, food, electricity, no TV or internet. Everyone for themself. Not a recession. A collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; that the Repubs are hellbent to crash us into a new dark age, it's that the people are so uneducated, and that includes journalists, that they don't get that this is what's at stake or they don't want to say it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be the mother of all bank runs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/06/us-gov-default-impact.html&quot;&gt;write about this&lt;/a&gt;. I agree with what it said. &quot;It is estimated that about two-thirds of the US national debt is held by US citizens and institutions.&quot; So if we default, I guess, that's who we're ripping off, though the Repubs never talk about that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What we need is not one twitter to replace the old twitter but a whole armada of twitters. Like the podcastosphere with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-podcast-player-apps&quot;&gt;all the different players&lt;/a&gt;. Look at how much better that's working.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a user, I no longer want to have to visit five sites to see what's new. I no longer want to have to copy/paste my writing into those same five sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each social net we belong to should have a feed coming out of it, virtually or for real, that contains a stream of all messages from accounts I'm subscribed to. How they do it behind the interface is up to each network, as with TCP/IP. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each network must present the same highly-factored easy to support and impossible to break API with libraries for all major platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's up to each platform, or independent developers working on its behalf, to adapt their native protocol to the internet format. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also -- see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/04.html#a145706&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I did on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I want Bluesky to go away</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I definitely want Bluesky to just go away. I don't like it because if it gains traction it has potential of replacing Twitter as the festering turd in the middle of what should have been a vibrant growing market that keeps anything else from rising in competition with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To people who say &quot;Oh Dave but it's federated and it has an open protocol&quot; -- yes I've heard that, but there are all kinds of games you can play, such that even if it's true (and so far it isn't), no competitor ever rises, or as soon as they do, they are foreclosed on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't like it because it's Jack Dorsey. You say &quot;Oh Dave but Jack is just a board member&quot; to which I say oh please, I wasn't born yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this Jack-induced nightmare is for: 1. It to fail quietly and 2. Jack to sit the fuck down and do something other than plant huge turds in the middle of what should be a vibrant thriving open market, which means there are lots of entrants, choice, and opporunities for cooperation and innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If having a license from &lt;i&gt;The Jack&lt;/i&gt; is a requirement, well we've already wasted 17 years on Twitter waiting for that to become something wonderful and it's fair to say now that it never did and never will, so Jack please enjoy your wealth and play somewhere else and leave Twitter and post-Twitter alone. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also -- see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/142200.html?title=internetSocialMediaApps&quot;&gt;The Internet of Social Media Apps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Knicks won. The series is now tied 1-1. They were losing until the very end of the game when a couple of bad calls went our way (truth), but also -- our passes were finding the open man, and the shots were going down. I tried to watch the beginning of the next game, the Lakers vs the Warriors, but I just couldn't get the energy. Instead I watched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSG_Network&quot;&gt;local station&lt;/a&gt; postgame coverage of the Knicks. It was fun to see them so excited. They have a star, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt&quot;&gt;Monica McNutt&lt;/a&gt;, who is so cool, I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/03/monicaMcnutt.png&quot;&gt;watch her&lt;/a&gt; talking about jello and oatmeal and find it fascinating. It's sad that the men on MSG don't seem to see her, but someone there must get she's the future and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pidto&quot;&gt;little troll&lt;/a&gt; is funny as long as he shuts up after repeating himself once or twice. I will watch the next Lakers game, hoping they lose in a horrific way. I think LeBron should step aside. And hey it was great to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/05/02/carmelo-anthony-gets-garden-ovation-at-knicks-heat-game-2/&quot;&gt;Melo welcomed&lt;/a&gt; so warmly at the Knicks game. We will always love Melo. Finally thank goodness there isn't another Knicks game until Saturday. I need some time to process the possibility that the Knicks &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be going to the conference finals.</description>

It's a couple of years old and the battery doesn't hold a charge very well. So I decided to treat myself to a new mini, and since there's a new version, the 6th generation, I went for that. I also decided to get 64GB instead of the 256GB I have on the current one, because these days most of the video I watch is streamed, not downloaded, and I don't use that much space, or so I thought. After four attempts to transfer the contents of the old iPad to the new one, each one taking hours, I gave up. The design of the transfer app is terrible. You have to be there for the whole process, because it asks questions after long pauses. It doesn't do enough preflighting. So it takes an hour before it decides it can't do the transfer because the old one has too much data for the new one. I hoped they would do something smarter than just refusing to do the transfer. I don't really care if it moves any of the movies or audio files. What matters is that it correctly moves the apps and the configuration data for the apps, the stuff that takes a huge amount of time to do manually. In the end, I realized this wasn't any fun, and remembered how Steve Jobs obsessed over the unwrapping experience of new Apple products, and felt sad that Apple didn't hold on to that value very well. Instead I'm going to buy a 5th gen iPad Mini from Amazon and save a hundred dollars. I won't be able to do a trade-in, so maybe I'll find a deserving person to send my old iPad to instead. Or maybe I'll just stick with the old mini until its battery completely fails.</description>

			<description>Here's something maybe to not look forward to. Next time you call for customer service, you will speak with one of ChatGPT's cousins. It will sound like a human, but will be clear it's not. Beg for mercy from a machine, a machine that's programmed to sound like they care, while being obstinate. Just try and cancel a subscription to the NY Times.</description>

			<description>Watching last night's NBA playoff game, the announcer would say if a shot went in or spun out of the basket before it's clear, visually, which way it was going. Is this a deliberate delay of the video feed, or a technical glitch somewhere in the network?</description>

When you watch the newest episode a second time, you realize that they have something, each of them. Kendall is creative, and is a Steve Jobs type showman who can think on his feet. Shiv is a plotter, networker and manager. Roman is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/02/meaning-of-machiavellian.html&quot;&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/a&gt; monarch. They don't necessarily let scruples get in their way. Each of them has part of Logan's personality, and all are good at it, they just didn't necessarily know while he was alive, trying to exist in his shadow. This epside is where the turned from klutzes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&amp;t=265s&quot;&gt;serious people&lt;/a&gt; perhaps with potential for greatness. And Tom fits in there too, we find out in the last scene of the most recent episode. I like that. I identify with Tom.</description>

I write an outline to organize the work. I put things where they belong as they are created. Nothing new about that, I've been working this way since the 80s. But the bot can help me manage it. I got an idea how this could work when I chose a codename for a new product using ChatGPT to make suggestions. It led me to a new more creative approach and I think a more interesting name. I hope it learned from what I did and may help other people choose names in the future. I just did an outline for the project and I'm not sure how I would give it to my friend the bot. We used to think of uploading our brains to computers, well isn't that what I'm doing now? It's a level or two above what I do with GitHub, but a similar idea. You can see how my brain works, either way. I'm making an effort to leave that as something others might learn from in the future.</description>

Nothing new about that, I've been working this way since the 80s. But the bot can help me manage it. I got an idea how this could work when I chose a codename for a new product using ChatGPT to make suggestions. It led me to a new more creative approach and I think a more interesting name. I hope it learned from what I did and may help other people choose names in the future. I just did an outline for the project and I'm not sure how I would give it to my friend the bot. We used to think of uploading our brains to computers, well isn't that what I'm doing now? It's a level or two above what I do with GitHub, but a similar idea. You can see how my brain works, either way. I'm making an effort to leave that as something others might learn from in the future." created="Tue, 02 May 2023 12:55:19 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/02/10/gumby.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/02.html#a125519"/>

			<title>The AI bots are already smarter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/29/monaLisa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT where the so-called godfather of AI is concerned that AI might get out of control. His two major concerns, as outlined in the article are that people might lose jobs, and not just menial jobs, and we might have a hard time finding out the truth. Another concern is that the bots will be fighting wars on our behalf, as we have seen in many science fiction stories over the generations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is already smarter than humans because it has a non-zero attention span, and isn't trying to promote its own career and has no conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you ask a human a question, the answer will probably just be a canned &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/schpiel-definition.html&quot;&gt;schpiel&lt;/a&gt; they have memorized based on hearing a keyword in what you said. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it isn't much of a leap to say someday the bots may be smarter than humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The better conclusion is that humans better get our shit together start using our intelligence because the competition is here and it's already better than we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, for years I've been trying to find an explanation of the difference between rain and showers in weather forecasts. I asked ChatGPT and it patiently &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/rain-vs-showers.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. I asked thousands of humans and the answers I got were either vague or wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
