Next up -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Eleven_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/a&gt;. I read the book a few years ago, but this series isn't much like the book. I like it so far. I usually don't binge shows as they come out, I like to wait for the series to end, and then watch it at my own pace. But this is an exception. Anyway I watched episodes 4 and 5 last night, both were very good, esp the one that took place in the airport in the first days of the apocalypse. I think HBO has the secret formula for making great TV series. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fstation-eleven&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; is right up there with Succession, Game of Thrones, etc.</description>

			<title>The significance of Daytona</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep beating this drum until people hear it, get how significant Daytona  is. It's as if all this time we were driving on roads that only went in one direction. It took 27 years of blogging for me to get around to add a lane going in the other direction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it's not surprising we thought blogs were for getting attention. That's all the medium supported, really. Yes we added feeds, so it could be somewhat more efficient to squeeze the new bits out of a sea of blogs. But this is more fundamental. Even if no one else reads my blog, having an idea harvester and an archive of years of writing gives me something no one has had before. No one. The sad part is Google could have and should have done this years ago. I think that's why I had the mental block that kept me from pursuing this. I figured it must be hard. It wasn't. It's just a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=MySQL&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; database with the outlines loaded into them. And luckily I kept a pretty good archive, so over the period of a week or so I was able to load much of it into the database. I think I'll get the rest of it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep banging the drum. There's a lot more potential in the web as an intellectual environment. We need to get beyond the loud screams for attention, another purpose for writing publicly. Obviously it's not for everyone or even most people. But for the people who think, and want to accumulate their knowledge over time, this bit of tech has been missing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But first, if you've watched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1474288736477356035&quot;&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; of the movie, this review is not a spoiler. It's a farce, along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr Strangelove&lt;/a&gt;. It's LOL funny all through. The acting is amazing because they've got a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/24/cast.png&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; of the most wonderful actors of our day. It's hard for me to not love a movie that stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;. The movie is sexy and true. Yes, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/24/weReallyDidHaveEverything.png&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;, and we blew it -- in the movie and in real life. It's a critique of our response to climate change, and Covid, and even has a dig at Trump (the president's chief of staff played by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Hill&quot;&gt;Jonah Hill&lt;/a&gt; is her son). I've already watched the ending twice, and I expect I'll watch the whole movie all the way through to the end at least once more. As to why the critics don't like it, the movie blames journalism for pretty much everything. I can imagine they must have realized doing so meant bad reviews, but they went for it anyway. If you're a climate change denier or a MAGA person, you probably won't like this movie either.</description>

			<description>I'm now loading all the posts from 1997 to 2010 into the Daytona database. For all the time involved, it's amazing how consistent the format is. In the early part of the archive, most posts had no created attribute. Then starting around 2004 most did, but I think it was only until 2017 that they all did. So I had to revise the conversion script to synthesize them if they weren't there.</description>

If you haven't seen it, or you have and liked it, then don't read the rest of this post. I like story-telling in movies, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;the first Matrix&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, was one of the best movies ever, as a story. It's a puzzle. Red pill, blue pill, who is Agent Smith, and The Oracle, and why does Morpheus think Neo is The One. And wtf is the Matrix! It's a beautiful story, and the characters -- young Keanu and Carrie-Anne, Hugo Weaving, Lawrence Fishburne. In the 2021 version, they recast a bunch of them and spent huge amounts of time explaining why. Who cares. When I switched it off last night, the characters were still yapping about what changed and why. It reminded me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;, a movie whose plot didn't start until they finished re-introducing all the main characters. And then they had about 40 minutes for something unmemorable, even stupid. Anyway I will finish Matrix 4, if only because maybe there's something worthwhile there. And I know some people really liked it, I don't understand why, but I respect that. Maybe sequels like this shouldn't be made, or maybe no one has figured out yet how to do it. Or maybe all movies these days have to be all about action and narration without acting or plots getting in the way. Instead I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Piano&quot;&gt;The Piano&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix, a wonderful movie, with almost no dialog, and no characters insisting that I hear their explanation for what happened. You get to figure it out for yourself.</description>

			<description>I haven't heard NPR talk about the failure of American democracy once. Lots of times they've blamed Biden for all kinds of loose shit. But never ever have they even mentioned that our democracy is almost over.</description>

Imagine if every night Ari Melber ran a profile of one of the people who could be funding the Republican push to autocracy and Manchin and Sinema's obstruction. Just say hey this is a billionaire who, according to recent Supreme Court rulings, can turn the US into a fascist hell, and might be one of them who's doing it. You could film Ari calling his office and asking the receptionist if he could speak to the ruling class member who could be quietly pulling the strings. No talk of &quot;kill shots&quot; or the like. No mobs invading their offices or homes. Just let's find out who they are and what they've done that we know of that fucks us over. And call Elizabeth Warren and ask why she talks about taxes all the time, when that's not the actual problem.</description>

			<description>If the people on TV weren't tools for the ruling class, if they really cared about you, they'd say the truth about Omicron. 1. We have no idea if it will kill you. 2. You should probably stay home if you don't want to be one of the test cases.</description>

I started by reviewing the top level folders on scripting.com. I saw a folder called opmlArchive. In there were folders for the years 1997 through 2010. I opened them up, and saw folders with each of the months, 01, 02 and so on. Then I opened each of those, and there were OPML files for each of the days. And inside the OPML files, the source text for that day's blog. And they're pretty much exactly the same format as the format I use today. My CMS isn't called Old School for nothing. Anyway I'm just merging the daily files into monthly ones, to be consistent with the archive that I've been keeping on GitHub since 2017. In few minutes I'll be adding 12+ years of source text. And then after a bit I'll load all this into Daytona. My memory is so weird, I vaguely remember setting this up. I mostly just do things like that and forget them. What this tells me is if I hunt around on my hard drive, I'll find the editing tools I was using then. It's almost as if someone else did all this stuff.</description>

			<description>BTW, yesterday a Radio UserLand blogger asked me if there was a way to convert their blog archive to OPML. I'm sure we could do it, probably fairly easily. The thing to look for is a file called radio.root. It's the object database that contains everything, including your blog posts. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/227&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.</description>

			<description>I haven't been listening to a lot of political podcasts these days because political reporting is asleep at the wheel, like the Biden administration, re the coup that keeps going, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/transcripts/Z3FUKzFDL2x0NURwZmJ2RmdnL0dXQzc4cUVwVmUyUzBzeWRrempwVElpYz0=&quot;&gt;this week's Amicus podcast&lt;/a&gt; is the exception. Though they are too kind to the press, the guest, Walter Shaub, has a clear mind re the coup, and the Biden's lack of response. I highly recommend a listen.</description>

			<title>I want gists in Drummer blogs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub has a nice feature called gists. They're little documents you can edit and share with other devs. GitHub hosts them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For fun here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting&quot;&gt;all my gists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can also embed them in web pages. I tried it, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they won't for some reason let me embed them in blogs that my users use. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So maybe I'm missing something? Or maybe I have to replicate the functionality of their plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I really want the look and feel of their plugin. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy! There must be an answer to this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I embedded a gist here, manually. Hey maybe this is good enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/scripting/3e5454f2b7a10029dfc301d7deabb576.js?file=package.json&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Reading OPML in JavaScript apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking on the phone yesterday with Scott Hanson, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; user and programmer, and longtime friend. He's been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage&quot;&gt;OPML package&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things it reads OPML files into JavaScript structures, and goes the other way, writes them out as OPML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like reading and writing JSON. It parses and stringifies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well Scott was surprised at how simple it is. I was surprised that he was surprised, but pleased that he used it, and happy to shine a light on what he saw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So -- here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/states.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the link to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/examples/browser/index.html&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; that uses the OPML package to read the file and it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/opmlpackage/examples/browser/index.html#json&quot;&gt;displays what it gets&lt;/a&gt;, which should look familiar to any JavaScript programmer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;From there your code and do anything it wants with the data it has. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should write some high-level routines that do common operations to an in-memory OPML structure. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about the OPML package, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues/2&quot;&gt;good place to ask&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A note to &quot;Web3&quot; backers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If there is actual substance to the hijack called &quot;Web3&quot; then they should do two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Come up with a name I can use for it that doesn't begin with W-E-B  because I don't want to support hijacking the web.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; I'm going to keep working in JS and Node, and writing my blog, but give me bridges into your world. I am not under any circumstances moving my act into your space. Only suckers would do that, so you have to build these bridges so you might as well start there. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why podcasting isn't dominated</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/22/paulBunyan.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I asked this question &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/20.html#a142628&quot;&gt;on the blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1472930147137466372&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. And so far all the answers have been about the companies, and imho they've been wrong. First, there are plenty of huge tech companies that have set out to own podcasting, and were fairly sure their dominance in other categories would help them achieve dominance in podcasting. I've listened to their bluster and at times have been worried that it might work. After all Google owns search, and Apple made the iPod (and therefore it's assumed by many that they invented podcasting). Amazon owns Audible which dominates audiobooks. Spotify is huge, and they've set out to dominate podcasting, and maybe they will, but they haven't so far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Second, how do I know that no single tech company dominates podcasting, or as some people claim a few of them do? Because the market doesn't behave like one that is dominated. There is no gatekeeper that can turn down your podcast, make you not cover topics they don't want covered or use language or images they don't think are acceptable, or compete with them. All these are features of dominated product categories. The press doesn't turn to Spotify or Apple to blame them for something someone said on a podcast that incited a riot or threatened a celebrity or politician. They don't turn to the companies because they are not dominant and they know it. I know no big tech company dominates podcasting because if you want to start a podcast there's no one who can tell you you can't. If you want to listen to a podast on your favorite player, yes there are some you can't, but you can for the vast majority of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now to the question that I actually asked that no one seems to want to answer. Why? Why is it this way? Why podcasting and not the other tech-based media. Why is podcasting still open after over 20 years? Drumroll please. The answer: there are enough users who understand how it is supposed to work. They expect to be able to listen to any podcast anywhere they want. Most probably don't understand why they have this ability, about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=podcasting&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and technology design that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/21/metaImage.png&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; it possible, but they understand that they have the ability. And it doesn't have to be all of them or even most of them, just &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; of them, whatever that means. And for right now, at the end of 2021, there are enough. Podcasting has always been and remains an open platform. I can't say it will be for the future, but so far so good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/23/mrNatural.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I'm not saying this as a form of self-congratulation, or an appeal for kudos, though I gratefully accept any that are offered. I'm focusing your attention on this because &lt;i&gt;we can do it again.&lt;/i&gt; Start a new medium with the understanding that users have the right to move, the right to use any tool they want to create media or listen to (or read or view or experience) it. That there are no gatekeepers that control them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words the example of podcasting says there's hope. We don't have to accept a bad answer. We can have freedom, and users are the key to that. I've always said that, because it's true. Users have the power, but they have to use it. But first developers have to set it up from the beginning so they are not locked in and so creators are not controlled. To set the expectation that they have the freedom to not be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Dear media experts. Have you wondered why podcasting is still a competitive thing? No tech company dominates, but not for lack of trying. How do you explain that?</description>

			<description>I forget where I read this, but the idea of the US losing our democracy is too strange for people to accept it, so you can be pretty sure it’s going to happen. Then 30 years later, maybe we’ll overthrow the dictatorship, with great effort and loss.</description>

			<description>I heard on NPR this morning that we elected Biden to fight Covid. Nothing else. Stated as fact.  I don't know about you, but I would have voted for anyone who wasn't Trump.   I think NPR ought to be much more careful lest people forget to vote in 2022 and 2024.</description>

			<description>Another thing. Americans need to grow the fuck up.  The president made vaccines free. But he couldn't make everyone take it. Thus we're experiencing more sickness. And you (the press) want to blame Biden? You're crazy. Journalism, never has it been more clear, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE&quot;&gt;you're hurting America&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>New blog archives in Daytona</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I did the initial Scripting News collection on Daytona with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;current archive&lt;/a&gt;, started in May 2017. It's in OPML, so it was ready to be imported into the database as-is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have now converted the previous months, August 2016 through May 2017, from a JSON-based format to OPML, and published the result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017&quot;&gt;in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, and also imported this archive into Daytona. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Along the way I found another eight months of blogging that's in the same format. I plan to convert those as well, and flow the result into Daytona.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to march back in time, looking for OPML versions of the blog, or OPMLizable data. The goal is to see how much of the 27 years of Scripting News I can get into Daytona. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017/chatlogToOpml&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that converts chatLog.json text to OPML.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbsrjRrDOw&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt; of the tool I used to edit my blog in this period. The software is 1999.io.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Following my tweets in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You can now follow my tweets in outline form in Drummer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click this &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://tweets.opml.org/davewiner/tweets.opml&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. It'll open a tab in Drummer with a live outline of my tweets. When I write a thread, it will be nested in the outline. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing more to do and it doesn't cost anything. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to broadcast your tweets like I do, no problem, just go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweets.opml.org/&quot;&gt;tweets.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions are right there. Basically all you have to do is log in, the server will do the rest. No cost, my treat. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if your outliner supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, you don't even have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. The same way you didn't have to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=radio%20userland&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; to get the benefit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. It's exactly analogous, and it worked, so  if you have your doubts remember that bootstraps work.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to create an ecosystem around outliners and OPML. Twitter is sort of a go-anywhere outliner. That's why integrating Twitter and outliners is so good. I can jot a note down on my phone and it'll be in my outliner when I get back to my desktop. I think this is an important combination. It is for me, as a writer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt; .
