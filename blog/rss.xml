			<description>We should just discount the president's approval rating down to zero and then we could view 39% as a historic high. But seriously folks, the president's approval rating is just how the news, as it's reported, bounces off the minds of the people the pollsters talk to. You could model it like they model weather reports, and tune up the news coverage to create any approval rating you want.</description>

			<description>BTW, my plan is to hook &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; up to any protocol people come up with. And when I say RSS, I mean all flavors including RDF and Atom. I don't just have advice for other people, sometimes I give myself advice too. I think it's time to love RSS again. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I also think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings&quot;&gt;Ken Jennings&lt;/a&gt; is the obvious best choice to be the Jeopardy host because he's such a great Jeopardy player, is immersed in all aspects of the game and he really connects with the players, and therefore the fans at home. They are all such wonderful unabashed nerds. I've been watching the show since I was a kid, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Fleming&quot;&gt;Art Fleming&lt;/a&gt; was the host, when I watched it with my mom.</description>

			<description>We're curing ourselves from Covid the way people who smoke while they quit smoking aren't actually quitting. To quit, you stop. If you take your masks off, that's like buying a pack of cigarettes, and having one or two and then finishing the pack and then getting another. I speak as an ex-smoker for over 30 years. I had all kinds of plans for quitting, but the only way to do it is to quit. We'll never get out of the Covid hole until &lt;i&gt;all of us&lt;/i&gt; commit to it and then follow through. Otherwise it's going to continue to be a lingering tragedy.</description>

My face feels naked without it. The other day I went into the supermarket without a mask and had to go back out to the car to get one. In that moment I got to think about why I wear a mask even when others aren't. It's because I want to send a message to my fellow shoppers that I care about their health. I was raised to be a considerate person. So many people were raised to be self-centered and pissy. I never want to see myself that way. Anyway it was really annoying how quickly the airlines took down their mask requirements. I suggest if you want to make your feelings known to them, stop flying until they bring the mandates back.</description>

			<title>Site licenses</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1986, my little software company was in a weird place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had a great product almost ready to ship for the Mac. Everyone was psyched, MacUser and MacWorld, the people inside Apple, the people we leaked it to in the industry. But we were broke, couldn't make payroll. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My board was tired of the roller coaster, they told me to shut the company down. I told them they were crazy, we're sitting on the best product anyone has ever made, and the market is totally ready for it. The Mac was finally selling in huge numbers, after they fixed all the problems, and most other software devs were shutting down their mac development in the year before, we were going to have the booming mac software market virtually to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No deal. The board wouldn't put up the $400K we needed to get to shipping the product. So I went to my best friend at Apple, and told him what was going on. We were going to have to shut down before shipping the product you want so badly. I begged for their help. Man did they help us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First they gave us the money we needed to stay open as a loan. We had to put the source code to the product in escrow. We also did a second deal. They bought a site license for the product, everyone at Apple would get a copy, and in return they'd give us 40 new Mac systems with lots of memory, printers, networking. And they gave us 10 more Macs to give to our board members, which was also really smart. None of them had Macs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason I told this story is the power of the site license. I would have paid them all to use the product, because once the hardware company is standardizing on your product, you'll never go out of business as long as they're in business. And the inverse was true too. If we all had Macs maybe we'd stop thinking about making software for PCs. Back then Apple had guts and smarts. Quite a combo. Probably because they too had gone through tough times and were emerging from them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the best year of my life in the software world, and I've had some good years. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tell someone they did something good, or they look nice, or they're a great friend. Or give them something nice to eat. I just realized it's so rare that we do this. Everyone's looking for a nice word of praise or reassurance. We treat our pets better than our human friends.</description>

			<title>A more concise brain dump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Key point -- Twitter has been going nowhere for its whole life, just drifting, aimlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The companies Musk leads do not drift.

			<title>Let a thousand Twitters bloom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A rambling brain dump about Twitter and Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Self-moderation is going to be a huge deal. Maybe something like self-driving Teslas. Which the driver controls, btw. It isn't a passive thing. If a Musk company can do that, yeah I think they can give users more control over the bullshit they have to deal with on Twitter. The thing is Twitter has been stuck since 2006 when it started. They hired people to make the system run reliably, which is fantastic, hat's off, but it needs a few more things to be able to realizae its potential as a world-scale notification system for all kinds of networked writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe to make something workable you have to start something new, not in a half assed way.. Or maybe a no-bullshit capitalist like Musk can make it come about from the chaos of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people have no idea how software works and is made. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Twitter-like webservice at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;. With better docs and a JavaScript API that doesn't require developer to run a server (big deal). Effortless install on Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let a thousand Twitters bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interop baked in from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look, Elon made buying a car a completely online experience, moving around huge amounts of money and metal and an explosion in demand. Buying a Tesla was like buying a Mac in 1984 or an iPhone in 2007, except they're doing it 365 days a year for years. And buying a StarLink is just as easy and just as much of a sensation. If this is easy to do why do so few companies do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if Musk was trying to buy my bank, I'd be all for it. That's how bad their software is. All banks have shit software, btw, near as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you think he can't run Twitter when he can run StarLink and Tesla, please. And why should Twitter be stuck in the mud like it has been since inception. It desperately needs some fixes, and at a minumum must be made easier to peer with. Developers can do all the work if they just add a few simple features that they probably already have implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was an Apple dev in 1997 when Jobs came back. Musk is like Jobs in that he won't be scared to make the big changes that are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're lucky a guy like Musk is hanging around and willing to take on this job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And as usual the journalists see a teeny little corner of the picture and are screaming about that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's definitely got the McCartney feel to it, another spin perhaps on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y&quot;&gt;Eleanor Rigby&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a good song to Peloton to, btw, imho.</description>

			<description>I love all the Beatles songs, but get the most, these days, out of John Lennon's songs. I learned that Lennon only partially completed his songs, leaving a lot of the work to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt;. Keep that in mind when you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt; (my favorite Beatles song) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8&quot;&gt;Strawberry Fields&lt;/a&gt;, as examples. The orchestral bits are pure Martin.</description>

			<description>I have the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; for a blog. I'm sure there's better search software out there, but no one else has the sheer quantity of blog-writing over so much time in a searchable index. There are bits missing here and there, and I'm determined to fill those bits in -- but the archive goes from October 7, 1994 at 11:27AM to the present day. A lot of stuff happened in that time, and some of it happened right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I hope someday it proves to be a useful resource to people studying this period, with the usual caveat, assuming the human species survives. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I hope someday it proves to be a useful resource to people studying this period, with the usual caveat, assuming the human species survives. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 15 Apr 2022 22:18:58 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/04/15.html#a221858"/>

			<description>Because the weather has been delightful here the last few days, I'm afraid I got no work done this week. I basically gave up today and spent time in the sun, reading, listening to music, went for a walk, did some shopping, took a long nap in the afternoon. I guess I was overdue for some downtime. It is a wonderful time of year, winter truly is over. We will still get some coldish weather, no doubt, but the glory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains&quot;&gt;Catskills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon. It's the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; place to be in the summer.</description>

			<description>If Twitter had peered with other Twitter-like systems then they never would have had to develop and pay for content moderation. It's *possible* this is factored into Musk's plan. File this under &quot;silos are expensive to run.&quot;</description>

And while my Knicks are not in contention this year, it does have the feel of an unusually good year. One reason it's so cool, no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/2022/04/06/lakers-eliminated-from-playoff-contention-suns-loss&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;! Hopefully at some point he'll stop trying to form superteams and finish his career with humility and grace, away from contention. I am rooting for teams with stars who have never won a championship, notably the Phoenix Suns and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also glad to see the Warriors are back in the mix with the same big three and no Kevin Durant, who I will be rooting &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; every time he takes the court. I hope Boston blows the Nets out so that embarassment for the great city of New York is over for another year. Maybe they want him back in Oklahoma? I'm interested to see if James Harden can get it together to have a good long run, and while he has never won a championship, hmmm, I don't know. He played on the Nets this year, and for that reason I question his motivations. I do not like artificially created superteams designed to win championships. And of course they rarely do. So hopefully that chapter of the NBA will be over. One thing for sure &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/09/1363.html&quot;&gt;sports is not arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;, esp not basketball.</description>
