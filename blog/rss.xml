			<description>I'd love to hear a real explanation of why they won't release the patents for the vaccines. In plain English. No hemming or hawing.</description>

			<description>Later -- I learned that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/biontech-partners-with-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-scoring-55m-equity-investment-novartis-sells-china-unit/&quot;&gt;Gates Foundation has equity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://biontech.de/covid-19&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; that makes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html&quot;&gt;Pfizer vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. So when he talks about not needing to share the patent with countries where the virus is running wild, like India, that's not really the new Bill Gates, philanthropist giving away all his money for the good of humanity speaking, rather it's the new Bill Gates, seeking world domination as always, posing as a philanthropist who's giving away all his money. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Belch water</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Greps wasser&quot; is the Yiddish word for seltzer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It translates literally to &quot;belch water.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stooges&quot;&gt;The Three Stooges&lt;/a&gt; playing with &lt;i&gt;greps wasser.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mit gas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another story. First time I visited Switzerland in 2000, to go to the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, I was very impressed by many things, including the two types of bottled water that were available called 1. Still and 2. Mit gas. It still makes me laugh. You know in English &quot;mit gas&quot; is something you say when you're farting a lot. I am mit gas, I might have said to my German grandmother, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/stories/storyReader$124&quot;&gt;Lucy Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;. She thought I was a nice boy except when I said things like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Three of my grandparents, Rudy Kiesler (her husband), Baruch and Sima Winer, were Jewish, but Lucy Kiesler was Lutheran from Hamburg in north Germany. Blonde hair and blue eyes. I think she was actually kind of anti-semitic, which is weird because she married a Jew. She might have done it to get back at her parents, the story went. Or she might have been confused. She died at 66, my first grandparent to go, when I was a grad student in Madison. I used to stay at her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5735367,-73.863431,3a,75y,49.15h,87.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sH90kfd-HjSqxwYfJBxsdGQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in Rockaway when my parents traveled. It was a nice place, just a few blocks from one of the &lt;a href=&quot;=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smG2Z5B0rVCc-oDpPMiCurQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DmG2Z5B0rVCc-oDpPMiCurQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D95.56618%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;best beaches&lt;/a&gt; anywhere. Really good waves. She was born over a hundred years ago (I could do the math, approximately, she was 66 in 1977, so I guess that says she was born in 1911? Her brother, my great uncle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, is a famous German novelist, in intellectual circles. When I tell people from Germany that I'm related to Arno Schmidt, they either look at me like I'm an idiot (Schmidt is a common name in Germany!) or the they are impressed. I inherited a lot from her, for better or worse. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The company kept a list of customers with &quot;funny&quot; names, for years. Assuming this is true, they deserve all the grief they get. I understand that non-founders do stuff like that, I've seen it, I've fought against it -- it's the job of the founder to take the side of the users. And make it clear that showing anything but love and admiration for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; customers, every damn one of them, is not only not optional, but will get you fired after not too many offenses. It's very hard to keep user-disrespect from taking over companies, so you always have to watch for it and be a complete fucking asshole about it. People who wade through all the confusion of the market and figure out that your product is the best are geniuses. They are your lifeblood. Also, I certainly would have been on their list. I have a &quot;funny&quot; last name. I know it. A product of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island&quot;&gt;Ellis Island&lt;/a&gt;. But I am not a customer of theirs.</description>

			<description>Would love to see in President Biden's speech tonight a cash bonus to residents of blue states who relocate to Wyoming, Idaho, Montana or one of the Dakotas. We could add 10 senate seats and a bunch of electoral votes. Enough to keep the filibuster or tell Manchin to STFU. Maybe you pay no federal taxes for 25 years? That would be cool. I even have a slogan. Do a mitzvah for 'Merica.</description>

			<description>BTW, I am mostly over the stomach bug. I went for an hour-long bike ride yesterday, and it felt wonderful. And look at all the writing I did today! Not wanting to return to development yet, the break has been worthwhile. I have been tending my todo list, and plotting out next steps. I left the software in a good place, it seems. I'm not worried about it at this time. More glad to have recovered my health.</description>

			<title>Oy the humanity</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have to keep my desktop Mac not-upgraded so I can keep running &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on it, so now I can't use it with my iPhone because I foolishly updated it to the latest version of iOS. I wish somehow I could get a Linux version of Frontier so I could dump the Mac. It's the wrong desktop OS for me, now. Has been for a while. And Frontier would be a great addition to Linux, imho. The source is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tedchoward/Frontier/releases&quot;&gt;Ted Howard's github&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mac to Dave: You fucked up! Loser!! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How different it would have been if Apple loved Frontier instead of steering people away from it. Their idea of programming back in the day was English. Program in natural language. Oy my god. What a tragic mess that was. Instead our approach was to factor until you can factor no more. Make it as simple as possible, but no simpler. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a machine that was not only the best end user machine but also the best developer and power user machine. Remove the barriers from users becoming more powerful. End the priesthood. And make it easy to create personalized suites of apps. For a while the Mac was all that. The best machine for everyone. Then at some point Apple gave up on the Mac and decided to start over with iOS. Leaving the Mac in cash cow mode. And Mac users without a home (imho, ymmv).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Blink's dishonest upsell</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/19.html#a142814&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C5DECBBE-4F56-4C36-B933-E62144578691?maas=maas_adg_api_5916655800301_macro_1_1&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;aa_campaignid=9998093451&amp;aa_adgroupid=103704934271&amp;aa_creativeid=ad-460884485470_kwd-13303316_dev-c_ext-&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwj6SEBhAOEiwAvFRuKGxwQjLXmrvLUgRWqgvHy6yXchcbpRUrAF1D02f-9t_MUSwlgfq3jxoChJwQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/22/16810516/amazon-blink-acquisition-smart-camera-doorbell-company&quot;&gt;subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; of Amazon, that was trying to sell me a cloud service that up till then I had been receiving for free.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First the background...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have two battery powered Blink cameras outside my house. When someone arrives, or an animal crosses its view, or the wind blows a tree branch in front of the camera, it takes a short video, which is sent to an Amazon server, which then sends me a notification. If I click the link, the video opens in their mobile app. I could then look at the image to see who or what had woken the camera. It's nice to be able to monitor the comings and goings at my house even when I'm not there. I can tell when packages are delivered, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But now there was a new deal. They wanted me to pay $3 a month per camera, not saying what I would be able to do with the cameras if I let the service lapse, implying that my cameras would be kind of useless if I didn't pay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided to let the service lapse to see what would happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the free service cut off. I was down in Kingston while people were working at the house. I wanted to see if they had arrived so I fired up Blink, and saw that something had triggered the camera at 9:08AM, but I couldn't view the video. I was told this was because I was cheap and didn't pay them the lousy money (paraphrasing).  I could if I wanted get a realtime look through the camera, and I could also talk to whoever was there (thus freaking them out I imagine). So there's the limit I thought. But then I remembered that there's a USB slot on the Sync Module (SM), which is a customized router that connects the cameras to the net. I had ordered a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001XURP8Q?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&quot;&gt;32GB thumb drive&lt;/a&gt; for the SM, from Amazon of course, for $15, one time, for all cameras, no monthly fee. I could've gotten a cheaper one, but I decided to splurge and get &quot;Amazon's Choice.&quot; Now was the time to figure out how to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.blinkforhome.com/sync-module-2/sync-module-2-local-storage-operation&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; are on the web, and are a bit confusing. They don't say how the drive should be formatted, so I took a guess that MS-DOS format would be the most likely to work. They also said it would automatically format the disk if it wasn't readable, and that it would confirm it with me, but there's no monitor or keyboard on the SM, so how the hell would it confirm it? I later figured out that this happens in the mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It works, &lt;i&gt;exactly as the cloud service works, &lt;/i&gt;with $0 monthly fee, and I can add more cameras without incurring a $3 a month fee. All of which says that their marketing of the cloud service is dishonest. Maybe accessing the images would be a little faster coming from the cloud instead of their server having to read them from my thumb drive and then send them to my mobile device. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upselling&quot;&gt;upsell&lt;/a&gt; continues in the Blink app, because they say that it's so slow because it's loading it off my local drive. I use the extra time (if it in fact takes longer, I couldn't tell) to curse them out for being such money-grubbers. I might've paid for the convenience of the cloud service if they had just been honest about the choices I had. And maybe if there were features like having my videos mirrored to one of my S3 buckets! Now that would be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is worth pointing out because they are, as I said earlier, an Amazon company, and Amazon is pretty good at is being clear about your choices. Sure they steer you to the most profitable choice for them, I expect that, but to omit vital information and make false claims about what they're doing for you? They should fix that. The advantages are not very clear, so maybe they should just add 32GB of memory to the SM itself and be done with the cloud service altogether. Memory is pretty cheap these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, a nice feature, they cache the videos on the phone, so once downloaded you can view the video as many times as you like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; for finding out what the thumb drive on the SM does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Sync Module with the USB drive attached. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Make the invisible hand visible</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of online users trying to get people fired, for me, goes back to the early 90s when UserLand was starting up. I was very active on &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Applelink%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Applelink&lt;/a&gt;, which was kind of an early version of Facebook. Everyone who was anyone, even if they weren't an Apple user or developer, was there. Online systems were still a new thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One day we got a call at the office, back then companies, even mostly virtual ones, still had offices, demanding that they fire Dave Winer. The person who answered the phone tried to explain that Dave is the founder and majority owner of the company, and no one here can fire him, but the caller persisted. Even then I had too many opinions for some. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; from Jason Fried, the founder of Basecamp, about changes at his company, I was impressed with how far this has gone. It's an incredible document. You can skip the preamble, head to the numbered parts where he describes the changes they're making. The infection of people feeling empowered to get people fired now has made it all the way &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; companies. Back then, no employee of my company would consider the possibility that I, the founder, could be controlled. But now, that's not true. Clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/26.html#a140858&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about how I don't trust the NYT on almost anything these days, because of what happened to Donald McNeil. But I think, from reading tea leaves, that I can see that something like what happened at Basecamp, has happened there. A committee of employees has formed, and they will decide who can stay at the company. A lot of it will have to do with age, gender and race. Someone who is young, a person of color, and not male will be able to express stronger ideas than one who doesn't check those boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did anyone consider what this does to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; of a news organization? And, what it does to the integrity of a software development company? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our companies, organizations of all kinds, have jobs to do, and fighting for your cause, unless that's what the organization was formed to do, is not what they're about. You may think a company can take on every cause you believe in, knowing that tomorrow they will be different causes. You should start a company to test your belief. A company like Basecamp was formed (I'm guessing) to serve Basecamp users, to make them happier with Basecamp than competitive products, to generate a profit so it can grow, and to make the shareholders rich for being smart enough to bet on the company. And that's pretty much it. Maybe they had other goals, but it seems from the letter they're letting go of those now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know this has been said by many startup founders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/work/1915278/five-percent-of-coinbase-staff-rejected-its-apolitical-future/&quot;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; went through something like this. You can shake your head all you want, but in the end your only recourse, as an employee, is to accept what the leadership of your company wants, or leave and find something better elsewhere, if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's especially troubling in a time when there are so many looming crises, that journalism is being subjected to this opaque idiocracy. If this is really how the Times is going to operate going forward, they have an obligation to explain it, until the readers understand that the words of the Times are being controlled by an invisible hand. We need the NYT to have courage, to not flinch at the possibility that something they cover might offend their employees. And the best outcome imho is if the management of the Times fires the would-be controllers and lets them start the publication of their dreams which I predict approximately no one will subscribe to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's an incredible document. You can skip the preamble, head to the numbered parts where he describes the changes they're making. The infection of people feeling empowered to get people fired now has made it all the way &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; companies.

But I think, from reading tea leaves, that I can see that something like what happened at Basecamp, has happened there. A committee of employees has formed, and they will decide who can stay at the company. A lot of it will have to do with age, gender and race. Someone who is young, a person of color, and not male will be able to express stronger ideas than one who doesn't check those boxes." created="Tue, 27 Apr 2021 16:01:49 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/27/161858.html?title=makeTheInvisibleHandVisible#a160149"/>

You may think a company can take on every cause you believe in, knowing that tomorrow they will be different causes. You should start a company to test your belief. A company like Basecamp was formed (I'm guessing) to serve Basecamp users, to make them happier with Basecamp than competitive products, to generate a profit so it can grow, and to make the shareholders rich for being smart enough to bet on the company. And that's pretty much it.

We need the NYT to have courage, to not flinch at the possibility that something they cover might offend their employees.

			<description>I've been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots:_The_Saga_of_an_American_Family&quot;&gt;Roots&lt;/a&gt; while I've been waiting for this stomach thing to pass. Maybe not the best choice for reading material when you're feeling sick, but it's a gripping story, very well told. It's long. And the slaves the stories are about didn't have the luxury of switching to a different entertainment medium. Now I find as I poke around on the net and read what people say about prejudice and racism, I think no -- that's doesn't begin to cover it. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/550179-almost-half-of-republicans-say-chauvin-jury-reached-wrong-verdict-poll&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; that 46% of Republicans polled feel the verdict in the Chauvin trial was wrong. The only universe that it was the wrong verdict was when black people, like George Floyd were slaves, and the only crime Chauvin would be guilty of was destroying another person's property. I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1386499946795393030&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;We were taught in school that slavery was over in the US but for millions of Americans it wasnâ€™t and isnâ€™t.&quot; So far no one has objected to that interpretation.</description>

Neither site is overly cluttered with nonsense, and neither has a paywall. You can find out what the story is a few seconds and not use up any of your free allocation on other sites that do a good job but have paywalls. Thought I should get an endorsement in for this practice. They coud become the most-linked-to news sites.</description>

			<description>I'm having a lot of trouble understanding who the NY Times is, where they're coming from, and how I'm meant to understand what they're saying. Pretty sure they'd say, don't worry about these things, the Times just prints the truth, the whole truth, all sides well-represented. I don't think so. When I was a kid I believed that, I still knew they could make mistakes, but I thought they tried to get the actual story, that they weren't manipulating readers to believe things they wanted them to believe. The firing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Donald McNeil%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; was a big deal for me. They never adequately explained why he couldn't continue as a senior reporter covering the story he had prepared for for decades. I don't believe the facts they presented. They were not adequate grounds for firing. Had something similar happened to a reporter of a different gender, race or age, nothing like that would have happened. Having exposed themselves so thoroughly, they have opened up a huge integrity issue. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; is the difference between what you are and what you appear to be. There's a deeper story there, and they've buried it.</description>

			<description>Another subject the NYT has no credibility on is Facebook. These days I don't even bother reading their coverage. Often the facts behind their criticism could be interpreted in Facebook's favor, but the Times never does that. They criticize Facebook for making a bad choice where all there are are bad choices. Could their own work stand up to that kind of scrutiny? I'd love to see them take a chance, but they don't. For every article that talks about all the terrible things that happen on Facebook, they have never, that I have seen, reported on how Facebook is useful, even indispensible. I assume this is because this idea is abhorrent to them. If they acknowledge that people, on their own, can provide service to each other, with no salaried reporter acting as a go-between, what does this say about their future? Well, a real news organization would put that aside, and go where the story is. A news organization that has more of a sense of service than the supposedly great NY Times.</description>

			<description>With that in mind, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/friday-23-april-2021&quot;&gt;bit&lt;/a&gt; the other day about how that reporter at Vox said something totally wrong about the origin of podcasting, I'm sure the reporter knew it was wrong, and his editors knew it was wrong, but they published it anyway. Naughton thought I must've been furious, but I'm not, I'm exhausted. It's the norm. I'm not a billionaire. I let my ideas float around in the world, I don't lock them up. My goal with podcasting was to create a new medium that everyone could use, and that has worked. Reporters don't need to score any points with me, so they give credit for my work to others. I wrote Naughton an email saying &quot;That's the way journalism works, I'm afraid. They report conventional wisdom, not facts. You're the rare exception.&quot;</description>

You're the rare exception.&quot;" created="Sat, 24 Apr 2021 20:00:07 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/10/10/maude.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/04/24.html#a200007"/>

			<description>You can't trust Apple to act in your interests, whether you're a developer or a user. After so many years, it's amazing to me that some people who have been around for a while still expect them to be benevolent. And btw, I'm sure I've written this exact post before.</description>

Not conducive for having ideas. So that's it for today. Maybe I'll have something for y'all tomorrow. Keep on truckin. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Now that cannabis is legal in New York State, where I live, I've been curious about how much prices vary around the country. I'm not aware of any comparison websites, but I've heard that Oregon is the least expensive, because they have an oversupply. I'm guessing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leafly.com/dispensaries/massachusetts/&quot;&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest state with retail sales, is still relatively high priced, because the business is so new. 1/8 ounce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theorywellness.org/ma/great-barrington-recreational-cannabis-dispensary/?dtche%5Bcategory%5D=flower&quot;&gt;goes&lt;/a&gt; for about $50. I imagine that some of the aggregator sites have a good idea of this. I also wonder what kinds of plans there are for stores in various parts of New York. I imagine that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village&quot;&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan will be a place where there are lots of stores. I expect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York&quot;&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest town to where I live, will also be a big spot. If you have any information, please leave a note in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/207&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I think in general, to rise to a position of fame and wealth in our society, you have to strive to never say anything. I was watching the beginning of an academic conference today, about social media, and recognize the way of speaking, having spent some time in academia myself. My mind drifted, because people weren't saying anything other than how great, amazing and wonderful people in their midst are, and wondered what would've happened at the NYT if the managing editor had told the people who wanted &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Donald McNeil%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; fired for using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anytimes.com+nigger&quot;&gt;somewhat forbidden word&lt;/a&gt; in a discussion about using that word that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; could resign, but they would not fire McNeil. Then I wondered why the people wanted McNeil fired in the first place. Maybe because this is the only way they get to have an opinion that isn't nothing. I recognize the pattern. As a man, I know that the only emotion that people are comfortable with from me is anger. Fear, fun, love, generally speaking happiness, all seem to make people uncomfortable, if you have a penis. I don't know why this is. But I reject it. We all should accept each other as we are, especially ourselves. It's this frustration with being nothing that made people want Trump, imho. We should learn to stop punishing people for being individuals. The other option is not good, as we found out.</description>

			<description>Back in 2015 the Mets were a blessed team, the way the Knicks are this year. You'd tune into a game in the 8th inning, the Mets down by 10, to see how they win. They had a few stars, pitchers and hitters who were all peaking at the same time, feeding off each others' energy, it seemed. Their run went all the way to the World Series, which they lost, unfortunately, but the charm was real. The Knicks are doing the same thing. As the fourth quarter starts to draw to a close in each game in the current run, you say that's it, no way the Knicks win this, but then Derek Rose finds Reggie Bullock, alone in a corner, he zips the ball to him and Bullock sinks a three, and we're off to overtime, which the Knicks dominate. This is sports that is charmed, not bought, like the Nets, Clippers or Lakers. Sure they have pedigree stars, they acquired a championship contender, but who cares about that. I love a team of nobodies who shine off each others' light and create an atmosphere of love, and they win because of it. People will soon forget the Nets, when the three stars go their way, to form some other super team in some other long-forgotten franchise. I think next year a few free agents will want to join up with the Knicks, but I hope the team resists. I want to see this team back again next year and the year after that. I want to watch Barrett and Quickley develop, and Rose be their mentors. I want Julius Randle to become the NBA star with a real heart, true to his squad. I feel about them as family, not acquisitions. All the years in the wilderness were worth it.</description>

			<description>The most common thing that stands between people working together is a dysfunctional kind of pride. People feel they are being put down if another person knows more about something than they do. There's an old management slogan that goes with this. &quot;A people hire A people, B people hire C people.&quot; The point is this -- to win, you have to &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to work with people who have developed skills, or even basic talent, that you don't have. That's how you form a team. If you have to do everything, you're going to have trouble making something useful.</description>

Anyway this inspired a longish &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grovesprof/status/1384871198933331968&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter this morning, All I can say is 1. Oy and 2.

Glad to finally have a credible historian on the record on this. Kafka and Vox you should run a retraction. What people don't get about podcasting, it was a product. Marketed as such. But not with a financial model attached to it. We wanted to create new media, without barriers to entry, so the people could participate. 20 years later and I have to say that actually worked. Reporters don't respect any tech accomplishment that didn't generate a few billionaires (they should, there might be more if they did), but I made a bunch of money in the early tech industry, and I didn't feel very motivated to make more. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; about what money can and can't do. Up to a point it's great, it buys your freedom, after that, there are limits to consumption, having good friends and fun is more important.

And &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/21/tedTurnerQuote.png&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;, that's important &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quoteswise.com/ted-turner-quotes-2.html#:~:text=I%20bet%20you're%20all,as%20good%20as%20average%20sex.&amp;text=Being%20a%20billionaire%20or%20being,t%20make%20that%20much%20difference.&quot;&gt;too&lt;/a&gt;.

I do think tech deserves some of the credit. In the past, without a witness with a phone, it would have been the cops' word against the people's.</description>

			<title>Predicting the Chauvin verdict</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At 4:15 PM Eastern.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That the verdict is coming in so quickly that imho means it's a guilty verdict. Here's why.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Given the strength of the evidence and the fact that there are four black people on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/us/derek-chauvin-trial-jurors/index.html&quot;&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt;, it couldn't be unanimous acquittal.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it was a divided jury, they couldn't be adjourning so quickly, the judge wouldn't let them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Therefore the only situation that makes sense, at this point, is a unanimous decision to convict.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the best investments I've made is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp&quot;&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;, the less famous of the two big ones, the other being the Dow Jones. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies&quot;&gt;collection of stocks&lt;/a&gt;, chosen by a company named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_Global&quot;&gt;S&amp;P Global&lt;/a&gt;. Simplifying just a little, they buy shares in those stocks and then in turn sell shares of the collection to everyone, people like you and me. The value of the fund is the totall of the value of all the stock it owns, and fluctuates as their prices change. Every day it goes up or down, like a stock. It means that even if one of these companies does badly, the collection doesn't crash. It's designed to reflect the value of the &quot;stock market.&quot; So why is the S&amp;P 500 such a good investment? This is what I think, everyone has an opinion about this. It's the way presidents are evaluated. If the stock market is doing well, then analysts say &quot;the economy&quot; is doing well, and the president's approval rating goes up. It doesn't make any sense, but that's how it works. So the president will work really hard to make sure that your bet on the S&amp;P 500 goes up and up and up, always, in good times and bad. Now, there are times when the S&amp;P 500 will go down, but usually it goes up. If you put some money there it will probably grow. Over time it will grow a lot. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.INX:INDEXSP&quot;&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; the value of the S&amp;P 500 here. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/19/sp500graph.png&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; of the S&amp;P 500 from 1981 to now. You can see it does go up, but there are times it goes down. You can buy shares in the S&amp;P 500 from any brokerage firm. The list is open source, so any reputable broker can sell you an S&amp;P 500 fund. They all, by definition, behave exactly the same, though commissions on transactions differ according to brokers. That's why I say I &quot;simplified&quot; just a little.</description>
