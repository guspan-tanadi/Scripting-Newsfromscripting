			<description>I got my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiwjvBSS_Wk&quot;&gt;Nintendo Sports&lt;/a&gt; and was pretty excited till I found out there's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ginx.tv/en/video-games/nintendo-switch-sports-golf&quot;&gt;no golf&lt;/a&gt;. Oy. That was my favorite. But bowling and tennis are pretty good. They say golf is coming.</description>

Journalism controls what we think about everything. The online world has become an echo chamber for what's talked about on cable news and podcasts.

I guess we depend on their integrity, their good intentions. But what evidence is there of the goodness of their intentions. I turn off the &quot;news&quot; the first time i hear them overstating a case, leaving out important facts that would contradict the conclusions they reach. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then there are gems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1519693680000520192&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I couldn't believe my ears when I heard Maddow say the other night, in passing: &quot;...assuming the Dems lose congress, as expected.&quot; That's like your doctor saying: &quot;Assuming you die of cancer in November, as expected,&quot; when you don't have cancer as far as the doctor knows. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We let these things go by without challenging them, and we start stating them as facts ourselves, and then no one bothers to vote because we already knew what was going to happen because according to people who know better, that's what always happens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>As rich as you can be</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/monicalo68/&quot;&gt;Monica Loredan&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian who is vacationing in Venice, stopped to enjoy a nice ice cream with her husband Paolo, and posted this picture to her account on Facebook. I asked if I could publish it on my blog, because it reminded me of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/28/174509.html?title=theRichestYouCanBe&quot;&gt;fantastic sushi&lt;/a&gt; I had in Sausalito many years ago, that helped me understand what real wealth is. You can't be richer than Monica is, in the moment, with this fantastic creation sitting before her, ready to bring her soul the pleasure of eating it. I felt wealthy myself because I had the experience too, as a memory of past pleasure. Now I am sharing the experience with you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Monica's dessert, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@45.4295366,12.3261928,3a,75y,329.67h,67.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syQ-6dwATnJNAG3mX-Nqyaw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656&quot;&gt;Gelateria Nico&lt;/a&gt;, in Venice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)&quot;&gt;McCartney album&lt;/a&gt; even though at the time the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Contemporary_reviews&quot;&gt;critics panned&lt;/a&gt; it. It's a really interesting album because they're all Beatles songs. He wrote them to do with the Beatles. But they had already broken up. At the time no one knew. So he bought a tape deck and recorded them all on his own. He has a beautiful voice. And they're not big productions, though they would've been if they had been done by the Beatles. This is like blogging or punk rock, but it's McC. What's not to like? It's Paul McCartney man. Get over yourself.</description>

			<title>What I like about Elon Musk</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk took over for Steve Jobs as the audacious tech lover who did wtf he wanted and told people he didn't like to fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Jobs actually said the words, not if sure Musk does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both made audacious products that capture the imagination. Very few people do that. And their products were also outrageously successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And even with all that success, they both were willing to put it all on the line, over and over, because they had an idea they wanted to see through. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Making software for Jobs is another matter.

			<title>I got what I want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If the NBA playoffs were Christmas, I already got the two presents I wanted, as a diehard Knicks fan.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Nets were swept and eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Trae Young was ineffective against Miami and the Hawks were eliminated too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to add, I don't have anything against the Nets, I would probably be interested in them if they stopped trying to form superteams and win at all costs &quot;this year.&quot; And if they advised Nets players not to openly dis the Knicks because if they're ever going to get fans for the Nets they're all also going to be Knicks fans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I feel about the Nets the way Lakers fans probably feel about the Clippers. Sort of meh. Why do they even bother, for example. But for years when the Knicks aren't in the postseason (which is most of them) why not root for the home team that's in contention?  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I say this as a lifelong Mets fan. Proving I'm not all that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I now get to relax and enjoy the rest of the playoffs, without any goals, just hoping for some good basketball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Why Trae Young? He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGLacgHgvTs&quot;&gt;wasn't nice&lt;/a&gt; to the Knicks last year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thought, making a federated twitter will be hard. No one knows how to do it. But I bet a lot of people know how to clone twitter. That's the way this will go. And we should make sure all these clones can peer with each other. I'm available to help with this.</description>

But this team has no idea what NY is, and our relationship with basketball, and our Knicks, who we love like family. It doesn't matter if KD thinks they're cool, and if you think that matters, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518880919762919424&quot;&gt;you can have&lt;/a&gt; the Nets. But last night's crowd at Barclay were mostly pulling for the Celtics, and that's a shame. It tells you how much the owners of and players for the Nets have to learn about the city that they are supposedly playing for. And btw, forget about a cross-town rivalry. You might want to see if the arena y'all were using in NJ is still available.</description>

And then you could ride a train from New York to San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering&quot;&gt;Peering&lt;/a&gt; means you can get from one system onto another.

			<title>A big patch of blue sky</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518701984265687045&quot;&gt;last night&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, when I unexpectedly felt pretty sad about what had happened. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter inherited the blogosphere, in a sense, and the chaos of the company hid the fact that it was owned, all that we put into it, we owned none of it. It could all be sold. Now it’s glaring.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Although Twitter was never a living thing, it feels like something died, in an instant, unexpected, shock, the end. When Jerry Garcia died, also suddenly, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“Like the big tree that fell last March, the death of a huge human being like Jerry Garcia frees up a huge amount of space. Once there was a tree, now there are seedlings. After the sadness, there will be huge creativity.“&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That’s my wish. With this passing, a big patch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22blue+sky%22&quot;&gt;blue sky&lt;/a&gt; opens. Let’s create something beautiful in that space.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The latest news from MuskLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of talk on Twitter today about what to do if Elon Musk ends up owning Twitter. Based on an article in the WSJ, it appears that might happen very soon, maybe even later today. The Twitter board is carefully studying the offer. Presumably after looking at their lack of success of getting Twitter to grow like other tech industry social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1518559177093926912&quot;&gt;Benedict Evans&lt;/a&gt; described Twitter as the  &quot;Craigslist of Web 2.0, coasting on network effects, building nothing much, and getting unbundled piece by piece.&quot; I think that's a good synopsis of the last decade or so in TwitterLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally there's a lot of discussion about where we'll go, which is good. We could have been talking about this long ago, and be more independent of Twitter now. But this is when people get creative. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1518574700611264513&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; suggests we all go back to Tumblr, presumably where she started blogging. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518575186383101952&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;Let's all go back to what we like, and meet up in the middle.&quot; Honestly I think that's what Musk must be thinking of. Unbundling Twitter. Turning it into an identity system and an aggregator of lots of sources of bite-size ideas from all kinds of people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1518559637553008644&quot;&gt;Evans suggests&lt;/a&gt;, as do many others. that the moderation problem on Twitter is insurmountable. I don't think it actually is. My Tesla car can drive it self, somewhat, with my assistance, guidance and supervision. Couldn't an algorithmic approach to moderation work just as well? If we're willing to trust our bodies to an algorithm, why not moderation? I think the problem is solvable. Musk's other companies solve bigger problems adequately. Amazon can deliver packages to millions of addresses in the US every day. I just don't think Twitter's are that much harder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Musk has shown himself to have a childish personality, I can't imagine people who are serious about doing hard jobs are willing to work for him, but apparently enough are to make SpaceX and Tesla very successful companies. A paradox I expect we'll learn a lot more about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said to Jeff Jarvis yesterday that we need a Plan B. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I suspect if Musk buys Twitter, we'll all get used to grumbling about him, and Twitter will continue to work more or less, and will gradually improve over time, as basic software development principles, which have evolved over many decades, will get Twitter growing and actually doing new things, which will be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I am a Twitter developer and shareholder. As a shareholder, I don't want to sell out. Just thought I should get all that on the record. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I own a Tesla Model 3 and a StarLink dish. I'm very happy with both products, so far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: In the early blogosphere I wrote about them watching them watch us watch them watch us, watch them watch us, watch them, etc. Same old same old. The more things change the more they stay the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPS: A lot of people are saying they will leave Twitter if Musk buys it. I've been through this before. Very few if any will leave. It's why I have this motto: &quot;Don't slam the door on the way out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPPS: Finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html&quot;&gt;at 3PM&lt;/a&gt;, the age of MuskTwitter has begun. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518666782608867329&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There weren't many people rooting for the Nets in the arena. There was a lot more enthusiasm for the Celtics, because they're an exciting team and they're going somewhere. Boston is close and NYC is so huge there are already a fair number of Celtics fans here. Today's Nets don't have a home court. They haven't sold the idea of the Nets to the NBA fans here. NYC is huge, even a team without much of a following should be able to fill the arena with enthusiasm. But Kevin Durant, the leader of the team, the reason the Nets are supposedly contenders, never approached the city as something he had to win over. They must've thought fans are simple. They loved me in Oklahoma and Oakland, of course they'll love me here. I don't think anyone in particular loved KD in Oakland, they do love Curry, Thompson and Green. KD was a carpetbagger in Oakland as he is in NYC. He came to the city with disrespect for NBA fans here. He could have said hey it's great to be in NY, love the energy of Knicks fans, I hope some of you will come out to see the Nets. That would've been appropriate. Instead he disses the Knicks, the Garden and by implication those of us who have suffered with the Knicks all these years. Yeah we know they suck, but we &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; them. They're family. You don't get to dis them. So this is the price. No one here cares if this year's Nets win. And some of us want them to lose. At this point it seems unless there's a miracle, the Nets are eliminated. If he's going to stick around KD should ask for a reboot with Knicks fans. Forget about a crosstown rivalry. For now the Knicks own the city, even if they suck. Ask for our support. You might get it next time you're in the playoffs. But you'll have to earn it by showing up in our city in the meantime.</description>

And &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Gentleman Jack&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gentleman-jack&quot;&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; I absolutely &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=gentleman%20jack&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;adored&lt;/a&gt;. I'm rewatching season one so I'll be ready when the new season starts on HBO on April 25. It's already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gentleman-jack/season-2&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; on BBC. And in just six days the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nintendoswitchsports.nintendo.com/en/&quot;&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/a&gt; arrives for the Switch, so you know what I'll be doing in May, June, July and so on.</description>

			<title>Ugh Musk</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was kind of in favor of Musk running Twitter, but this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/23/disturbingImage.png&quot;&gt;disturbing image&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/23/disturbingImage.png&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Body shaming sucks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Gates is smart, a powerful person. I don't see why he'd want to blow him off like this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't want Musk having power over me, even though I guess he does already.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm working my way through Paul McCartney's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)&quot;&gt;first solo album&lt;/a&gt;. It was as big an event in 1970 as Elon Musk tweeting that he wanted to acquire Twitter in 2022. The album amounted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Press_release_and_the_Beatles'_break-up&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that the Beatles were broken up. In fact, Lennon had already quit the group, but hadn't announced it publicly. But it's a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; album. I listened the hell out of it when I was a teen and in my 20s, but never really &lt;i&gt;listened&lt;/i&gt; to it if you know what I mean. Like try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCppWWmIGQ&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; out. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. So much to listen to. And he did the album, in secret, and on really low tech hardware with no mixing board. Just four tracks straight to tape. Much more lightly produced than Beatles songs, no grand George Martin productions, just McCartney and that's worth something.</description>

It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondlife.com/&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;. And Second Life was boring.

That's where the &lt;i&gt;virtual&lt;/i&gt; in virtual reality is fun, when you get to be Elon Musk and own your own Twitter for example. Isn't that the dream we all had as kids, that we'd grow up and then we'd show them. I used to have images of my father, locked in a tiny bathroom, with a bowl of spaghetti poured on his head. I would say to him &quot;You're staying in there until you learn some manners, young man!&quot; It was a nice dream then, truthfully it still is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'd love to see some publication do a comparison of legal cannabis in various different states. How does the quality compare, prices? What states have public places like bars and coffee shops where it's legal to hang out and consume as in Amsterdam (where it's not legal, I know, but tolerated). New Jersey just opened yesterday, and I was interested in seeing how prices compare to those in Massachusetts. Too early to draw any conclusions. But I can tell you that it's way more expensive than in Washington or Oregon.</description>

			<title>I'm rooting against Durant</title>

Who exactly do you think comes to games in the Garden? We sure as hell aren't Nets fans. And that's what's going to greet them tomorrow night. An arena full of Knicks and Celtics fans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If he wants the support of NY basketball fans, he should say so, and maybe even apologize for dis'ing us when he came to town. Until then, this lifelong Knicks fan is going to be rooting for the Celtics, and yes I know that's weird. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We should just discount the president's approval rating down to zero and then we could view 39% as a historic high. But seriously folks, the president's approval rating is just how the news, as it's reported, bounces off the minds of the people the pollsters talk to. You could model it like they model weather reports, and tune up the news coverage to create any approval rating you want.</description>
