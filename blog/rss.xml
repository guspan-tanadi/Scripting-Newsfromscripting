			<description>There will be features in some products that will no longer work, ones that depend on a connection to Twitter, like tweeting a post in Drummer by clicking on an icon. Some whole products, like thread.center won't work at all.</description>

			<description>At this point, I don't plan to convert any of the software to their new API, or to pay for the connection to Twitter. So the features that are broken likely will stay that way.</description>

			<description>To be clear: I haven't decided to cut the connection from Twitter to my products -- Twitter did that. I haven't broken one thing in any of them related to Twitter support. The only changes I made were to make Drummer and FeedLand work if Twitter ever cut them off, which has now happened.</description>

This is the first one that I care about. Gets me thinking about how I might resurrect this app. I wrote it shortly after I became a fan of Facebook. I wanted to create a blogging system around their UI breakthoughs, and to improve on them.</description>

			<description>I had ChatGPT write some SQL code for me. I probably could have figured it out in a couple of hours, but instead it took me five minutes to specify the problem, and it took ChatGPT another five minutes to code it up and explain it to me.

			<description>I'm not getting very much work done these days. Still more work to do on &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. And after that I'm thinking the next project might be a Linux port for Frontier. I really want to leave a functioning &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; behind as part of my body of work. And the Mac isn't a very reliable platform going forward. It's so funny -- the best product I ever did, really -- and it got all mired in the jealousy of Apple employees. Thinking about it.</description>

It's best to have your eyes open about this before it becomes a big issue, by then it will be too late.</description>

And to create more headaches for everyone, the huge instances will develop differentiating features that are not supported by the others, without offering any interop. Early Mastodon fans will be as powerless to fix this as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1093562299758067712&quot;&gt;we are&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to Spotify, Amazon, Google et al calling their audio programs podcasts, even though they don't provide the feeds that would give users choice. It's best to have your eyes open about this before it becomes a big issue, by then it will be too late." created="Wed, 12 Apr 2023 18:48:47 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/15/cannedTomatoes.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/04/12.html#a184847"/>

In contrast, NPR received no money directly from the US government, and a few million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is partially funded by the US government. In other words, if receiving money from the US government to subsidize your business is a sin, Musk is a far greater sinner than NPR.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1646138100035272704&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, imho, is right to withdraw from Twitter after they classified them incorrectly. The question is, why aren't other journalism companies withdrawing in sympathy? Should they cede to Musk the power to decide which sources of journalism are allowed to publish via Twitter?</description>

I'm aware that one of the reasons I like to binge-watch TV series is the simulated community of it. Social contact is a basic human need. But our society has moved online, and then there's Covid, and that's why simulated communities that satisfy our requirement for social contact are so popular and valuable. It's relaxing to check in with a group of fictional people every so often, to see them behaving with ordinary human dysfunction, so our subconscious can project itself into their drama. The death of the central figure in a simulated community is why I feel so unsettled today, I think. At first I couldn't place it. What happened? I have a fairly ordinary week planned.

After programming in JavaScript for almost a decade, I still don't accept the basic design choice they made to require that whether or not a function does I/O is visible in the syntax of the program. It's exactly the kind of thing that should be sucked down into the interpreter. It makes the code 10 times more expensive and fragile. And achieves absolutely no efficiency. Zero benefit. I don't know why other people don't see this, but I'm going to keep going until others join up and help. It's the same approach as we used in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, only in this case the scripts run at the command line, like bash scripts. And they run as Node.js apps, so they have access to all the packages Node apps have. I'm just starting to use it myself, just for little utility things. It works great.</description>

			<description>When all is said and done the value of Twitter is its role as the place of record for public communication. It maintained that even after banning the president of the United States. But that is the very thing that Musk is dismantling.</description>

A place you can go to find out what happened recently and get reports in plain language that you can understand. Without any of the usual filler copy or adware. And if they leave out the bit of info that everyone reading it would want (why do news orgs always do that) you can ask a follow-up question. So I started by converting the NYT Most Recent Headlines &lt;a href=&quot;http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnmarkdown?feedurl=http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, created a new bot on chatthing.ai, and fed it a copy of the feed.
