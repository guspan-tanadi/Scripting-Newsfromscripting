Can't wait for the election. Trump's plan to steal the election &lt;i&gt;will work.&lt;/i&gt; First, do not vote by mail. Do not vote by mail. Not sure what you should do if you live in a state like Utah, Washington or Oregon where vote-by-mail is all you can do. Second, Congress has to come back. We must protest in the streets. Esp in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KolbieReports/status/1294615470004469760&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;. They must feel our ire. Now, not in November. That will, for sure, be too late.</description>

			<description>A couple of things they changed in the iPhone UI, not sure how recently. To get the app switcher to come up, double-tap the home button. To take a screen shot, click the power button and the home button simultaneously. I will never remember these, but at least I will be able to find them on scripting.com. The problem with the way Apple changes this stuff, when you search for it, you find the old method. To get the new method you have to have as many followers as I do on Twitter. This is a bullshit way to run a platform, Apple.</description>

			<description>I had a little dinner party at my house in the country last night. People do this here. But not in the time of Covid. I haven't had a gathering at my house since last winter, but last night we chanced it. These are lovely people who I speak with them frequently online, but it was so much better to eat and imbibe in person, outside, under the stars. With the animals and bugs. Ideas flowed. We made new jokes, new memes. I promised to do things that I have since forgotten. What I will never forget is how much I enjoyed their company.</description>

			<description>One thing I think we agreed on last night is that people who support Trump do so because he tells them what they want to hear. The truth doesn't enter into it.</description>

			<title>BingeWorthy 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just flipped the switch, now the  new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy for TV&lt;/a&gt; has replaced the previous version. I think it's reliable enough to use going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you had an account on the original BingeWorthy, you should have one here as well. Most of what you did on the old BW has been ported to the new one, automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Notes on the new version. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your prefs start over. So you should visit Settings, in the system menu, the one you use to log in via Twitter, at the right edge of the menu bar.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also, any ratings added in the previous version after August 5 are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; preserved. That's when I ported the data.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is no concept of a private profile in this version. Your ratings are public. So people can walk a web of programs and people, as a way to look for new programs to binge, as well as finding people with similar tastes. Another form of serendipity. Finding out a close friend hates a program you think the best.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can share anything you can see, and most of it can be read without logging in. For example, here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my ratings&lt;/a&gt;. And here's the page for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-sopranos&quot;&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/a&gt;. You can do a lot of surfing from those two links, wtihout logging in. You must log in to do your own ratings, of course. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can add programs to the database without my approval. This is a huge deal, because it's what kept the first BW from growing. People would recommend programs I knew nothing about. Which meant I had to discuss each one, and that grew really tiresome. After a while I stopped looking at the suggestions, realizing it was a deal-stopper for the product. First you have to find a page for the show on Metacritic. Then paste the URL of the page into a dialog in BingeWorthy. Look in the menu for &lt;i&gt;Submit a program.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've learned a lot about programming SQL since doing the fit BingeWorthy, so I have been able to streamline the server, factoring, producing a new package, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/davesql&quot;&gt;davesql&lt;/a&gt;, which anyone can use, and it'll make other projects I have that use SQL easier to upgrade and maintain. The two major ones are River6 and feedBase. I plan to revisit each of those products after BingeWorthy settles down. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Docs for now are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/184&quot;&gt;GitHub thread&lt;/a&gt; we've used for support. Ask questions there, report bugs. Eventually I'll rewrite the official docs, and put that on this.how, and point to that instead. Consider this version beta, the product is almost done, but we're watching for problems, and expect to find them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The version number is 2.0.0. Like an odometer rolling over. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can't believe liberals are such cowards, idiots, so ignorant, such petty snobs -- they are eviscerating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader&quot;&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt; for having the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=temerity&quot;&gt;temerity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RalphNader/status/1294040427004399618&quot;&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; to read an &lt;a href=&quot;https://nader.org/2020/07/31/ralph-nader-letter-to-aoc/&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; he wrote to her, about causes she fights for. He has advice about organizing, something he knows about, has had enormous success with. I actually read his &lt;a href=&quot;https://nader.org/2020/07/31/ralph-nader-letter-to-aoc/&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, which is something I expect most of his critics didn't, because if they did, they would stop and think and maybe just maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=get+a+grip&quot;&gt;get a grip&lt;/a&gt;. For liberals, Nader should be considered a pioneer of the stature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. He successfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed&quot;&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; to reform the auto industry, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Laura__Antonini/status/1294307355232894978&quot;&gt;so much more&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>BTW, I also write publicly to petition people in power to help the causes I believe in. You should do it too. Stick your neck out. It's easy to be a critic, much harder to stand for something. You'll find the assholes try to shame you. Keep going.</description>

			<description>Underlying all the bitterness, the liberals are angry that Nader elected Bush. That's the crazy part of their argument. The people who elected Bush are 1. The people who voted for him and 2. The Supreme Court. Illustrated in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIE0cT54yU&quot;&gt;beautiful scene&lt;/a&gt; from The West Wing. Josh, to Amy who is working for a third-party candidate. &quot;He's taking the president's votes,&quot; says Josh. Amy responds: &quot;Listen, I'm not indifferent to this situation, but that right there, that's the crazy part of your argument. They're not his votes.&quot; She's right. Nader ran for president. Gore lost (technically he gave up). Get over it.</description>

			<description>Journalism has a simple question to answer. Are we just going to report on what Trump is doing or should we organize the opposition. They're coming for the election.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TedMielczarek/status/1293581030947946497&quot;&gt;A fair analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the reason Mozilla is adrift. Lots of extra agendas, often personal, no discipline, professional values, or much connection with users. The mean petty behavior has no place at a customer driven venture, which Mozilla never has been. Another takeaway is that the fire hose of money was wasted hiring more than a few employees to maintain Firefox. The rest of the windfall could have been invested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=s%26p+500+chart&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=S%26P+500+chart&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l8.4565j1j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;, held in reserve for the next Firefox, a product developed speculatively by entrepreneurial devs, &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; it achieves market acceptance. They would have billions in reserve by now. Could have changed the way we develop networks, with emphasis on user choice and no reliance on lock-in. But no one was ever empowered at Mozilla to do that, or no one had the vision or ability to lead.</description>

			<description>I'm in a funny place with the new BingeWorthy. Started testing it with people who had rated a lot of programs in the previous version, and am getting good feedback. I'm getting ideas other than bug fixes and tweaks, and today I implemented one of them, which leads me to believe I should just make the new version public and start rolling out the new stuff here on the blog in public view. If you want to see what the new feature is, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZKjlklkU6Q&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Have a look. And if you think you could contribute to the testing, send me a message on Twitter.</description>

			<description>I've got my new iPhone SE. Transferring data from my iPhone XS/Max, after many tries because the old phone has four times the memory of the new phone. I had to delete a lot of stuff. But now it seems to be chugging along. It's quite a bit smaller than the original phone. First thing I want to do is take some pictures to see how well the camera works. Update: I gave up on the over-the-air update, and used an iTunes backup I took last night. Most of the data appears to have been preserved. All my music and photos are gone (but backed up on my Mac).</description>

I had to delete a lot of stuff. But now it seems to be chugging along. It's quite a bit smaller than the original phone. First thing I want to do is take some pictures to see how well the camera works. Update: I gave up on the over-the-air update, and used an iTunes backup I took last night. Most of the data appears to have been preserved.

			<title>Twitter's latest change is good</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/200811/p25#a200811p25&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that I never thought to ask for, but should have. Now you can decide who can respond to your posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your choices of who can reply:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only people you follow.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only people you mention in the tweet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And since you can mention no one, you can make it so that no one can respond to a post. This is a good feature because people can still comment on your tweet by RTing it, but they can't speak to everyone who reads it unless you let them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the Twitter equivalent of what I say to people who want to comment on my blog posts. Start a blog, I advise, and say what you have to say and link to my post. Of course what they really wanted was to use my flow to (very often) zing me personally in some way. I consider that spam. Or hijacking. It gets so insidious so quickly that I haven't had comments here for any duration for many years. It starts off collegial, but quickly devolves into abuse as the trolls take over. And that's exactly what has happened on Twitter. Completely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People like to say Twitter is about conversation, but that isn't my experience. Very little illuminating conversation. Lots of stupid unfunny supposed jokes, and put-downs, and ads masquerading as opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a good change:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People should feel more courageous in saying what they really believe, rather than avoiding opportunities for people to attack them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't have to block or mute people who misuse the ability to respond. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People who say they can't comment are wrong, they can, they just have to create their own flow. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The author of the post they're commenting on always has the option to RT if it truly is constructive, which gives commenters the incentive to be civil. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Good move all around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Politics, when it's done right, is pretty boring.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The person you want running the show should fairly quietly make things better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You aren't going to have a beer with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You need to trust them enough to not blow up the world, and in our form of government to have the kind of personality that can compromise and work with others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want someone who's thoughtful and loves to understand how things and people work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mostly you want to feel things are being taken care of and get on with your own life. That imho is the most important freedom of all, freedom to focus, to be yourself, to have a life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Who will do journalism?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the people my age when we were in school never imagined computers would be used by normal people to communicate. They resisted the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what are most of us missing today? I think it has to do with who will be doing our daily journalism. Imho, we all will. Why? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A void is being left as professional journalists focus on fewer stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Weâ€™re learning how to do it with blogging and social media.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We need and want journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s like jury duty, itâ€™s uplifting, gives our life purpose and meaning. Itâ€™s its own reward.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's a wicked idea.  Let Trump put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/10/politics/donald-trump-mt-rushmore-kristi-noem/index.html&quot;&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt; on Mt Rushmore. Hopefully to be announced before the election, hopefully with great fanfare. That would get all the Democrats to turn out, and quite a few Republicans, now they can clearly see where Trump is going.</description>

			<description>It doesnâ€™t matter to me personally who Biden picks, that said, the best choice imho is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/michigan-gov-whitmer-met-biden-running-mate-announcement-nears-n1236213&quot;&gt;Gov Whitmer&lt;/a&gt; of Michigan. Mainly because I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer&quot;&gt;she'd&lt;/a&gt; be a good president. Sheâ€™s been tested in Michigan. I was impressed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/podcasts/the-daily/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-protests.html&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;, in April, at the height of the tensions in Michigan re their lockdown.</description>
