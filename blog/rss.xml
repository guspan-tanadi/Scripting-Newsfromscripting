			<title>The Beatles had a sad end</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt;, and I kind of hated the way it ended, but it is what it is, it's not like there were screen writers who chose the wrong ending. The rooftop concert was a Ouija board thing. Something Ringo could have an opinion about, so they had the concert. I thought it was awful, esp for the last live performance of the Beatles. It wasn't really a concert, it was cheap, they used London, acted like dicks, it made the whole Let It Be process suck. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At one point the idea of going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cavern_Club&quot;&gt;The Cavern&lt;/a&gt; was brought up, and I thought that would have been great. They clearly have very strong feelings for that period of the Beatles, even though it's something most of us never experienced (it was before the mania). Or they could have arranged to be surprise guests at a London club. I'm sure they were there, and any of them would be happy to host the Beatles. Then it would have been legal, the enthusiasm would have been there, and they could have fucked around and everyone would've loved it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe there was just no place for the Beatles to go in 1969. I've noted this about superstar basketball teams. Once they win a couple of championships, I felt, they should just disband the team, because there would be no joy in a third or fourth. It seems like everything they did in the album Let It Be was no more interesting than what they did in Magical Mystery Tour or the White Album or Sargent Pepper, Revolver, they were all huge leaps. Let It Be -- no -- it's great stuff, historic -- it all really matters, but none of it was necessary. Anything past that, well there was no vision for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned, over the whole three episodes, is how little the Beatles cared about business and how much of it they delegated. I had read the story of Billy Joel, and was amazed about how he kept money far away, and had gotten ripped off massively by someone he trusted. Lennon was in awe of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Klein&quot;&gt;Allen Klein&lt;/a&gt;, but he sounds like a schmuck. I think if the Beatles had a manager who loved them, and cared about them, they might have continued writing music together for many years, and gotten what they wanted out of independence. It doesn't seem like it had to be either/or, and what's also clear is how much love there was between them. It's a common pattern, something great happens, and the assholes move in and squeeze the life out of it. How strong the Beatles were that they got so far. Or how much their manager, who had just died, must've loved them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A good movie to watch after finishing Get Back is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Eight_Days_a_Week&quot;&gt;Ron Howard documentary&lt;/a&gt; about the touring Beatles. It's on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hulu.com/movie/the-beatles-eight-days-a-week-the-touring-years-d3b00689-e450-4fcb-9853-d37e78ed4c57?&quot;&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Idea: Open source patents</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a radical idea about patents many years ago, when they were starting to spoil the software world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea -- open source patents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Develop something new. Document it, have it evaluated by a panel of experts. If it's new you get a &quot;patent&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ersatz_good&quot;&gt;ersatz&lt;/a&gt; patent does a few things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It prevents Google or Apple from patenting it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It gives the inventor proper credit for their work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It makes the idea useful to other software devs because it isn't just some random feature ready to be patented by Microsoft or Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can find out if something you did really is unique or if someone did it 25 years earlier (this has happened to me, I thought I had invented outlining until I read Ted Nelson's book and leared about Doug Engelbart).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's good publicity, giving people an incentive to participate. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Unlike non-open patents, everyone is free to use the idea for free. However they can't claim that they invented it. It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; for patents. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I must not have been very good at explaining it, I thought it was something my friends at Harvard Law School would help with, but we're still stuck in this horrible situation where inventors of new ideas are forced to put up gates to simply get credit for their work. I'm never willing to do this myself, so I've seen many of my works being ignored or even undermined (notably podcasting by the f'ing EFF) or patented by IBM or Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I had a nice thought that maybe when you die you wake up as from a dream. And you resume your higher level reality. Life is like a procedure call. This was one of the ideas in the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception&quot;&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt;. When you die in a dream you wake up. I think that's how it worked.</description>

			<title>Tesla's missing app ecosystem</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1466594398230106113&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that the Tesla needs to run Apple Car Play. This was a short statement with a lot packed in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My Tesla is both a car and a computer system. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Almost all the controls for the car are on a big screen in the middle of the dashboard, between the driver and the passenger, slightly tilted toward the driver. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are other controls, a stick attached to right side of the steering wheel that shifts between Reverse, Neutral, Drive and Park. A stick on the left signals turns and I think adjusts the brights, but honestly I'm kind of confused about that. I think the car decides when you need lights and what intensity, and it's not possible to overrided it? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are two pedals on the floor, roughly analogous to the brake and gas pedals in a gasoline-powered car. When you press the gas pedal the car accelerates, but unlike previous cars when you let up on the gas pedal, the car slows much faster. You only need to use the brake pedal when you need to stop quickly, otherwise all your acceleration and decelration is done via the accelerator pedal.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are also controls on the outside of the car. Handles on each of the doors and the two trunks (front and rear). If you tap the charging port door, it opens. There probably are other outside controls that I'm not yet aware of.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is done through the UI of the big screen in the middle of the passenger compartment. It works as it would if it were created by Apple, Google, Amazon or Microsoft. There are tech industry norms, and people move around between the companies. This is a standard tech industry UI. But the design is radically different from every other car anyone has ever driven. And it works, but -- and this is important -- there is no &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;app ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. I can play music from my iPhone via Bluetooth, but I can't control the music via the car's screen, I have to use the screen on the iPhone. Since my Subaru has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CarPlay&quot;&gt;Car Play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Auto&quot;&gt;Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;, I've gotten used to controlling music, podcasts, and anything else -- directly on the car's screen, and this is imho a must-have feature that Tesla does not have. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For right now this doesn't seem to be an issue for most Tesla users. I'm happy to drive my new wonder machine knowing that it's missing its app ecosystem. Tesla (again imho) has to have one, either they start to develop it now, or they hook up with Apple and/or Google, and allow their apps to run in TeslaLand. In a few years I think it will be necessary, because esp luxury car makers are going to feel the pressure to do what Tesla does in terms of controls. I'm pretty sure Apple and Google will offer it to them. And I think both of them are capable of doing what Tesla does. And they both have app ecosystems. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Beatles were an invention</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Beatles, I realize now, have played a really important role in my life going back to when I was eight years old and in the hospital recovering from a ruptured appendix. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGbWU8S3vzs&quot;&gt;She Loves You&lt;/a&gt; was the big hit. I only had the vaguest idea of how they made such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Loves_You&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't think about it too much, but after watching Get Back (I'm now on the second installment) I see the magic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They invented The Beatles, it was a real thing, you can see it in the relationships and the end result. A song starts as an idea, and they hack at it, over and over, and gradually the song emerges. I kept wanted to say it's &quot;Tucson Arizona!&quot; but of course they didn't know that yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I recognize the dissatisfaction of people who don't share the bond that Lennon and McCartney did. Ringo accepted his role as an onlooker, George struggled against it. And all the hangers-on with opinions about this and that. They remind me of the VCs and execs in tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The magic was Paul working out a hit song on the bass, with Ringo and George looking on. Then John coming back and loving it, and adding his bit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The conversations reveal so much. If only we had understood all this less than 50 years after the fact. I think of all the young creative people who can watch this, and how it will help them understand, and how we got by, feeling our way around this the way the Beatles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote to a friend yesterday that this feels biblical. This is how it all began. I expect we'll be talking about this for years to come &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish we had the equivalent video for all kinds of other seminal events. I'd love to see a video of all that Trump did on January 6, for example, while the Capitol was under attack. Who was he calling on cell phones, threatening them in not so subtle ways while they were feeling so vulnerable?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listening to She Loves You reinforces the point made by Paul McCartney in a recent Fresh Air interview. He said when they were young, when the Beatles were starting out, mostly what they wanted was girlfriends. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At one point, in the struggle over George Harrison's departure, Lennon talks about how they'll feel about all of it when they're old. How profoundly sad that he didn't get to be old, and we didn't get to learn from an older John Lennon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the music Lennon and McCartney produced separately after the breakup there was (evidently) a lot of bitterness between them. But in this movie you feel the love they had between them. I wonder where the bitterness came from, or if it was just an illusion. Maybe we imagined it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/imagineBeingPaulMcCartneyAndMeetingJohnLennonAndViceVersa.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the invention of the Beatles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
