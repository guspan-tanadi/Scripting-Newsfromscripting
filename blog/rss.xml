			<description>The wires are the problem, and Jobs fully understood this. I talked about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/17.html#a211718&quot;&gt;yesterday's podcast&lt;/a&gt;. They had the Mac office, school, backpack, pocket, the living room should belong to Apple. Not with a dongly thing and &quot;content.&quot; It should be the Apple experience at room scale. I want a full scale Apple/Pixar experience in my home.</description>

			<description>Gotta wonder if Trump and Barr are planning on disrupting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1306963691028578305&quot;&gt;huge turnout&lt;/a&gt; for early voting in Virginia. Actually I don't wonder, I'm sure they will. These are all antifa's, some very fine people, but some very not fine people too. Send in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men_(Ukrainian_crisis)&quot;&gt;little green men&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I use Frontier to manage my source code, which no longer runs on the newest version of the Mac OS. I desperately want it to run on Linux so I can get out of this situation. In the meantime, I bought a new iPhone, and just updated it and got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/18/softwareUpdateDialog.png&quot;&gt;this awful dialog&lt;/a&gt; when I plugged it into my Mac. I clicked on Learn More hoping to find out which version of the OS it wants to install, but it &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208831&quot;&gt;doesn't say&lt;/a&gt;. I am running High Sierra, 10.13.8. I'm not going to update the Mac. I guess that means I'll be relying on the new Pixel 4a more and more, because I can't give up my ability to run Frontier on my desktop. Not a good situation, but as they say it is what it is.</description>

			<description>I'm on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/17/appleTvShouldBeATvDammit.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; roll these days. 17-minutes worth of rambling about how Apple should fix the TV problem, which btw is all those freaking wires. The tech has advanced so much, you could blow people away with elegance, ease of use, and power, and so what if it costs three times as much as the competition. We're accustomed to paying for the best. I should note that I have some $AAPL stock, purchased in 1997 and held since then so when Apple screws me in software at least I make up for it in my brokerage account. I'm so puzzled why I'm not using Clubhouse these days. And I'm totally maxed out on new services. OMG no more please. Also a story about hanging out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixonline.com/recording/don-pearson-1942-2006-377439&quot;&gt;Don Pearson&lt;/a&gt; who did the sound for the Dead.</description>

			<description>An idea for a business. Home entertainment system makeovers. I have so many friends with obsolete entertainment systems. They work fine. You get used to them. It was exciting when you got it 10 years ago and you still feel that. But. Things have gotten so much better and so much cheaper. Now, for very little money, relative to the amount of time you use it, you can have something much nicer. You could make people really happy and make a good living doing it, I think, at least for a little while until word gets out you just have to buy a new screen and then work out from there. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I use it mainly for timing my exercise, and to see what the temperature is outside and of course the time. I charge it every night, but it never gets less than 1/2 battery. I already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08925BSQJ?gclid=CjwKCAjwkoz7BRBPEiwAeKw3q5aZ6H8UhO9-Mvimosqj09gb1Ieg576mrwkZy5zwD6s0GzfEl1wdQRoCBssQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;pulse oximeter&lt;/a&gt;, and I take a reading once a day, and record it.</description>

			<description>I have a new iPhone SE, new Pixel 4a, and a new Subaru, which supports both kinds of phones. I love all three very much. I previously had a super high end iPhone, but I'm a middle class kind of guy, and the SE is much more my speed. And for the first time I've been able to use an Android phone for navigation and listening to podcasts and audio books. I took a drive to Albany on Tuesday, and was able to test it out. It all works, in an unsurprising manner, except Google Maps on the Android has one feature that the iPhone version desperately needs. The map re-orients so that the direction you're heading in is always up and to the right. On the iPhone it's kind of random. Hard to parse. And the layout is much better for a driver, who can't spend any time puzzling out what the computer trying to say. If you have a turn in 2 miles, there's a box that says Right Turn in 2 Miles. And it counts down as you get closer. Next time I'm driving I'll try to take a picture (obviously with the iPhone).</description>

			<title>Self-executing functions</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE&quot;&gt;self-executing functions&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript are obsolete with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp&quot;&gt;ES6&lt;/a&gt;. I never liked and rarely used them. I prefer to use features put there by the designers, rather than use a clever hack that makes you wonder why the feature wasn't put there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now in ., you can create a simple block and declare your variables with &lt;i&gt;let. &lt;/i&gt;No clever hacks needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some real-world example code.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;{ //insert headline for 1st level subs&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;let htmltext = &quot;&quot;;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;let ixButtonsArray = ix + 1; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;let theButton = theButtons [ixButtonsArray];&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function div (classname, val) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;return (&quot;&amp;lt;div class=\&quot;&quot; + classname + &quot;\&quot;&gt;&quot; + val + &quot;&amp;lt;/div&gt;&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function add (s) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;htmltext += s;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;add (div (&quot;divButtonEmoji&quot;, theButton.htmlEmojiCode));&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;add (div (&quot;divButtonTitle&quot;, theButton.theTitle));&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;add (div (&quot;divButtonVal&quot;, ix));&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;opInsertRawHtml (htmltext, right);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The block, like a bundle in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/manual/userTalk&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, allows you to collapse some code, hide its variables from the containing code, without declaring a new routine.

			<description>It's possible the easiest and quickest way to undo the Electoral College is for a bunch of people from blue states to relocate to low population red states. Elect Democratic legislatures and governors, and then ratify a constitutional amendment that eliminates the Electoral College. Then everyone can move where ever they like, since all votes will matter the same. Now with remote work being more acceptable, and the cost of living generally lower in the low population states, why not relocate? It's a relatively simple hack, and the red state people can't do it to blue states. Heh.</description>

It has a big W on the front, and on the back it says &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Badger&quot;&gt;Badgers&lt;/a&gt;. I was getting some dirty looks, and at one place a woman commented that I shouldn't wear that hat because people might not understand.</description>

			<description>Trump always talks about how other countries don't pay us for the things we do for them, but they do, they really do. Hugely. The US has the world's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency&quot;&gt;reserve currency&lt;/a&gt;. We're the only country that can print money that can be spent anywhere. People all around the world use our currency to store value. Even with all the lunacy, our dollar is still the safest place to store value. It means we can always have more money. We don't even have to actually print it, they're just numbers in a spreadsheet somewhere. Trump, of course is doing everything he can to make everyone else &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; trust us.  So if the trance breaks, and the dollar is no longer seen as the most trustworthy country, we would end up being one of the &quot;other&quot; countries, and we'll have to pay &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#Chinese_yuan&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to store our money, along with all the other schmucks. And they'll have the power we still have. It's one of those things that if you don't know about it, and most people don't, you can't understand how global economics works. And when they say &quot;The American taxpayer paid for this,&quot; well it's not technically true.</description>

			<description>I'm working my way slowly through &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/08.html#a133321&quot;&gt;Borgen&lt;/a&gt; season 1. It's very good, and immersive. The format is basically &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; in Denmark. The prime minister is a woman with a family. Every episode, as in TWW, they tackle a big issue. It's in Europe, and it's a small country, not the mighty USA. It's very well done. It's slow going because they wrote it so that you need to read things in the show and read the sub-titles (the characters get information from reading headlines in newspapers that go by too quickly to read them).  Sometimes they drop into English because the characters would speak English then. It's on Netflix now. There are already three seasons and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-04-29/borgen-season-4-netflix/&quot;&gt;fourth&lt;/a&gt; is on the way. A side-note, the chief of staff of the PM is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilou_Asb%C3%A6k&quot;&gt;Pilou AsbÃ¦k&lt;/a&gt;, who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters#Euron_Greyjoy&quot;&gt;Euron Greyjoy&lt;/a&gt; in Game of Thrones.</description>

			<description>We are learning more about Trump even if it's coming at glacial speed from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt;. Also his comment yesterday about climate change was revealing. The snotty look on his face when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/14/politics/donald-trump-wildfires-briefing-climate-change/index.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; science is bullshit. You can tell he's never had to deal with a health emergency, or he wasn't paying attention when it happened. If he doesn't die of an instant heart attack or stroke, he's going to learn to respect science, at some point.</description>

			<description>The fundamental rule of discourse on the net is that you should treat each person as you would treat an actual human being, face to face. Too often people &quot;speech&quot; at you, that is give a speech, addressed to you. Giving speeches is cool, that's what Twitter is for, but then address your speech to everyone, not to an individual.</description>

			<description>When species go extinct, other species they keep in check will grow, possibly explode. If it were bats, for example, that might mean more Covid-19 type viruses. Human-killing viruses come from bats because they have more powerful immune systems. It's all balanced.</description>

			<description>On the west coast, every town has a few hot tub rental places. You pay a fee, about $10 or $20 an hour, and you get a private room with a hot tub. Soak for an hour. Come out a new person. Here's the list for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=hot+tub+rental&amp;find_loc=Berkeley%2C+CA&quot;&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. In Palo Alto there's the grand &lt;a href=&quot;https://watercourseway.com/tub-rooms/&quot;&gt;Watercourse Way&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want the best, go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esalen.org/page/esalen-hot-springs&quot;&gt;Esalen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://harbin.org/&quot;&gt;Harbin&lt;/a&gt;. Of course you might want to wait until the fires are over. Nothing like this exists in the east. In all of New York City, the closest you could get was a communal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/nyregion/after-124-years-the-russian-and-turkish-baths-are-still-a-hot-spot.html&quot;&gt;Russian bath&lt;/a&gt;, that's like 100 years old. And no it's not the same thing. Once they legalize cannabis in NYC, they're going to need to open up some hot tub places for people to mellow out in.</description>

			<description>Speaking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, in Madison. He's been working on a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; for Node to go with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;XML-RPC for JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; package I wrote. We talked about lots of stuff, esp philosophy of maintaining networks of software. We both agree &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation&quot;&gt;deprecation&lt;/a&gt; is a bad idea. I didnâ€™t know that there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=2020+riots+in+Madison%2C+WI&quot;&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; in Madison. We talked about Kenosha in that context. We need better news folks, too much repetition and they're leaving out important information. Riots in Madison? That is for sure news for this lifetime &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_Badger&quot;&gt;Badger&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>A NYT reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1305244745917063169&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about early/mid 00's bloggers. There was a lot of response. I thought this was weird, a throwback to the thirst for recognition in the early blogosphere. The names offered were some of the famous ones, and I felt the same frustration I felt back in the day when the style sections of pubs like the NYT &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; those bloggers famous, and ignored the ones who weren't as young, but had deep experience in something other than blogging. The story always was here come the bloggers, look at how weird and stupid, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs&quot;&gt;Microserfs&lt;/a&gt; way, they are. If they looked a little deeper and more optimistically, they'd discover that their sources were going direct, and now they can do a different less superficial kind of journalism. That would have been powerful, instead we got the fearful story. Over and over. Blogging is and always will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources go direct%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;sources go direct&lt;/a&gt; to me.

			<description>I want to see one major publication's editorial page or opinion writer say how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; betrayed us, and how reporters must not do that. If you have information that can save lives, err on the side of disclosure. I was hoping that Ben Smith would do it in his weekly column, instead he went after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/business/media/the-intercept-source-reality-winner.html&quot;&gt;The Intercept&lt;/a&gt;. Reporters do that, go after safe targets, believing perhaps they'll never work with someone from The Intercept, or need a quote from the owner. As far as I know not one op-ed writer has said what Woodward did was bad.</description>

			<title>Chrome playing video halts screen saver</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago my Mac stopped going to sleep when I left. Not only will this burn out the monitor, it's a security problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I tried rebooting. No help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tried quitting all my apps. Then the screen saver would start. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now to figure out which app was the culprit. I figured it was Dropbox, my first guess for anything going wrong. Sorry. But it wasn't Dropbox. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was Chrome. If it thinks you're watching a video, it will keep the Mac from going to sleep. I had a window from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agora.io/en/&quot;&gt;Agora&lt;/a&gt; open, because I was interested in it and planned to go back to learn more. Well it has a video on the home page. It didn't even register with me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I closed that window, waited a minute, with Chrome running, and the screen saver kicked in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A reminder if you have this problem in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The number of dead, for purposes of the election, should be the projected number as of Election Day. And a question should be part of the discussion. Do you want to be one of the dead ones?</description>

			<description>I had a heated discussion yesterday with a dear friend who I greatly respect, about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; thesis. Here's the question I asked, at the core of my case, and I'd ask it to Jay Rosen too, and to you dear reader, if you think what Woodward did was understandable and/or excusable. Why do you care about winning the election? What are you trying to prevent? Think about it. If you're listening and not arguing, you'll get it.</description>

			<description>I had to write a piece about this before I realized that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best/worst example. Had it been a random reporter at the NYT, I think people would have looked at it differently. The Times brought us many terrible things like WMDs in Iraq and Hillary's Emails. Holding on to such an important bit of information about the president, and the snake oil he was selling about the disease, would be less excusable perhaps if it were a reporter no one heard of, instead of the most famous reporter in the world, possibly the most famous reporter ever. Who feels qualified to criticize The Great Woodward, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter&quot;&gt;St Peter&lt;/a&gt; of the Church of the Savvy.</description>

			<description>Someone on the NYT op-ed page has to call &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/11/135338.html?title=woodwardBetrayedUs&quot;&gt;Woodward&lt;/a&gt; out. But journalism always covers up the sins of journalism. Please let me know if you see journalism &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing this, I'll give them an award. It never happens. If only Rachel, Chris, Al, Joy, Wolf, Erin, Jake, Brian or Anderson looked at the Woodward case, and broadcast a message loud and clear, &lt;b&gt;if any other reporter does this, we're going to crucify them.&lt;/b&gt; They do it regularly for Facebook. Someone has to do it for them. We pay too high a price for their inability to admit the most costly errors. They've all set a terrible precedent by remaining silent.</description>

			<title>Firmware file not compatible</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I update my iPhone using iTunes I get this error message.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The iPhone could not be updated because the firmware file is not compatible. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No one seems to know what that means when you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22firmware+file+is+not+compatible%22&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for it on Google, and none of the advice works and it's happened a number of times, and every time I have to re-discover the workaround. This time I'm writing a blog post so when I search for it, I'll have the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Don't update the phone with iTunes. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can update it over wifi, it doesn't need iTunes to do the update.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Open the Settings app, scroll down to General, open it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Click on Software Update. Follow the instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Works every damn time!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's basically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs&quot;&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/a&gt; method of updating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
