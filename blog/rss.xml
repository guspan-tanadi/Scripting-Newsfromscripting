			<title>Predicting the Chauvin verdict</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;At 4:15 PM Eastern.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That the verdict is coming in so quickly that imho means it's a guilty verdict. Here's why.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Given the strength of the evidence and the fact that there are four black people on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/us/derek-chauvin-trial-jurors/index.html&quot;&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt;, it couldn't be unanimous acquittal.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If it was a divided jury, they couldn't be adjourning so quickly, the judge wouldn't let them.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Therefore the only situation that makes sense, at this point, is a unanimous decision to convict.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the best investments I've made is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp&quot;&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;, the less famous of the two big ones, the other being the Dow Jones. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies&quot;&gt;collection of stocks&lt;/a&gt;, chosen by a company named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_Global&quot;&gt;S&amp;P Global&lt;/a&gt;. Simplifying just a little, they buy shares in those stocks and then in turn sell shares of the collection to everyone, people like you and me. The value of the fund is the totall of the value of all the stock it owns, and fluctuates as their prices change. Every day it goes up or down, like a stock. It means that even if one of these companies does badly, the collection doesn't crash. It's designed to reflect the value of the &quot;stock market.&quot; So why is the S&amp;P 500 such a good investment? This is what I think, everyone has an opinion about this. It's the way presidents are evaluated. If the stock market is doing well, then analysts say &quot;the economy&quot; is doing well, and the president's approval rating goes up. It doesn't make any sense, but that's how it works. So the president will work really hard to make sure that your bet on the S&amp;P 500 goes up and up and up, always, in good times and bad. Now, there are times when the S&amp;P 500 will go down, but usually it goes up. If you put some money there it will probably grow. Over time it will grow a lot. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.INX:INDEXSP&quot;&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; the value of the S&amp;P 500 here. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/19/sp500graph.png&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; of the S&amp;P 500 from 1981 to now. You can see it does go up, but there are times it goes down. You can buy shares in the S&amp;P 500 from any brokerage firm. The list is open source, so any reputable broker can sell you an S&amp;P 500 fund. They all, by definition, behave exactly the same, though commissions on transactions differ according to brokers. That's why I say I &quot;simplified&quot; just a little.</description>

Blink is owned by Amazon. They're sending me &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/19/blinkPlan.png&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; saying that my free plan is about to expire and that I should pay them, for something, they're not clear what, but it sounds like my cameras will be useless once they turn off the plan. In about a week. I don't like that they are so vague about what will happen if I don't pay the money. Amazon hasn't always been the most customer-friendly company, but this is unusual for them, not to be reasonably clear what the proposal is. This is the kind of slimy crap I expect from a cable tv company like Comcast or Spectrum. Or AOL back in the day. Companies that want your money and will do everything ot keep it coming, no matter how unprincipled. Of course I can and will let it expire to see what'll happen. I doubt seriously if, as they threaten, then it will be too late. Heh. This is the kind of campaign that just keeps coming.</description>

			<description>BTW, if it's a summit, you don't have to say it's a summit. The conference with FDR, Stalin and Churchill was simply called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference&quot;&gt;Yalta Conference&lt;/a&gt;. My father once told me that a university doesn't have to say it's a university if they really are one. You don't see car window decals for proud parents that say Harvard &lt;i&gt;University&lt;/i&gt; or Stanford &lt;i&gt;University. &lt;/i&gt;Just Harvard and Stanford will do. He was putting down the window decal I got him for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tulane.edu/&quot;&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;, which did proclaim itself a university. Even worse, they called themselves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/602l8x/the_harvard_of_the_south/&quot;&gt;The Harvard of the South&lt;/a&gt;. Oy! That's not a good sign. I wonder if they still do that. And doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22harvard+of+the+south%22&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; today I learn that Duke, Rice, Emory and Vanderbilt also consider themselves THOTS. Maybe they should forget it and just try to love their students more.</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Harvard of New Jersey&lt;/i&gt; is Princeton, another school that can leave off the University part. Some people think it's an even better school than the other top most prestigious schools in the US, which imho would be Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Yale.</description>

			<description>I like to listen to audiobooks on my daily walks and bike rides, they're good to have around when podcasts aren't so interesting to me. It happens. Right now I'm listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/Roots-Audiobook/B002V8H174&quot;&gt;Roots&lt;/a&gt;, narrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Brooks&quot;&gt;Avery Brooks&lt;/a&gt;. It's a beautifully crafted story, and the narration is among the best I've heard. I'm still at the beginning, but I love it, I'm even listening when I'm not out getting my exercise.</description>

			<description>BTW, to follow up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/17.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's&lt;/a&gt; posts about tabs and bookmarks in the outliner part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like I did get it stabilized yesterday. I have to qualify that because I saw some problems before I shut down for the day yesterday, after fixing a huge number of really serious mistakes and omissions. But I feel confident that I can start the post corner-turn cleanup and get ready for more fun projects starting tomorrow. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1383828003013070850&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;: Re the problems, oy there was a huge problem. In the main closure for a tab there's a background thread that I did not kill when the tab was closed. As a result it kept running. Whenever it saw a change in a file (not its file) it would save it, to the now-closed file, thus wiping out the contents of the closed file. This was hard to track down. Now everything is really smooth. Haha until I find the next horrible omission! Users never see these problems, hopefully, but this is what you have to deal with getting to the point where software is useful.)</description>

			<description>I'm learning that more people from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_County,_New_York&quot;&gt;Ulster County&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood are reading this blog. I find that exciting. Maybe we should have some meetups this summer? At the beer garden at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colonywoodstock.com/&quot;&gt;the Colony&lt;/a&gt;? I love the idea of a beer garden in Woodstock, and as everyone knows, summers here are the best. There's a lot of planning to do now that cannabis is legal everywhere in NY State now. And Tuesday is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture)&quot;&gt;4/20&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.0426&amp;lon=-74.1183#.YHw_JRNKjUZ&quot;&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; is going to be nice.</description>

			<description>I don't know if I've ever told this story about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt; at his hippie commune outside St Augustine, FL. Once I went to visit, on vacation from my Silicon Valley startup. When I arrived at his little off-grid geodesic cottage in the woods, he showed me they had pinned up an article in Business Week with a picture of me, which labeled me as &lt;i&gt;President&lt;/i&gt; Dave Winer of Living Videotext. My uncle who claimed he had changed my diapers when I was an infant, thought this was insanely funny. He told me they started calling each other President Ken, or President Dorothy, or President Pumpkin (one of their dogs) or President Dump Kitty (one of the cats). I didn't object because in my mind I had a terrible case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&quot;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. No one in California dared make fun of it, but here in the woods with my dear uncle and friends, it seemed fine.</description>

			<title>The current-events-osphere</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'd love to see an exercise bike that's tuned up for podcasts. Not sure exactly what that means. But I don't like competing on my bike rides. I more prefer to learn stuff. In a somewhat organized way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the podcasts I listen to are suffering from the same problem CNN and MSNBC are. They had a great knuckle-biter story to cover for the last five years, amped up by another knuckle-biter, and now the first one is gone, and the second is waning. Leaving them without anything to talk about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm really not worried about Trump anymore, and I'm vaccinated, and I have mask-wearing and social distancing down. I don't travel and I'm fine with that. I enjoy my work, and summer is coming!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I found for example that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22that+trippi+show%22&quot;&gt;Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; was fascinating in the run-up to the election, but now, I don't care so much about what's on the mind of a classical campaign runner (with apologies to Joe, who is a great guy).  It's a very specific thing he does, and only vitally interesting to me in-season. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The whole current-events-osphere could use a re-think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Knuckle-biting, demonstrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio&quot;&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_(book)&quot;&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan&quot;&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great book, but already dated. The missions he talks about for the future have already happened. Our understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has greatly increased since 1994. Now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens&quot;&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt; has visited, so much &lt;a href=&quot;https://stfc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/features/10-things-we-ve-learned-from-cassini-huygens/&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; is known.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; has a feature that LO2 doesn't have -- Bookmarks. Here's how they work. There's a Bookmarks menu. When you choose the first command, Add Bookmark, a dialog confirms that you want to bookmark the current outline. If you click OK, the bookmarks file opens in a tab, and a link to the file you had open appears as the first item in the list. You can move the link where ever you like, and change the text. If you look in the Bookmarks menu, the changes are reflected. The menu can be hierarchic. As you have probably guessed the file is an outline, like any other outline. But it has this special UI. There are a number of other features like this. Anyway, Bookmarks are tricky because of the way asynchronous code works in JavaScript. If bookmarks.opml isn't already open, you have to wait until it is open to create the bookmark link. If you don't, weird things can happen. Now that I've changed how tabs work internally, this feature is broken. It drives me crazy because I depend on Bookmarks, and I'm starting to use Drummer for real work now. So today I must get this problem solved. I'm not getting up until it works. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, it's not &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; true that no outliner I've shipped has had a Bookmarks menu. &quot;Electric Outliner&quot; has one. But I haven't exactly promoted it. I use it to write my blog, in fact I'm using it right now to write &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/17.html#a133713&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It has had a Bookmarks menu for years, and I've been able to manage lots of complex projects more easily because of it. EO is an Electron-based outliner that runs on the desktop. There will be a desktop version of Drummer, using lots of what's in EO, hopefully. It's possible we did a bookmarks feature for Frontier too. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/autowebdocs/menusharingwalkthru_148.html&quot;&gt;menu sharing&lt;/a&gt; is something like Bookmarks. My memory sucks. Sorry.</description>

			<description>I've been trying to watch the news on MSNBC and CNN, but it's really hard to get into. Their product transformed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Trump%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and now that he is gone, or so it seems, knock wood -- what's left for them to cover? Here's what I suggest. This requires that you put the heat on Biden and Judge Garland. First I've heard it said that January 6 could happen again, which I think is too meek. It &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; happen again. And until the prosecutions begin, the news should be filling in the details the same way they were covering every detail of the Trump crime scene when he was in office. Who are the leaders? Their names, pictures, backgrounds, are they free, awaiting trial, on the run? These people, and the politicians that are covering for them, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-senators-voted-against-bipartisan-bill-anti-asian-hate-crimes-2021-4#sen-tom-cotton-of-arkansas-1&quot;&gt;six sentators&lt;/a&gt; who voted against the Asian hate crimes bill, to name a few, are vying for the position of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/03/06/howToPreventAnotherTrump.html&quot;&gt;The Next Hitler&lt;/a&gt; of the United States. We need a bunch of good enemies. And why aren't the Bidens prosecuting them. We need some bodies in cells for January 6, now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🎈&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>So, instead of watching the news from 6PM to 10PM every night, as I did during the Trump years, I've been reading books, watching the Mets and Knicks, watching British movies, also the Godfather I and II. On the whole this is a better deal. More variety, it's more personal, much less repetitive, and besides the Knicks are playing entertaining basketball, and that's more than I can say for whatever sport they're playing on MSNBC.</description>

			<description>On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; front, I decided to rewrite the tab code to use JavaScript closures. Much simpler code and hopefully more easily extended to add new functionality. But right now the app is a mess. I learned some new jQuery tricks with custom event handlers and triggers. You can have a very isolated function with persistent and private storage but you can still make calls into it, for the times when the outside world needs to know something about what's inside.</description>

			<description>An unusual day is one where It's almost 6PM and I haven't posted anything to the blog. This is one of those days. I think I actually have to update at least once a day for the nightly mail app. Not sure what it would do if midnight came and there was nothing new. I don't really want to find out. Everything's fine, in the middle of a pretty heavy bit of development so my focus is there. See you tomorrow! ;-)</description>

			<description>I have to say, a consistent theme in my career has been, I create something, through a lot of work and trial and error, and years later it's out and people like it. And then people say thanks for doing that, now I'll take over. The first time I saw that in a huge way was with OPML. It came a couple of years after RSS's success, and a lot of people assumed OPML would be big and they could get rich if they owned it. I had a colleague at Harvard even tell me literally he was going to take over now. Those were the words he used. He had no idea what OPML was! I thought this is the height of ridiculousness. It got so awful I just dropped the project, to let them all fail, which is exactly what happened. These things aren't designed to get anyone rich. There is no lock-in possible so nothing to charge money for. How stupid can you be. Obviously, I learned the lesson that people can be very very very stupid. And unbelievably, larcenously, greedy. (BTW, the guy from Harvard was already very rich. He did not need more money. I had been to his house.)</description>

			<description>So many more examples. Like the VCs and RSS. They all lost all their money because they thought a format can be owned. None of them were interested in where I thought the products were, they all created the same product, badly -- and failed. Podcasting, more of the same. My partner, Adam Curry, thought I was just a programmer, and therefore &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility&quot;&gt;fungible&lt;/a&gt;. I am a programmer, for sure -- but I think about things in a different way, there's a part of the stack almost no one else gets into. I see new media before it exists. I work at it. You can't just hire someone to do what I do. That's why my consistent drumbeat is Let's Work Together. Instead of stopping here, there's much more to do and no one gets to do it all. The interchange format isn't ownable. But most people don't get that, and when they bet money that they can, they lose it all.</description>

			<description>Drummer is going to be the anti-silo, as Frontier was. What this meant for Frontier is when we saw a new protocol, our first impulse was to implement it. I wanted it to be able to communicate with anything. A silo'd outliner would instead usually not to support a protocol, and implement everything itself. Watching Roam, I'd say they are a half-silo. When it comes to exporting content from Roam they seem to be fairly liberal. They don't want to implement their own blogging software, for example, they'd prefer to export to a static site generator.

I wanted to see how at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/days&quot;&gt;some of my writing&lt;/a&gt; here on Scripting News, in outlines, would look in their graph. As far as I can tell, it might be possible to do, but it would require a lot of work by hand, and no one has time to do that. It would make more sense imho to support some kind of standard interchange format. Luckily, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/&quot;&gt;created one&lt;/a&gt;, in the 00s, for just this purpose, and it's pretty broadly supported. Anyway they certainly don't make it easy. They really want me to use their outliner. I'm sure it's very nice, but I already have one. Anyway, like all recent text products and services, you're pretty much locked into using their editor.</description>

			<source:outline text="Drummer is going to be the anti-silo, as Frontier was. What this meant for Frontier is when we saw a new protocol, our first impulse was to implement it. I wanted it to be able to communicate with anything. A silo'd outliner would instead usually not to support a protocol, and implement everything itself. Watching Roam, I'd say they are a half-silo. When it comes to exporting content from Roam they seem to be fairly liberal. They don't want to implement their own blogging software, for example, they'd prefer to export to a static site generator.

			<description>Follow-up to yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/206&quot;&gt;braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/&quot;&gt;WordPress still has an API&lt;/a&gt;, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; to interface to it, and even better, they still have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support&quot;&gt;XML-RPC interface&lt;/a&gt; and support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_MetaWeblog_API&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt;. So it should be possible to have WordPress support in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and use the outliner to create and edit posts on a WordPress website, and who knows where that goes. What's especially cool about it is that in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/&quot;&gt;December 2019&lt;/a&gt; I released a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt; of XML-RPC in the form of a client and server for Node, in JavaScript of course, and a client that runs in the browser. So now there's a good reason to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; support to Drummer, which I totally want to do.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/206&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: Is there a way to post to WordPress from an external app? If it has an API, I'd like to get support in the first release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It's an important connection. For years they had an XML-RPC interface. I think that's gone now. Has something replaced it yet?  (Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; looks promising.)</description>

			<description>Earlier this month I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/04/174604.html?title=theLostAppsOfThe80s&quot;&gt;The Lost Apps of the 80s&lt;/a&gt;, wondering where the depth of early PC writing tools went. Also spreadsheets, databases, graphics programs. There were huge numbers of them. The reason imho is Microsoft and not just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars&quot;&gt;Browser Wars&lt;/a&gt; which threw all of software into chaos for a number of years. There's another reason, and it might have happened even if the web hadn't come along. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office&quot;&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;. So quickly I forgot. It used to be that a word processor cost $495 as did a database, spreadsheet, and various other software. When you added up the retail prices it could easily come to $2000. Then one day, Microsoft bundled &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word&quot;&gt;Word&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel&quot;&gt;Excel&lt;/a&gt; and a few other apps, for the price of a single productivity app. And over the years, they added more software to the bundle. This alone might have reduced the productiving software business to one vendor. The competitors couldn't afford to do what Microsoft did, they didn't have the royalties from the OS to support their price-cutting in apps. So that's another theory on where the apps went. Today, that's no excuse. Writing tools would have a different purpose today, writing for the network, rather than for printing. Different requirements.</description>

			<description>I just found a 1991 piece by Steven Levy at MacWorld about Frontier, which was still in development at the time. Really interesting read because now, only 30 years later (heh), I'm doing a smaller version of the same idea, not on the Mac but on the open web, once again using standard protocols to connect apps. It starts on page 51 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://vintageapple.org/macworld/pdf/MacWorld_9108_August_1991.pdf&quot;&gt;this PDF&lt;/a&gt; of the August 1991 MacWorld.

			<description>What neither Levy or I understood, at the same time in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee was working on the world wide web. Frontier's importance in bootstrapping the web as a content management platform, via blogging, RSS and podcasting, was where the real growth would come. It would require a pivot, of course. The Mac &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; entering middle age, as Levy postulated. But a new shiny thing that worked really well with the Mac was coming along and would soon change everything. The same vacuum that existed on the Mac at the time, now exists on the web. There is no simple-enough scripting language designed for power users to integrate the functionality of many and disparate apps. Why do I like this so much? I guess I'm just a pipes and wires kind of guy. And I think lots of new media will emerge from the ecosystem we'll create here.</description>
