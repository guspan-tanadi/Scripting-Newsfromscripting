			<description>In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/09.html#a151330&quot;&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; I made a change to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/everyMinute&quot;&gt;script scheduler&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to get rid of drift, so that the nightly email would go out more or less precisely at midnight. The fix worked. Sometimes it's one second after midnight, but usually it's exact. The important thing is that any difference is not cumulative, it gets back on track on its own the next day. Here's a screen shot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/02/footer.png&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/a&gt; on last night's email.</description>

			<description>The weather. Oy! Very cold very windy and the power has been out, on and off, since yesterday afternoon. I charged up all my devices before the power went out and loaded up lots of podcasts, so I'm very entertained. Made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy82ekHbVpM&amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;nice fire&lt;/a&gt;, but the house still got down to about 45 degrees. I was worried about pipes freezing if the outage lasted much longer. But the power is back at about 12:20PM Eastern and I'm feeling pretty good now.</description>

			<description>BTW, if you download Netflix shows to a mobile device, why does the app refuse to open if you don't have a net connection? What was the point of downloading them? I swear it used to work. How did I watch Netflix shows on airplanes?</description>

			<description>Brian Lehrer is one of the best podcasts out there. Just listened to his &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-serious-is-andrew-cuomos-sexual-harassment-scandal/id1482313742?i=1000511167029&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of the Cuomo situation, including calls from listeners. They covered it all. Totally worth listening to.</description>

			<description>DocServer was a Mac app, before there was a web, that let you read the verb docs for the UserLand scripting language. Once we transitioned to the web, DocServer became a web app, managed by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/netScripting/web.html&quot;&gt;website framework&lt;/a&gt;. I had forgotten it was an app before it was a website. And, btw, it was fully scriptable, as were all the apps we were making at the time. Here's a screen shot.</description>

			<description>How are we going to be sure we remember January 6 and the fact that we've done &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; so far to punish those responsible. Congress is filled with instigators. Yet the Dems go along as if it's four years ago and perhaps HRC is president and the Repubs are just being assholes.</description>

			<description>I was asked what would you do if you were in charge of the Dems. Okay. I would do the equiv of what Trump did on Jan 6, but do it legally, within the limits of the Constitution. Turns out the Constitution gives the Dems enough power to do what's needed. Yes, it will provoke what remains of the Repubs. So when are you going to stop worrying about that and realize that the rest of us have been totally provoked. They don't worry about provoking us. Maybe that's something we have to fix.</description>

			<description>Like many others I learned to live with an alcoholic parent. You try desperately not to provoke them. They drink and that's all the provocation they need. But they're the adult, and you're a kid so you believe them when they say you provoked them. But kids are not stupid, you can't see how.</description>

			<description>I am pissed that the press is going after Andrew Cuomo, who led us through some very dark times, when it helped to feel like someone was in charge. We may need that again, and thanks to this purge, he may not be available. But if you really want to nail him, learn about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_New_York_City_mayoral_election#General_election&quot;&gt;1977 campaign&lt;/a&gt; between his father and Ed Koch, for mayor of NYC. It was very mean-spirited, and Andrew was part of it. I find what the Cuomos did utterly abhorrent, but you know what, we still need people who can lead. Perfection is nice, if you can afford it. We can't.</description>

I know what he means about being edited. I wrote briefly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awired.com+%22dave+winer%22&quot;&gt;for Wired&lt;/a&gt; in the early days. I loved my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen&quot;&gt;first editor&lt;/a&gt;, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes.</description>

I know what he means about being edited. I wrote briefly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awired.com+%22dave+winer%22&quot;&gt;for Wired&lt;/a&gt; in the early days. I loved my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen&quot;&gt;first editor&lt;/a&gt;, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes." created="Mon, 01 Mar 2021 14:09:09 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/01.html#a140909"/>

			<description>I have Apple's credit card, and it's got good integration with iOS as you would imagine. I get a notification every time some business charges my card. That's a killer feature.</description>

			<description>Good morning! March is coming in like a lion for sure. It sucks. This afternoon a super cold front is blowing in, after a warm few days, with slush everywhere, and it's all going to freeze. Oy. I got so tired of living in California. Oh no another beautiful day, when will the torture end. Right now I'd give anything for a warm breeze, a bit of green, some flowers, a bike ride perhaps. Can't come soon enough. Anyway welcome to another month of my life.</description>
