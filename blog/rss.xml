			<description>Somehow it's especially sad that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-dead-1.6828991&quot;&gt;Gordon Lightfoot died&lt;/a&gt;, because his music reaches into my heart and pulls out really strong feelings. Always has. Now the strong feelings are in gratitude of all he has given us. If you have a moment, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuzTkGyxkYI&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates.</description>

			<description>Here's something maybe to not look forward to. Next time you call for customer service, you will speak with one of ChatGPT's cousins. It will sound like a human, but will be clear it's not. Beg for mercy from a machine, a machine that's programmed to sound like they care, while being obstinate. Just try and cancel a subscription to the NY Times.</description>

			<description>Watching last night's NBA playoff game, the announcer would say if a shot went in or spun out of the basket before it's clear, visually, which way it was going. Is this a deliberate delay of the video feed, or a technical glitch somewhere in the network?</description>

			<description>Succession spoilers, don't read. I love how the Swede calls the Roy brothers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/02/tribute-band-definition.html&quot;&gt;tribute band&lt;/a&gt;. When you watch the newest episode a second time, you realize that they have something, each of them. Kendall is creative, and is a Steve Jobs type showman who can think on his feet. Shiv is a plotter, networker and manager. Roman is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/02/meaning-of-machiavellian.html&quot;&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/a&gt; monarch. They don't necessarily let scruples get in their way. Each of them has part of Logan's personality, and all are good at it, they just didn't necessarily know while he was alive, trying to exist in his shadow. This epside is where the turned from klutzes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&amp;t=265s&quot;&gt;serious people&lt;/a&gt; perhaps with potential for greatness. And Tom fits in there too, we find out in the last scene of the most recent episode. I like that. I identify with Tom.</description>

I write an outline to organize the work. I put things where they belong as they are created. Nothing new about that, I've been working this way since the 80s. But the bot can help me manage it. I got an idea how this could work when I chose a codename for a new product using ChatGPT to make suggestions. It led me to a new more creative approach and I think a more interesting name. I hope it learned from what I did and may help other people choose names in the future. I just did an outline for the project and I'm not sure how I would give it to my friend the bot. We used to think of uploading our brains to computers, well isn't that what I'm doing now? It's a level or two above what I do with GitHub, but a similar idea. You can see how my brain works, either way. I'm making an effort to leave that as something others might learn from in the future.</description>

			<title>The AI bots are already smarter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/29/monaLisa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; in the NYT where the so-called godfather of AI is concerned that AI might get out of control. His two major concerns, as outlined in the article are that people might lose jobs, and not just menial jobs, and we might have a hard time finding out the truth. Another concern is that the bots will be fighting wars on our behalf, as we have seen in many science fiction stories over the generations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is already smarter than humans because it has a non-zero attention span, and isn't trying to promote its own career and has no conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you ask a human a question, the answer will probably just be a canned &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/schpiel-definition.html&quot;&gt;schpiel&lt;/a&gt; they have memorized based on hearing a keyword in what you said. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it isn't much of a leap to say someday the bots may be smarter than humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The better conclusion is that humans better get our shit together start using our intelligence because the competition is here and it's already better than we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, for years I've been trying to find an explanation of the difference between rain and showers in weather forecasts. I asked ChatGPT and it patiently &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/rain-vs-showers.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. I asked thousands of humans and the answers I got were either vague or wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
