I just changed it to 25. Soon it'll give you the ability to set the value for yourself, but the default for new users and people not signed in will be 25.</description>

			<description>You'd be amazed how many people have 10-year-old TVs. There's been so much progress. I was one of those people until last year, bought a big Sony for a few thou in 2010. Replaced it with a much better, much larger, higher def screen for 1/5th the price in 2019. Just looked at prices, makes my 2019 screen look like chopped liver.</description>

			<description>How does a person, much less a president, come to see fallen soldiers as losers or suckers. Then imagine what the president thinks of people who defend us against the virus. This is the opposite of leadership. He is the enemy.</description>

			<description>Things I use my outliner for -- writing my blog and publishing it, writing all my JS code, project management, list-making, decision-making, design. You see outlines in every product, but no one puts a lot of effort into developing them. Most programmers, it seems, aren't good at connecting the dots and seeing trends in our work and then factoring based on those observations. I use two outliners. One is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/09/16/concordOurGplOutliner&quot;&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;, in an Electron shell. Its feature set is an almost exact copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;, with a few extra features to support my blog-writing. And I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on my Mac for writing JS code, because I have a well-developed code management system that runs in Frontier. I also write little utilities that are quicker to write in Frontier than they would be in Node, but I have hopes of tackling that job and making Node a real scripting system. I no longer use the server apps we developed in Frontier. Most of them have been ported to Node. Many advantages to doing that, unfortunately none of those compare with Frontier for server programming. What Node has is a huge community that writes lots of packages that I can use. As far as I can tell I am the whole community in Frontier. Eventually that had to give, and it did. I found a good teacher to help me get started in JS in 2013 or so, and boom off to the races.</description>

			<description>First episode of Borgen is very good, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/07.html#a151932&quot;&gt;advertised&lt;/a&gt;. I tried the English dubbing, but couldn't understand what they were saying and the English subtitles don't match the dubbing, so I reverted to the Danish audio with English subs.</description>

After that, he can rot in jail for the rest of his life as far as I'm concerned.</description>

			<description>When criticizing a product, it's a good idea to hedge your criticism so you don't look like a complete fool when it turns out you were wrong. A simple &quot;it seems to me&quot; or &quot;apparently&quot; would make you look a bit more humble and less like a jerk. It happens to us all, so be careful. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, re the pandemic, everyone who thinks Trump has done badly up till now, it's about to get much worse. He's found his Bill Barr for managing the pandemic.

			<description>The day after Election Day in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, I went for a walk around midtown Manhattan. It looked just like it did the day before. Nothing changed about the city. But I felt like people looked at each other differently. Did this person vote for Trump? Do they think I voted for Trump? I wanted to wear a button that said &quot;I voted for HRC.&quot; Or better, I'm on the other side. I came up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MLK button%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;MLK button&lt;/a&gt;. I bought a thousand of them, and gave them away. I still wear it some days when I'm out in public. It was a more general &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt;. It said people are sacred and differences should be celebrated. And we're scared, so let's be there for each other. Today almost four years later, I suspect if you walk around Manhattan things are visibly different, and it's at least indirectly because Trump has been president for four years. Four more years? Hard to imagine how transformed this country will be then.</description>

			<title>Trumpolini</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The bad thing about all the open corruption in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=trumpolini&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; admin, is they aren't all as sick and crazy and Trump, and know if they leave office, without Trump or someone worse in charge, they will go to jail. So they're going to fight like hell to keep him in office.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also if you accept the premise that they're also hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and I do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He can target death by cutting off funding strategically, by geography, economic status, age, race, or forcing people to do things that will expose them to the virus. They're already doing it, for example forcing schools to open. That translates into death and disease, as you know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People ask what if Trump refuses to leave. Let's see if we can figure it out. He watches TV all day. I assume he’ll continue to do that. I suppose we‘ll have to sign loyalty oaths to him. Penalties very harsh for not doing so. What else? I bet his health continues to deteriorate, which means perhaps Melania will be running the country, or the Trump kids. There won't be any checks and balances, I guess.</description>

			<description>The press repeats their blaming Facebook for the terrible state of our political system. In such damning terms. I wish they'd find a way to take &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/11/butHerEmails.png&quot;&gt;their share&lt;/a&gt; of that responsibility. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/facebook-has-militia-problem&quot;&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt; is the worst.</description>

			<title>Australia and Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Something weird about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-facebook/facebook-to-block-news-on-australian-sites-after-new-law-riling-lawmakers-idUSKBN25S36J&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At least in the US, if I link to an article on FB, the text of the article isn’t on FB, it’s on the original site.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Any text from the article that appears in FB is in the metadata put in the file specifically so it can be quoted by FB. Totally voluntary. There's no requirement you include that data.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the news org wants to stop FB, just don’t include that metadata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, the metadata is saying FB, please include this information when someone links to this story. It's kind of pissy to then complain that they included the information you asked them to include. If you want them to not include the information, mate, stop asking them to. It's really fucking simple. I'm sure there are plenty of Australian programmers who can explain it to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, view the source code of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/06/145953.html?title=australiaAndFacebook&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Near the top of the page look for &amp;lt;meta&gt; tags with the og: prefix. Those are put there for Facebook. There are others, with the same info, for Twitter. It's smart to put those in there, they're kind of like ads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Facebook%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I applied for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://absenteeballot.elections.ny.gov/&quot;&gt;absentee ballot&lt;/a&gt; in New York State. It seems to me they could allow me to download and print a PDF of the ballot, instead of mailing it to me via USPS. The first half of the process could be electronic. At least they didn't require you to send them a printed request to send you a ballot. They didn't ask for an email address. That's a shame, because that could be used to debug problems with the system, or provide confirmation when they receive the ballot. Also note they don't ask for your mailing address. This is good. However, they display the person's physical address in the form, once you provide information that isn't that hard to guess. &lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; a good idea.</description>

			<title>How the super-rich think</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Many years ago at a tech conference in Arizona, I was seated next to a billionaire. He had started a shoe company, very successful, sold it. I tried to have a conversation, but he mostly ignored me. He said something I remembered. You can't get by on less than $20 million a year. I looked to see if he was joking. He wasn't. I said you know that's not true. I live quite well, but I don't even spend $1 million a year (an understatement, I probably didn't spend $100K a year). I said there are lots of people who get by on $30K a year (it was a long time ago). He didn't say another word the whole meal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that ignorance because he made shoes a lot of people liked. Shoes. I've seen it many times. Vast wealth doesn't make people smarter, though a lot of people including the super-rich think it does. It actually makes you stupider.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A guy like Trump has no idea what it means to be president. Yet for some reason he decided that's what he wants to be. And he is. And he probably doesn't understand why people are so upset with what he said about suckers and losers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could imagine one of my roommates at UW-Madison saying something like what Trump said in the 70s. But a president not only can't, but a president can't even think it. A president has to send people to their deaths. That's a very big responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A person who truly believes what Trump does can not be president. We could argue about it in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-caribou-tavern-madison&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0820869,-89.3795457,3a,75y,131.15h,82.88t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slrCk4WmhSscUcMsBgtq0gA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;E Johnson St&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin&quot;&gt;Madison&lt;/a&gt;, but he doesn't get to be undecided on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>On Facebook's new UI</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1323083621232373&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After a week of using the new Facebook user interface — it’s awful. The first thing you want to do when you come to Facebook is find out what’s new, so you pull down the menu with all the new stuff in it. In the old version in that menu were links to all of the comments, posts, likes of people I follow. Perfect. That’s exactly what I’m looking for. In the new version most of the new items are friend requests. I get huge numbers of spam friend requests. I can’t tell in this menu which are spam and which are real so I just delete them all. And it’s hard to find the new comments posts and likes of my friends. Usually new interfaces are upsetting in the first few days and then you get used to them and that’s it. That isn’t happening with this interface. It’s just wrong. Facebook you should fix it. I know this because I still have the old interface on my iPad and it’s much much easier to use. I apologize for typos in this. I recited it using voice recognition on my iPad, and it’s not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

To his question, I like to help others. That's what's in it for me. I don't envy anyone who lives only for himself. As you get older, and there's not much life remaining. When you already have enough material wealth, there really can only be satisfaction in helping other, mostly younger, people get more out of their lives. Trump is 74 years old and you can see his health is slipping. Not much time left. He already has more money than he can possibly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/10/19/transcendentalMoney.html&quot;&gt;spend&lt;/a&gt; in 1000 lifetimes. There's no point in making more. He's not making anyone's life better, quite the opposite. There's still a little time left for him to find his way. Or at least get out of the way.</description>

			<description>People forget when they say that DJ Trump will declare victory on election night that he doesn't get to say that, it's the network statisticians who call elections. They know when enough votes have been counted, and I don't think too many people will believe Trump if none of them agree.</description>

			<description>BTW, when I was a kid growing up in NYC I had a lot of close calls with NYPD. I never worried about them killing me. It never occurred to me. They were mostly  pranks. That's the kind of kid I was and who I hung out with. But we did have a couple of student strikes. We also had a run-in with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/04/15/letsBuildANewInternetInAca.html#p6233&quot;&gt;teachers union&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Thinking about what it would take to turn JavaScript into a simple-enough scripting language. I wouldn't change anything but the syntax for functions that require callbacks. I think that's the only thing that keeps it from being for system scripting, for simple one-off scripts that automate things you do a lot by hand.</description>

			<description>A longtime &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; uses Mailchimp to send a periodic newsletter. They have a feature that allows the author to re-send the mail to people who haven't opened it. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/help/resend-an-unopened-campaign/&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt;. They don't say how they know it wasn't opened. I was under the impression that mail apps prevent this kind of invasive behavior. People used to use one-pixel images with search params, but I think the email apps now copy the image and replace it in the HTML, to prevent the sender from knowing. So I told my friend I don't think it's possible. Pretty sure that's right, but I guess it depends on the app you use for email. I use GMail. I think these days enough people use GMail to make the Mailchimp feature useless. BTW, I did open the first email, and it treated me as if I hadn't. More evidence that the feature doesn't really work. If you have insight, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1301930952151764992&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

The stories are going to get worse." created="Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:34:57 GMT" type="outline" urltweet="https://twitter.com/joshscampbell/status/1301324061373538304" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/03.html#a143457"/>

			<description>Had a great chat on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; last night. One takeaway, I understand why there's no connection to the web at this time, I would probably do it that way too. Feel the pain of the missing feature, and then take a careful first step after gaining experience. I've learned over the years that you can't take features away from users, without a lot of pain. So you have to add features carefully. That said, I'd love to post a followup to that chat, in writing, but there's no way to do it. Creating a connection between my Clubhouse world and my blog world would be interesting. For that they'll need an API. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>This election should be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(well_drilling)&quot;&gt;blowout&lt;/a&gt;. Americans are dying, the economy is a wreck, the country is careening and this time the casualties are at home. In a sane society, Trump would be in jail, Pence would be president and Biden would be preparing to take office in January.  There should be a permanent people's campaign, all day every day, every year, whether or not there's an election. Clearly waiting for the politicians and journalists to do this isn't working. And the current tech networks are mired, trying to serve everyone. Politics has moved online. So far it's been chaotic. But we could envision something that's orderly and productive and still preserve the energy. The idealistic vision of the early web wasn't entirely wrong, imho. :-)</description>

			<description>I have a feeling that this election would be a blowout if we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/01.html#a211304&quot;&gt;good marketing&lt;/a&gt; instead of business as usual. Joe Biden will save your life. Now I don't imagine Biden himself would want to say that. That's why god invented PACs. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Here's something funny. The new version of Facebook looks so much like the new version of Twitter that I have a hard time telling them apart. The evolutionary message is clear. There really should be one way to do this, and the systems should interop perfectly. An analogy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt; played fine on NBC, then it went to Netflix, and now it's going to some other place. Same software runs everywhere. I want to send my blog posts everywhere and have the fidelity be maintained. How would they ever agree on a standard? HTML is pretty good. I know both Zuck and Jack know how that works. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
