			<title>Knicks clinch, I'm ecstatic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Knicks suck in so many ways. But this year they suck less. Last night the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/knicks-clinch-playoff-berth-first-021855101.html&quot;&gt;Knicks clinched&lt;/a&gt; a spot in the NBA playoffs. Tears are streaming down my sad old face as I write this. The first playoff year since 2012-13, the season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1747434-timeline-of-jeremy-lins-rise-to-linsanity-and-journey-to-where-he-is-today&quot;&gt;Linsanity&lt;/a&gt;. This year it's a team full of Linsanity. Randle, Barrett, Derek Rose, Quickley, Bullock and so many more. A lovely team like the 1969 Mets. So the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Yb0HCTe1ET4?t=30&quot;&gt;paper bags&lt;/a&gt; come off our heads, at least for a while. We're no long staring into space wondering how a team could possibly suck as bad as the Knicks. Fans being kicked out of the Garden by the owner for telling the truth about him and his stinkin team. Phil Jackson, his triangle offense and all the lousy trades. This was the year the superstars of the NBA spit on the Knicks and went to Brooklyn. There must be a Basketball God who looked at this and said, my dear friends, fate is not in the hands of KD, Kyrie and Harden. I am the master of fate. The Knicks believed in themselves and we came to believe in them, however tentatively. And meanwhile, thankfully, Melo, playing in Portland, seems happy in his new role. For one day in May, pandemic or not, all is good because god loves us and we love the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Double-square brackets revisited</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/12.html#a142449&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I explained what the &amp;lsqb;[square brackets]] are doing in the various outlining products that support them. But I got it wrong. They are simpler than I thought, and represent a feature we had in our web CMSes going back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatdoesclaylooklike.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in 1995. They're doing the same thing they do in Wikis.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you've written something in an outline entitled Bill Gates vs The Internet. Then a year later you could link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; with &amp;lsqb;[Bill Gates vs The Internet]]. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's useful if you give titles to what you write, but this is an old discussion not just in blogland but elsewhere apparently. To programmers it is convenient if every piece has a title. But the truth is most items in web and personal writing don't have titles, in this sense: there isn't an obvious title for them, if you had to come up with one it would be convoluted, and probably collide with some other convoluted title, depending on how long you had been writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the things I write don't get titles, so this feature, with this definition, would be fairly useless to me. I use permalinks in their place, therefore I've made it really easy to generate an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp&quot;&gt;anchor tag&lt;/a&gt; in my writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I started blogging in 1994, all my pieces had titles, but over time, I realized my daily writing comes in long and short bits, and even many of the longish ones don't get titles. I'm not writing for a magazine or newspaper. I'm writing a blog. My thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see how they get around this in Roam by starting a new outline every day, and giving it a title, which is the date. I could do that in my blogging outline, and even in my development status outline. But I have to say I've never wished for such a feature. Maybe now that I know they use them so much in other products I'll get more ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I automatically put a &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; attribute on every node, which is a string representation of the date-time, for example: Thu, 13 May 2021 16:41:07 GMT. From that I generate a permalink for the node, which is displayed next to it in the web rendering by a purple poundsign. If you're reading this piece on the web, you'd see a purple poundsign next to each paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Lots more to say. In Roam et al, they use links as private connectors. When I refer to a piece called My Favorite Soup that refers to my piece with that title, not yours. But in a wiki, which is a group writing tool, there's only one piece with that name. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Our outlines have attributes, and conventions for what the attribute names mean. For example, if a node has type &quot;include&quot; and a &quot;url&quot; attribute, that's an include node. The url points to an OPML file. When you expand the node in an outline, we read the file, parse it, and insert its contents under the include node. All that happens instantaneously for not-too-large included outlines. Some people call these transclusions, we call them includes. It's the outline equivalent of an HTML link. In Drummer it will be possible to have these link to specific nodes in outlines. Bookmarks can already do this, in the Drummer in development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+glossary&quot;&gt;glossaries&lt;/a&gt;. And they are explained in lots of places.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here may be the biggest difference between my outline world and the nascent ones. I've tried out lots of approaches to lots of different things in the over 40 years I've been working on outliners. I'm happy to share what I've learned, and I think all of it is applicable to the connected world we live in. But there are also advantages to being a newcomer to this stuff, you start with a clean slate. You might think of something that takes another 40 years to develop, where my horizon doesn't extend nearly that far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are also big differences in the way our outliners work. I could explain that in a podcast, but don't have the time to write it up now. The takeaway is that without open modular connections between the components via APIs, this new burst of outlineism will end up with a sad story of silos and stagnation, not a wonderful explosion like the earlier open platforms. One silo vs a thriving ecosystem -- either approach could win. It's happened both ways in the past. We have to be careful to learn from past mistakes in evolving open platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For that, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

All the characters are great, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock&quot;&gt;Chris Rock&lt;/a&gt;, who, after getting over the weirdness of a comedian in a serious role, really pulls it off.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1392476430525771780&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt; is a great American. Any Republican who at this time stands for the rule-of-law and the Constitution deserves our support. We may disagree on everything but these basics. We can respect them because we agree on everyone's right to participate in our government. We have this cause in common, to make sure the fascists and would-be slave owners go back into hiding. We have a terrible history to overcome. Another way of looking at it -- Cheney might be one of a small number of Republicans in Congress who aren't owned by Russia.</description>

			<description>Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/11.html#a164404&quot;&gt;yesterday's thread&lt;/a&gt; about integrating &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; with Obsidian, an idea promoted by SMS. He said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sabre23t/status/1392115762358276097&quot;&gt;he expected&lt;/a&gt; that putting a word inside two &amp;lsqb;[square brackets]] would open a page full of links to that word within my outline. This is a very important point, and one I want to focus on. I actually put that feature into the outliner I currently use to write my blog, when I saw how they were doing things in &amp;lsqb;[Roam]] and &amp;lsqb;[wikis]]. I will ship that for sure, it's a good thing, I'm using it myself. But! It would be so much better if all these tools worked together in an open web of these things. That's the way I think about it. Remember, I led the development of &amp;lsqb;[RSS]] in its early years. I always wanted outlines to be &lt;i&gt;world&lt;/i&gt; outlines, ie to include content from other outlines all over the web. I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+%22world+outline%22&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; a lot about that. In that context, I should be integrating with a &lt;i&gt;world wide&lt;/i&gt; service that integrates lots of tools into a database of linked material. Roam insists that you use their editor, which is abhorrent to me, I will never support that, where Obsidian takes the open web approach. So the question I throw back to SMS and others is how can we set things up so a &amp;lsqb;[bracketed]] reference works with the &lt;i&gt;world wide link manager.&lt;/i&gt; We can do this. The technology is totally here. It sounds like &amp;lsqb;[Obsidian]] is off to a good start.</description>

			<description>Interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sabre23t/status/1391981493438668802&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from a person named SMS. &quot;I would love to see how your outliner app can work with Logseq. A few Obsidian users had got Logseq to work with Obsidian on the same folder.&quot; Lots of new terms in that sentence. He posted a pointer to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.obsidian.md/t/logseq-a-perfect-companion-for-obsidian/10887&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is something like Roam, but it's an open system, where Roam is a silo with lots of lock-in. So we like Obsidian over Roam, instantly -- simply because our tools (yours and mine) have a chance of participating, where Roam, well we can use their outliner, and get locked-in, which I don't see happening any time soon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt; is where we start. Since outlines are in an easily used and open format dating back over 20 years, and can be made accessible to any web-able app (by making them public), it should be possible to &lt;i&gt;easily&lt;/i&gt; hook it up to Obsidian or any similarly open platform. This is a good place to start. Now, this has to be a community thing, because I'm busy working on a new product, and don't want to detour. And that's why we support open formats and protocols, so there are no limits on what users and devs can do. See my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/10/164703.html?title=myNolockinPledge&quot;&gt;no-lock-in pledge&lt;/a&gt;. This isn't new, it's the same idea I've been using since I started developing commercial software, way back with ThinkTank in 1983.</description>

			<description>BTW, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, and this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricserver.scripting.com/users/davewiner/electric/blog.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; it's generated from. Gives you an idea of how a chronologic outline can be turned into a publication. My blog has been running since 1994, and for most of it, I've been writing it in my outliner. I did take a few detours to use other tools I was working on, but realized eventually that the only writing tool for me is the outliner.</description>

			<title>Testing local file system with Logseq</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay I don't know much about either &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Logseq&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=mozilla+local+filesystem&quot;&gt;local file systems&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm just trying it out, starting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. There was a box I clicked on that asked it to connect with the local file system. I was expecting something like localStorage, but it's not, it's better. The files are stored in a folder on my local system. That means they can be used by, or generated by, other apps. Very nice. I'm not sure what Logseq does with them from there, if they can be connected with other apps in some way.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are two screen shots. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. A simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/11/editor.png&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; as I edit it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2.

			<title>My no-lock-in pledge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, I love there's new interest in outlining software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there's too much lock-in in the developing systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is anyone's business who wants to use these systems for collaboration, now or in the future. I may like to use one editor, others may want to use another. Key point: We should be able to collaborate even though we use different writing and organizing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the servers and back-ends, which are so powerful for outliners. They can be used for beautiful tree visualizations, or networks of nodes, presentation slide shows, blogs. There are many different ways of rendering structures created by outliners. You should be able to innovate here without having to write your own outliner! It would be like having to use a different text editor just because you got a new printer. These things should work together. If we've learned one thing about tech over the decades it's that locking people in to using one vendor's tools stops growth. We should compete on the basis of price, performance and features, not lock-in. Users and devs should demand no lock-in. Long-term it means what holds promise now will devolve into a complete mess of things that don't work together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There should be simple APIs to connect any outline editor with any back-end used for storage, graphic displays, data crunching.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I promise that all my editors, storage systems and renderers will be connected through simple, open APIs. There will be no lock-in for users or devs. I challenge anyone developing idea organizing software and back-ends to do the same. Users and developers should demand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Puzzle I saw on Twitter, sorry I don't have the link. Suppose I have three numbers. The second is the square of the first, the third is the square of the second and the first is the square of the third. What are the values of the three numbers? I didn't seen their solution.</description>

			<description>More re &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/08.html#a143741&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; as a candidate for president. We liked the idea of Warren more than we liked Warren herself. I saw her on TV during the campaign, and this idea hit me square between the eyes, she's talking to us like we're in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/&quot;&gt;faculty&lt;/a&gt; lounge at Harvard Law School. Very top down. Center of the universe, only this isn't a good image to project to voters. They want to feel feel understood, which is weird because the candidate is doing the talking. HLS faculty make good &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_schools_attended_by_United_States_Supreme_Court_justices&quot;&gt;Supreme Court justices&lt;/a&gt;, not presidents. We had one with Obama. And he was funnier than Warren. She's got a real mean streak. Not good for someone who wants to lead the Free World. Clearly they understood this problem when she launched her campaign, because they presented her as a down home single mom from Oklahoma. She may have been that at one time, but that's not who she is today.</description>

			<description>The reason &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elizabeth-warren-book-persist-campaign-memoir-2020.html&quot;&gt;Warren's campaign failed&lt;/a&gt; is that once she was the frontrunner and people got a good look at her, they didn’t like her. She’s kind of what you’d expect, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10935/Warren&quot;&gt;Harvard professor&lt;/a&gt;. They do well at the top of academia, but don’t have a popular touch, and I’m being generous. Certainly there was some sexism, people who wouldn't vote for a woman under any circumstances, but she became the frontrunner with everyone aware of her gender. A woman candidate could have won the nomination in my opinion, someone like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar&quot;&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; or Michigan governor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer&quot;&gt;Gretchen Whitmer&lt;/a&gt;. It's ridiculous to conclude that a woman couldn't get the nomination, esp since the Democratic nominee in 2016 was a woman. If Warren wants to be president she's going to have to listen to people outside her bubble. People who will, as they say, speak truth to power.</description>

			<description>When you hear about new strains of Covid that are ripping into India, as an American do you feel as if it's far away and won't affect me? Does it make you want to get vaccinated?

			<description>As a basketball fan this is how I look at where we are with Covid in the US. We have a 2 point lead going into the fourth quarter. Our two star players are out with injuries. Our fans are going home, they think the game is won. I know anything could happen at this point.</description>

			<description>BTW I've heard it asked -- what's the big deal about &lt;a href=&quot;http://artshow.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Art Show&lt;/a&gt; -- I could write it in an afternoon. Well maybe you could (actually no you can't), but that's not the point. The points are this: 1. Art and 2. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader#the-fan-feeds&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; of curators doing it for love. But really it's about #1. It's nice to add art to your life where ever it makes sense. Beautiful images scrolling through the screen of a computer is a good thing, if that's what you like. If my development work ever was about prowess, that part of my life is long-gone. It's something young people worry about. Perhaps a residual part of the mating dance. As you get older, you're constantly reminded that you have no prowess. And gentler things, like appreciating other people's artistic visions, come to the front. So why do Art Show? It's the art, dummy! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The changes happening in the Republican Party are more than disturbing. Given that there have been no charges or arrests of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/05/politics/swalwell-trump-giuliani-brooks-lawsuit/index.html&quot;&gt;political leaders&lt;/a&gt; for instigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, it's fair to assume that it will happen again, and next time it: 1. Might be successful and 2. It will happen with the full support of one of the two major political parties. We are sleeping through this.</description>

			<description>I listened to another Kawasaki podcast, an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/mark-manson/&quot;&gt;Mark Manson&lt;/a&gt;, a deliberately foul-mouthed young man. They talked about people's legacies. I don't doubt that people want to leave something behind, but as I've aged, I've come to an unorthodox view of this. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/&quot;&gt;8 billion&lt;/a&gt; people on the planet, if we all succeed at leaving something of ourselves behind, what a fucking mess that would be! Some of these behind-leavings will cancel each other out. And others will be horribly misguided, they'll be exactly the wrong thing to leave behind. A better approach, imho, is to do things that please you, and others. Be kind. Help people. And whatever is left behind, incidentally, from that all that, is what you leave behind. Don't consciously try to change the world. Just do your thing. I'm not perfect about this. I would like to see what I've written, both in software and prose, survive me. They won't take up a lot of space. And, in all likelihood &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of it will survive me, I'm aware of that. What can I do but shrug? Even so, I'm &lt;i&gt;still diggin!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Next week I'm going to be on Guy Kawasaki's &lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/remarkable-people/&quot;&gt;Remarkable People podcast&lt;/a&gt;. In preparation I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://guykawasaki.com/dr-katy-milkman/&quot;&gt;latest episode&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not surprised that he's an attentive and thoughtful interviewer. I knew &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=guy+kawasaki+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;Guy&lt;/a&gt; when he was chief evangelist at Apple in the early days of the Mac. I was a software developer. He always treated me with respect. He worked for developers as much as he worked for Apple. I remember watching him talk with a developer who was kind of lost, and I was blown away how Guy treated him like a customer. I wonder if Steve Jobs knew how much care he put into his work. He was also one of the most passionate users of my early outliners. I wanted him to know that podcasting was developed the same way the early Mac products we worked on were. A core idea, an audio blog post. Trial and error. See what works. When something does work, do more of it, until four years after we started it, it took off. That so many years later, Guy is loving podcasting, that is so gratifying to me, that someone who connected to my earliest successes in tech, is flourishing with one of my more recent successes. That's how I came to get on his calendar to be interviewed next week. I'd like to talk with him as a developer and a user, I want to learn from his point of view how the product (podcasting) has helped him create. I'm sure we'll talk about why I keep doing this, iterating over new software ideas, over so many decades. That, right there is it. I do it so I can have conversations with smart people who use it, like my longtime friend Guy.</description>

			<description>One more thing. I think Guy would really get a kick out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;Bruce Sterling's talk&lt;/a&gt; in Copenhagen, in 2009. Everything Guy and Dr Milkman said in his latest show has happened in my own life. Big changes in your life are good times to head off in new directions. I've done it a fair number of times myself.  That's what Sterling, a famous science fiction author, was talking about. How to use those big turns in your life, to have a more interesting life.</description>

			<description>Forget about ending the filibuster, it can stay. Instead, expel the congresspersons who backed and continue to back the insurrection. Let’s fight their civil war now, while the military is controlled by the rule of law. Later, it'll be a fairly one-sided affair. Think about it this way. We're getting a breather, a break between storms. Isn't it nice. Would you be willing to fight for this? Well if so, if you don't want to live in an authoritarian country, now's the time to fight. The situation is the most favorable it probably ever will be. We keep missing these windows. And every step it gets harder to put the genie back in the bottle.</description>

			<description>At one point I thought I'd have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;chat app&lt;/a&gt; adjacent to Scripting News, so I wrote a little bot that cross-posted everything I write &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, over &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. Just for fun I took a look at the chatbot, it's still running, and has every post I've written for the last year, including images. It's kind of nice when something you wrote that you never look at just scales up fine. I've written so much software like this over the years. I guess I must like to write software? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The fan art feeds from Twitter are now available as a web app, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://artshow.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;artshow.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;. I think that's about all the work I'm going to do on this project for now. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; will update periodically with more images. I've shared the source for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/app&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that gathers the images and data about the images, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/client&quot;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt; that displays the art in a web browser. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/artDownloader/main/data/art.json&quot;&gt;public JSON file&lt;/a&gt;, part of the repo, that is a list of all the images, so you can create your own apps if you like. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/artshow/&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; doc. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader#the-fan-feeds&quot;&gt;fans&lt;/a&gt; who curate these wonderful art feeds. I love it, and am glad to be able to do a small part to make the art more useful. If you have questions or comments, please open an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/issues/new&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; on the repo.</description>

			<description>Why Facebook must continue to ban Trump. Mitigating damage. If there were a sniper shooting up Times Square, it would be wrong for a bullet-supplier deliver more ammo to him. You might argue bullets are too dangerous to sell to anyone, but with Trump there's no excuse.</description>

			<description>Having written so much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/12/paywallsAreLookingBackward.html&quot;&gt;paywalls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, it was a big deal for me that yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/a-better-way-to-publish-and-read-on-twitter.html&quot;&gt;Twitter announced&lt;/a&gt; that they had acquired &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Scroll%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, a company that was founded to fix those problems, if only enough news publishers agreed. That's the chicken that's waiting for the egg, etc. It's possible that Twitter can make the difference, the same way the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/martinLeavesTheTimes.html&quot;&gt;NYT made the difference for RSS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. That's what gives life to a standard. An entity so central to an economy, like NYT was to news in 2002, getting behind an independently developed format or protocol. With RSS it was an instant hit. It would be better imho if the NYT had bought Scroll and put its subscription function behind it. Would have also made sense for the Washington Post to do it, esp with Bezos as the owner. No question Amazon would know how to monetize this so as to eliminate the stifling ideas of paywalls and subscriptions. But Twitter is what we got. There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/a-better-way-to-publish-and-read-on-twitter.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from them yesterday that spelled out the vision. I wish them, and us, lots of luck, because the current economic system for news is untenable. Maybe Twitter can make the difference.</description>

			<description>One year ago today: &quot;People seem to feel it's over, they see the weather changing, winter is finally over, summer is here,  we must have survived, time to go out and play. That's evolution for you. Of course the virus is still out there hunting us.&quot;</description>
