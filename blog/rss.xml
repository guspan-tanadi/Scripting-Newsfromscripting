			<description>Here's the thing about Twitter. Since they started showing the number of impressions on every tweet, you can see how meaningless the number of followers is. You could have 66.7K followers, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1639404110725402626&quot;&gt;your tweet&lt;/a&gt; might still only get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/25/tweetscreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;764 views&lt;/a&gt;. Once, a long time ago, Twitter was a flow machine. Now it's like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kpbs.org/news/local/2022/11/29/drying-california-lake-to-get-250m-in-us-drought-funding&quot;&gt;dry lakebed&lt;/a&gt;. A void. It looks like Twitter used to look, but looks aren't everything.</description>

			<description>On the dark side, AI is going to be a great tool for 1984-type governments, because with a single script you could rewrite history everywhere. Write people out, and other people in. Kind of like Wikipedia of course, nothing new actually. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW,  please -- someone should offer a package that can load a series of RSS feeds into ChatGPT. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;Node package&lt;/a&gt; I wrote that makes reading a feed as simple as it can possibly be.</description>

I'd like to have that content loaded into ChatGPT so it can be part of the knowledge base. I am a JavaScript programmer. What's the easiest way to get a quick result?&quot; I understand the code, I think -- but I'm no closer to understanding what to do. How do I come up with the prompts? What if I have no prompts, what's the result? They say be careful of the cost, what is the cost based on. I feel lost like I did when I first saw what the web could do, I wanted to know -- how do I set up a node on the next. The answers I got from those in the know made no sense to me, until they did.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know if you read this blog, I've been intrigued and enthusiastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chatgpt&quot;&gt;about ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; as many people have, and specifically am anxious to load up one of these with the content of my blog so I can see what can be learned from the aggregation of what I've written. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have over 25 years of archive, all in &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, a flavor of XML. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course OPML can be converted into any other reasonable XML or JSON-based format. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's all by one author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.com/&quot;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;, covering roughly the same topics for all those years, including pointers to source sites.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For reference, here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; where my archive is stored.

We don't want to become experts in this technology. But we are willing to do the work to get our data in a compatible format.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want to discuss, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/254&quot;&gt;thread here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Fixed a problem in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MtEsrcTTs&quot;&gt;reallysimple package&lt;/a&gt;. It caused FeedLand app to crash, occasionally. Just had to check that something wasn't undefined. I love fixing problems like this. It's how software gets burned in.</description>

			<title>I still use Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/05/30/elephant.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I still use Twitter because it's still basically the same system it always has been, at least from my point of view. I don't see any fascist messages, or antisemitism, or race hate, for some reason -- that everyone else seems to see. I still have longtime friends who I only see here. It still has that annoying character limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also use Mastodon, and it's more interesting all the time, esp when it comes to technical discussions. One thing I don't like about Mastodon culture is it seems to assume Twitter is over, and only terrible people use it. This feels a lot like the political divide in the US and elsewhere. I don't find this is a political thing for me. Maybe I'm too old to give a shit. That's probably it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who say Musk is stupid don't understand how this works. No one who has reached his position in the world is even remotely stupid. Same thing with presidents, or people who reach the pinnacle of accomplishment in anything. There's more to it than you can see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Musk may have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/22/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;screwed with&lt;/a&gt; Tesla's products, but he had the good sense not to screw with the driving experience, which still is like nothing else I've ever loved in a car, and I've had some good cars. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has screwed with Twitter, I guess, but so far it's still Twitter after all is said and done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A cool feature for FeedLand users. When you &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; an item, it's automatically added to two RSS feeds -- one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;your likes&lt;/a&gt;, and one for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/likes/all.xml&quot;&gt;likes of all users&lt;/a&gt; on your FeedLand.It's basically a single-gesture linkblog. There's a lot of that in FeedLand, where things have been factored to a point where they couldn't possibly be simpler. Of course since they're standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, you could follow them from any feed reader.</description>

			<description>The first thing I did when I started at Berkman, twenty years ago, was to get a blogging server up and running. It was 2003, so I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, a product we made at UserLand. It was the first weblog server at any university, in the world. Early days. A few years after I left they converted to WordPress. A solid move both times because by then UserLand had shut down and the default blogging server was the software made by my friend Matt.</description>

It was 2003, so I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, a product we made at UserLand. It was the first weblog server at any university, in the world.

			<title>Don't conflate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you should never do in reporting a bug is conflate two events that might not have anything to do with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have to work to figure out that you're doing this. Esp when a lot of unnecessary info is mixed in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Because theories like this from people who aren't familiar with how the code works behind the scenes (no reason you should be) almost never get this right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You have to boil it down to the minimal number of steps-to-reproduce. Those are facts that are incontrovertible. That one problem caused another? Probably not. In general. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html&quot;&gt;docs page&lt;/a&gt; to answer this question.

			<description>It will be possible to create better teachers out of ChatGPT tech. What led me to that is that it certainly could help people write better bug reports. It would have far more patience than a busy developer, whose job is to fix bugs, not decypher a user's (justifiably) imprecise understanding of how software works. But a chatbot could help, patiently asking the user questions. Then, of course, over time -- the user would learn how to do it themselves, and get this -- they would also learn how software works. There might be some great programmers out there who don't know they are. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I was wondering how I could create something that behaved like an app on the Mac desktop from a page in Chrome. I want to use web Drummer to write docs about something I'm working on in Electric Drummer. It helps to have each in its own window for something like that, rather than switching back and forth between tabs. I was going to post a braintrust query but realized I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/chrome-page-to-app.html&quot;&gt;use ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and get the answer right away. It seems to have worked.</description>

			<title>Register RSS piece</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was the tenth anniversary of Google shutting down their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/15/google-reader-shutdown.html&quot;&gt;Reader&lt;/a&gt; product. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Register had some questions, which I answered via a voicemail, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/15/interviewAnswersForRegister.m4a&quot;&gt;included here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turned into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/14/requiem_for_google_reader/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, which I offered some corrections:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;UserLand Software&lt;/a&gt; no longer exists, I left in 2002, and we shut it down a few years later. I'm just a person now, not part of any company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS 1.0 was not a fork, not sure how you'd characterize it, but it was definitely not a fork. It was a whole new syntax, had no compatibility with RSS 0.91.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS 2.0, which appears to have been left out, was finished in September 2002, and was supported by the New York Times, and thus was supported by the whole news industry and became the standard. Though some disagree, it was backward-compatible with RSS 0.91 and 0.92.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Atom was a new format, again -- not a fork. It gained some popularity and is still in use.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
