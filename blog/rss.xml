			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; was a repeat of Saturday's email. I think the problem was related to the switchover to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/usa&quot;&gt;Daylight Saving Time&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday night. Fingers crossed about tonight's email. If you're reading this at midnight on Tuesday morning, it worked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I found a way to save trees. I bought a pile of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JCG1V42/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;dish towels&lt;/a&gt; and put them on the kitchen counter where the paper towels and paper napkins used to be. When they get dirty, I throw them in the washing machine with the clothes. And re-stack them. And they're nicer to use than napkins.</description>

			<title>About Roam's product</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my correspondents on Twitter, I think I'm starting to figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=roam+research&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roam's&lt;/a&gt; product. I am guessing about some of these things, using the blogger's ethos, put your mistakes out there for everyone to see so you can learn faster. :-) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Roam's world an outline is computed, not stored. There is no &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; file for an outline, as with my outliners. There is a database with blocks of text, and they are connected to other nodes/blocks through links that are represented textually by double-square brackets or with a hashtag as in Twitter. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Roam, the outline hierarchy is a way of browsing the results of a query. I've often thought of this as an interesting way of doing things, and even have an experiment up that I think is Roam-like, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=roam&quot;&gt;thesaurus.land&lt;/a&gt;. It's a way of navigating a database of synonyms, using an outline structure as the presentation format. It works.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you reorganize an outline in Roam? I haven't heard about anyone doing that. This is one of the reasons I'm not sure Roam actually is an outliner. In my world, an outliner has two defining functions: 1. You have control of detail, via expand and collapse and 2. You can reorganize according to structure. The text is on rails. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People expect by entering all their ideas into Roam's database that there will eventually be serendipities, things they will learn by seeing connections they had not seen before. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You are expected to use Roam for all your note-taking. Many people see Roam as a replacement for Evernote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In my world, OPML support is not incidental. Each of my outliners is a church, but the religion is OPML. There is no lock-in in this world. You can use any other tool that can read or write OPML. So when I ask if Roam supports OPML, I'm asking if their product can play with products that are compatible with mine. This is like asking, imho, if a news reader can deal with RSS. With OPML the standard is rock solid. For some reason no one has screwed with it (thankful).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can I use my own editing tools to get my ideas into their database? I don't know. I suspect a developer could create a bridge. Most of my writing is available in OPML. There are lots of examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that holds my blog content starting in May 2017. The rest of it is on the web, and I can provide a zip archive for a developer who wants to try importing all 26-plus years of my blog. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Cuomo, BBC, men, women and hate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why do I write so much about men, women and hate. Because I guess it's taboo, and my life was in many ways formed around dysfunction between genders, and I feel fear when I see a man taken down, fear that it's going to happen to me. I'm pretty sure many other men feel the same, because I've been in places where men can talk privately, and this is a big topic, the fear that our lives will be ruined. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so, I don't think I'm alone as a man who seeks the approval of women. This might be the single driving force in my life, probably going back to birth. I kid you not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I appreciate not being &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=excoriate&quot;&gt;excoriated&lt;/a&gt; for touching this third rail. I tiptoe up to this topic, but then I'm getting older, with less at stake, and the world is crumbling anyway, so why not take a chance. I think there may be a resolution possible, maybe it'll come at the last minute, in time to get us focused on solving the problems we share, not just the ones that divide us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wrote earlier...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just heard, on the BBC, about a book entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Hate-Women-Misogyny-ebook/dp/B08QY6PXX5/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Men Who Hate Women&lt;/a&gt; written by a woman. I don't doubt that there are men who do hate women. On the other hand, I also don't doubt that there are women who hate men. Maybe if we worked on all the hate, what an idea that would be. In the interview the author said that hate speech by men includes the statement that not all men hate women. We always have to be so careful because you never know what's going to be considered hateful. Not hating women and saying so is not hate, imho, it's more like pleading for mercy. To think it's hate is straight out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6146-war-is-peace-freedom-is-slavery-ignorance-is-strength&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;. Further, it's exactly this kind of crap that makes people fear women, because they can ruin a man's life so easily. I've seen it happen. And when it does, it does not, imho, in any way help anyone. It's just more of what you hated about men being applied to men, and probably feeding more hate all around. You can't stop hate with fear. Also: every man had a mother, and early in life that little man was putty in that woman's hands. If you want to fix the problems, and make life better for women, you have to work on women's attitudes too, and help that little dude love &lt;i&gt;himself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/invictus&quot;&gt;Invictus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70118779#:~:text=2009%20%7C%20PG%2D13%20%7C%202h,Watch%20all%20you%20want.&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, a 2009 movie about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela&quot;&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; and rugby in South Africa. It's not an incredibly great movie, but it's worth watching to learn how Mandela treated the whites who oppressed blacks during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid&quot;&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;, which was ended, as Mandela became president. It's hard to summarize the whole philosophy in a short blog post, but I'll try. When you win, try to protect the dignity of the people you defeated, assuming you have to live with them. He would say the women's movement in 2021 is doing it wrong, by aiming to destroy the lives of men. It may make you feel good in the moment, but it's only going to perpetuate the problem, perhaps even make it worse, as the fear becames betrayal because some men who are charged really are innocent, and that turns into the hate we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; want to try to overcome. Everyone suffers when people are abused. I know this first hand, from the experience of my parents and how that was passed down to my generation. The thing to do is to stop all abuse, learn where its roots are, and help people overcome the history that makes them view the world the way they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The thing to do is to stop all abuse, learn where its roots are, and help people overcome the history that makes them view the world the way they do." created="Mon, 15 Mar 2021 14:22:44 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/162043.html?title=cuomoBbcMenWomenAndHate#a142244"/>

			<description>Earlier today the NYT published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/opinion/andrew-cuomo.html&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; about Cuomo &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/14/nytEditorialScreen.png&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The governor has lost his political allies and the public’s confidence.&quot; There's no question about the first part, lots of Democratic office-holders in New York have called for him to resign. But there are no polls that show that he's lost the confidence of the voters. For a few days last week I thought it was over, he should resign, because they're never going to let him be a functioning governor again. But I get an email from him every day, and he's going forward with the business of helping New Yorkers deal with the pandemic. Without him, we'd be as adrift as every other state. So I say, stay in office Governor Cuomo. Let the investigation run its course, let the people see, clearly, what the charges are, and how they're substantiated, and then we'll talk. The idea that such a huge decision that has so much affect on New Yorkers, should be made in a rush, without our participation &amp;mdash; no one has made that case yet. This is our decision to make, collectively. Times editors get one vote, the same as every other voter in New York. And imho, it's wrong for them to say the public is losing confidence and then offer no evidence to back that up.</description>

			<description>I wonder if they have arguments within the NYT Editorial Board about whether or not &quot;the public&quot; is something they can fudge. When they say &quot;the public&quot; is losing confidence in the governor, should they back that up with data, or just say it because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8UZn7PmyXc&amp;t=58s&quot;&gt;feels right&lt;/a&gt; to them.</description>

			<title>Cuomo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone polled New York voters on whether they want Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign? I haven’t seen any results. The journalists and politicians pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; out just like they’re pushing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/13/politics/andrew-cuomo-chuck-schumer-kirsten-gillibrand/index.html&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; out now. Why not have a &lt;i&gt;somewhat&lt;/i&gt; democratic process? Wouldn’t the cause be better served?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why Cuomo matters. First, being fair to everyone matters. And when you see someone rushed off, as is happening with Cuomo, and what happened to Franken, and other people you probably never heard of, this has a nasty side-effect with people who identify with Cuomo and Franken and the others. They think you're going to do the same to them. Some would say if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about. Hah. You know where that comes from. That's the kind of shit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; used to say about people who worried about being purged in one of his un-American trials. It's a common thread, and totally anti-democratic. We believe in due process here, not in mob rule. And what's happening here is mob rule, even if you aren't willing to say so publicly, you know it is. Take a close look at why you're not willing to say it publicly. What does that say about where you live. And what does it say about you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The more they try to rush Cuomo's resignation, the more I want it to stop. I'm a NY voter, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Threadviewer update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Threadviewer is back up. I have to admit to having serious brainfog about this project, but I slowed down, and did some more verbs docs, and just got it working much better than it was previously. Here's the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370863807715762179&quot;&gt;test thread&lt;/a&gt; and here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://threadviewer.com/1370863807715762179&quot;&gt;threadviewer view&lt;/a&gt; of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That should continue to work, even as I post more tweets through the night and into tomorrow (knock wood). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should also reflect any additions and deletions to the thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However after 24 hours, it will disappear. Obviously that's not good! But one step at a time. I want to make sure this much works as I expect it would. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What we want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure we all want the same thing, what's fair, to be ourselves, for people to care about us. I don't think it matters what our identity is, at the core, we're pretty similar. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we have in common is that we believe and share lies about each other. That keeps us isolated and from working with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule I believe is our salvation. Respect the differences, and always when you can, give the benefit of the doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone says someone else is evil, focus on what you know not what they say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why I wanted the vaccine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who I have known for a long time, who I love very much, who is one of the smartest people I know, who I would trust with my life, who says she does not want the vaccine. I have told her I'm going to write about it, without naming her, because the goal isn't to shame her, not even slightly, but rather to explore why I was enthusiastic to receive the vaccination, and to be open about it, to share my thoughts and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, why I wanted the vaccine. The main reason: I was horrified to think of dying alone, suffocating, feeling awful, surrounded by people who were overworked and exhausted. Your body is theirs. Your life is in their hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are harsh places. It's never quiet, the lights are always on, people come and go at all times. You're in pain, weak, and groggy from the meds they give you, and you have to grapple with whatever the future holds for you. I've been there myself, with parents who were gravely ill, this is not a place you want to go in good times, and it most definitely is not a place to be during a pandemic, where the odds of survival, if you're sick enough to be in the hospital, are awful. 1 in 10, say. So you're lying there, feeling terrible, with no one to help your soul through the most difficult thing a person has to do, knowing you're almost certainly not getting out of there alive. The fear of dying that way overwhelms me. I'd do almost anything to avoid it. Take a vaccine, twice? Sure! No problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so what about the other side. Why would you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to take a vaccine. I listened, and skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandemic.solari.com/family-financial-disclosure-form-for-covid-19-injections/&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt; my friend sent. And I thought about it. Conceding that the vaccine makers are all big companies with problems in their history, I also know they went through a vetting process with the FDA, and other regulators elsewhere. Yes, it's possible that the government officials could be bribed, but I honestly don't believe they were. Had it only been the Trump government that was supervising it, I would have been more suspicious than I am now. I'd say I'm 95% confident that the FDA can be trusted, and they say the vaccines can be trusted so that's 95% good enough for me. Considering the risk of the awful death I outlined in the first part, this would be enough for me to risk it. But there's more. Suppose the government was in cahoots with the drug manufacturers, what is the probability that that fact would not leak? That's where my real trust lies. I think most professionals in every profession want to do it well. But in this case, &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; doctor and researcher would have to be in on it. And that's just not possible, imho. The world doesn't work that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As much as I love and trust this friend, I also have a friend who is a biomedical researcher who I've known since he was a little person, five or six years old. A real brat who grew up to be a wonderful friend, who I have been talking with since the beginning of the pandemic. He's now in his mid-30s, and because of his field, had early access to the vaccine. He took it. The question of me not taking it never came up in our talks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I follow lots of doctors' advice. Some of it has been awful and left me with disabilities. Ones that I can live with and are not painful, and ones which are actually hard to live with. So I am very skeptical of the competence of individual doctors. But I also understand that their prescriptions are the result of a huge amount of testing, statistics, cost and risk analysis. With vaccines, they aren't just prescribing a treatment for individuals, I also got the vaccine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is true of all medicine. The drugs we take to control our diseases aren't designed for each of us individually, they are designed for all humans, we are all assumed to be the same, because there's no other sane way to do it. That's why they print the side-effects warnings on the labels, so we know that while this treatment works for most people, for some it will hurt them, and for some it &lt;i&gt;will kill&lt;/i&gt; them. I don't want to die that way either, but I understand statistics and probability and I also understand that I am part of a community, and my health affects yours in a pandemic, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to the story, but this is enough for now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Slow down to hurry up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm juggling too many balls in my development work. I just lost about 24 hours tracking down a problem. I had some code outside of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitter&quot;&gt;davetwitter&lt;/a&gt; module that really belonged in there, so after a half-day of working on something else, I decided to quickly move the code from where it was to where I wanted it. However since I was actively developing the davetwitter module, I included it using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; call to include a copy of the file, without going through NPM; and here's the key thing, in one place, and in another I used NPM. I couldn't understand why a properly initialized config object at startup would all of a sudden be completely uninitialized when I used it later. The answer was there were two davetwitters, one initialized the other not. A sloppy mistake I would never have made in a bootstrap. This kind of thing only happens when factoring. I guess the moral of the story is I should only attempt these integrations at the beginning of the day, when no other project is loaded into my brain, and I'd be more likely to spot these kinds of mismatches. In the end it cost me a lot of time to try to do it quickly. That's a lesson I've had to learn many times, and still am learning. I even have a slogan for it -- &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Someone said tweets are like potato chips and therefore should be limited to 280 chars. I took a few screen shots of tweets that lead to long reads or watches. These are not potato chips. People think of twitter as a home for baby squirrels, this was clever marketing in the beginning, but now it's where the political and cultural world is centered. The former president of the United States was banned from twitter. The potato chip people need to let that sink in. It's a place where real communication happens. The better the tools, imho, the better it works.</description>

			<description>They like to say the apps are better than the web, but I find the opposite is true. When I click a link in the twitter app it doesn’t take me to the web. I don’t have all my tools where ever it is they take me. and When I click a link to a tweet I’m taken to a dead end. Ughh.</description>

			<title>Threadviewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new app is coming soon called Threadviewer, not quite ready yet, hopefully tomorrow. Here's how it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You give it the ID of a tweet that's at the top of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. The app loads all the tweets it can find that are replies to the tweet with that ID, written by the author of the original tweet and shows them inside a box, in chronologic order, as a nice sequence of easy to read paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It does what I need it to do. Now twitter can be a writing space for me that flows into my blog. I also have thread.center if I need it, that goes the other way. BTW, you can use this with WordPress, Medium, Substack, email, whatever you like. It's just copy/paste from the threadviewer rendering. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's an here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/11/aThreadviewerUrl.png&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a Threadviewer URL. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Twitter Thread</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote to be sucked into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Medium was founded in 2012, I was afraid they were going to do to writing what YouTube did to video, what Twitter did to short outbursts. Medium is a nice product, but it was too strong, and too much of a silo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Medium didn't exist I'd have the same fear about Substack, but they are there to keep each other from dominating. And I still hope a more distributed approach appears, esp since running a server these days is getting much easier and cheaper and is only going to get more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder why Medium hasn't directly competed with Substack. It isn't that hard to ad email subscriptions to a product like Medium. Have they done it and I missed it? I would have thought it would be automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with Clubhouse. A bit of a juggernaut. I tried it, was briefly addicted, and then for some reason I lost interest. It was a time-filler, like Twitter is, for example. When I reach a milestone in other work, I take a break by checking out Twitter. You can't do that with Clubhouse. There is no 15 minute Clubhouse break. It's either a few seconds, or an hour. I don't usually have an hour in the middle of the day to goof off, and at night I'm not at the computer and in need of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Twitter is going where Clubhouse is. I'll try it. I think it has a chance because Twitter and Clubhouse really should be more integrated. And Twitter itself doesn't live with the limits outside devs have. They can create connections we can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world somehow has missed that Twitter has a great API, and it runs fast, and they are expanding it, not contracting it. Briefly, when Dick Costolo was CEO, they made a mistake that they quickly corrected, by cutting off certain (but not all) external devs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then they've been very liberal and reliable. I love using the Twitter API. Of course I would love it even more if they got rid of the 280 char limit. I'm usually good at figuring out angles on things in tech, but I have never seen the logic behind this limit, when they allow so many other much more complex data types to be attached to tweets. I would have thought given all their other payload types that by now they would have a 64K or greater limit to the amount of text attached to a tweet&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Ever since Medium was founded in 2012, I was afraid they were going to do to writing what YouTube did to video, what Twitter did to short outbursts. Medium is a nice product, but it was too strong, and too much of a silo." created="Thu, 11 Mar 2021 16:02:30 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#a160230"/>
				<source:outline text="If Medium didn't exist I'd have the same fear about Substack, but they are there to keep each other from dominating. And I still hope a more distributed approach appears, esp since running a server these days is getting much easier and cheaper and is only going to get more so." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="I wonder why Medium hasn't directly competed with Substack. It isn't that hard to ad email subscriptions to a product like Medium. Have they done it and I missed it? I would have thought it would be automatic." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Similarly with Clubhouse. A bit of a juggernaut. I tried it, was briefly addicted, and then for some reason I lost interest. It was a time-filler, like Twitter is, for example. When I reach a milestone in other work, I take a break by checking out Twitter. You can't do that with Clubhouse. There is no 15 minute Clubhouse break. It's either a few seconds, or an hour. I don't usually have an hour in the middle of the day to goof off, and at night I'm not at the computer and in need of distraction." created="Thu, 11 Mar 2021 16:03:32 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#a160332"/>
				<source:outline text="Now Twitter is going where Clubhouse is. I'll try it. I think it has a chance because Twitter and Clubhouse really should be more integrated. And Twitter itself doesn't live with the limits outside devs have. They can create connections we can't." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="The world somehow has missed that Twitter has a great API, and it runs fast, and they are expanding it, not contracting it. Briefly, when Dick Costolo was CEO, they made a mistake that they quickly corrected, by cutting off certain (but not all) external devs." flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#aNaNNaNNaN"/>
				<source:outline text="Since then they've been very liberal and reliable. I love using the Twitter API. Of course I would love it even more if they got rid of the 280 char limit. I'm usually good at figuring out angles on things in tech, but I have never seen the logic behind this limit, when they allow so many other much more complex data types to be attached to tweets. I would have thought given all their other payload types that by now they would have a 64K or greater limit to the amount of text attached to a tweet" created="Thu, 11 Mar 2021 16:05:19 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread#a160519"/>

			<title>Playing with a thread viewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been accumulating tools to use Twitter as a blog-writing tool, for times when I'm not near my desktop the main place I write.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one was a tool that, using the Twitter API, gathered all my tweets in the last 24 hours and categorized them as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Original tweets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Replies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RTs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to get the original stuff first, to give me a way to jot down an idea in Twitter, so I could recall it later when I'm officially writing my blog for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It worked okay, it was great at first actually, but it required too much work to reassemble a twitter thread for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted was a tool that could gather a whole thread, like the one you're reading now, into a series of paragraphs, that could then be edited into a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there was a missing feature in the Twitter API. No way to ask for all the replies to a given tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then a few days ago while my mind was wandering, I figured it out. Get the timeline for the person, and figure out which messages are in reply to the main tweet of the thread, or to one of its replies, and build the thread outside of Twitter that way. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I needed a thread to test it with. Something non-trivial, that could also be somewhat meta. And that my friends is what this thread is for. Thanks for your indulgence! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It worked.

			<description>If Osterholm's analysis is right, and it seems likely, the virus is going to explode again soon. What a difference it would make if we had a leader who could do fireside chats and keep us all directed in the most positive way,  as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Cuomo%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; did last year. Biden is doing the right things, but he doesn't have a good fireside manner. Cuomo was one-in-a-generation. I think that is now impossible. I think ultimately this was a product of very bad judgment on his part and journalism without perspective.</description>

			<title>My kitchen is mine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing happens when woman friends visit. They take over my kitchen. Move things around. Hide them. Put things in places they don't belong. Sometimes I find them years later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got so used to it, and btw angered about it, that I tried to make a deal with my aunt when she and my uncle came to visit when I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California&quot;&gt;Calif&lt;/a&gt;. I said if you tell me why you want to do it, I'll let you. (At least they asked, I think that was probably my uncle's influence, I should have asked him why they asked, usually they don't, they just start doing). Anyway, when I made the offer Aunt Marsha said nothing and went ahead and started cleaning and reorganizing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It. Happens. All. The. Time. And I hate it. I fucking hate it. I tell them this before they do it. I tell them while they're doing it. I warn them, don't mess with the kitchen, after they've done it, and they do it again. Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's what it says to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We like our men incapable of taking care of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You are a man, therefore you cannot take care of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I will do it for you. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now on their side -- I don't think there's much thought to it. I think I am invisible to them. Not a factor. Subconsciously somehow they got the idea that there is no woman who owns this kitchen therefore I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked many times if they would do this to a woman friend, come for a visit and start rearranging and cleaning their kitchen. No one has said yes, but I think some of them actually do it. But most won't because it's such a sign of disrespect. I guess maybe they can see other women. Or they can relate to it, they can imagine how they would feel if their friend tried to take over &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for all men (and neither can you btw) but some of us want powerful and capable women friends. People who have big positive ideas and try to do their part to help. More than anything what we want from women is to be seen as real people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's help each other, and start by giving us all the benefit of the doubt, and assume we mean well and can and want to take care of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token&quot;&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are easy to understand. It's like buying a work of art to hang in your house. Everyone else can have a print. The print is just as beautiful, but the original can possibly appreciate in value. It's controversial because it uses the blockchain (probably the first time I've used that word on this blog) which uses a lot of energy. Isn't there a way to achieve the same without that cost?</description>

			<description>I'm thinking about selling one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/fridayDave.mp3&quot;&gt;my first podcast&lt;/a&gt;s, the one that got the ball rolling, that started my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt; podcasts, and then inspired a community to develop, which caused more podcasts and on and on. People are dismissive of NFTs, and critical, but there's been no other way for a maker of new media types such as myself to get credit for our creations. Looking back, I certainly would have led the bootstrap of podcasting, even if I didn't get credit for it, someone had to do it, we needed to use the internet for audible expression and no one else seemed able to do it. But I'd like young people to know how these things work, they don't have to start companies to make a significant contribution. They can stay in their art.</description>

			<description>It took a while for me to get how common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; is. If someone says, in a discussion, that you're upset, they're gaslighting. It's wrong because: 1. They have no insight into how you feel. 2. They're changing the subject.

			<description>A bit of advice to people who want a vaccine but aren't yet eligable. It pays to hang around places that do vaccinations near closing time, because they're required to get extra vaccines into people's arms, if they don't they're wasted. There are, apparently, lots of cancellations and no-shows in some places, so your chances are  getting better all the time. Just want to be sure everyone knows.</description>

			<title>Virus, Democracy, Climate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our focus should be sharply on these three things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Virus &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Democracy&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Climate&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every other issue is a distant non-priority. Yet of course the news keeps gravitating around things other than the mutating virus and people's refusal to mitigate, how we're going to get our republic back on solid ground, and what are we doing to radically change how we live so we can survive the climate catastrophes that are already here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can find a solution for the problem with Governor Cuomo. Have him wear a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uedata.amazon.com/Smartphone-Powerful-Action-Sports-Camera/dp/B016M99GAW&quot;&gt;head camera&lt;/a&gt; 7 by 24. Every word is recorded, every image, from his point of view. It should be designed like one of those lights coal miners wear, and be streamed live to Facebook and YouTube. Everyone will see and hear everything Cuomo does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we don't need to discuss this any further. Problem solved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Virus, Democracy, Climate. If it doesn't have anything to do with these, it's a distraction. Distractions are necessary so we don't go insane. But understand that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I would say you would do well to develop a Manchin-Sinema rule on getting around the filibuster as it relates to race and civil rights.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“You can’t filibuster the budget. That’s why we have reconciliation rules. We need to have civil and voting rights reconciliation. That should have had reconciliation permission a long, long time ago.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;“If the headlines were to read that the John R Lewis Voting Rights Act was filibustered to death it would be catastrophic.”&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
