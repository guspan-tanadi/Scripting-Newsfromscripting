			<description>In all media I want to pay for what I use. Instead everything is priced flat rate, itâ€™s all pretty much a ripoff. I have Hulu, Disney+, YouTube TV, Netflix, AppleTV+, Amazon. I mostly just watch news and sports. I pay a lot of money for nothing. It's as ridiculous as with new websites. As a user I want an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/06/133617.html?title=moneyForNews&quot;&gt;EZ-Pass&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if people from the cities migrated to places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/wyoming_rb/&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/idaho_rb/&quot;&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, where very few people vote, yet they have two senators and extra &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College&quot;&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; oomph. Might not even be too late for the November election in some states. And btw, Zoom works in Wyoming too. It's almost like a bug fix for the Constitution. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/podcasts/the-daily/nba-coronavirus-basketball.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; explains what it's like for a reporter inside the NBA bubble. Totally worth listening to. But as with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a162754&quot;&gt;last Daily&lt;/a&gt; I listened to, it has a significant error. At the end they say that what the NBA has done is too expensive to replicate elsewhere, but -- it's not true. The NBA is doing what China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Iceland, Singapore, Vietnam did. How did I learn about this? From the Daily podcast, in repeated interviews with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Donald+McNeil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. An NBA-style bubble can be as large as the US.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/aPodcastToProgressives.m4a&quot;&gt;A podcast to progressives&lt;/a&gt;. This was the convention for all Americans who want to fight the virus and keep the Constitution. We know for a fact that progressives want this. We have to appeal to people who may be on the fence. &lt;i&gt;The DNC was a commercial. &lt;/i&gt;Marketing. It wasn't there to make you feel heard. Personally I think to fight the virus we'll need to have single payer soon after Biden takes office. There may never be a moment where you hear from everyone that you were right. You'll have to find the glory within yourself.</description>

This will not end well. Don't centralize technology whose main power is decentralization. But there's no law against it. Maybe it's a business model. And no I don't care if users want it.</description>

			<description>Sometimes you have something to say but it's a general thing, not about one specific instance. For example, someone could come up with yet another exhausting attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.c2.com/?NotInventedHere&quot;&gt;re-invent&lt;/a&gt; RSS without saying that's what it is. The tech world is littered with them. Each one is a bad idea. But I'm not going to call out any specific one, that's not practical. I'd be saying it all the time.</description>

			<title>Biden nailed it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's DNC went by quickly. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1296681978029322241&quot;&gt;funny&lt;/a&gt;. The speakers spoke warmly of Joe Biden, including Bernie Sanders. Everything was great until the moment Biden stepped up to speak. His first few sentences were awkward, the words were vague and muffled. I started to get up from the chair, not wanting to listen. I thought I'd clean up and go to bed, but I decided that I have to sit through this, so I did, and I was quickly riveted and glad to hear him touch on all the important points, ones that no one had made through the week. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until that point I thought Michelle Obama's speech was the best. I thought Barack Obama's was weak. I don't think the Constitution is the strongest appeal, it's the lack of leadership, we're all left to fend for ourselves against a virus that's killing huge numbers of Americans. We could deal with a little authoritarianism, I feel, if it was in the cause of saving our lives. The fear isn't rooted in the 170K Americans who have already died, it's the next 170K and the ones after that. We all want to survive this. With Trump in for four more years, our chances of not being destroyed by the virus are zero. I think that is by far the strongest appeal. And until Biden, amazingly, in four days of the DNC, no one had made it. He didn't quite make it explicitly either, but he came pretty close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I often feel there's this divide between our leaders and the people. And I don't kid myself, the divide is there between Biden and us too. All the stories about how he gave people his phone number, or sat down and talked for hours with a random person, those are touching for sure, and even if they are real, I know he'll never call me. It was the equivalent of having a beer with Bush or shooting hoops with Obama. I wish one of these politicians had a practical vision -- of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;political social network&lt;/a&gt; that mobilized us 365 days a year, every year, not just when there's an election. Biden is not that person, nor is Kamala Harris. When they're elected they will govern like Obama did, and will be vulnerable to the same Republican sabotage that he was. But. Biden was not awkward. His speech was more a fireside chat than a DNC acceptance speech. Yes, I am convinced he is on our side, relative to the current president. A low bar for sure, but it grabs me emotionally, also physically, cheering, sobbing. It would be such a relief, on Election Day, to find we had come together and elected Biden and Harris in such large numbers that everyone will see what a fool Trump is, even his most vocal supporters, and we'll tell him to STFU, with one voice, and just retire in disgrace to his bunker in Russia. It's a dream I allow myself to have. And it was supported by Biden's speech last night. That's political speech at its best. It was a good thing I sat my butt back down and listened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a dream I allow myself to have. And it was supported by Biden's speech last night. That's political speech at its best. It was a good thing I sat my butt back down and listened." created="Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:32:13 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/27/bidenActionFigure.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/132553.html?title=bidenNailedIt#a133213"/>

			<description>I wonder why the DNC didn't create an actual crowd for one or two speeches. It can be done safely. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4&quot;&gt;eulogy&lt;/a&gt; Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Maybe they'll create such an event tonight for the presidential nominee. I went to Obama's acceptance speech in Denver in 2008 in a football stadium. Quite an event.</description>

I'm sure they've thought it through, but next year we'll know a lot more about living with the virus than we do now. Look at how much we've learned in the last six months. Net-net, we'll do better in terms of human lives, if we give it more time. Work up to it slowly. Maybe have conferences on campus but do everything else online. Create projects for people to do collaboratively. I know the economics are dismal. But I think it's better if universities die to keep students alive rather than the other way.</description>

			<description>Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/podcasts/the-daily/dejoy-postal-service-trump.html&quot;&gt;Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about Trump and the USPS. They present something as theory that I'm pretty sure is fact, that Trump is trying to and quite possibly succeeding at making the postal service incapable of doing its part in the November 3 election. Also, they got an important fact wrong, if this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/trump-mailboxes-sorters-usps-2020-election-louis-dejoy-20200816.html&quot;&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. The author of the NYT story, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/by/luke-broadwater&quot;&gt;Luke Broadwater&lt;/a&gt;, said that disabling by-mail voting would not hurt Democrats more than Republicans. On the other hand, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png&quot;&gt;Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt;, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. &lt;b&gt;Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. &lt;/b&gt;So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction.</description>

On the other hand, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/19/votingByMailPlans.png&quot;&gt;Inquirer story&lt;/a&gt;, Republican voters have been warned by Trump not to vote by mail, and apparently are heeding the advice. &lt;b&gt;Only 18% of Repubs are expected to vote by mail vs 59% of Democrats. &lt;/b&gt;So if Trump could disable the post office, it seems that would ensure his re-election. If the Daily got this wrong, the whole of today's podcast requires some kind of correction." created="Wed, 19 Aug 2020 16:27:54 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a162754"/>

			<description>I finished John Barry's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. I would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; recommend it, if your goal is to learn as much as you can about the pandemic itself. In the afterword, Barry explains why the book isn't really about the pandemic, it's about how scientists collaborate. He used the pandemic as an example. I had pretty much already figured that out. So much information about the lives of the individual scientists. It went on and on. I skipped whole chapters. Now, I like a good story as much as anyone, but nothing about his tale made me care about them as people. And that isn't why I picked up the book. I want to learn as much as I can about influenza pandemics, because I'm living in the middle of one. To his credit, the book was published 15 years ago, long before Covid-19. I'm going to keep looking for a book that focuses on the science.</description>

			<description>BTW, then as now the government lied about the disease. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who has since had his reputation somewhat cleaned up, was apparently not a very great president. Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video&quot;&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu. He theorizes that the terrible deal that Germany got was due to Wilson's flu, and if he had not gotten ill, maybe Germany wouldn't have gone fascist? The same story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/woodrow-wilsons-case-of-the-flu-and-how-pandemics-change-history&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker earlier this year. He also says the flu resulted in Wilson's stroke and disability. Perhaps a cautionary fact for our current president. Also interesting that there is no mention of &quot;influenza&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for Wilson! Amazing. I wonder how Trump's epitaph will read? I expect Covid-19 will be prominent.</description>

			<title>Mouse invasion</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I've had two of mouse invasions in my car. One where a mouse chewed through a vent in my air conditioner, and the latest where a family of mice made a nest in the air conditioner and then proceeded to die! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ay ayay.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had the mouse family cleaned out by the local Subaru dealer, but the smell lingers, and now I have to figure out what to do. It's not a nice problem to have! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I know some are in dismay because the Democrats are appealing to Republicans, but they are doing the right thing. It's so much more important what we agree on than what we disagree about. We agree in the Constitution and government of laws. Right now, in 2020, that's what matters most. Later we can re-divide on issues, but right now, we have to organize for one thing: America.</description>

			<description>I was sure that last night's virtual DNC was going to suck, but quite the opposite, it was riveting, great political TV. I can't wait for tonight's episode. Michelle Obama, the closer, was masterful. I hadn't heard anything from her since her last DNC speech. Imagine what watching Trump has been like for her. She knows how demanding the job is. She was generous with Trump and said he wasn't up for the job. Such an understatement. And she threw his &lt;i&gt;It Is What It Is&lt;/i&gt; line back at him. Kind of what you might say giving Trump's eulogy (since that's what he had to say about 150K American deaths he's responsible for). Great speech. Now tonight we get Bill Clinton. He gives great DNC. I've heard him speak in person a few times. Get ready. It's going to be something. But. The most powerful speech of the night was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKrDMEvvNzU&quot;&gt;Kristin Urquiza&lt;/a&gt;. In case you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it, because there's one line in it that will stay with you, but you should hear it from her, the way she says it. Her father, a Trump supporter, died of the virus. The speech isn't long. Be sure not to miss it.</description>

			<title>Adams Farms in Kingston</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two reasons to live in this area. Blueberries and Adams marinara.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My mother would have turned 88 on Thursday. She was always on my case to eat more blueberries. She would be happy to know that I am. Esp this time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I live in blueberry country. It's peak blueberry season. I bought these at &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/locations/kingston/&quot;&gt;Adams in Kingston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries in season.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every place has one of these groceries. In New Orleans it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.langensteins.com/&quot;&gt;Langenstein's&lt;/a&gt;. In Menlo Park, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.draegers.com/&quot;&gt;Draeger's&lt;/a&gt;. In Woodside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertsmarket.com/&quot;&gt;Roberts&lt;/a&gt;. In the Hudson Valley -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/&quot;&gt;Adams&lt;/a&gt;. They make a lot of their own stuff. They get the best products. They have a farm where they grow a lot of the produce they sell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now we have peaches and all kinds of berries, local grown, fresh and delicious. In September that's when the apples arrive. Huge boxes of them. It's something to behold. New we have blueberries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I'm telling you, their marinara sauce is the best. I know Adams is not an Italian name. But somehow they figured it out. Very fresh and delicious in every way. Previously my favorite marinara was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/San-Marzano-Pomodoro-Marinara-Sauce/dp/B00CXA1J14/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw-O35BRDVARIsAJU5mQUhOqC-6Uu6FYC5Tmcpcida0mGpAZxQZKZrdG5feJIzaeQsshg62_0aAp9uEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=232499064174&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1023511&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=7378444453978147064&amp;hvtargid=kwd-383386643679&amp;hydadcr=4846_9629179&amp;keywords=san+marzano+marinara&amp;qid=1597765390&amp;sr=8-3&amp;tag=googhydr-20&quot;&gt;San Marzano&lt;/a&gt;. Very good. But Adams is better imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Adams marinara.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
