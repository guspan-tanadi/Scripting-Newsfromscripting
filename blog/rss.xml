			<title>The internet of social media apps</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a user, I no longer want to have to visit five sites to see what's new. I no longer want to have to copy/paste my writing into those same five sites. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each social net we belong to should have a feed coming out of it, virtually or for real, that contains a stream of all messages from accounts I'm subscribed to. How they do it behind the interface is up to each network, as with TCP/IP. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each network must present the same highly-factored easy to support and impossible to break API with libraries for all major platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's up to each platform, or independent developers working on its behalf, to adapt their native protocol to the internet format. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also -- see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/04.html#a145706&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I did on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I want Bluesky to go away</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I definitely want Bluesky to just go away. I don't like it because if it gains traction it has potential of replacing Twitter as the festering turd in the middle of what should have been a vibrant growing market that keeps anything else from rising in competition with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To people who say &quot;Oh Dave but it's federated and it has an open protocol&quot; -- yes I've heard that, but there are all kinds of games you can play, such that even if it's true (and so far it isn't), no competitor ever rises, or as soon as they do, they are foreclosed on. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't like it because it's Jack Dorsey. You say &quot;Oh Dave but Jack is just a board member&quot; to which I say oh please, I wasn't born yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this Jack-induced nightmare is for: 1. It to fail quietly and 2. Jack to sit the fuck down and do something other than plant huge turds in the middle of what should be a vibrant thriving open market, which means there are lots of entrants, choice, and opporunities for cooperation and innovation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If having a license from &lt;i&gt;The Jack&lt;/i&gt; is a requirement, well we've already wasted 17 years on Twitter waiting for that to become something wonderful and it's fair to say now that it never did and never will, so Jack please enjoy your wealth and play somewhere else and leave Twitter and post-Twitter alone. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also -- see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/04/142200.html?title=internetSocialMediaApps&quot;&gt;The Internet of Social Media Apps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Knicks won. The series is now tied 1-1. They were losing until the very end of the game when a couple of bad calls went our way (truth), but also -- our passes were finding the open man, and the shots were going down. I tried to watch the beginning of the next game, the Lakers vs the Warriors, but I just couldn't get the energy. Instead I watched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSG_Network&quot;&gt;local station&lt;/a&gt; postgame coverage of the Knicks. It was fun to see them so excited. They have a star, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt&quot;&gt;Monica McNutt&lt;/a&gt;, who is so cool, I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/03/monicaMcnutt.png&quot;&gt;watch her&lt;/a&gt; talking about jello and oatmeal and find it fascinating. It's sad that the men on MSG don't seem to see her, but someone there must get she's the future and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pidto&quot;&gt;little troll&lt;/a&gt; is funny as long as he shuts up after repeating himself once or twice. I will watch the next Lakers game, hoping they lose in a horrific way. I think LeBron should step aside. And hey it was great to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/05/02/carmelo-anthony-gets-garden-ovation-at-knicks-heat-game-2/&quot;&gt;Melo welcomed&lt;/a&gt; so warmly at the Knicks game. We will always love Melo. Finally thank goodness there isn't another Knicks game until Saturday. I need some time to process the possibility that the Knicks &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be going to the conference finals.</description>

It's a couple of years old and the battery doesn't hold a charge very well. So I decided to treat myself to a new mini, and since there's a new version, the 6th generation, I went for that. I also decided to get 64GB instead of the 256GB I have on the current one, because these days most of the video I watch is streamed, not downloaded, and I don't use that much space, or so I thought. After four attempts to transfer the contents of the old iPad to the new one, each one taking hours, I gave up. The design of the transfer app is terrible. You have to be there for the whole process, because it asks questions after long pauses. It doesn't do enough preflighting. So it takes an hour before it decides it can't do the transfer because the old one has too much data for the new one. I hoped they would do something smarter than just refusing to do the transfer. I don't really care if it moves any of the movies or audio files. What matters is that it correctly moves the apps and the configuration data for the apps, the stuff that takes a huge amount of time to do manually. In the end, I realized this wasn't any fun, and remembered how Steve Jobs obsessed over the unwrapping experience of new Apple products, and felt sad that Apple didn't hold on to that value very well. Instead I'm going to buy a 5th gen iPad Mini from Amazon and save a hundred dollars. I won't be able to do a trade-in, so maybe I'll find a deserving person to send my old iPad to instead. Or maybe I'll just stick with the old mini until its battery completely fails.</description>

Instead I'm going to buy a 5th gen iPad Mini from Amazon and save a hundred dollars. I won't be able to do a trade-in, so maybe I'll find a deserving person to send my old iPad to instead. Or maybe I'll just stick with the old mini until its battery completely fails." created="Wed, 03 May 2023 11:57:00 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/03/ipadMini.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/03.html#a115700"/>

Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison are obvious. The only one I'm pretty sure isn't wigged is Tom Petty, and it's &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; that's a very good wig. I don't believe that's Bob Dylan's real hair, and I am absolutely sure at some point Paul McC switched to a wig, and I think there's a pretty good chance George Harrison is wearing one as well. (My father was convinced &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the Beatles were wearing wigs in 1964!) Not that there's anything wrong with wigging, esp if your appearance is a big part of your product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/03/wilburies.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_Wilburys&quot;&gt;The Traveling Wilburys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Here's something maybe to not look forward to. Next time you call for customer service, you will speak with one of ChatGPT's cousins. It will sound like a human, but will be clear it's not. Beg for mercy from a machine, a machine that's programmed to sound like they care, while being obstinate. Just try and cancel a subscription to the NY Times.</description>

			<description>Watching last night's NBA playoff game, the announcer would say if a shot went in or spun out of the basket before it's clear, visually, which way it was going. Is this a deliberate delay of the video feed, or a technical glitch somewhere in the network?</description>

			<description>Succession spoilers, don't read. I love how the Swede calls the Roy brothers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/02/tribute-band-definition.html&quot;&gt;tribute band&lt;/a&gt;. When you watch the newest episode a second time, you realize that they have something, each of them. Kendall is creative, and is a Steve Jobs type showman who can think on his feet. Shiv is a plotter, networker and manager. Roman is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/02/meaning-of-machiavellian.html&quot;&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/a&gt; monarch. They don't necessarily let scruples get in their way. Each of them has part of Logan's personality, and all are good at it, they just didn't necessarily know while he was alive, trying to exist in his shadow. This epside is where the turned from klutzes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk&amp;t=265s&quot;&gt;serious people&lt;/a&gt; perhaps with potential for greatness. And Tom fits in there too, we find out in the last scene of the most recent episode. I like that. I identify with Tom.</description>

I got an idea how this could work when I chose a codename for a new product using ChatGPT to make suggestions. It led me to a new more creative approach and I think a more interesting name. I hope it learned from what I did and may help other people choose names in the future. I just did an outline for the project and I'm not sure how I would give it to my friend the bot. We used to think of uploading our brains to computers, well isn't that what I'm doing now? It's a level or two above what I do with GitHub, but a similar idea. You can see how my brain works, either way. I'm making an effort to leave that as something others might learn from in the future.</description>

His two major concerns, as outlined in the article are that people might lose jobs, and not just menial jobs, and we might have a hard time finding out the truth. Another concern is that the bots will be fighting wars on our behalf, as we have seen in many science fiction stories over the generations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is already smarter than humans because it has a non-zero attention span, and isn't trying to promote its own career and has no conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you ask a human a question, the answer will probably just be a canned &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/schpiel-definition.html&quot;&gt;schpiel&lt;/a&gt; they have memorized based on hearing a keyword in what you said. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it isn't much of a leap to say someday the bots may be smarter than humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The better conclusion is that humans better get our shit together start using our intelligence because the competition is here and it's already better than we are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, for years I've been trying to find an explanation of the difference between rain and showers in weather forecasts. I asked ChatGPT and it patiently &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/rain-vs-showers.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. I asked thousands of humans and the answers I got were either vague or wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Obviously I agree, because it's the truth, and this is how I responded..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Adam -- as you know we've been having this discussion for years. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Companies like Google, Amazon, Spotify etc don't care, they'll  call a cheese sandwich a podcast if they want to. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the end, the word may come to mean nothing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Same thing happened with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;unconference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand -- a lot of people believe they have choice in what client software they use to listen to podcasts, and that will do more to enforce the standard than either you or I.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/01/rss-2-0-required-for-podcast.html&quot;&gt;it agrees&lt;/a&gt;, no feed, not a podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I don't know why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=APwXEdcOwGFDjBPP42XyUZlduM0RyUQPmA:1682943817050&amp;q=cheese+sandwich&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigopGjjtT-AhWkhIkEHa48A9UQ0pQJegQIDBAB&amp;biw=1443&amp;bih=1058&amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;cheese sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; are so funny, but they are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
