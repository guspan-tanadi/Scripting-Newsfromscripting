They think there's a chance we might wake up and do the easy thing to neutralize them, by adding more members to the court. So they have to get it all in on the off-chance we might get smart. What's next is probably going after the presidential election, to give states the right to override their voters' choices.</description>

			<description>I know 89 percent of you don't care about the NBA, but please don't even think of moving &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1542581090812149767&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; to the Knicks. I can't imagine where he could possibly go. Maybe somewhere in the midwest like Denver or Dallas. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-kevin-durant-requests-trade-from-nets-185500155.html&quot;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; to try to fill the shoes of the great Chris Paul. Maybe he and Russell Westbrook and James Harden could get back together somewhere to finish up their careers. Or maybe the Clippers. I'd like the Knicks to please turn the other way. No he's not welcome in NY. Thank you. I bet he thinks he's going to Boston. That would be a huge mistake imho. Maybe he can play in Europe or China. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Durant&lt;/a&gt;, no matter how good he is choked twice. He didn't fit in Golden State, and what a fiasco in Brooklyn which anyone could see coming. Maybe he could take a sabbatical or a gap year to see the world. I think he'll be boo'd in every NBA city. I guess I could be wrong about that. Cleveland or Miami might want him.</description>

			<description>We've been at war for all these years, without being very conscious of it, and the enemy just took over. We're only beginning to realize we have to fight back now with everything we have. We didn't defend the victories. New generations came along and took for granted that we couldn't go backwards. In fact I'm pretty sure it hasn't sunk in yet for most.</description>

			<description>I bought a relatively cheap office chair that I really liked. Fit me really well, and elevated me high off the floor which is comfortable for me. But yesterday one of the arms on the chair broke off. Just like that. I thought no big deal, I'll get used to it. No. It doesn't work that way. I spend so many hours each day in this chair, the missing arm throws me off balance, sometimes literally. Almost fell off the damn thing a couple of times. I have another much more expensive chair (older) that I hate. I tried using it. No not going to do that. So I ordered a new cheap replacement. Even the littlest things matter it seems. Of course I have to assemble these things and I hate that part. So many opportunities to screw it up (I think that's the problem with the older chair btw).</description>

			<description>BTW I always put &quot;web3&quot; in double quotes because it's an illegitmate name and hugely disrespectful. You shouldn't get to self-declare yourself the 3rd coming of something as hugely significant as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&quot;&gt;world wide web&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think we should have used the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0&quot;&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, but don't blame me for that one.</description>

			<description>Scienceites have an effectionate name for ourselves, but it's not really printable. Let's see if I can telegraph it. We didn't have a football team, but we did have a math team. We had a computer in the early 70s when I went there, which was amazing. A block away was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School&quot;&gt;DeWitt Clinton High School&lt;/a&gt; which was all-boys and definitely had a football team. We were under no illusions about who would win if we fought, so they didn't pick on us. Sort of an honor thing, I guess. Anyway we called ourselves (and as far as I know still do) The Science Fa**ots. Maybe they &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; say it these days, this was before political correctness. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Biden is keeping the seat warm for DeSantis. Unless he steps aside after the November election and lets the next gen of Dems duke it out. I'd like to see the governors of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/18/140211.html?title=whatPeopleWantInAPresident&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/06/28/1107881079/michigan-abortion-gretchen-whitmer&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in the mix.</description>

			<description>My blogging ethos came from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Catalog&quot;&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/a&gt;. They moved from technical howto-type stuff to whatever was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand&quot;&gt;SB's&lt;/a&gt; mind. If the ideas come from the same mind, and the pub is a product of that person's mind, it's perfect. I remember reading it at my uncle's house in Florida, totally off the grid little geodesic he made himself. I loved the Whole Earth book because it seemed like my uncle. an engineer and hippie. He was another big influence in my path to eclectic, jumping where my mind wanted to go, even if it took years.</description>

			<description>One of the miracles of the web. I sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1541813885870788608&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; to Heather Cox Richardson, and she responded. Even though I'm not a historian. I love it when the quality of an idea makes a difference, not the qualifications of the person asking the question.</description>

			<title>Can I have a TLD please?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/register-domain-name-2017-06-20-en&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that companies can register and run &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain&quot;&gt;TLDs&lt;/a&gt;, I've been somewhat obsessed by the idea of running one myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea, a TLD for the feed-o-sphere. I'd like to have a feed named &lt;i&gt;dave.feed.&lt;/i&gt; When you access my domain it returns the content at a URL you specify and can change. So where ever I may be blogging today, you may find my feed at that address. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the questions are basically: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How much money does it take, up front and periodically? Who gets the money? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How much time does it take to apply for the TLD, and what are the requirements to be approved?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you make a TLD non-profit, and does that affect the cost?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it only for companies or can individuals register TLDs?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What questions have I missed?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/236&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on my blog's repo to discuss, or you can respond &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1541872442024550403&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but I'd prefer on the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Not &lt;i&gt;dave.rss.&lt;/i&gt; I tried that for a while and got all tied up in a revolutionary movement in India, or something like that. No thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>An analog for software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect analog for the software we develop. We strive to make it simple, but under the covers the simpler it is the harder it is to master. After a while you can't add more functionality without breaking it every time you make a change. So the challenge to make more powerful software is to invent ways to simplify what's going on behind the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Simple user interface, complexity behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note: This illustration came from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SharadBishnoi05/status/1540552557856161792&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SharadBishnoi05&quot;&gt;Sharad Bishnoi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Roe v Wade overturned</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Roe v Wade &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0&quot;&gt;overturned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/24/theDemocratsAreLame.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: The Democrats are lame, that's also a problem, just as bad at the Repubs being Putinites. I struggled with when RBG &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/09/18/100306972/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-champion-of-gender-equality-dies-at-87&quot;&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;, it was Sept 18, 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP4lFtw0Hfo&quot;&gt;This ad&lt;/a&gt; is no longer a cautionary tale. It's the new reality. America.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1540412748630310912&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/a&gt;: I wish the Dems had prepared for this moment. They had the time. The best they can come up with is &quot;Vote?&quot; Really. We voted Obama into the presidency and he let the Repubs steal a judge from us. What good does voting do if the people we elect won't fight!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1540500062358454275&quot;&gt;Poll&lt;/a&gt;: Is the Supreme Court a terrorist organization?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1539955224617566208&quot;&gt;Poll&lt;/a&gt;: Have you or a sexual partner had an abortion?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should consider ignoring the Supreme Court from now on. Declare the Constitution defunct, and go on from there. One side respecting the Constitution and the other side ignoring it is not a workable situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Politically, tag every Republican candidate for *anything* with this decision. It's a referendum on freedom. The Repubs, each and every one of them, are on the wrong side of this. Make them defend it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you haven't seen it yet, now's the time. The last minute.  This is what the majority said: Basically the right to an abortion is nowhere in the Constitution. If you want a right to an abortion, get Congress to pass a law. Or, I suppose it could have been more extreme, that the reason it isn't in the Constitution is the same reason murder isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't know, I'm the furthest thing from a legal scholar. But we have entered a new reality, leaving one where almost everyone alive today came of age in a world where abortion was safe and legal, trying to deal with the consequences of that no longer being true. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, how do we respond to the idea that anyone in NYC could be carrying a concealed weapon. Someone might bump into you on the street and draw a handgun and someone else could draw one too, and there would be a shootout on 5th Ave in broad daylight and there wouldn't be a law you could pass that would prevent it, that wouldn't ultimately be struck down by the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what hasn't changed and must, first, before anything else can really. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've written about this at length. It should be the people's party, and that means organizing the people every minute of every day of every year. Our political parties used to be machines for getting people elected, and that worked when both parties agreed the role of government was to govern, but that hasn't been the case since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need a party that spans all political ideaologies. We're already seeing this happen, it was predicted on this blog years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney&quot;&gt;Liz Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, everyone agrees, is a gift from god. A possible savior of our sanity. And she's probably okay with people carrying guns in Manhattan or not having sex so they don't need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepLizCheney/status/1540361645159055360&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah she's crazy all right. But she's our kind of crazy, &lt;i&gt;American&lt;/i&gt; Crazy. Not Putin Crazy (which is what the Republican Party is now).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, when the Repubs have gone Russian, the Democratic Party as it was previously conceived no longer works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this at some length in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;The Getting-Shit-Done Party&lt;/a&gt;, May 4, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It shouldn't be 6-3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court shouldn't be 6-3. At worst it should be 4 conservatives, 3 liberals and 2 moderates. That is, if two Democrats had behaved rationally and with courage. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;President Obama. He didn't have to accept what the Repubs tried to do to Merrick Garland. He could have waited a decent amount of time for the Senate to advise and consent, and assume they consented, and walked Garland, himself (with the Secret Service) over to the Supreme Court to take his seat. Who would've stopped them?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Justice Bader Ginsburg. Yes we love her, but.. She was sick, and the chances of her dying were too high for her to stay on the court past Obama's tenure. Then Obama would've nominated a moderate like Garland, and gone through the same process of walking the new Justice to the Court himself with the Secret Service.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;4-3-2 is a pretty good configuration, so much better than the 6-3 disaster we're dealing with now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
