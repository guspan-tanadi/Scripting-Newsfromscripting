			<description>This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gen.medium.com/i-lived-through-collapse-america-is-already-there-ba1e4b54c5fc&quot;&gt;best thing I've read&lt;/a&gt; today. It says when collapse happens you might not notice. We are post-collapse in the US, the author says. You know what, I believe it. &quot;I used to judge those herds of gazelle when the lion eats one of them alive and everyone keeps going â€” but no, humans are just the same. Thatâ€™s the real meaning of herd immunity. Weâ€™re fundamentally immune to giving a shit.&quot;</description>

			<description>Remember Romney's &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/M2gvY2wqI7M&quot;&gt;47 percent speech&lt;/a&gt; to Republican donors. The nice Republican. They really think this way. Do they think you should live? Probably not. A waste of resources. You just want handouts. Repub dogma: 47 percent of the people are disposable.</description>

			<description>The House could still impeach Trump to halt the ratification of the new Supreme Court justice. And the Democrats, assuming they take power in January, can increase the size of the court to whatever they want. Of course the Repubs will scream bloody murder and the press will repeat that, with volume, because it's an exciting story. And we know the Dems can't stand that. Look what they did to Al Franken. Concerned they would be called hypocrites by the Repubs, itself an act of total hypocrisy, they destroyed his career which was going pretty well, you'd have to say. One of the most eloquent Democrats in a party that has trouble finishing sentences, much less whole thoughts.</description>

			<description>Trump's Taxes is not a horse race story. The questions it raises -- 1. Can a president so deeply in debt concentrate on his job, and 2. When making a decision can he focus on the needs of the country over his own needs?</description>

			<description>Tim Bray &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/09/25/Subscription-Overload&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; how subscriptions don't work for news. All readers know this. Since people in news orgs must read other pubs, they must know it too. We need a meter on our browsers, a set of prefs we easily control, a max budget, a special offer to subscribe when it makes economic sense. Create an &lt;i&gt;easy path to subscribing, &lt;/i&gt;not the brutal wall that interrupts you at exactly the wrong moment. We can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/16/133627.html?title=newsHasBeenUnbundled&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; a rational system for news that grows. The web should be a fantastic way to get news, not the repetive junky stuff we get now, but news with real nutrient value. We're stuck and don't need to be.</description>

			<description>I suggested a few years ago that one of the networks move one of their evening shows to Michigan or Ohio, just to shift the perspective a bit. It would work. Probably one of the most revolutionary things they could do, and it's so easy.</description>

			<description>There's some good news about Covid-19 that you don't see in the news -- eventually it will become less deadly. Most viruses in that family do, the virus mutates, and a strain that kills fewer victims comes to dominate, and that process repeats. The virus spreads out to find new victims and over time it weakens. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; ended after two years, with no vaccine, but the virus didn't go away, it became seasonal. It still pops up, to this day, but it's nowhere near the problem it was in 1918. That will probably happen with Covid-19 too.</description>

I made it, I own it, I can make it do what I want. It's the feeling in a young man's heart.</description>

			<title>Shake yourself up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people are trying to get past Covid and Trump without making radical changes to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend asked what could he do to combat fascism. This is it. Do something to radically shake up your life, by choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Each of us are trying to reboot as if taking a box, without changing its shape, and moving it across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; going to change. If we emerge from these days, the world will be very different. We have to be different too. We have to be prepared for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At some point you have to ask was the shape really the right shape, and what would I give up by changing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Radical change. Quit your job. Give your car away. Jump out of a plane. Get a sex change. Destroy your business model. Say something unthinkable. Whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm reminded of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Sterling that I keep coming back to. When something radical changes in your life, that's a good time to make other big changes. Death of a parent or spouse. Stock market crash. Major illness. Divorce. A time when you start over. When you have to start over. No choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; have been through that. We've had a major change not just on an individual basis, but on a &lt;i&gt;global&lt;/i&gt; scale. Global. Everyone changed. So we can do it. We can change our lives radically. Trump demands it. Covid demands it. The climate crisis demands it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your sense of what's normal is worth $0.24. You might find that much money on a sidewalk. I know this because I buried both my parents, and I know how much they thought their opinion mattered, and I know the truth. In the end, what they thought was worth about $0.24, approx.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So fuck it. Destroy your business model. Start over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once you've made such a change, you'll find you want to make others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Reporters forget past atrocities, so they can re-discover them, so it's (as far as they're concerned) news -- again. This makes their job approachable. Anything beyond this would require them to adapt, risk, improvise, grow. In software, ideas from users can be confusing, but also incredibly valuable. Users have nothing invested in the way you do things. They just know what they want. Knowing what users want is valuable, but news doesn't incorporate that, because they never listen to users, they only listen to each other, and often not even that.</description>

			<description>It's true that in 2016 Trump said he wouldn't honor the vote if he lost, but there is a big difference between then and now. Now he's the president, and he lives in the White House and is commander in chief of the armed forces. There's a lot of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Time Trump can really fuck things up for us, beyond how fucked up they already are. Everyone thinks Trump is going to lose but refuse to leave. I think he has another plan. When I was playing a board game with my little brother when we were kids, if he didn't like how it was going, well you know what little brothers do. That's Trump. A snotty ass little brother if there ever was one. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I have a huge collection of MP3s and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a&quot;&gt;new Android phone&lt;/a&gt;. Is there a music-playing Android app that can access files in Google Drive? I've been using that to transfer photos and movies from the phone to other devices and onto the web. I could easily do the same with music if I could play the MP3s from GD.</description>

			<title>BingeWorthy profile pages</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal with profile pages.    &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You have &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has signed on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt; has one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They list all the shows you've rated, from best to worst. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Profile pages are designed to share. When someone asks for a list of good things to binge, instead of thinking of a few off the top of the head, share a link to your profile page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You can edit your name, the image URL, description so if you're not happy with the initial versions (which we got from your Twitter profile), you can change them in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/25/settingsDialogLocation.png&quot;&gt;Settings dialog&lt;/a&gt; in BingeWorthy. All this is echoed in your Facebook and Twitter metadata, so it'll show up when you paste a link into those services, and many others that read this form of metadata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If your screenname is bullmancuso, &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/bullmancuso/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is your profile page. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, please post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/188&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot of the top part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Trump plus the virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading this piece, carefully, word for word and beling relieved that there was a way to fight the virus. It's a summary of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-pandemic.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; McNeil did on March 12. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html&quot;&gt;March 22&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Terrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's one of those things that I'll remember forever. Before listening, I had no idea how we fight this. After listening, I understood how it works. And that it had worked, in China and South Korea and other places. It would have amazed me then that here it is 6 months later and only a few states have done it remotely this way. Our efforts in the Northeast are primitive in comparison, but they worked. A lot of people were made very sick, and a lot of people died, but we got the virus under control. But it's raging out of control elsewhere in the country. You know when the Dems say the election is about health, they're talking about the ACA, but that's wrong. There's a pandemic raging through our country and it's growing again. We have to connect with this. And we won't have any hope, any hope at all, if Trump remains president.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini&quot;&gt;September 7&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If you accept the premise that [Trump is] hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and I do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's time to be scared. In the moment when you still have power. Later it will be too late. Trump plus the virus -- that's what we're up against. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Biden's campaign had a slogan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/&quot;&gt;Build Back Better&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't stick. Campaigns need slogans. For example, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ThinkTank%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; we had See What You Think. Of course Trump has many. MAGA. Mexico will pay for it. Fine people, on both sides. We'll have to see. Just a few. It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY&quot;&gt;Yes We Can&lt;/a&gt;. That's pretty good, hard to refute and doesn't really commit to anything in particular. I liked &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1840981_1840998_1840901,00.html&quot;&gt;FDR's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvk_uLnv4uo&quot;&gt;Happy Days Are Here Again&lt;/a&gt;. That campaign happened long before I was born, but in a sense, I remember it. The same way I guess today's kids remember the Beatles.</description>

			<source:outline text="Biden's campaign had a slogan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/&quot;&gt;Build Back Better&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't stick. Campaigns need slogans. For example, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22ThinkTank%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; we had See What You Think. Of course Trump has many. MAGA. Mexico will pay for it. Fine people, on both sides. We'll have to see. Just a few. It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY&quot;&gt;Yes We Can&lt;/a&gt;. That's pretty good, hard to refute and doesn't really commit to anything in particular. I liked &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1840981_1840998_1840901,00.html&quot;&gt;FDR's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvk_uLnv4uo&quot;&gt;Happy Days Are Here Again&lt;/a&gt;. That campaign happened long before I was born, but in a sense, I remember it. The same way I guess today's kids remember the Beatles." created="Thu, 24 Sep 2020 13:43:21 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/06/bidenHarris2020.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/09/24.html#a134321"/>

			<description>Why does the browserâ€™s Back button not work in Facebook? When you hit the Back button you're taken to a random place. You have to remember to look for a link to the previous comment, or the post, and usually you forget. No other website works like this. And once you erroneously hit the Back button the Forward button doesn't work either. The place you were at is lost. This is pretty bad for software that's ten years old, and the bug persists even in the new version, suggesting it's a deep flaw in the design, or worse, it's intentional.</description>
