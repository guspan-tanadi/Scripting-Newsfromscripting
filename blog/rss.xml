			<description>Journalism has a simple question to answer. Are we just going to report on what Trump is doing or should we organize the opposition. They're coming for the election. The First Amendment is next. Succinctly, do you fight when you've lost, or when you still have a chance.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TedMielczarek/status/1293581030947946497&quot;&gt;A fair analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the reason Mozilla is adrift. Lots of extra agendas, often personal, no discipline, professional values, or much connection with users. The mean petty behavior has no place at a customer driven venture, which Mozilla never has been. Another takeaway is that the fire hose of money was wasted hiring more than a few employees to maintain Firefox. The rest of the windfall could have been invested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=s%26p+500+chart&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=S%26P+500+chart&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l8.4565j1j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt;, held in reserve for the next Firefox, a product developed speculatively by entrepreneurial devs, &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; it achieves market acceptance. They would have billions in reserve by now. Could have changed the way we develop networks, with emphasis on user choice and no reliance on lock-in. But no one was ever empowered at Mozilla to do that, or no one had the vision or ability to lead.</description>

			<description>I'm in a funny place with the new BingeWorthy. Started testing it with people who had rated a lot of programs in the previous version, and am getting good feedback. I'm getting ideas other than bug fixes and tweaks, and today I implemented one of them, which leads me to believe I should just make the new version public and start rolling out the new stuff here on the blog in public view. If you want to see what the new feature is, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZKjlklkU6Q&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Have a look. And if you think you could contribute to the testing, send me a message on Twitter.</description>

			<description>The Biden campaign should have had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUwxqxlUXXY&quot;&gt;this ad&lt;/a&gt; ready for this moment. Perhaps they should outsource marketing to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lincolnproject.us/&quot;&gt;Lincoln Project&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, I would have preferred for this one ad, that Trump be left out of it. Let the campaign stand on its own for a moment.</description>

			<description>I've got my new iPhone SE. Transferring data from my iPhone XS/Max, after many tries because the old phone has four times the memory of the new phone. I had to delete a lot of stuff. But now it seems to be chugging along. It's quite a bit smaller than the original phone. First thing I want to do is take some pictures to see how well the camera works. Update: I gave up on the over-the-air update, and used an iTunes backup I took last night. Most of the data appears to have been preserved. All my music and photos are gone (but backed up on my Mac).</description>

			<title>Twitter's latest change is good</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/200811/p25#a200811p25&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that I never thought to ask for, but should have. Now you can decide who can respond to your posts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your choices of who can reply:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only people you follow.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Only people you mention in the tweet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And since you can mention no one, you can make it so that no one can respond to a post. This is a good feature because people can still comment on your tweet by RTing it, but they can't speak to everyone who reads it unless you let them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the Twitter equivalent of what I say to people who want to comment on my blog posts. Start a blog, I advise, and say what you have to say and link to my post. Of course what they really wanted was to use my flow to (very often) zing me personally in some way. I consider that spam. Or hijacking. It gets so insidious so quickly that I haven't had comments here for any duration for many years. It starts off collegial, but quickly devolves into abuse as the trolls take over. And that's exactly what has happened on Twitter. Completely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People like to say Twitter is about conversation, but that isn't my experience. Very little illuminating conversation. Lots of stupid unfunny supposed jokes, and put-downs, and ads masquerading as opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a good change:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People should feel more courageous in saying what they really believe, rather than avoiding opportunities for people to attack them. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You don't have to block or mute people who misuse the ability to respond. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People who say they can't comment are wrong, they can, they just have to create their own flow. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The author of the post they're commenting on always has the option to RT if it truly is constructive, which gives commenters the incentive to be civil. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Good move all around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What we need from a president</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Politics, when it's done right, is pretty boring.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The person you want running the show should fairly quietly make things better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You aren't going to have a beer with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You need to trust them enough to not blow up the world, and in our form of government to have the kind of personality that can compromise and work with others.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You want someone who's thoughtful and loves to understand how things and people work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mostly you want to feel things are being taken care of and get on with your own life. That imho is the most important freedom of all, freedom to focus, to be yourself, to have a life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>JavaScript, which I love in the way a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Hearst&quot;&gt;hostage&lt;/a&gt; loves his or her hostage-taker,  fails the test of &quot;Does the code look like what it does.&quot; It requires you to stand on your head with every finger in some random orifice to get simple stuff done if it involves any waiting. On the other hand if no waiting is involved, the code is perfectly understandable. If they invented JavaScript in the 70s, in the 80s we'd invent a language the fixes this colossal design error.

			<title>Who will do journalism?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the people my age when we were in school never imagined computers would be used by normal people to communicate. They resisted the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So what are most of us missing today? I think it has to do with who will be doing our daily journalism. Imho, we all will. Why? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A void is being left as professional journalists focus on fewer stories.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Weâ€™re learning how to do it with blogging and social media.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We need and want journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s like jury duty, itâ€™s uplifting, gives our life purpose and meaning. Itâ€™s its own reward.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I need a backlit keyboard because I write at night and the room where I work is pretty dark. I like it that way.

I would buy one from Apple if they had one. The model that I have now has been discontinued, it seems.</description>

			<title>If Biden &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; choose Harris</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1300841583456577?comment_id=1300853373455398&amp;reply_comment_id=1301136613427074&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My two cents on Kamala Harris and baggage.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;She has the worst kind of baggage. She's already tried to humiliate Biden, unfairly, in public. It didn't work. My experience in life is if you let something like that go, they do it again and again. The relationship is over. She took a calculated risk and it didn't work. That's the way business and politics work. You don't often get do-overs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;She can run for president again, maybe she'll win, but it would be a sign of weakness and ignorance, even naivetÃ© for Biden to choose her. There are so many other possibilities. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He may just have to weather the nonsense from Harris supporters, and there are many and they are vocal, and pushy (not her, her supporters, some of whom I consider friends), and then we can tell the people who are trying to raise hell that they're playing with our lives and their own lives, and they should just let it rest. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That said, she's also from California, which won't get you a lot of votes in Iowa or Wisconsin.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A day after buying the Pixel 4a, I drop my iPhone XS/Max, which is usually OK because it's in a case, but this time the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/09/crackedIphone.png&quot;&gt;display cracked&lt;/a&gt;. I can't be without a phone, and the 4a won't get here until the end of the month, so I bought a new iPhone SE. I'll be comparing the two low-end products from Google and Apple. Weird timing, eh.</description>

			<description>A friend writes: &quot;A Pixel 4a? Wow! I thought you were a big iPhone fan!&quot; To which I respond: &quot;I'm not particularly wed to either iPhone or Android. I have pretty much always have had both. In the last couple of years I have not had an Android because they didn't make a phone that interested me, considering the price, but the 4a is a new product, it seems sweet and it's a nice price.&quot; Note I bought it on pre-order like everyone else. I never have liked the iPhone as a product, I think Apple blew it. I couldn't make my beautiful scripting system work on it. They wouldn't allow it. I'm just a user. I think it's kind of a bleh product, honestly. As is Android, btw.</description>

			<description>As I work my way through &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/03.html#a155126&quot;&gt;Schitt's Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the characters are so fascinating and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira_Rose&quot;&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; may be the most, since we already knew the actor as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/in-defense-of-beetlejuices-delia-deetz&quot;&gt;Delia Deetz&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice&quot;&gt;Beetlejuice&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard for me to see the connection between the two. In one episode in Season 2 Moira is frantically looking for nude pictures of herself taken when she was younger. For most of the show you think she wants to find them so she can take them down, but no. She wants to be sure they're there. She wants to still be, in some sense, the actress we knew as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=delia+deetz&amp;t=hx&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&quot;&gt;Delia Deetz&lt;/a&gt; (Moira plays a former actress, btw). Her advice to Stevie, a super cute young supporting character, is to make sure to take lots of pictures of herself now when she's young. No matter how you think you're not very beautiful, when you're older you will see all the beauty you can't see now. I'm about the same age as Catherine O'Hara, the actress, and I want to say I totally concur. I can't believe how beautiful I was when I was younger, but of course I didn't see it then.</description>

			<description>I heard yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; that people stopped reading my blog because of RSS. Interesting story. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/03/12/thingsAreCrystallizing.html&quot;&gt;subscribed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22google+reader%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Stopped reading on the web. Then they shut down Google Reader. The people who were reading my blog and others before RSS, lost track of the feeds they were reading in Google Reader. There were other choices, but that doesn't change what happened. We are rebuilding slowly, because blogging is still a useful form of communication. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; is the best way to get it, probably always was, even in the heyday of RSS. I have to admit reading &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; blog in RSS was never a great deal. I write one day at a time. I'd prefer if you read what was on the home page at midnight. That's how I write it. Since RSS is something I'm well-known for developing, I didn't want to say this too loudly. But RSS should have had a chance to grow, and it didn't. So it got stuck. Not really a surprise.</description>

			<description>BTW one of the problems with the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/05/144824.html?title=clubhouseFirstImpressions&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; is that it's impossible to remember. At least for me. I never had a problem like that with Twitter, and I was a very early user, as I am with CH.</description>
