There's more to the history of the Civil War as he tells it. What the Confederacy did by seceding from the Union was quite similar to the January 6 attempted coup, but after the Civil War, we (ie the United States) made the same mistake the Bidens are making. They wanted to bring the Confederates themselves back into the country. So really it was no surprise that slavery continued, it was just a bit more complicated. When we prevail this time, when Trump is dead and gone, and his successors are a bit easier to shame, we must have a purging. With force. No more trying to love the rebels back into the country. Deport them any place that will have them. Offer them to Russia or Hungary. You want em? We don't. If not, build huge prison camps in remote parts of America. Life sentences with no parole. These people should not feel after all is said and done that they are part of America. They didn't love it, they left it, tried to destroy it, they do not get to come back and enjoy the benefits of living in a free society. It's their turn to really feel the pain.</description>

			<description>What made me think of this was a random experience while waiting for my order this morning at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utopiabagelsny.com/&quot;&gt;Utopia Bagels&lt;/a&gt; in Whitestone, NY. It's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Queens,+NY+11358/Utopia+Bagels,+Utopia+Parkway,+Queens,+NY/@40.7747863,-73.7984347,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a61da3d0acd:0xe857931aa5334a2a!2m2!1d-73.7937332!2d40.7802255!3e1&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; I grew up in. The people behind the counter looked nothing like the people I grew up with, coming from the current working population of Queens, one of the most diverse places in the world. The night before I had gone to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/edwin-diaz-gets-6-out-save-as-mets-beat-braves&quot;&gt;Mets beat the Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;. This year's Mets are unusually competent. Anyway there was a man there, in the crowded bagel store, probably in his early 80s, wearing a rent-a-cop uniform. I thought he was one of the few people remaining from my time there. He looked like a drinker and smoker. He could have been one of my childhood friends' fathers. He picked me out and asked if I knew what he thought. I said nothing. He said &quot;America matters, that's all.&quot; I mumbled quietly well we can agree to disagree. After that I avoided him, looked around, he and I were among the oldest people there. This, I thought, is the new Queens, we are part of the old (and I am long-gone, just back for the Mets game and the bagels). On the way out, on an impulse, I tapped his shoulder and said in a voice that I was sure he could hear, but not too loudly -- Black lives matter. I don't know why I said it, it probably only meant pain for this man. He is a human vestige. So old and obviously tired, but he still had to do a job probably no one else wanted. I think what he was really saying to me was hey brother, you look a bit like me, maybe we agree us white people matter. But he couldn't say it that plainly.</description>

			<description>I got a Lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel at Utopia Bagels and ate it on the drive home. It was heaven. I will remember that bagel as long as I live. Also the store gets its name from the street it's on, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway_(Queens)&quot;&gt;Utopia Parkway&lt;/a&gt;. It's just an avenue, not a major thoroughfare, not what in NY you'd call a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkway&quot;&gt;parkway&lt;/a&gt;. It winds north-south through this part of Queens. I always felt privileged to live near Utopia. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway_(Queens)#History_and_naming&quot;&gt;Wikipedia says&lt;/a&gt; where the name came from, an attempt to create a utopian community in Queens. There's no mention of Utopia Bagels in the Wikipedia article, but there should be. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I think Twitter, with Musk largely history, can become a stronger company than they've ever been. The way forward imho is to focus on the platform, so lots of apps can be made to run on it, not just one way to use its capabilities. Lots of user experiences. That's something none of the other social media platforms have let happen. Amazingly in 2022, while there are standards for images, movies -- everything but simple documents, with titles, unlimited length, simple styling, links and enclosures. That's where I'd like to see Twitter be the leader. Be the world-scale distribution system for simple text documents.  Lead by filling the void. No standards bodies. PS: I bought a small amount of TWTR stock a few years back and continue to hold it. PPS: I basically wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/01/08/gottabearetha.html#4&quot;&gt;business plan&lt;/a&gt; for the Apple of 1996.</description>

			<title>Supercharger visit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I went to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/supercharger&quot;&gt;Tesla supercharger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I thought I could make it home with 6% to spare, but my Tesla insisted that I should play it safe and get a charge at the charger in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&amp;bounds=41.866847319736465%2C-73.89163051440431%2C41.62811734881771%2C-74.28198848559572&amp;zoom=12&amp;filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger%2Cbodyshop%2Cparty&amp;search=New%20Paltz%2C%20NY%2012561%2C%20USA&quot;&gt;New Paltz, NY&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out it was at a place I knew well, the Plaza Diner. When I was 17 I hitchhiked up to New Paltz every Friday that summer and often would end up there on my way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/05/plazaDiner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The Plaza Diner, New Paltz, NY.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was amazed at how fast their charger runs. It almost felt like filling up a gas-powered car. I was also impressed that there was &lt;i&gt;nowhere to piss. &lt;/i&gt;How can you have a place like this with no way for a human to evacuate while the car fills up. I was tempted to just do it, but I held on and waited till I got home.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am generally critical of the substance and format of cable news, but — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bezgeMocFPU&amp;t=270s&quot;&gt;opening segment&lt;/a&gt; on Joy Reid’s show last night about women and abortion after Kansas was outstanding, deep, emotionally evocative, inspiring. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization&quot;&gt;Dobbs decision&lt;/a&gt;, however awful, enslaving and life-endangering of American citizens, has a silver lining. It can stir us to act in care of each other, across all supposed divisions, find the American within each of us. We are still unitable if you push us hard enough.</description>

			<description>If the Democrats enjoyed politics even a &lt;i&gt;little,&lt;/i&gt; we would be experiencing a huge wave of euphoria right now.

At first I couldn't think why that was wrong, but I just went down to the car (a Model Y) to set it up to work with the new Pixel 6 Pro I got yesterday, and remembered. When you're playing music on a phone in a Tesla, you have to use the UI of the phone to control the music. With CarPlay it's integrated with the display of the car, and it's simplified to be like a car control. And it's easy to switch apps, again using the UI of the CarPlay software, integrated into the car. It's so dangerous to do the same with the Tesla system that &lt;i&gt;I never do it unless the car is stopped.&lt;/i&gt; The difference is integration. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/03/141929.html?title=teslasMissingAppEcosystem&quot;&gt;wrote about this&lt;/a&gt; when I was first transitioning from CarPlay to Telsa, and it's a serious problem for Tesla that they don't have an app &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_ecosystem&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, and unless they do a deal with Apple and Google, they probably aren't going to have one. It's no small thing to build one of those, they might have done it when they had the electric car business to themselves, but that's already past.</description>

One of the first things I did was transfer some music to the phone. I have to say it worked much better than transferring to my iPhone. From a Mac, which didn't work at all. I even bought a new Mac just for that purpose. Still couldn't get it to work. What's wrong with this picture? On the other hand, how do you play music on this Android wonder? All the apps begin with Google followed by three dots. Hmm. Which one plays music? I can't tell. Didn't they user-test this stuff at all?? I found an app that opens data files and when I opened one of the MP3's it figured it out and launched something that would play it. Now I wonder how that's going to work on my Tesla?

			<title>Software is like a building</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I spent ten years living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in that time, five huge skyscrapers went up within a few blocks of where I lived. All of them residential, all of them of record-breaking height for residential buildings in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They started as huge holes in the ground, then pilings were driven deep into the earth, and concrete poured to form a foundation. Then the steel frame was attached to the pilings and it started to rise, and floor after floor of steel were built on top of the previous floors. As the building rose, crews came in to put up the inner walls of the building, water pipes, electric lines, sewer, the elevators, phone lines, internet, the inner walls, and then they put up an exterior, and glass in the windows, and while they were adding new steel beams on the (say) 50th floor, you could actually see people in the lobby of the building. It was a holy mess, with construction crews everywhere, just a complete mess, even so you could see clearly the outlines of something familiar coming together. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they kept building until the building was topped off, and all the various crews kept doing their jobs. There were no elevators above the 10th floor, everything still had to get to the top with a huge crane that was itself an engineering marvel. While all this was going on there were some demo units on the 5th floor and a rental office, all furnished, and one working elevator that was beautifully clean and functional, giving the &lt;i&gt;impression&lt;/i&gt; that the building was ready to be occupied, but the truth was that it was still a long way from being done. But it could be used, in a way, for its intended purpose, people could imagine using it to sleep, eat, work, play -- all the things an apartment building could be used for, but it's not yet an apartment building, it's a construction site. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Building a big piece of software is a lot like this, The construction company wants to know if you were killed by a random piece of metal being hauled up in a crane, but if you say that the buttons on one of the floors in the elevator actually closed the door when they were meant to open the door, they thank you for the report, but they weren't listening. They have a big job still ahead of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
