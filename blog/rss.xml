			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/mylogseqblog/2022/01/13/000005.html?title=changeNotesForV041&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog&quot;&gt;myLogseqBlog tool&lt;/a&gt; fixing a couple of bugs reported on day one. There's also a note there on how this will evolve. Right now all the loose-ends are showing, that's because I know almost nothing about LogSeq. As the people from LogSeq-land get familiar with this, they will no doubt have ideas about how to better integrate this software so it's super easy. This is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=bootstrap&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;bootstraps&lt;/a&gt; start.</description>

I always loved the imagery of this event. A cooperative venture, one team building from east to the west, and the other from west to east, meeting at a middle point, and thereby creating one great thing. Working together. Built during the Civil War.</description>

			<description>At some point, people we think of as independent software developers today will be thought of by Apple and Google as terrorists. The people won't know what to believe. In the future, even saying what I said here will be seen as terrorism.</description>

I find I can't do the most basic things in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=logseq&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt;. I know there must be keystrokes for basic actions like creating a new subhead or moving a sub around structurally. The menus don't have anything for outlining (that I can find). I was able to get by because I can now edit LogSeq documents in Drummer (!) -- it took me about 1/2 hour to realize I could do this. Oh the wonders of interop. I'm on Day 2 of my quest to hook up LogSeq to Drummer blogging. The first product of this work will be a JavaScript app that converts a LogSeq journal folder into a calendar-structured outline in OPML. We're creating a new idea universe here, and it's coming together quickly. I love being in the middle of these projects.</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-queens-gambit&quot;&gt;Queen's Gambit&lt;/a&gt; again. It's so refreshing. The lead character, Beth Harmon, is so attractive, appealing, I want to see everything she says and does. She totally commands attention. And admiration. I once had a girlfriend who was as beautiful and brilliant like the character, smart and clever and ambitious. The show is such a fantasy, and very motivating. It makes me want to do brilliant work just to get her approval. I know it's just a story but it's also real in a sense, as my inner life. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. And it's good as a re-binge as well.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In a screen shot because I was writing in LogSeq. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have code that reads my Journals folder and turns it into an outline ready to be pushed at Old School and published as a blog. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It feels like building the transcontinental railroad. Something we did a lot of twice in the past...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hooking up Mac apps using IAC.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hooking up web apps using XML-RPC and Menu Sharing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here we are again, but this time OPML is the common language. I've been waiting for this for twenty years!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hey you can't hurry love. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the screen shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What's your price Joe?</title>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/09/185121.html?title=noCellCoverage&quot;&gt;No Cell Coverage&lt;/a&gt; issue. I got a note that said to: 1. Turn on Airplane Mode. 2. Turn on Wifi. The thought is that should be enough to get the iPhone to stop trying to find a cell connection and thus stop draining my battery. If this works, all I'll have to do is remember to turn off Airplane Mode when I return to civilization.</description>

			<description>As you may know we're very close to having interop between Drummer and LogSeq. Just starting to think about what this opens up. Here's an example. We could set it up so a LogSeq user could edit and publish a Drummer blog from within LogSeq. The wiring would be easy (and fun).</description>

			<description>It would be interesting if one of the paywall'd pubs also offered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=ez-pass&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;tollbooth&lt;/a&gt; or pay-as-you-go option. It's possible I could end up paying more per month that way, but as a reader I'd feel better about it. I have too many subscriptions for things I never use. That really tarnishes the brand in my mind, esp after I unsub, which I inevitably do.</description>

			<title>Why LogSeq?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure some &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users are puzzled that the change notes outline all of a sudden has a bunch of stuff about LogSeq in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To a web outliner user who might not have heard of the product, or of the nascent &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; category, it could seem odd. My interest comes from the growth of the TFT category, and its close proximity to my products, and the potential for interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have put out a format for interop -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, but I've decided I don't want to wait for its broad adoption in the category to get interop. It's similar to  when RSS 0.90 came out when I already had &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scriptingnews%20format&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;scriptingNews format&lt;/a&gt;. You have a choice at that point, you can have interop right now, or you can wait for a consensus that may never come. In the first case you have the chance to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; the consensus, in the latter, you have to wait for others to agree. It's why I've noted in the past that the person who goes second has all the power. So I chose in this case to go second.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if I want to interop with TFT products, why LogSeq?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, when I approached them, they responded, and listened, and followed up. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Second, they have an open product, you can interop with it without getting in a locked trunk. What you look for in interop is a level playing field, that it be a peering arrangement, and that your interop partner can't shut off the connection without losing their users. LogSeq meets all those requirements. They are committed to being open. It's not just a thing they say, it's how they've built their product.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Third, the format is simple. I am familiar with it, having created a similar format for my outliners in the 80s called .HEAD. I know what it can and can't do. There's enough that we can do with the LogSeq format that makes for interesting projects built on the interop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fourth, I like the team! They have a fresh can-do go-get-em attitude that is very refreshing. You don't see this very often in the US (they are in China). One thing that makes interop work better is if there's compatibility between the people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I have to make a disclosure that I wish I had been able to make in November. I have made a small investment in the company. They have not announced this yet, and they asked me to wait until they do, but I feel I've already waited too long. I need people to know that I have a financial interest in the success of the company. But I also wanted to send a signal to them, to the users of our products, to the Tools For Thought category, to developers and others -- that we can compete and still see our success as beneficial to each other. This space is so large and under-developed that we can work for many years building on each others' strengths. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think what we're doing is substantially different. The focus of my projects tends to be in publishing and tools for development. I see their product as being useful in that context, but I don't think there's a big conflict. If we are able to co-exist with products that support OPML, surely we can do the same with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/4#issuecomment-1008016791&quot;&gt;progress report&lt;/a&gt; on the interop work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I wanted to understand why I felt the way I did about things. One of my teachers told me a story about holding a baby and the baby smiled, and the person thought that the baby was saying something to them. But the truth is the baby might have just farted and thought it was cool. Whatever it is you're angsting over might not have anything to do with you. Most of the people on the planet are living their lives not thinking about you at all. Maybe they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be thinking about you, but they aren't. Sorry.</description>

			<description>I love getting emails from PR people who offer to send me products based on what I write here. Not sarcastic. I got an message from a publicist at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://knopfdoubleday.com/imprint/pantheon/&quot;&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, which publishes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/239452/station-eleven-television-tie-in-by-emily-st-john-mandel/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that the Station Eleven HBO series is based on. I thanked her for the offer. I read the book when it came out, still have it, and realize I may want to re-read it after seeing the series. But at first I was confused, I thought she was offering to send me the graphic novel (ie comic book) that's at the center of the story, Dr. Eleven, but that doesn't exist. I think it would be immensely popular if it did, that is of course if it was good. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

But it has a cheap feel, and mouse pointer freezes a lot. If I'm going to use a scroll wheel mouse eight hours a day every day, I am willing to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Scroll-Wheel-Mouse-Mac/s?k=Scroll+Wheel+Mouse+for+Mac&quot;&gt;better product&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Asking for help with software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want help, you have to put the effort in, first. You can't expect people to help you if haven't checked your work.  First you have to carefully read the docs. Not just once, but two or three times. Then stare at the problem. Try changing something and see what happens. Maybe the docs say one thing but you're observing something else. What did I do wrong? You have to ask that question first. We all make mistakes, there's no shame in it, but it's not good to show no effort before sounding an alarm. Esp when the person you're asking for help from is doing it as a volunteer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned from far too many years using computers, I'm usually the one who made the mistake, though it's tempting to assume the software is wrong. When I say &quot;usually&quot; --- I mean once in a thousand times the software was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was a situation the other day when the user appeared to be reporting that the software had completely failed. We're now months into the shipment of the software, and I was pretty sure this part worked. I depended on it myself. The user gave me no information other than he thought the software was broken. I closed the issue and moved on. I can't work with people who aren't at least a little humble. And nothing is so urgent that I should stop everything I'm doing and help a panicked user who won't even do a little work to try to figure out whether they misunderstood or made a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problems I like helping people with are ones that are dished up in clear terms -- this is what I saw, I expected something else to happen (please explain), I read the docs (be sure you actually have) and tried a few things (explain) but I can't figure it out. When the explanation is so clear I recognize the issue and am able to quickly help. I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; helping people. I don't like doing other people's work for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It would be as big a breakthrough as S3 was in 2006. Actually it'd be more like the introduction of the floppy disk to the Apple II in 1978 or so. Really it's amazing how long this niche has been left unfilled. User-owned storage that their apps can use, provided by Amazon please. It has to be Amazon. I understand finally that's what all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=web3&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;web3&lt;/a&gt; michegas is about. The Blockchain vendors insist they have the solution to this festering sore of a problem. Of course tehcnologically -- far from it. But for some reason Amazon has been unwilling to fill the need. I think rushing to one form of storage rather than providing a cloneable API is foolish. We can have it all, and we should insist on it.</description>

			<description>Have you ever had a doctor willing to work with you on an appointment so you don't have to waste a half a day because they weren't willing to spend a few minutes scheduling a meeting. So many services value your time at zero. How refreshing it would be if just one respected the value of your time.</description>

			<title>The two-ways rule</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The rule: One way of doing something is better than two. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when the language gets a new way of doing something that is only slightly better than the previous version, or not better at all, I always stick with the way I was doing it before. That way when reading the code I never have to wonder why did the author choose this way in one place and another way elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Coding tricks is not why we program -- we program to create new utility, and to create something that is easy not to break when it needs maintenence. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's very common and imho totally wrong to not adopt the conventions of code you're contributing to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another way of emphasizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=prior%20art&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you can get to zero ways of doing something that's way better than one, and way-way better than two or more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions. Sometimes they add a feature to a language that is so sensible you have to use it. For example, initial values for parameters to functions in JavaScript. Or not having to say &lt;i&gt;name: name&lt;/i&gt; in an object definititon, just &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; will do. Another one, the forEach function in JavaScript is more sensible than the equalent for version.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/#1497798940000&quot;&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt; in the standards-makers howto. It's the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I don't have time to write a full prose version of a post, I think it's better to write the skeletal version rather than publish nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

How I miss &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Donald%20McNeil&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt; who used to tell it like it is. Too bad he said the n-word when talking about the n-word instead of saying literally n-word he said the word the n-word is standing in for. How tired is that. Think of all the things we have to fight for to just get back to where we were and this wasn't one of them. Such fools at the NY Times.</description>

			<title>Many worlds, one structure</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People from the blogging world didn't necessarily pay attention to the podcasting world as it grew out of it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the outlining world, even though outlines play a big role in blogs and podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Podcasters mostly were not bloggers, or outliners. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And most of the people who know me from outlining (all boomers and graybeards btw) had no idea that I went on to develop blogging and podcasting, even though they were natural outgrowths of outlining.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All these things are connected. They really are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And no one seems to understand that there is a format that ties all this stuff together. And it's not RSS, although that's important too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a master plan! I kid you not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
