			<description>In general journalism should report tech that is actually being used to do new things, not on VCs hyping ideas of things that will make them even richer but don’t actually do anything for anyone. If a VC is promoting something that fact alone should make you suspicious.</description>

			<description>Idea for a TV miniseries for HBO or Netflix. In 2022 a variant of Covid comes out that kills Republicans and leaves Democrats unharmed. Two thirds of the Supreme Court is wiped out. The state governments of red states are decimated. Within a few months there are no more red states. Series ends with the main characters enjoying a beautiful sunset reveling in the bright future ahead.</description>

			<title>Why Daytona is a game-changer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/14/strongman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I spent all of 2021 working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, and part of 2020, and I'm going to keep working on it in 2022 (which is just a couple of weeks away gulp). One of the goals of the project was to have great &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/about.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;, and I think they came out pretty good, but there was still a major problem -- where to put things. This is the problem in all docs. Even if you're a good docs writer, and I've had a lot of practice, and you know the product well, and care about the users, some things just won't have a place. So you document them on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, or in the Change Notes outline, and hope people can find them in a search engine. But they keep doing a worse job of indexing our stuff, and they don't know what is a Drummer doc and what isn't, so you can't say for example, &quot;search the Drummer docs for instructions on how to restore a blog.opml file in a myfiles archive&quot; which is a question a user posed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/140#issue-1082790948&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. I smiled when I saw it. This is a job for Daytona. So here's the query I entered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Import%20opml&amp;collection=drummerdocs&quot;&gt;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Import%20opml&amp;collection=drummerdocs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I laughed out loud when the result came back. Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't in a place a user would have looked, and Google &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; would have found it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The point is this -- it's past time to take responsibility for finding the stuff we write, and if we do it well, and Daytona does, all of a sudden blogging works so much better, and the incentive to write stuff, to document, to narrate our work, to index everything you can, makes total sense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We crossed into a new generation. I think this is a lot closer to &quot;Web3&quot; than the hyped up garbage the VC industry is selling, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My product is interop</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/30/grannySmithApple.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;If someone was a passionate user of one of the other &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=tools%20for%20thought&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; projects, and they asked me to sell them on using &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, I would probably say why don't you stick with the product you like, and work with us to get it interoperating with Drummer. That way when you want to try Drummer, you won't have to switch, you can just use it, and use the other one too, whenever you like. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something I struggle to explain to people. I'm 66 years old, and have spent decades making software, so I think about it differently than I did when I was say 22 and wanting to take on the world. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=runway&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;horizon&lt;/a&gt; is obviously 44 years shorter now than it was then. And my goals are adjusted as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I said the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/14.html#a144920&quot;&gt;other day&lt;/a&gt;, I've been lucky because of when I was born and my interest in technology, to be part of several &quot;bare metal bootstraps,&quot; where we got down to a basic set of functionality, a complete machine that everyone agreed on, and we as developers built up from there. Some amazing things can be accomplished if the baseline is powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think of my &quot;product&quot; today not being Drummer or Daytona or whatever's next, rather it's wanting to have my passion, outlining, experience the same kind of birth as a platform as the Apple II did, or CP/M, MS-DOS, Windows, the web, RSS, podcasting. Look at that string! Wow. But today's users and developers haven't even really experienced &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; exploding platform. That's my product now. I want outlining to be the basis for growth the same way those others were. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you don't have to use Drummer but do insist on the highest level of interop with it from the people who make your software. Don't accept no for an answer. I'm not. Hopefully that makes sense? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Drummer is more than a piece of software -- it's an interop &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindbomb.org/&quot;&gt;bomb&lt;/a&gt;. It's going to sit there and grow, inviting others to interop with it, and every feature and service I add will make the proposition more enticing. Think of Drummer less as a product and more as a seduction. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Look at that string! Wow. But today's users and developers haven't even really experienced &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; exploding platform. That's my product now.

			<description>Here's an idea. I have a drone that communicates with my peloton via satellite, so it's not constrained by range. I can send the drone anywhere I like, but I have to ride there on my peloton. Obviously what I see on my screen is what the drone sees. I think it would quickly become addictive, not that peloton isn't already addictive. PS: I can fly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger&quot;&gt;debuggers&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of the coding process. I almost never run anything complex without stepping through the code in the debugger, to be sure it's running the way I intended it to. Having the data it's working on right there, easily browsable, gives me ideas for new functionality. Imagine being a surgeon who can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; the living body, turn off all the systems to examine things, then click a button and have the organism reanimate. And then imagine having such a tool available to you and not using it. There are programmers who don't use debuggers. They're working at a lower level imho. Like flying without instruments.</description>

Having the data it's working on right there, easily browsable, gives me ideas for new functionality. Imagine being a surgeon who can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage&quot;&gt;inside&lt;/a&gt; the living body, turn off all the systems to examine things, then click a button and have the organism reanimate. And then imagine having such a tool available to you and not using it. There are programmers who don't use debuggers. They're working at a lower level imho.

			<description>So I have the last 4.5 years of Scripting News in the Daytona index, now I desperately want all the rest of the years, but that's not going to be so easy. In 2017 I had a really good idea of how I wanted the data stored, but until then, I was playing around a lot. A lot of it is in OPML, somewhere, probably. But a lot more of it is in HTML. But it's pretty incredible to have 4.5 years. Makes all that writing so much more useful.</description>

			<description>I noticed people are talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/search.opml&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt; on their blogs, and there's a general positive view of it, and an expectation that I will continue to improve it. That's all good. But a lot of that depends on how much I get back from users. Ideas that are interesting, not necessarily obvious, and aren't expressed in terms of panic. I want to move this forward, with friends, with people who are as excited as I am and are ready to roll up their sleeves and participate. But if you wait for me to do it, then I'll just add the things I want. I'm hoping that &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users take an interest. And not just &quot;do this for me now&quot; -- help out. I can't read minds, and I don't really like working for free. I don't want dollars, I want the product of intelligent, kind people who help. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=nakedjen&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; has the perfect motto for this, &quot;You can fake caring, but you can't fake showing up.&quot;</description>

			<description>The Democrats need someone who can be counted on to say &quot;The Republicans are full of shit&quot; when called on by the press.

			<description>Today I learned that if you want Apple's mouse to scroll, as if it had a scroll wheel, you have to go to the Accessibility panel on Preferences, then click Options, and check the Scrolling checkbox.

I come from both cultures, Maisel from my home in NY. Miriam's mother and father could have been my parents or grandparents. And I lived the HACF life in Silicon Valley in the same timeframe as the show. But for some reason when I tried MMM this week, I got into it. I think I figured out why. The family I was part of is now completely gone, and has been gone since early 2018 when my mother died. Enough time has passed that the memory has softened and idealized in an emotional way. I still remember why they upset me so, but I don't feel it so much any more, so Maisel is tolerable, even adorable. And bingeable. TV shows are excellent because they immerse you in their society, you start thinking of the characters on the show as members of your clan. Maybe I should try HACF again. Also, it's really funny that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; comes even closer to the lifestyle I led, and I loved it when it came out!

			<description>Made a small change to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter a search string, it constructs a URL for the search and redirects to it. That way the address bar has a link that's ready to be shared. This is something Google does that's quite useful. It works if you're searching Scripting News or the Drummer Docs, but sharing searches into your own public writing doesn't make sense, because they will search in the other person's public writing, not yours. For now you're the only person who can search your public writing. But I had it redirect because you might want to remember the URL for your own use.</description>

			<title>What is OPML?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A thread on Twitter led to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blogisch/status/1469579178890743808&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from Joël de Bruijn: &quot;Is an OPML file meant to encompass a whole library (with a notebook, subnotebook, note structure) or is it more like &quot;one note = one OPML file&quot; structure? Or something in between, what a user prefers?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; is just a file format, like HTML or RSS. So it can be used for whatever you want, large files, small files, libraries, bullet charts, tree charts, graphs, calendars, directories, projects, things we haven't invented yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/manila/opml/spec.html&quot;&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt; designed as the interchange format for the outliner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, a scripting environment I created at UserLand Software in the late 80s and 90s. In Frontier, an outline could be a script, a menu, an object database, a blog, a blog post, or just an outline. We needed a way to exchange outlines with our product and other outliners, so this is what we came up with. OPML wasn't the first interchange format for outlines, there was a format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/misc/dotHeadFormat.html&quot;&gt;.HEAD&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced dot-head) that we used for outliners in the 80s, but OPML was better because not only did it handle structures of text, they could also have attributes. Anywhere you could put an outline node, you could add attributes. They aren't visible when you're editing, but they're accessible through a dialog, or software can automatically attach attributes, such as the creation date of a node, so that they are indentifiable and can be pointed to from outside the outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then came a very special attribute, the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute -- which says basically that this node in an outline is a document, so the outline containing the node behaves like a file system. That's how I edit my blog. Each post is a document contained within a day, which is part of a month. I find it convenient to start a new outline every month, and archive the previous month in a GitHub repository. You can study what real-world OPML looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, I have 4.5 years of archives there. I recently created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;search utility&lt;/a&gt; for those, which is kind of like the tagging systems you see in Tools For Thought products, but I don't have to tag anything, I can just search for the words. It's already a lot better than Google or other search engines that don't understand outline structure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway that's a longish answer to a question that can be answered simply by saying that an OPML file can be whatever size makes sense for the application. It's just a file format. Its signficance, I hope, is that it can provide a way for all kinds of outliners, and applications that accept outlines as input, to share the same data, making it possible for lots of outline-based tools to co-exist, and for users to be able the use the right tool for whatever job they want to do right now, without having to convert any data.

				<source:outline text="A thread on Twitter led to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blogisch/status/1469579178890743808&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from Joël de Bruijn: &quot;Is an OPML file meant to encompass a whole library (with a notebook, subnotebook, note structure) or is it more like &quot;one note = one OPML file&quot; structure? Or something in between, what a user prefers?&quot;" created="Sat, 11 Dec 2021 14:50:40 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/11/145032.html?title=whatIsOpml#a145040"/>
				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; is just a file format, like HTML or RSS. So it can be used for whatever you want, large files, small files, libraries, bullet charts, tree charts, graphs, calendars, directories, projects, things we haven't invented yet." created="Sat, 11 Dec 2021 14:53:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/11/145032.html?title=whatIsOpml#a145323"/>
				<source:outline text="It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/manila/opml/spec.html&quot;&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt; designed as the interchange format for the outliner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, a scripting environment I created at UserLand Software in the late 80s and 90s. In Frontier, an outline could be a script, a menu, an object database, a blog, a blog post, or just an outline. We needed a way to exchange outlines with our product and other outliners, so this is what we came up with. OPML wasn't the first interchange format for outlines, there was a format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/misc/dotHeadFormat.html&quot;&gt;.HEAD&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced dot-head) that we used for outliners in the 80s, but OPML was better because not only did it handle structures of text, they could also have attributes. Anywhere you could put an outline node, you could add attributes. They aren't visible when you're editing, but they're accessible through a dialog, or software can automatically attach attributes, such as the creation date of a node, so that they are indentifiable and can be pointed to from outside the outline." created="Sat, 11 Dec 2021 14:53:52 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/11/145032.html?title=whatIsOpml#a145352"/>
				<source:outline text="Then came a very special attribute, the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute -- which says basically that this node in an outline is a document, so the outline containing the node behaves like a file system. That's how I edit my blog. Each post is a document contained within a day, which is part of a month. I find it convenient to start a new outline every month, and archive the previous month in a GitHub repository. You can study what real-world OPML looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, I have 4.5 years of archives there. I recently created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;search utility&lt;/a&gt; for those, which is kind of like the tagging systems you see in Tools For Thought products, but I don't have to tag anything, I can just search for the words. It's already a lot better than Google or other search engines that don't understand outline structure." created="Sat, 11 Dec 2021 14:57:03 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/12/11/145032.html?title=whatIsOpml#a145703"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway that's a longish answer to a question that can be answered simply by saying that an OPML file can be whatever size makes sense for the application. It's just a file format. Its signficance, I hope, is that it can provide a way for all kinds of outliners, and applications that accept outlines as input, to share the same data, making it possible for lots of outline-based tools to co-exist, and for users to be able the use the right tool for whatever job they want to do right now, without having to convert any data.

			<description>I have an announcement coming shortly, having solved a problem that I've posed here as a task for &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/span&gt; databases, I want to get all the OPML files that I have archived for Scripting News queryable so I can do research on my own writing. I now understand why they couldn't do it, and the solution is remarkably simple, was easy to program and imho blows away the tagging approaches the other TFT apps use. Sometimes you have to start with the use-case, not the technology. And this is a long-term problem that was solved, it goes all the way back to the beginning of outlining. The braintrust query above is for this project. I want it to be just right before showing to you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
