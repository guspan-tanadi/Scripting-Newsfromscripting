			<description>A rambling 12-minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/26/theBigDavesBasketballPodcast.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about the NBA and how it compares to tech. I'm speaking to my bud, Dave Jacobs, we've been chatting during the playoffs this year. His team as you will soon learn are the Golden State Warriors, who I don't particularly like (as you will also be able to tell). It's just what's on my mind in terms of basketball, which is basically a metaphor for everything.</description>

Google was replaced here &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/25.html#a210857&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; by my personal chatbot. We need RSS support on the other end so it can always be up to date with the content on the site, but otherwise wow -- a dream realized. Still so much to learn. So Google is on the way out, and Twitter while it's here to stay, not as the town square, rather as the global and public news wire service, Mastodon is becoming more of the place where intelligent people discuss their doings. I'll try to link to Mastodon posts over tweets in the future.</description>

			<description>I've been linkblogging exclusively to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; for the last week or so. No more posting links to Twitter. Just Masto (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt; on my blog.) I like it. It's changed the way I see the two networks. Not sure people on Mastodon understand it's my linkblog, I think we still have some more work to do there.</description>

			<description>I don't usually watch MSNBC these days, esp not at 9PM at the beginning of the NBA playoffs, but for some reason I was watching Maddow on Monday and after her long monolog, which was obviously headed to gloating over Tucker Carlson's firing at Fox, her first guest is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22jay+rosen%22&quot;&gt;JAY ROSEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; who we know. So weird to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@jayrosen_nyu/110259979835565712&quot;&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; in my Catskills living room like that out of the blue. I think TV should be more like that, customized so Maddow mostly interviews (or appears to interview) people they know I know. This is the ultimate in news. And if I don't like Maddow, I can swap her persona for someone I like better. Not sure who that would be now, I find them all pretty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=obsequious&quot;&gt;obsequious&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>While we're at it why don't we have an open api-able dictionary for the English language. Google doesn't really have one, and I don't like pointing to them anyway. When I use an unusual word, I want to link to its definition. (Yes I know about Wordnik. I even wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; to work with it, but they shut us out of the API for some reason. I was hoping they'd adopt the product, even market it. I can't imagine it cost that much to let people use it.)</description>

Click the link to see all the times I've used the term on the blog. Maybe that'll help. In case you still don't get it, it's a writing system that not only publishes RSS, but accepts it as input. So I can write using my own editing tools, and publish through yours. I want to publish anywhere people want to read my stuff, and I refuse to copy/paste my writing into edit boxes. The first system I really wanted this for was Substack, although I would have liked Facebook or Medium to have it a long time ago. Yes I know there are ways to pipe RSS into systems, I've written plenty of them. But there's no substitute for a content system supporting it as a feature.</description>

			<description>If you're a developer who wants to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;create standards&lt;/a&gt;, you might check in with other people who have worked in the area, describe the problem, ask if they have ideas. I try to do that. Unfortunately the people mostly don't respond, but sometimes they do. It's how we avoid having two or more ways of doing exactly the same thing. And the second person is the one who has the power to set a standard, not the first. So it's the power move if your goal is really to try to set a standard.</description>

			<description>Have you ever noticed -- if you ask a programmer to do something and their first reaction is a vehement &lt;i&gt;no way are we doing that&lt;/i&gt; then they come back a week later and they've implemented it. I learned never to take a hard no as a for-real no. Good developers keep coming back to the idea if it's interesting enough. Sometimes it ends up as disastrous as the programmer initially thought. I could tell you stories. But also sometimes it's how killer features get into products at the last minute.</description>

			<description>FeedLand tweak. Now when displaying a linkblog item, instead of (link) we say what domain the link goes to. That's how we do it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from that approach.

			<description>I'm having random problems accessing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; today in Chrome on a Mac. It's just an S3 bucket, chosen so there would never be any difficulty getting through. I wonder if you all are experiencing this? The browser just sits there, wheel spinning. Eventually it sorts itself out, it seems. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/258&quot;&gt;respond here&lt;/a&gt;. (Obviously if you see that, you're probably not having problems getting through, but maybe you did earlier.)</description>

			<description>Funny story. When I ask Alexa to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFz3vdyirR4&quot;&gt;Here Come Those Tears Again&lt;/a&gt; by Jackson Brown, it plays the song, then plays it again, and again and so on. I guess it gets tripped up on the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+again&quot;&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; in the song name? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Come_Those_Tears_Again&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of the song is quite moving. Background vocals by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Raitt&quot;&gt;Bonnie Raitt&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Blue Sky questions</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Basic questions to ask of any would-be successor to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is there a character limit in Blue Sky?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does it support simple styling: bold and italic.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#How_hyperlinks_work_in_HTML&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Titles?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you edit posts?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does it support enclosures, for podcasting?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How about two-way RSS, nice to have. Hook up to simple networks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My criticisms of Blue Sky, having never tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's invite-only. Really? On an open protocol? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's founded by Jack Dorsey, a nice enough fellow, who should sit down after the huge mess he left us with Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The FeedLand platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the FeedLand platform has been ready to be released as open source for some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland&quot;&gt;https://github.com/scripting/feedland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I haven't been focused on that kind of stuff, so I didn't want to create an expectation that there would be a lot of support. That's still true, but the product deserves to be out there, so very quietly last week I made the feedland repo public. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/database/database.md&quot;&gt;SQL commands&lt;/a&gt; that create the FeedLand database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided today was the day to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/151114.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about it, because I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/31&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the database that I want to ask questions about from people with expertise in MySQL, and can't do that publicly without referring to bits that are in that repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Don't read -- spoilers!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was both impossible to watch at times, and in some ways the best most revealing most fun episode ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two sons are complete fucking idiots. And Shiv is her father's daughter and the son he never had. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The moral of this story is the feminist complaint, she was obviously pushed aside because of her vagina, in favor of the idiot penises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And like the previous episode which ended with Kendall smiling (over something stupid), this one ends with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/shivSmile.png&quot;&gt;Shiv smiling&lt;/a&gt; (over something clever and kind of evil). So I guess in the next one it's Roman, right? Five episodes to go. Two more siblings, plus Tom and Greg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who's smiling at the end of the last episode? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Washington Post did some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3AsTRnv&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; (free link, no paywall) to discover the sources behind &quot;AI like ChatGPT&quot; -- and they have a dialog you can use to find out how often certain sites are used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Documenting-the-English-Colossal-Clean-Crawled-Dodge-Sap/40c3327a6ddb0603b6892344509c7f428ab43d81?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template&quot;&gt;Google's C4 dataset&lt;/a&gt; (whatever that is). So of course I checked to see how much data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is included. The answer: 710K tokens, which is 0.0005% of all tokens. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/scriptingquotes.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Some comps: &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.com/&quot;&gt;daringfireball.com&lt;/a&gt; had 610K, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seths.blog/&quot;&gt;seths.blog&lt;/a&gt; had 750K and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kottke.org/&quot;&gt;kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; had 590K.</description>

It was the class that weeded out those who would get graduate degrees from those who would not. The class project was to write a compiler for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122103/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ohearn/Algol/intro.html&quot;&gt;Algol-like language&lt;/a&gt; that the professor desgined. He gave us a set of test apps that we had to compile and run correctly. I didn't get it. I thought code generation was like a magic box. Somehow the machine had a copy of every program you could write, and when it saw you were asking for that one, it would just spit out the code. Knowing what I know now, this was a ludicrous idea, but it's the best your mind can do when you just don't get it. Then there was the moment when I did get it. I started writing a code generator for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop&quot;&gt;while loop&lt;/a&gt;, and plugged it into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler&quot;&gt;compiler-compiler&lt;/a&gt;, and saw what it generated worked. From that point on, it was just writing code. Same thing with the web. I thought of big data centers, until I visited one of the most popular sites on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Underground_Music_Archive&quot;&gt;IUMA&lt;/a&gt;, and found it was just an old Sun terminal and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box_form_factor&quot;&gt;pizza box computer&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on the floor in a random dusty one-room office in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Cruz,+CA/@36.9758914,-122.04748,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808e441b7c36d549:0x52ca104b2ad7f985!8m2!3d36.9741171!4d-122.0307963!16zL20vMGwwbWs&quot;&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;. That's it? I couldn't believe it. So I'm sure there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gestalt&quot;&gt;gestalt&lt;/a&gt; like that for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the magic is a bit of software, as magical (or not) as my compiler, or the pathetic Santa Cruz machine with the huge net presence. I'm sure there's something very mundane behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR64EF3OpA&quot;&gt;curtain&lt;/a&gt;, but for now I love the magic of it and I don't believe the explanations that say it's stupid. It feels really smart to me.</description>

			<description>Another ChatGPT use-case. There's an open source package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;medium-editor&lt;/a&gt; that I use to edit text in most of my products. I believe it's popular, but because of its name, it can be hard to use a search engine to find technical information about it. I wanted to make an instance of the editor the focus by default when its created. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/20/medium-editor-package-familiar.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT how to&lt;/a&gt; do it, and it gave me fantastic docs, because it could sort out what Google simply can't. Incredibly useful. It will, if it works, result in a product that &quot;feels good&quot; -- people probably won't even notice that it did anything unusual. This is what make software excellent. (Update: Still scratching my head over this.)</description>

			<description>This might be my favorite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSyNUAzPofI&quot;&gt;Stones song&lt;/a&gt; because the lead singer is Keith Richards, but he gets a bunch of help from Mick Jagger. It's like magic. Perfect music for 4/20. Always took candy from strangers. Don't want to end up like papa working for the boss every night and day. I need love to keep me happy.</description>

Last night's emails went out with the linkblog items coming from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;new feed&lt;/a&gt;, and if I hadn't said anything I bet most people wouldn't have noticed the markdown styling wasn't rendered on one of the items.
