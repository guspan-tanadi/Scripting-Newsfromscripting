			<description>All the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; emanating out of MastodonLand is blowing my mind. We're all part of the same freaking religion. This has been an incredible day, and I expect tomorrow to be even more so. I have a list of things I want them to look at. For example I think Mastodon's outgoing feeds should support &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; so we can get instant updates. I would be happy to show them how it works and help them do the adaptation. Basically all they have to do is add some info to their feed, and ping a special server when they update the feed. We take care of the rest.</description>

It factors out all the variability, and returns a consistent JavaScript object. Reading an RSS feed is as easy as reading a JSON file. I promise. No bullshit. And btw, it also reads Atom and RDF through the same interface. You don't even have to know what format the file is, all that is taken care of. The point is, reading an RSS file was too hard. So I spent the time to make it simple and easy.</description>

			<description>&amp;lt;item&gt;s in Mastodon feeds do not have &amp;lt;title&gt;s. It's time for all feed readers to not treat this as an error. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/16/itemsWithNoTitlesAreLegalRss.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates. Also repeating the text where the title goes is not useful or correct, and if your reader does that, it should be fixed. RSS is going places now, and if you don't go with it, people are going to notice.</description>

			<title>Follower counts on Masto</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do they play around with follower counts? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At twitter they most certainly do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are people with millions of followers who were given those for being friends of the founders. I don't know if they still do it, but in the early days it was very observable. All of a sudden one day a person who had 200 followers had 10000 and then a million the next day. And many of them were nobodies, and a lot of them were journalists who wrote puff pieces about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We even saw a case where a journo was punished for writing a piece based on leaks from their board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was not a secret. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Artists don't hide</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading a lot of music history. When a new album came out, every musician would listen, in the first days. They’d go to their shows. Listen and let it affect their own creative process.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Beatles went to a Jimi Hendrix show in London and heard him cover Sgt Pepper, a week after the album came out!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software years and years go by and no one looks. Can you believe a book about innovation in languages came out, and no chapter about Frontier. All the new ideas, still not in the vocabulary of designers, decades later, I hope not lost to history.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who think of themselves as friends of mine not willing to spend even five minutes to find out what FeedLand or Drummer are. The first has been out for a month, the latter, a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think you’re practicing software art, but you’ve got yourself cloistered and protected from outside influence, you are a pretender, not an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ask a Jewish boomer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a boomer friend who is Jewish, you might  ask what their parents told them about antisemitism and the Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea that we will end up in the ovens is pretty well-ingrained from all those talks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when a comedian, singer or NBA player talks in dog whistles of their Jew-hate, it pretty much freaks us out. You may hear us laugh but inside we're revisiting our parent's fear and pain, and in their own way, love.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now a delicate subject -- when the singer, comedian or NBA player is black, this has a special sting because we heard the stories your parents told you about encounters with the police. It's an incredible perspective-shift. Some of us are listening and let it sink in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now maybe you can appreciate that &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; parents had the same kinds of talks with us. Our fear is not just of our own personal deaths, but genocide. In the Holocaust they came to kill all the Jews, whole families, neighborhoods. Everyone who was wearing a yellow star. They would line us up in front of ditches and shoot everyone. Then bring in another group and shoot them so their bodies fell on the bodies that were already there. This &lt;i&gt;actually happened&lt;/i&gt; to people of our parents' generation. This wasn't some plot to fool you. It fucking happened. It was only luck that kept them from dying this way, kept them alive so they could be our parents. And to warn us of things happening that are exactly what you are doing. We aren't stupid and we haven't forgotten. We know where you are taking us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I believe if this genocide happens in America they will  come for blacks too, so what you all are doing is not just morally indefensible, it's not going to keep you and your family out of the ditches and the ovens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We should be working together. I always kind of thought we were.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Then bring in another group and shoot them so their bodies fell on the bodies that were already there. This &lt;i&gt;actually happened&lt;/i&gt; to people of our parents' generation. This wasn't some plot to fool you. It fucking happened. It was only luck that kept them from dying this way, kept them alive so they could be our parents. And to warn us of things happening that are exactly what you are doing. We aren't stupid and we haven't forgotten.

			<title>The NBA and hate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a bit of Dave Chappelle's routine on SNL. Very funny how he points out there are a lot of Jews in Hollywood. (That was sarcasm.) I'm sure they're all assholes. No sarcasm there. I had some dealings with them in Napster days. I couldn't believe the ideas they had in defense of their profits. Really scorched earth shit. The sense of entitlement of these people is something to behold. But to be fair, some of them were Christian and while I didn't meet any I bet some of them were black too. That's more a disease of the entertainment business than it is of any one religion or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand most NBA players are black, obviously, and until now I thought they were pretty neutral about Jews. No reason to think otherwise. Until Kyrie Irving lets out the secret, tests the water. It's met with silence from NBA stars. Only LeBron James speaks out, saying he doesn't &quot;respect&quot; what Kyrie said and does not &quot;condone&quot; it. That's it? Was condoning it actually an option? That's all they have to say. Geez if it were a white person saying something equivalent about black people, or god forbid a &lt;i&gt;Jewish&lt;/i&gt; white person, the league would stop and they'd all wear armbands and have candlelight vigils and they (and we, the fans) would force them to divest from the NBA for life. And that would be right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, when you deny the Holocaust you're crawling around in the pain of millions of descendants of Holocaust victims. I am only learning how profound that is, being a child of Holocaust survivors myself, after my parents have been gone for years, enough time to now feel the pain that I grew up in, very much inside me, a big part of my foundation. If you think you can ease the pain of being descendants of slaves by denying the Holocaust, well I don't believe you can, and it's not okay any more than it would be for us to deny that slavery happened, which is something today's Repubs very much are doing. We should be helping each other. I thought we were. But I see how mistaken that was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sensing that antisemitism is one of the foundations of the NBA by their silence, and Dave Chappelle is already known to be a total asshole (why was he hosting SNL). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't expect them to sanction Kyrie, I expect him to be reinstated, and the silent antisemitism to continue. But they let a little truth slip out. And while I was a huge fan of the NBA before, and felt good about it, because they were the one sports league that cared about people and fought against hate, now I can't stand to watch them knowing what I know now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I knew they were racist, btw -- from the way they treated Jeremy Lin. My fault for choosing to overlook that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Later, I heard more of the Chapelle monologue. Exactly as I thought. Blacks go deep into our pain and think it’s power? Does he think the millions of children of victims of the Holocaust run Hollywood? And the silence of NBA stars is deafening. And NBC? Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A feed reading breakthrough</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The feed list page in FeedLand is also a feed reader.  A new kind. All the feeds you're subscribed to are listed in reverse chronologic order. Click the wedge next to any feed to see the five most recent items in the feed. Each time you expand an item it gets the latest stuff. I never anticipated people using this as their only interface to FeedLand, but it works. So I'm thinking about ways to improve it. That's why it's good to have users. You never know what kinds of patterns will develop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/feedlistExpanded.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/feedlistExpanded.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my feed list showing the stories from the BBC expanded. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU9yE_axytQ&quot;&gt; a video demo&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Our feed peering service</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Built into &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is a way to move updates to feeds efficiently and quickly. We use the protocol that's built into RSS 2.0 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. I'm finding out that more people are supporting the protocol than I thought. Last time I checked all WordPress sites support it for example. micro.blog supports it. Since I'm spending more time there these days that was a nice surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I'm describing here are the feeds that users write in FeedLand, not the ones that FeedLand gets from reading feeds. This is a very new feature, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/yourFeed.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;These are feeds that emanate &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; of FeedLand. When I write about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twowayRss&quot;&gt;Two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt; -- I'm talking about FeedLand and hopefully many other writing products. I'm trying to show people how to do this, and why you would want to. If you make a feed reader you might want to include a simple feed writer.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; that's in the screen shot, above. You literally are editing a feed. Any feed reader can subscribe to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it has some extra features that you can use, notably -- the text is provided both as HTML in the description element, and in Markdown in the source:markdown element. The intention here is to seed the use of markdown in feeds, something I was writing about in the summer, when I was developing this feed editor. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to provide a websocket-based service for apps to hook into, to not only get new items in this format, but also updated items. I think since we're starting fresh on federation let's have realtime updating built in from the start. And Markdown support. All the while producing an RSS feed that all feed-reading software understands. No breakage. But a way to move forward. Back when RSS 2.0 was first specified in 2002, there was no Markdown. If there had been we would have built on it as we did with MP3 for podcasting. And while we're at it -- there's OPML in there so tools for thought integrate beautifully with RSS. (I haven't forgotten about OPML.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this is a heads-up. Not sure exactly what form this service will be in. But it will really be simple, that's for sure. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

All the while producing an RSS feed that all feed-reading software understands. No breakage. But a way to move forward. Back when RSS 2.0 was first specified in 2002, there was no Markdown. If there had been we would have built on it as we did with MP3 for podcasting. And while we're at it -- there's OPML in there so tools for thought integrate beautifully with RSS.

			<description>What I really want from AI is for it to sort all my writing into an index, like the index in the back of a book.  i've got 28 years of writing on my site, and there are definitely threads running through it, but i have never been able to visualize those threads. I want the AI to do an editorial job that would be insurmountable for a human. I know I've tried at times to work with editors on that, and they see the scope of it and just give up.

			<description>There are a couple of new features in FeedLand, &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/changenotes/2022/11/11/205211.html?title=newButtonsOnNewsItems&quot;&gt;documented here&lt;/a&gt;. With the first, the Document icon on each news item (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/11/twoNewIconsScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;), you can now link to individual items from a news page on FeedLand, and can of course share that link with others. They will not need to log in. I realized we needed this the other day when I wanted to point to an episode of a podcast, not the podcast feed. We didn't have that ability, now we do. And, a bonus is that we can point to long-form feed items in a comfortable to read format instead of in the middle of all the other items. I found this very useful reading stuff this morning on my iPad. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?item=427416&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a story from The Atlantic. And an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?item=435534&quot;&gt;untitled post&lt;/a&gt; from today's Scripting News. I have to say, I feel so much more powerful now that I can improve my reading environment so easily.</description>

But the insiders are on Twitter, and the story that's coming out at least has some truth behind it. Journalism always tells the same bullshit story.

			<description>ActivityPub and RSS have to come together. It should be possible for a site that produces RSS feeds for each user to peer with a site that uses ActivityPub in the same way. They should have started with RSS, imho, and added whatever they needed via a namespace. I said this in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109329535083378801&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, and was pleasantly suprised by the collegial response. So hopefully you all understand that when I'm saying things like &quot;I need to get my linkblogging tool hooked up to Mastodon,&quot; I've taken part of the problem and put it in simple terms. The goal in coming up with open formats and protocols is to maximize interop. Now we have to go back, and if possible, build a bridge between RSS and ActivityPub.</description>

Today I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden items in a new kind of feed were getting link elements when there were no item-level link elements in the feeds. Okay so I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/reference-entry-link.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what I'm dealing with. My workaround which is ugly, is to consider the link element on an item to be a ghost (ie ignore it) if it has the same value as the guid element. It's bullshit. Nothing in the design of RSS allows me to infer this. But that's what happens with egregious hacks. To live with them you have to do more egregious hacks.

I don't have the ability to do this myself, for quite some time -- I'm the only person working on FeedLand and there's still a lot more to do. The package is MIT licensed, so anyone can do this work, and I don't need all the functionality. Looking for someone to take on this project.</description>

			<description>One of the nice features on Facebook, they show you things you wrote on this day in years past.

			<title>Feed writing in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A big new &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; feature today -- it's now two-way. It's not only useful for feed reading but now it supports feed writing as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's a new command in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/09/editMyFeedCommandScreen.png&quot;&gt;first menu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Edit my feed. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you choose the command, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/08/editboxscreen2.png&quot;&gt;edit box&lt;/a&gt; appears where you can enter a title-less item that goes into your feed when you click the Post button.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the new feature. Any FeedLand user can have a feed. You of course must be logged-in to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;where my feed is&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's very simply an RSS 2.0 feed, public -- which you or anyone else can subscribe to in any app that can read an RSS feed. That includes feed readers like Feedly and NetNewsWire, but it also, innovatively, can included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, a system created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, in place of a blog I write there. To someone reading my feed on micro.blog, because I have included my FeedLand feed, it appears as if I wrote the post there, not over here. And why shouldn't it work that way. This is an example of what I call &lt;i&gt;Two-way RSS.&lt;/i&gt; It's common for blogging systems to support outbound RSS, where what I post there is available outside the blogging system, but it's mind-blowingly powerful if it goes the other way. Very few non-feed reader reading systems support inbound RSS, but imho if they would, web writing would be revolutionized. All kinds of ad hoc connections would be possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two systems I'd like to support this idea are:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Substack -- then I could use any writing tool that produces RSS as output to write essays that then could be received via email. CLearly they already have the technology to do this because they have a feed reader that can subscribe to sources outside of Substack. It's one simple step (imho) to let authors write using their own favorite tools rather than Substack's writing tool, which is nice, but I like the writing environment I already have, as do many other writers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon -- if they did, any app that produced an RSS feed could peer. The Fediverse would then extend futher than it can with ActivityPub because RSS is so widely supported, and easy to implement. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will of course have more to say about this new direction for feeds on the web including a chance to reboot with a safer way to write HTML alsk known as Markdown, another drum I've been beating fairly regularly, lately. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/125&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where, a couple of days ago, I introduced this feature to the inner circle of FeedLand users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ideas for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started thinking and the ideas kept pouring out. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the blue checkmarks, leave them alone. Make a very clear statement and stick to it. Blue checkmarks are Twitter Classic.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let's come up with some more colors -- silver, gold and black (to correspond to different levels of credit cards perhaps).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone can buy a silver checkmark. It means that other people, with a single click, or by hovering over their tag, can find out their real name and whatever other verifiable info the user wants to share publicly. The info comes from the credit card company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;With gold, you get more services and they cost more. Twitter will make introductions to other members who might share interests with you. With this Twitter could get into the businesses of match.com or linkedin.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Black is reserved for Friends Of Elon, whatever that means. People who hang out and smoke weed or travel on Twitter Tours. The kind of perks credit card companies offer. Hey you could even partner with Amex or whatever. Good deals on a Model Y or Starlink. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hey here's another idea. There must be a pool of good names that have been abandoned years ago. Those might be worth money. I'd like to buy a few if they're for sale. Or buy a TLD, maybe .twtr and allow their twitter names to be portable in some sense as afforded by DNS's flexibility. Thinking out loud here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, while I have your attention I used to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;, and the NYT didn't mind. It goes back to the beginning of Twitter and NYT support for RSS. I'd pump links to NYT articles through this Twitter account. Never got an explanation why it was suspended. If you like the ideas can you ask them to let me use that account again? It was fun. Free advertising for the paper of record. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Hey you could even partner with Amex or whatever.

					<source:outline text="Hey here's another idea. There must be a pool of good names that have been abandoned years ago. Those might be worth money. I'd like to buy a few if they're for sale. Or buy a TLD, maybe .twtr and allow their twitter names to be portable in some sense as afforded by DNS's flexibility.

					<source:outline text="BTW, while I have your attention I used to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;, and the NYT didn't mind. It goes back to the beginning of Twitter and NYT support for RSS. I'd pump links to NYT articles through this Twitter account. Never got an explanation why it was suspended. If you like the ideas can you ask them to let me use that account again? It was fun.

			<description>I found a bug in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; I use to build Scripting News. When I change the title of a story the guid in the RSS feed for the site changes, so if you're reading me in a feed reader, you'll see the story again with its new title. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog#v0723----11722-by-dw&quot;&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; for the bug, just haven't deployed it here yet. And my apologies. This bug has been there for a long time. I'm only seeing it now because I'm debugging a feed reader myself.</description>
