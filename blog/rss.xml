			<title>A proposal for newsletter tools</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we could help one of the newsletter distribution companies support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi.html&quot;&gt;Metaweblog API&lt;/a&gt; or  equivalent.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to help design it, and would implement an editor as open source example code to help seed the market. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This would be an easy upgrade for the web, and good publicity for an innovative platform. Let's create a great new market for writing tools for the web. All it takes is one developer to get this going. It's something I would support with all the influence I have.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Writing tools for the web have been languishing. This is easy to fix, it just requires a little leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Pleading for Stallman</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I feel so sad about what's happening to Stallman.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;He's 68&lt;/a&gt;. I know what that's like, I'm 65. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He has fixed his whole existence on a single idea that software should be free. Not free of charge, but free to use and to adapt. It's not that far from the kind of openness I believe in, that I believe is an ethical responsiblity for developers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's useful to have a person like Stallman around, consistently marking an extreme view. It's like knowing there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backpacker.com/survival/how-to-navigate-by-the-stars/&quot;&gt;North Star&lt;/a&gt;, you may not be going to it, exactly, but knowing where it is makes it possible to go other places. And some people agree with Stallman in total, and to them he's their leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you step back and look at what's being said about him, basically people don't like things he says or the questions he asks. I read these things completely factoring out the non-factual stuff, where they tell you what his questions mean in some pure sense, when what they're really saying is what these questions mean to them. To a reasonable person imho they're just questions. Some people don't argue with questions, they just ask them. For the people who attack him, it's the opposite, their questions are accusations. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think Stallman is actually a naive innocent, almost child-like &lt;i&gt;harmless&lt;/i&gt; person. That's based on years of observing him, being connected through communities. Maybe he did terrible things I don't know about. But maybe you have too.  Is this how we're going to coexist? All of us worrying about who's going to make a credible case for destroying each others' lives? This isn't about Stallman, it's about your sense of justice and how far it extends, and how unfair that is for the rest of us who fear being judged by you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A quote from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/05/randombreathlessstuff.html#2&quot;&gt;1994 blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I try not to get offended on principle.&quot; I was quoting someone else, but I've remembered that. Just because I should be offended, doesn't mean, if I'm not actually offended, that I have to pretend I was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: If you still think Stallman should be destroyed, go see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others&quot;&gt;Lives of Others&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful film about intellectuals in East Germany during the Cold War. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The best part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613&quot;&gt;The Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt; is the very last line, with Paul McCartney. &quot;The musical papers which you used to read, started to slag us off because we hadn't done anything, because it took five months to record. And I remember with great glee seeing in one of the papers 'ohh the Beatles have dried up, there's nothing going on, they've been in the studio, can't think, what are they doing. And I was sort of sitting rubbing my hands just saying Oh you just wait.&quot;</description>

			<description>A famous John Lennon quote. He was asked if Ringo was the best drummer he knew. “Ringo wasn’t the best drummer in the world,&quot; Lennon is said to have said. &quot;Let’s face it, he wasn’t even the best drummer in The Beatles.” Ringo complains about that in the video. He says all the other Beatles wish they were drummers. I think we were having our legs pulled.</description>
