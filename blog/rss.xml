			<description>An &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/instantoutlinesrepo/demo/index.html?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/instantOutlines/main/outlines/twitter/davewiner.opml&quot;&gt;outline of my tweets&lt;/a&gt; for the last few days, with threads using the outline structure. I think this is a good way to have tweet streams flow into an outliner. Since it's entirely &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; and uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/outlines/twitter/davewiner.opml&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; in a public repo, any outliner can be part of the network.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/22518571/facebook-substack-bulletin-newsletter-launch&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is coming out with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.substack.com/p/welcome-facebook-and-twitter-seriously&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; killer. Just guessing it comes with its own editor. Yet another crappy writing tool that doesn't peer with other writing tools. This is what kills the web as a writing environment. We should flush all these pieces of crap down the virtual toilet. If you're going to do something with text, please for writers' sake do not require them to use your stinking editor.</description>

			<description>I noticed yesterday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt; may not have a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; for this blog. When you go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210308124857/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of their archive pages, the shell is visible -- the header graphic, title, footer, but the contents is missing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/29/archiveOrgScriptingScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/29/consoleErrors.png&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; in the console, there are errors. If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/08.html&quot;&gt;actual page&lt;/a&gt; on the web, it looks fine. If a simple site like this blog can't be rendered by archive.org, perhaps we are making a mistake by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html&quot;&gt;depending&lt;/a&gt; on it as the record for what was said on the web. The question remains how do you maintain a record for a medium that thrives on its distributed nature that has a chance of lasting for decades or even centuries. The programmers at archive.org have an inhumanly impossible task, with all the experimentation on the web, over time, and like all programmers, they can make mistakes. Developers of websites make mistakes too -- a lot of the early UserLand sites are inaccessible via archive.org because they saw its crawler as a denial of service attack. Obviously our code was wrong, but there's no way to go back and fix the bug. The sites are long gone.</description>

			<description>There should be a limit on the number of times a team can foul one player. When a team exceeds the limit, the team being fouled gets to choose a player on the fouling team who is fouled out of the game. Do it again, lose another player. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack-a-Shaq&quot;&gt;Hack-A-Shaq&lt;/a&gt; isn't good for the game. There's no reason a power dunker like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo&quot;&gt;Giannis&lt;/a&gt; has to be a good foul shooter.</description>

			<description>I start my programming day with a new outline entry where I make notes about the first projects I'm going to do as I start working on code. Inevitably, I think of next steps, so I note them too. At the end of the day, I make notes for the next day, so I never have to worry about showing up to work and having no idea of what I'm supposed to do (this happens sometimes). In the middle, I note anything I might need to remember about the work in teh future, similar to the way a doctor takes notes on your chart as they do an exam, or decide on a plan.</description>

I'm deep in InstantOutlineLand, this time doing lots of documenting, sample code writing, and developing flows of automatically updating outlines so we have something to test against. Not too different from the initial development for various other projects, such as podcasting. You need to do all the chickens and eggs if you want a new protocol to develop.</description>

			<title>Paycasts?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's kind of a shame Apple didn't do something creative with their pricing for podcasts.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, pricing for podcasts, as they have implemented it, is awkward and confusing, as evidenced by the way NPR did it. The pricing is voluntary, according to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2021/06/15/1006687574/support-your-favorite-npr-podcasts-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. You can still listen if you don't subscribe (for money). Not sure how it could work otherwise. Would NPR want to transition Fresh Air, one of the founding podcasts? It's kind of like the Meet The Press of podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But, what if there were something new, call it a &lt;i&gt;paycast&lt;/i&gt; perhaps, where you pay per episode. Maybe $1 per. Flat price, everything costs the same, at least at first. Keep it simple and easy to understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You need a special app so there's no confusion about what's what. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's tied to your credit card. Every time you listen to at least 5 minutes of a podcast, you pay. Put a warning beep at 4 minutes 45 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would love to try this out because I'm pretty sure this is the way web news will ultimately work, and there is no pricing model for podcasts, therefore nothing to displace, unless you consider ads a model, see below. As long as we're trying something new, might as well try something better than what's already out there, from the point of view of users (we're the ones with your money in our pockets).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, no ads please. Ads in podcasts really suck, esp the ones at the beginning. I almost never make it through the ads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A slogan for programmers. &quot;Let's see what happens.&quot; An idea pops into my head. I wonder if that could possibly work? Go for it. Other kinds of product designers, engineers, or screen writers, don't have the luxury that we have. Usually we can try something out and see what happens, and if it blows up, you can shrug and say well I guess it doesn't work. Or maybe it does. Or maybe in its failure it'll give you and idea of what might work. But be careful not to risk actual data. I expect this might show up in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/utils/blob/679fe7641178a7946f4b8aab806e0360f85f960d/daveutils.js#L828&quot;&gt;snarkySlogans&lt;/a&gt; array.</description>

			<description>Over the years I've had lots of friends, people I otherwise respect, who won't listen to sports stories. But sports is good thing to talk about, for the same reason they dismiss it -- sports is of no consequence. It isn't real. It's a human-created pseudo-reality. It doesn't matter. Basketball, to me, is like watching a great chess tournament, with athletic performance and chance playing a bigger role. If you see any meaning in a random event, you've found god. I loved talking with my uncle about this. His Church of the Non-Functional Probabilities. Like an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html#3&quot;&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; during a World Series game in in 1989. &quot;The gods made a deal. the Baseball God said to the Earthquake God: 'we gotta stop this!'&quot; These gods aren't gods of war, or punishment of individuals, they are charged with keeping things mostly in balance. There are rules to baseball and earthquakes. When chance seems to be making a moral statement, that's god. Just a choice of terminology. You could call it anything really. God is the box we put all our imagined reasons for the weirdest coincidences.</description>

And it's also a demo of the NYT's new sharing technology. The link is a gift, which means I am giving it to you, as a NYT subscriber, I can make 10 articles a month free this way. I love that they had the guts to try this. Trae Young, the devil that beat the Knicks in round 1, got his ass kicked last night. And I love that he's taking it the right way. He has heart. “That’s all on me,” Young said. “I’ve got to be better at taking care of the ball and just do a better job of at least getting us a shot. Nine turnovers. I’ve got to do better, and I will do better next game.”</description>

			<description>I have another idea for the NYT if they like the way this turns out. Let readers pay to move an article outside the paywall permanently. Something like an NFT. For example we collectively give the Times $1 million, to make this article available to everyone for free forever. I wrote this idea up a few years ago, have to find a link.</description>

			<description>After writing the stuff about the GitHub API earlier, a solution was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/213#issuecomment-868277650&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out there may be a way to use GH now as a user-controlled storage system. I find this hard to think about, as I imagine it's hard to grasp reading about it, but I'm going to keep plodding along. The goal is basically do we get to have an open app ecosystem on the web, ever -- or is it a lost cause. Seems we're pretty close now?</description>

			<description>I can’t believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.nytimes.com/a-new-way-to-share-new-york-times-stories-3e66e8d7e620&quot;&gt;the NY Times uses Medium&lt;/a&gt; for stories about their development process. I was literally fooled, as a NYT member, when the site asked me to sign on, I thought it would be a NYT login. The Times has one of the most skillfully produced websites in the world, and these are the people who run it, they can't figure out how to set up a section to explain their own innovations? Something is wrong. In any case, we ought to have a place for these kinds of papers that has some plan to survive time. Medium could shut down any day and take its archive with it. The NYT has a responsibility here too, to set an example. When they lean on Medium for archival storage, what are they thinking?</description>

			<description>Okay following up on yesterday's bit about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/24/141650.html?title=githubAsAppStorageContd&quot;&gt;using GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as an app storage system, even though I know it's possible, LogSeq has it working, but I'm not good enough with GIT as an API to figure out how to make it work. I have to table this idea for now and move on. I'm going to use S3 in its place. I know how it behaves, I have simple code to write to it that works. Unfortunately S3 does not come in a user-friendly package, so it doesn't get us anywhere as far as user control of their data. I think this is an ethical mission for devs, akin to the &quot;First do no harm&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere&quot;&gt;edict&lt;/a&gt; for doctors. Don't lock your users in. I want to establish a norm here, for Tools For Thought, that users expect to be able to move their data around where ever they want. Not giving up on this. We've done it before, with RSS, for example. And podcasting still hasn't been siloized, amazingly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Speaking of which the other day the phone rings, I pick up, it's a robot from the gas company, something is very wrong, I need to call this number, which she recites, and goes on, never repeating the number. At the end they threaten that they're going to cut off my supply (which I know legally is hard to do, and btw I'm current with my bill). So I call. I get put on hold. We appreciate your pateince, another robot says. Your call is important. I'm sure. When an actual human comes on the line I am accused of being rude for telling her what her stinking company just did in the middle of my freaking work day. They want to know where the check is. I don't know. My credit is good. Maybe the check got delayed. I hear there are problems with the post office. God bless the robots. And by the way, email is much more efficient! Please.</description>

			<title>The glossary in Little Outliner</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you're new to &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;LO2&lt;/a&gt;, the glossary is a pretty unique feature that goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; in 1995, and was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/downloads/Website%20Tutorial/GlossariesandFilters.html&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; as part of Frontier's website framework. It's a permanent fixture, very useful, and easy once you know what it does and how it works.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The glossary is a substitution table. When a term appears in text being rendered, the term is replaced with its value. So you could define an entry called &quot;my blog&quot; (the quotes are part of the definition) and its value would be a link to your blog. At some time in the future if your blog moves, just change the value of &quot;my blog&quot; and links to the blog will change too, when the text is rendered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/glossary.opml&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; I use in all my pages. It's a public outline. It has to be public for it to work, so you shouldn't put private information into the glossary. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In LO2 a glossary is a two-level outline. At the top level are a set of terms the renderer will look for, and its subordinate text is what it will be replaced with.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/24/glossaryScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of part of my glossary, being edited in my outliner.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To use your glossary outline, here's what you do:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Make the outline public. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Choose the View OPML command in the File menu to get a link to the glossary outline. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put the URL on the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In an outline where you want to use the glossary, choose Edit OPML Head from the file menu, and add an attribute to the table.

			<title>GitHub as app storage, cont'd</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/23.html#a221440&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/174309.html?title=isGithubRawStorageReliable&quot;&gt;bits&lt;/a&gt; about using GitHub as a storage system for a community of apps.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea matches the as-yet unachieved ideal of using the web as an operating system, that for me goes back to 1994. It's the potential I saw when I first understood how HTTP works. Now in 2021, the one thing the web OS doesn't have is reliable storage for users that multiple apps can access to edit and render on the user's behalf. The same way you might have a text file on your desktop, that you write in a word processor (of your choosing, this is important) and send it over email, put it in a tweet, or a Facebook post, or print it. Or any of a million other uses. The key thing is the text file is yours. Not just for Mac or Windows, for everyone, anywhere. It's the wedge we need to be able to build a new world that's been technically possible for a couple of decades now. :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's important that we're using GIT which is an open and often-cloned data structure. You could move your data to another GIT provider if GitHub proved too expensive, or their service was failing, or really any reason at all. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dropbox was getting close to this idea, but they pulled back. That's why I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, which used Dropbox for storage. But no other app could access Fargo's outline files. They couldn't even access public files, that's the feature they withdrew. They had reasons to change course, not faulting the company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LogSeq&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The main reason I picked up using GitHub as storage, again (I had experimented in 2017 with a GitHub-backed &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/english/&quot;&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt;) is that another app developer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; is going down this path: using GitHub as a place for users to store their data. Even better LogSeq is an outliner! And even better, they're supporting &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;. So now it gets interesting. I can imagine a user opening an outline in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; because it has a feature they need, and then opening the same file in &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt; because it has features that Drummer doesn't. This is the nirvana we've been waiting so long for. And we're close to having it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;GitHub is tempting, but there appear to be problems when accessed through their API, as I am doing. For example, if I saved a file to a user's repo, it might take 20 minutes before the changed version showed up to other apps. There must be a cache somewhere in there. I don't have a clear statement of how GitHub works here, maybe it's out there, but I wanted to do a reality check. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;LogSeq says they use a Node package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git&quot;&gt;Isomorphic-Git&lt;/a&gt;. It has been reliable. But there are other problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/213&quot;&gt;started a thread&lt;/a&gt; on this. Maybe we can figure this out. Or maybe it's something we come back to periodically until it works. We'd love to hook up with people at GitHub, after we've explored all other options. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Revisiting Glitch, a year later</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/&quot;&gt;April 2020&lt;/a&gt; I gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+glitch&quot;&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a unique free Node.js hosting service, that cuts out a lot of the complexity in creating and managing network apps. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; project, run by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Dash&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt;, both people I've known for many years. Early bloggers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; is founder of Stack Exchange, Trello and many other projects, and now is super rich, probably a billionaire, after selling both his hits to big companies. I knew him when he was a normal ex-Microsoft NYC-based developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I succeeded at getting several apps running on Glitch last year, but it wasn't simple for me, an experienced Node developer. That's okay. I left them the apps there, and they continued to work. But when I tried to update my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; installation on Glitch to the latest version, all of a sudden I'm getting errors from Node that make no sense. Things that worked before. There have been hardly any changes in PagePark in the last year. I have no idea what the problem is. And I'm concerned it might take days to figure it out and get things working properly. And these are days I don't have. Trying to complete Drummer, my latest product release, and help users get going in the OPML ecosystem (which is why I was drawn back to Glitch in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I'm trying to figure out what's the best use of my time. Glitch is inexpensive, but not the least expensive way to run a server, if you don't want the server to go to sleep. It takes (it seems) a minute or more for it to wake up. Perhaps that's the incentive to get you to pay. I'd understand that. But their &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/pricing&quot;&gt;price&lt;/a&gt; is $8 a month, paid annually. I can host a server on Digital Ocean for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new&quot;&gt;$5 a month&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pay as you go. If you use the server for a week you pay for a week. And while I appreciate that Glitch is trying to make it easier by factoring and editing in the browser (good things to do!), Digital Ocean makes it as easy as possible to get started using standard Linux at the command line, and their docs are excellent, the best I've seen. It's what got me to switch from AWS in the first place (their docs are impossibly bad). I've been using Digital Ocean for years now, and the other thing I like about it is that my apps continue to work, they don't break them, as apparently has happened on Glitch (which is okay, not complaining, just making a decision).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then something amazing happened. After writing this post, all of a sudden &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;PagePark-on-Glitch&lt;/a&gt; is working. Fuck me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; project, run by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Dash&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt;, both people I've known for many years. Early bloggers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; is founder of Stack Exchange, Trello and many other projects, and now is super rich, probably a billionaire, after selling both his hits to big companies. I knew him when he was a normal ex-Microsoft NYC-based developer." created="Wed, 23 Jun 2021 15:08:02 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/02/mrFrog.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/145559.html?title=revisitingGlitchAYearLater#a150802"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway, I succeeded at getting several apps running on Glitch last year, but it wasn't simple for me, an experienced Node developer. That's okay. I left them the apps there, and they continued to work. But when I tried to update my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; installation on Glitch to the latest version, all of a sudden I'm getting errors from Node that make no sense. Things that worked before. There have been hardly any changes in PagePark in the last year. I have no idea what the problem is. And I'm concerned it might take days to figure it out and get things working properly. And these are days I don't have. Trying to complete Drummer, my latest product release, and help users get going in the OPML ecosystem (which is why I was drawn back to Glitch in the first place)." created="Wed, 23 Jun 2021 14:49:47 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/145559.html?title=revisitingGlitchAYearLater#a144947"/>
				<source:outline text="So now I'm trying to figure out what's the best use of my time. Glitch is inexpensive, but not the least expensive way to run a server, if you don't want the server to go to sleep. It takes (it seems) a minute or more for it to wake up. Perhaps that's the incentive to get you to pay. I'd understand that. But their &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/pricing&quot;&gt;price&lt;/a&gt; is $8 a month, paid annually. I can host a server on Digital Ocean for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new&quot;&gt;$5 a month&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pay as you go. If you use the server for a week you pay for a week. And while I appreciate that Glitch is trying to make it easier by factoring and editing in the browser (good things to do!), Digital Ocean makes it as easy as possible to get started using standard Linux at the command line, and their docs are excellent, the best I've seen. It's what got me to switch from AWS in the first place (their docs are impossibly bad). I've been using Digital Ocean for years now, and the other thing I like about it is that my apps continue to work, they don't break them, as apparently has happened on Glitch (which is okay, not complaining, just making a decision)." created="Wed, 23 Jun 2021 14:52:23 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/145559.html?title=revisitingGlitchAYearLater#a145223"/>
				<source:outline text="But then something amazing happened. After writing this post, all of a sudden &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;PagePark-on-Glitch&lt;/a&gt; is working. Fuck me." created="Wed, 23 Jun 2021 14:59:00 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/23/145559.html?title=revisitingGlitchAYearLater#a145900"/>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Journalism, academia, government and the corporate world all hire from the same talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They go to the same universities, get their news from the same sources. Corporate people take government jobs, then go back to the corporations. The people move fluidly in and out of each bucket. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So you get the same story, the reality they believe in, developed over centuries, that is radically different from the reality most other people experience. The story recited daily at CNN, MSNBC, The New Yorker, NYT. The world changes, again and again, and the story they tell is how angry this makes them, and how everyone must snap back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;New technologies can make change possible, like the one we're using now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We would never have Trump if it weren't for Twitter. Imagine someone saying that sentence 20 years ago. It would pay to have that kind of imagination built into journalism, and it is available. The incumbents, like the Democratic incumbents, will have to be left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today we can't rely on journalism, not because of a campaign run by Russians or Republicans or billionaires. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They think the problem is that we don't see what they see, but I think it's the other way. They hold on to a normalcy that is gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They can't see what they can't see.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
