			<description>I had a mentor back when I was a software entrepreneur. He told a metaphoric story how in the army they teach soldiers if they see a dead enemy on the side of the road, you should put a bullet in his head, just to be sure.</description>

			<description>Spoiler alert. I was pretty sure I had the answer to today's Wordle puzzle, so I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdSa5kJb-yw&quot;&gt;screen recording&lt;/a&gt; of the reveal, to capture the animation, so I could experience it over and over. Now you can too. But of course if you haven't solved today's puzzle -- this is a spoiler.</description>

			<title>The Putinites in America</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;So much disappointment in what Biden said about Putin. As I've &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1508069853193773057&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, I don't care. Putin has to go, whether or not Biden said it out loud. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/01/29/uncleSamRoulette.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;But there's a much more dangerous despot-in-waiting here in the good old US of A.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He tried to overthrow the government and came incredibly close to doing it. I remember while it was going on, wondering if the entire US Congress was being executed while we were watching the riot. If the attackers had been somewhat better organized, that's exactly what would have been going on. And how would our country ever recover from that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The coup didn't work, but that was only luck. The organizers are still free, and they're getting ready for Coup II and this one is going to work. They're using our own laws to pre-rig the outcome of the next national election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So to President Biden, who was refreshingly honest and open about Putin (and I don't think it was a gaffe, btw) what are we going to do about the Putinites in America?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: The only punishment for Trump was he lost his TWTR.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: No one scanned them for weapons as they entered the Capitol. That the Capitol was completely undefended can't have been an accident. I wasn't born yesterday and neither were you. If that had happened in another country would have believed there wasn't help on the inside?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>I remember Watergate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember Watergate and the Gerald Ford pardon of Richard Nixon. Because right now that's the prior art. That's the event we're paying for now, and it seems as if we're about to repeat the mistake Ford made. While all the attention is focused on Putin and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember Watergate. And I remember the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon&quot;&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt;, and remember that some people were very angry about it but I wasn't -- I was relieved. Finally we could stop obsessing over Nixon. He was obviously guilty right from the outset. Yet it took what seemed an incredibly long time to get from the initial reports of the break-in to his waving goodbye from the White House lawn as he left for the last time. That was the way I wanted to remember Nixon.

I got a lot of shit from devs who said they don't make shitty software, but in fact, they do. All devs do. Those that don't know they do don't know to set up a process that accounts for the shittiness of their software. A corollary -- some of the shittiest software is made by devs who think their software &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; shitty.</description>

That doesn't mean that people you invite to enter your house should be allowed to go through your private stuff. It may not be illegal, but we still recognize it as wrong. In the same way, you have &quot;free speech&quot; in America, even when it isn't the government restricting your speech, when it's your employer, school, family or friends. No law prohibits them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1357/&quot;&gt;point&lt;/a&gt;, but being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans of all persuasions, wrong, un-American.</description>

			<title>Are African-Americans fungible?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First let me say up front that, of course, African-Americans are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fungible. It's a stupid question, but I didn't raise it -- the Supreme Court process did, over many decades of the comings and goings of black justices and also women.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So -- are racism and genderism part of the Supreme Court process? Yes they are and I can prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall&quot;&gt;Thurgood Marshall&lt;/a&gt; retired, the Repubs replaced him with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=who+replaced+thurgood+marshall&quot;&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the &quot;African-American&quot; seat's significance was supposedly preserved. Marshall was the Supreme Court's first African-American justice. Thomas is the second.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;African-Americans are fungible, they seemed to say. Of course Marshall and Thomas, even though both were black, were almost exact opposites in philosophy and rage-suppression. The former was very liberal, a highly respected scholar, and the latter is fascist and resentful, and the depths of his depravity are only now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1086535100/wife-of-justice-thomas-rebuts-claims-of-conflict-of-interest&quot;&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; died, she was replaced with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett&quot;&gt;ACB&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>A philosophical question</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Constitution says the government can't conduct unreasonable searches, without a warrent or probable cause. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone you have invited into your house goes through your private stuff. Reads your diary, your financial records, calendar, contacts list. Looks in your medicine cabinet, your collection of drugs, legal and illegal, sex toys. Etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Should you be prevented from writing a tweet or a blog post about how it felt to be violated that way? Would it be fair to rebut the post by talking about the Constitution? Can you imagine someone actually doing that? (I can't, it would seem pretty cruel.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, with the question posed this way, it's ridiculous to think someone would be condemned for expressing their thoughts and feelings about being so violated. Note that I didn't say their rights were violated, in any legal sense. But their rights were violated in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might not be illegal for someone you invite into your house to violate your privacy, but legality isn't the only thing we're permitted to write about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I've written about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/18.html#a161837&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. As I go deeper into this project, I'm becoming more resolved that I'm only going to support a subset of feeds. What will come out of it will not be a feed reader in the sense that people think of them for the last 20 or so years. They all try to read everything, and that makes it hard to go beyond the intersection of features found in all feeds. I don't see any point in producing yet another one of those. If people producing blogging software want to give this another shot, they should be ready to retool, a bit. Not very much. Maybe not at all (if you've been considerate in your feeds). And not breaking anything. This is absolute. I will not break anyone either with feeds I produce (I write a popular blog and make blogging software.) Which is a bit tricky because there are important features in my feeds that most readers don't support thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/03/15/oneGreatThingAboutTheDemiseOfGoogleReader.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. This is how everything got broken. I want to go back to before this all became such a mess, and slowly and carefully pull through something beautifully simple and easy to work with. And then go from there. Not leaving the past behind, but also not being limited by it. It's possible. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I gotta say there are a few public figures who, if they died tonight, I'd do a little jig, drink a toast, in private of course. In anticipation my heart beats a little faster. Oh could we be so lucky! I'd put a George Harrison &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIbVWNy7HBk&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; on the speaker, only &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; with sarcasm.</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Severance&lt;/a&gt; on AppleTV+. It's good science fiction, good acting, a bit of a mystery that unravels slowly. The cast is amazing.</description>

			<title>If money is speech...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1505904993223725058&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi tweets&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You're probably paying for Putin TV.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He's right, you are. If you have a basic cable package that includes Fox News, you're paying your share to keep Tucker Carlson on the air. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Joe, I think this would be an incredible political cause to raise a fuss about. Focus the spotlight on how we're subsidizing Fox. I think that law, whatever it is that makes this possible or necessary, needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's as fundamental as the First Amendment. I should not be required to fund speech that I find abhorrent. The Supreme Court ruled that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC&quot;&gt;money is speech&lt;/a&gt;. Let's get some lawyers working on this! Make news. It's the kind of issue Repubs raise huge money on. And it pisses me off that my money goes to fund the destruction of our political system. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote about this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/01/27.html#a160229&quot;&gt;1/27/2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
