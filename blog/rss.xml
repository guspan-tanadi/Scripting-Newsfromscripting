I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/163100.html?title=starlinkSetup&quot;&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; installed as a backup, and it wasn't working very well last time I tried it, presumably because it didn't have a good view of the sky. I thought this might change in the winter when all the leaves are gone, and I'm happy to report that it did. The service is &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/13/speedtestscreen.png&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt;!

			<description>BTW, yesterday we paused new signons to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. There were a lot of reasons for this. First, I didn't want a lot of users. I think of FeedLand as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt; global feed management system. Not wanting in any way to compete with the huge systems, to create yet another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1602663488157089795&quot;&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; like Twitter. I felt that we already had too many users for my liking. At some point the load on the server is going to be a problem, I wanted to stop well before we got to that point. Also, I want to do some development that would be harder with new users coming online. Remember this is not a corporate site. I am the only person working on the software and I'm responsible for keeping the service running at a technical level, and dealing with trolls, spammers and abusers, which thankfully have not been a problem yet, but I know from experience that it's just a matter of time.</description>

			<description>There's this great line in Sleeper where the character played by Woody Allen was asleep for 100 years and when he woke wanted to know how the world was destroyed. They said a guy named Albert Shanker got a nuclear weapon. That's a 1970s NYC joke. If you knew Albert Shanker, you'd get it. If they were remaking the movie now instead of Albert Shanker it'd be Elon Musk and instead of a nuke it'd be Twitter and instead of being science fiction it'd be true. Now that's still an Albert Shanker joke, but soon there will be plenty of Elon Musk jokes. Lots of them. I'm never wrong about things like this btw. ;-)</description>

			<description>BTW, this was the first time I wrote one of these HowTos that is part prose and part code. I love the way it turned out. I didn't plan on talking to feed reader devs on behalf of writers, but I think we all need to focus on who we're doing all this for, and it's primarily writers imho and then readers, and to the extent that programmers matter, it's just teeeny little bit. If this were a restaurant, we've designed things solely from the point of view of waiters, ignoring chefs and diners. That's how far off course we've gotten. We value tech too much esp when tech has done such a bad job as we have in feed reading user experience.</description>

			<description>No wonder the writing and reading environment of the web in 2022 is so awful. We ignore the writers and the readers. Every time one of us speaks up, we get a chorus of agreement from other writers and readers, and then totally ignored by the developers. One example I'm constantly reminded of, because I often read the NYT on my iPad, it &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; interrupts my reading to put up a dialog asking if I want to read the article in their app. Even worse, they wait long enough so that I have already started reading the article. It's as if they &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; me to hate them. They say the app is much better. Well, I don't want to do that, for good reason, and it's none of their freaking business but there's no way to turn this dialog off. I pay them a lot of money to read their articles. And every time I open one of their stories on my iPad I'm reminded how much they hate me, and vice versa.</description>

			<title>How to find new feeds in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Talking with a friend who uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; today, the question came up as to how you find new feeds that might be interesting. So here are a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you don't want to do a lot of work, start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt;. I subscribe to a lot of feeds, more than anyone else. Now here's the cool part. If you see a checkbox that isn't checked that means you aren't subscribed to it. Just click on the checkbox to subscribe. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Start with a feed you like, on your &lt;i&gt;Feed List&lt;/i&gt; page. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/11/feedlistScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the title of the feed, which takes you to the &lt;i&gt;Feed Info&lt;/i&gt; page. At the end of the page is a list of other people who subscribe to that feed. Click on a name to see their Feed List page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;i&gt;Recent users&lt;/i&gt; from the first menu. It takes you to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?userslist&quot;&gt;list of users&lt;/a&gt; who have recently used FeedLand. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/11/recentUsersScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Click on any name to go to their feed list. There are the checkboxes again. You can play with the sort order on the Recent Users page, you can see the people who have used FeedLand the most (that's the &lt;i&gt;Hits&lt;/i&gt; colum) or are subscribed to the most feeds (the &lt;i&gt;Ct&lt;/i&gt; column) or have been using it the longest (click twice on the &lt;i&gt;Started&lt;/i&gt; column). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

I have no idea who else is involved, how big it is, and how much power it has. But I find it interesting and believe it's well-intentioned, so I participate. They ask you to look at posts and rate relevance, sources, context. None of the messages have profanity or are abusive or personal (some contain assumptions that are). I think there must be filters in place that see the items before people like me do. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/10/communityQuestion.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of something they asked me to look at.

			<title>My manifesto for feed reader developers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, credit and respect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt; for helping steer Mastodon to titleless feeds. That's a mega-contribution to moving toward turning the web into a functional writing environment instead of the utterly broken mess stemming from when Twitter and Google Reader couldn't come together on micro-blogging and feeds. Imagine if they had worked it out. We'd be so much further ahead. That was in 2007. Writing on the web has been broken since then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now most feed readers imho are broken, even the beloved products we depend on every day. We can love them even though they're wrong. I can't be mushy about this. Wrong is wrong. But we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; that is both code and prose, I say what I think the purpose of feeds are, to serve writers and readers, and there is no room for the wants of programmers, esp when it's so easy to do what the writers want us to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been nice about this for a long time. We need to get together, users and developers and get this fixed so we can start adding more features to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/whatIsADocument/&quot;&gt;common feature set&lt;/a&gt; of writing environments for the web. We can easily get unstuck if we decide to get unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A prototype for a feed reader</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than just preaching how feed readers could easily accommodate both titled and title-less items, as I have been, I put up a prototype that illustrates, with real data. It's not a lot of work, I developed this from scratch in one full programming day. Still have a little work tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it deals with three test feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.nytimes.com%2Fservices%2Fxml%2Frss%2Fnyt%2FWorld.xml#&quot;&gt;NYT feed&lt;/a&gt;. It's an easy case because the NYT feeds are uniform. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News feed&lt;/a&gt; contains both titled and title-less posts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;My Mastodon feed&lt;/a&gt;, where all items are title-less. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will publish the source tomorrow, and hopefully skilled UI designers will have a look and then maybe we can approach the developers at each of the feed reader developers, and get past this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I have 20-20 vision for the first time in my life. Seeing so much more in a lot of ways. I told a friend today it's like I have Tesla eyes. I know people don't like Tesla these days, but I still feel like it's a privilege to drive my Model Y every time, even though I've been driving it for over a year now. It's a feeling of able-ness no car has ever given me. And that's the feeling my new eyes give me. I've been dis-abled seriously for years now. And my vision never really worked, even when I was a kid. I remember getting glasses for teh first time in second or third grade. I never knew there was so much writing in the world, everywhere. It's like that except at an age where such discoveries are pretty rare. I think this experience will fade away as my new eyesight becomes the norm, but for now, it's given me a new youth-like experience, pretty cool.</description>

			<description>A fact I've observed. Most programmers who work on web content systems not only aren't writers, they don't make an effort to know or understand writers. The really good products, the ones writers like to use are not surprisingly written and designed by programmers who are also writers.

			<title>Feed items without titles</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to be true to the intent of the author of a feed, and create a good experience for the reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the real world some feed items have titles and some don't. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/08/itemsWithoutTitles.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. I've put red arrows pointing to the items that don't have titles. You could argue I suppose that they should have titles. That I should take a 9-word item and give it a two-word title. But I don't do that. And it shows up in my feed without a title, because the item does not have a title. And that's not up to anyone but me, the author of the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/08/readerviewitemswithouttitles.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of how a popular feed reader displays those items. It isn't terrible, but it's imho wrong. The first item has a [no title] message where a title would go. Why? Look at it from the human reader point of view. What information does that convey, above what the writer was saying, in bigger type and in bold. &lt;b&gt;NO TITLE&lt;/b&gt;. I don't know about you but to me that looks like criticism, an error message, from the software to the person who wrote the post. Sometimes all the posts show up with that message. This time only one did. And for the others, they repeat the first bits of the post. Again, why? The human read them once, why put the same words they just read on the screen again? That seems quite wrong to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't know why they designed their software this way, but I can guess -- when they started they designed it assuming all posts had titles, and it took a while before they discovered that some items don't. So they shoehorned those into the app without disrupting the design of the product. But this has been going on for a very long time, many years, basically since Google Reader decided, incorrectly, that all feed items must have titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Mastodon supporting RSS, and Mastodon booming in popularity, feed readers should expect to see a lot more feeds with items without titles, unless for some reason Mastodon does what Twitter did many years ago, under pressure from Google Reader to add titles to items, and just withdraws the feeds. All because they couldn't adjust to a reality they hadn't planned for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so what's the answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Never display NO TITLE. It's not a good use of your space, the reader's time and it's wrong. The author didn't use those words. They're your words. You don't have a right to put your words in space reserved for the words from feeds. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Instead display the first words from the description element of the item where you would put the title. If there are too many words, flow them into the space you've allocated for the description, but &lt;i&gt;do not repeat words&lt;/i&gt; from the description. Again, you'd displaying something that isn't in the feed. The author did not repeat the words, so you can't do that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it, unless I'm missing something, and if I am, tell me. You can send me email, dave@scripting.com, and if you don't want me to publish it, say so and I won't. I don't want to embarrass anyone, I just want to solve this problem and move on to a feed world where feeds with items without titles are handled well by the reader software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, one more thing, some feeds will have both kinds of posts, items with titles and items without. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; is like that. The item for this post will have a title because the post has a title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I don't know how to say this without pissing a bunch of people off, but I have to say it anyway. It's not ActivityPub that's booming now, it's Mastodon, which happens to use ActivityPub. The problem with ActivityPub is that it is basically incomprehensible. I don't know why it is that way. I could clear my schedule for the next three months and then at the end, I'd be able to tell you why it is that way. But I can't do that, because I have stuff to do with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; and I want to get back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; soon. I have users and I want to do stuff for them. As curious as I am to find out what's there, someone else will have to do that work. What we need is this. A simple package for Node, a lot simpler than the ones that are out there, that covers the basic functionality of things users do in Mastodon interactively, without using Mastodon, just ActivityPub. Create a new post, edit an existing post, boost a post, like one. Follow someone. Etc. Over on Mastodon a few people are talking about Bear Hugs. I didn't remember, but that's a term &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/15/the-bearhug/&quot;&gt;Steve Gillmor coined&lt;/a&gt; (I believe) for what I did with RSS. I basically kept building stuff with it, and getting content people on board until RSS on its own meant something. Then I let it go. We need that for ActivityPub. The people who won't like this are the members of the W3C. I'm afraid they think AP is done. Mastodon is already doing things outside of AP. I don't blame them. I would do the same thing. They have an API, they are using RSS, both of which are comprehensible. I think AP deserves to be comrepehensified, it deserves a bear hug. BTW, Steve Gillmor is to tech as Steve Bannon is to MAGA. Very much the same concept, imho.</description>

Another interesting weirdness, as I've been working on software this week I can now see that I have been mis-spelling the names of things all over the place. I have a practice of copying and pasting names when I want to refer to a value or call a function, so as the mis-spellings propagate, my code still runs without errors. I really have been transformed into an able-eyed person in just one little operation. My dreams, also amazingly, have become more vivid and memorable and also gratifying (no more information forthcoming in re this).

Good example code to get started with the Mastodon API. Also illustrates how easy feeds (RSS, Atom, RDF) can be incorporated into any Node app with the reallySimple package. Finally, I hope to start building a rep in the Mastodon development community with this package. I hope to make quite a few contributions in the future.

Or you find out some app is running in Google's cloud and Google is destroying the web. I have another one. I use Digital Ocean for hosting and S3 for storage. You might want to check out who owns those services and decide if you still like me. (I use DO because they have great docs and good prices. I use S3 because it was a breakthrough product when it came out and I totally needed what they offered and I loved what they were doing, and now I'm pretty well locked-in.) And I chose Twitter for identity in 2014 because identity is a human-intensive bitch and they were offering to let me use theirs for $0. I solved the problem long ago and baked it into my system. I could bake something else in, and I would, quickly if they broke us. But so far I've been able to spend my time on more productive and fun development work. Maybe I'm giving something up. Yeah, there are a lot of choices in life. You never know what was down the road you didn't take.</description>

The piece has been &quot;boosted&quot; (the Masto equiv of RT) 1.1K times, yet I only have 3.7K followers there. Meanwhile on Twitter, where I have 69K followers, it has been RTd just 17 times.
