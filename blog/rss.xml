			<title>Radical ideas for political pubs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1444705859582533635&quot;&gt;Idea&lt;/a&gt;. For a few weeks, assign a reporter to read the Twitter comments for all the stories, but don't announce anything. Look for people who write intelligent comments with new ideas that people in your circle never come up with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are out there, might take some effort to find them. Recruit new ideas. We need you to do that. Be a contrarian. In journalism the assumption is that comments are disgusting. Take an opposite view for a short period of time, and see objectively if there aren't some diamonds out there in the middle of all the crap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another radical idea for political pubs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear blogs are back? They call them newsletters now. They all have RSS feeds, of course. How about gathering a list of all the newsletters people on your staff read, publish the list, and run a river of all their letters, when they come out. A way of revealing your sources in a new dimension. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Build relationships with the smartest of them. Become known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connoisseur&quot;&gt;connoisseurs&lt;/a&gt; of political thought. How could that hurt your pub? Pay special attention to ones that criticize your specific publication. Always listen to your most passionate users, that's how you improve over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I read about how Biden's popularity is dropping, I wonder if there's any reality to this. If it were really a troubling sign that means in the next election, Americans will do what Germans did in 1932, we'll vote into power a fascist party, and open the US to concentration camps and mass exterminations of our own citizens. You may think this is wild, but before Covid the idea of 700K Americans dying of a disease that was largely preventable, because of disinformation from the government itself, that would have seemed like a paranoid delusion. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05/aDeadlyVirusIstakingOverTheWorldAndTheUnitedStatesDoesntHaveAGovernment.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/&quot;&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to preserve that perspective. If the US actually does vote Repubs into power, we deserve what we get.</description>

			<description>Here's the big problem with Ted Lasso season 2. You have to like at least one character in a sitcom like Ted Lasso. That was the charm of season one, the star, the person the show is named after, was very likeable, and so were almost all of the others. Nice people, you cheer for them. This season you have to brace yourself because at any moment the formerly likeable Ted Lasso is going to do something supremely assholelike. I'm not joking. Come on. Anyway it's just like Apple to switch the user interface radically without any warning, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs&quot;&gt;ask Gruber&lt;/a&gt; about where they moved the freaking &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/use-tabs-for-webpages-sfri11576/mac&quot;&gt;tabs&lt;/a&gt; in the new version of Safari. It's conceivable that a character could reveal a very well hidden dark side and pull it off, but it's not very common and they totally don't pull it off.</description>

There's over &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;four years&lt;/a&gt; worth of archives there to play with.

			<description>Facebook tells me today is &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakesav.in/&quot;&gt;Jake Savin's&lt;/a&gt; birthday. He's a young man, I don't know exactly how young. Jake worked at &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/span&gt; on Manila. Oct 1 was also my dear departed &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;uncle's birthday&lt;/a&gt;, it would have been his 76th. I miss him every day. He would have loved the web, especially Wikipedia. Ken was always looking stuff up in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please&quot;&gt;Information Please Almanac&lt;/a&gt;. Ken's mind would no doubt be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outspanned/status/1437301987884871682&quot;&gt;blown&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis is legal in much of the US, at least the parts of the US you'd want to visit. He grew the best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikileaf.com/thestash/what-is-sinsemilla/&quot;&gt;sinsimilla&lt;/a&gt; back in the 70s and 80s. I was trying to explain to a friend what that was, to no avail because all weed is seedless these days. Ken had an efficient way of killing off the male plants. He'd cover and uncover his seedlings with a blanket to simulate spring. The tiny baby plants would flower, and thus reveal their gender. Only the female plants produce the resin that humans like so much. 😀</description>
