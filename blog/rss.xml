			<description>I heard from a friend of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Gary Sevitsky&lt;/span&gt;, a colleague of mine in the late 70s at the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/span&gt;. He and I were both smokers and grad students in Computer Science, so we'd go out for smoking breaks together while working at the Unix lab on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/1210+W+Dayton+St,+Madison,+WI+53706/@43.0711993,-89.4087568,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8807accf34599401:0xcbdcc82ca4309b0f!8m2!3d43.0711993!4d-89.4065681&quot;&gt;West Dayton St&lt;/a&gt;. It was in one of our hallway smoking conversations that he told me about Lisp editors that understood structure. I loved the idea, but I was programming in C, so I decided to build an editor for that language, with the same idea. That started me down a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;path&lt;/a&gt; that to this day I'm still working on. The combination of outline structures and programming, it's a big deal. I never spoke with him after leaving &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Madison&lt;/span&gt;, and after the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/guy-kawasakis-remarkable-people/id1483081827?i=1000528857811&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I heard from a friend of his who said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/stamfordadvocate/name/gary-sevitsky-obituary?pid=190783474&quot;&gt;Gary had died&lt;/a&gt; at age 57, in 2013. He was a kind, brilliant man, and a friend from one of the best times of my life.</description>

			<description>In the future, kids will learn about the attempt to overthrow the government that failed, but they let the coup leaders stay in Congress and they tried again, and again, and again. Kids of the future will wonder why the people of America didn't force the politicians to evict the terrorists. Instead, it took 20 years to get them out of the government, in the meantime the planet became unlivable, billions died and civilization basically dissolved. Right now that's the story that should be being reported in the news. Wait longer, the story gets worse.</description>

			<description>I'm still trying to figure out how to use &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt;. The goal is to create an index, like the index in the back of a book. Maybe when I have enough tags I will be able to create a book from my writing here? It approximates the way we did the index in the back of software manuals at &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/span&gt;. Hmm. Maybe tagging would work well for the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; docs? Also my apologies to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; readers, for some reason the tags don't show up in emails. I have to figure out why, but I'm not working near there at this time.</description>

			<description>I never expect to hear any challenging ideas on cable tv news, but yesterday I actually did hear one, in passing, from a surprising source, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;John Heilemann&lt;/span&gt;, who I think of as the ultimate &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jheil&quot;&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;. A good looking person, speaks well, but just shovels shit. But yesterday he said something &quot;out there&quot; not on the script they're all singing from on CNN and MSNBC. He said that Biden's response to the threat to democracy is too weak. He said if Biden was really signed on, he'd be putting roadblocks in the Repubs' way, every day. Using the incredible communication system that the White House can be, if used bravely, to expose the threat, again: Every. Damned. Day. I just gave &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/span&gt;, Dan Gillmor and Jay Rosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1420401709214572545&quot;&gt;grief&lt;/a&gt;, for only being willing to dip a toe in the water on the mess we're in. Trippi had an episode where he must've mentioned my name 20 times, but he never told his listeners &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/08.html#a152650&quot;&gt;what I told him&lt;/a&gt; he had to do. And of course he's not doing it. Presumably because he's still holding on to the option of having a career if the Repubs prevail? Doesn't he see that won't happen. And we're all about the same age, in our mid-60s. This isn't time to be thinking about our careers, it's a time in our lives when we can afford to take some risks. Think about it next time you decide to play it safe. (That's the problem with every successful person, you can't trust them, even when they're old, they're so set in the groove of safe-playing, they'll never actually do anything to change how things work. And very few young people are willing to risk, or would know what to do if they did.)</description>

			<description>&lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;White Lotus&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;HBO&lt;/span&gt; got really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-white-lotus/season-1&quot;&gt;good reviews&lt;/a&gt;, so I gave it a try. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-white-lotus%2Fseason-1&quot;&gt;sucks&lt;/a&gt;. Often overwhelmingly cringe-worthy. However I have watched the first three episodes and I can see that I'm probably going all the way. I also tried &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Manifest&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/span&gt;, a former NBC series that got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/manifest&quot;&gt;mixed reviews&lt;/a&gt;. I knew from the start that it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fmanifest&quot;&gt;junk&lt;/a&gt;, but I watched anyway because sometimes &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Junk TV&lt;/span&gt; is just right for the moment. You don't have to pay close attention to what's going on. They were trying to make another Lost, which was okay, but they didn't get there. It's just plain garbage. But it was #1 on Netflix last week. I haven't watched a series on Netflix in a long time, I wonder why I pay for it.</description>

			<description>I recently saw a video of a very early &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pee-wee_Herman&quot;&gt;Pee-wee Herman&lt;/a&gt; standup act. I remember the first time I saw him on TV, it was a bit after this, but I couldn't figure out if he was for real or playing a role. That's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBEipABTws8&quot;&gt;how good&lt;/a&gt; he was. Too bad he got cancelled for doing a very natural human thing to do, I can't see how anyone was hurt. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Pee-wee Herman&lt;/span&gt; is a comedian who gets so intertwined with the role, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Atkinson&quot;&gt;Rowan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kaufman&quot;&gt;Andy Kaufman&lt;/a&gt;, that you can't really tell if they're for real. We always assumed &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Robin Williams&lt;/span&gt; was an act too, but it's become apparent that the wild riffing comedian was who he really was, and it was part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body_dementias&quot;&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; he died from.</description>

			<description>Almost every time I visit YouTube they make me confirm that I don't want a free trial for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;. Not too smart. Every time I see it I want to tell them, hey, I tried your service and liked it, and would still be using it if you had Knicks games. They could skip the pitch until they got the Knicks, then I would say yes, maybe -- after giving it some thought. But without local games, forget about it. I'll put up with Spectrum. BTW, YTTV is really superior to Spectrum, whose UI is awkward, even after you've gotten used to it. And they don't have a virtual VCR, which was the nicest thing about YouTube TV.</description>

			<description>That said, some of them &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; idiots. I was out for a walk in the early days of the pandemic when we didn't know much about social distancing or mask wearing, and a man and woman couple were approaching, taking up more than half the (fairly wide) road we all were walking on, making it difficult to pass them without coming too close. As we passed I remarked that they were taking up a lot of space,. The woman pointed to the man and said &quot;he's working on a vaccine&quot; as if (I suppose) to imply he could take up as much of the road as he wanted, was he larger than he appeared? A kind of royalty? I thanked him and said hurry up, and thought to myself what a bunch of assholes. I guess they thought I was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=country%20bumpkin&quot;&gt;country bumpkin&lt;/a&gt; and not the tech god I imagine I am. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>For serious &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/span&gt; users, it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/tree/master/cli&quot;&gt;command line tool&lt;/a&gt;, and can run apps. This work was complete over a year ago but I didn't announce it because I wanted to burn it in for a while. I've been using it on a production server without issue for many months, running lots of apps. You still want to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever&quot;&gt;Forever&lt;/a&gt; or something like it to be sure that PagePark stays running, but for the apps that PagePark is managing, it takes care of keeping them running. The Forever people made their great app into a Node package, that's what made this possible. I wrote my own command line tool.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/span&gt;, we worked with Data General on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General-One&quot;&gt;DG/One&lt;/a&gt;. A 9-pound battery powered luggable. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/span&gt;, ran &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;MS-DOS&lt;/span&gt;. It was a real portable, you could use it on a plane, in a restaurant, at a meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was rolled out in a huge expensive press conf at a Los Gatos winery. Everything the best. Hundreds of people, great party and a great breakthrough product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But you couldn't read the screen.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they didn't light the demo room.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So that's all anyone talked about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They were really good people, spent a lot of money on the product, and it should have changed the world more than it did. But they had the same problem many product people have, they didn't know how to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Listening is hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My quick reMarkable review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of being on Guy's podcast is you get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://remarkable.com/&quot;&gt;reMarkable&lt;/a&gt; tablet to play with. I tried using it, and sent him an email which he has forwarded to the development team at the company. Here's the email.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have two physical issues that make it hard for me to use.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My eyesight sucks, and if I'm not mistaken the screen isn't backlit. I was going to keep it near my tv-watching chair, I usually watch the news in the evening, and I thought this would be a good time, but the light isn't good, and as it got darker, I had to give up, I just couldn't read the screen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My handwriting, which used to be great, is now a pretty slow way for me to record my ideas. Obviously the reason is I've spent the last 40 years using a keyboard all day every day.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now, as a user -- I found your pitch, on the podcast, compelling. It was a very familiar one. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I could have quickly found that model, take notes, quickly send it to my desktop somehow, I would overcome the other two problems. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;reMarkable&lt;/span&gt;, the path to success is cluttered with lots of tutorials that show me how to be an expert user, but I haven't become a newbie yet. A lot of software devs do this. They don't set up their product so it quickly hooks you. And therefore it doesn't get hooked.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I learned this over years, the hard way, by failing. It started with the first internal release of what became &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Visicalc&lt;/span&gt; company, which I was part of. No one would use my product. I never did figure out how to get them to do that. But by the time the product got those fabulous reviews in the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Infoworld&lt;/span&gt;, the software did present itself with the minimum info, and clear clues as to how to be successful. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are engineering techniques to getting a product set up for new users. It involves making lists of steps, and finding ways to eliminate them one at a time. So when you turn the tablet on, the first thing it presents is a wifi login, then immediately, a box you write in (the prompt makes that obvious), and a big button that says &quot;send it to me&quot; where you enter your email address and off you go. Nothing else on the screen, no other &quot;important&quot; information. Give me success, and give me something I can repeat, and later when I decide to use it regularly, I can go looking for other things to do. That should be easy too, but at the right time.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The hardware is good Guy. The pencil has a nice feel. I'm sure inside the software it has all the functionality I just described, but it has to be presented in the right way in the right order.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Nothing else on the screen, no other &quot;important&quot; information.

			<description>Now that I can see &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt; in action, I changed how tags are displayed. A tag appears as a single-square-bracketed term, in blue. When you hover over it, it's underlined. This is more consistent with the way links work. And single-square-brackets are less intrusive than double, but still convey the idea that where you're going is different from a normal link. Feedback is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/218&quot;&gt;welcome&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also finding bugs in the tag server. Of course, and that's good.</description>

Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX_TFkut1PM&quot;&gt;American Pie&lt;/a&gt; about the death of music, and as wrong.

The tragedy isn't that Google fucked us over so hard, it's that even now, eight years later, people still haven't figured out that companies don't make wholesome tech, they consume it. Leave it like an Amazon rain forest after harvesting. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/span&gt; should have been called Exxon Valdez Reader. The author's attitude toward people who understand this tragedy is to dismiss us as naïve. Which is ridiculous given the premise.

			<title>Tagging in Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's something new on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; today -- tags. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you see a tag reference, click on it to see a list of refs to the same tag. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example of a tag reference. Click it, see what happens: &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you hover over a tag ref, it should turn blue.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on one you should see a dialog that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/22/taggingDialog.png&quot;&gt;looks like this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the text in the dialog has tags, you can click on them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The left and right arrows move back and forth through the tags you've clicked on like the arrows in a browser.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I'm writing, my CMS passes the OPML of today's writing to a new server app called a &lt;i&gt;tag server&lt;/i&gt; that scans for tags. A tag is simply text that's enclosed in &amp;lsqb;[double square brackets]].&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When it finds a tag, it adds it to a database, with the following info: the URL of the OPML file it came from, the path to the tag in the outline, the &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt; attribute of the headline it came from in the outline, and the screenname of the author (for now, just me).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now we can do a query, such as: Find me all the items tagged by davewiner with the term RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And that query can be displayed in a dialog when you're reading the blog.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkNWAr6s5K8&quot;&gt;video demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll have more to say about this, but first I wanted to introduce the feature so you can try it out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or comments, you can post them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/218&quot;&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>In the end I was rooting for the Milwaukee &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bucks&lt;/span&gt;. I don't understand why, maybe it's because I had been following the east more than the west, largely due to the time difference. Or maybe it was my connection with Wisconsin? Whatever the reason I was happy last night because the Bucks won the series, 4-2, over the Phoenix Suns who are also an excellent team. I felt bad for &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/span&gt;, this was his first chance in the finals and at age 37 perhaps his last, after a long playoff career, marred by injuries, and he didn't win, not just because the Bucks wanted it more. The playoff process is a long grind. He was still standing, but the Bucks prevailed -- because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo&quot;&gt;Giannis  Antetokounmpo&lt;/a&gt;. He's a superstar in league with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AooUnpj5nzE&quot;&gt;best&lt;/a&gt;, plays through pain, and basically carried the team on his back. He is also famous as a terrible free throw shooter, but last night he made 15 of 16 free throws. Without that, the Bucks would've lost, and we'd be going to a game 7 showdown in Phoenix tomorrow night. The most important thing to me, and Giannis commented on it too, is that the Bucks are a team that was developed through the draft and trades, not as a superteam formed for the purpose of winning a championship, like the detestable &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Brooklyn Nets&lt;/span&gt;. The two stars of the Bucks, Giannis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khris_Middleton&quot;&gt;Khris Middleton&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the Bucks since 2013. I feel great that the NBA, despite the best efforts of the superteams, is still a game where talent and perseverance wins. The playoffs were good this year, it was the year the Knicks competed well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young&quot;&gt;young talent&lt;/a&gt; impressed and entertained. Now it's time to shift to the Olympics which start on Friday, and the Mets who are in first place!</description>

The official story is we used the bomb as soon as it was ready, but that could just be a story. He asks a good question, and many others.

			<description>&lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Bezos&lt;/span&gt; wants to move manufacturing into space. I had never heard that idea before seeing a quick interview today with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/07/20/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-launch-cooper-intv-sot-vpx.cnn&quot;&gt;Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt; of CNN and the two Bezos brothers, who look very much alike. The rich one is the guy in the dorky cowboy hat. He says some industries that use up too much of the earth's resources would be better in space. I started to think about what he might have in mind. Server farms run on solar energy, and cooled by the vacuum of space. Perfect. On the other hand, who would regulate his businesses in space? No OSHA, no unions, no taxes or laws. I bet they're all thinking about this, and I kick myself for not having thought of it myself.</description>

			<description>In &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Denmark&lt;/span&gt; they have a children's show about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillermand&quot;&gt;man with a huge penis&lt;/a&gt; that he uses to help people. At first it's a little shocking to this American, but why shouldn't we think of a &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;penis&lt;/span&gt; as something friendly and useful. I was brought up to think of my penis as something shameful, dirty, to hide, to apologize for. I can't imagine how I got those ideas, but they were and are there in my infant brain. Eventually we learn to have fun with our penises. Hopefully. Why not start as a kid? Thanks to &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;John Oliver&lt;/span&gt; for his incredible little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A51mJjFyG_w&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I decided to watch Tucker Carlson for the first time and was rewarded with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1416800705940230148&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Michael Wolff taking down Brian Stelter, and couldn’t agree more with what Wolff said.</description>

I have a new feature coming for Scripting News. As soon as I posted this I started writing. It happens that way every damned time.</description>

			<title>Reporters are pussycats</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;More confirmation that today's blockbuster news about Trump is about the crazy place we were in six months ago. I don't get reporters who think that's acceptable. Their job is to know (and tell us) what crazy place we're in &lt;i&gt;right now. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with the military. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/14/donald-trump-reichstag-moment-general-mark-milley-book&quot;&gt;Joint Chiefs guy&lt;/a&gt; thought Trump might be doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire&quot;&gt;Reichstag fire&lt;/a&gt;. Great. So WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T HE PREPARE THE MILITARY TO KNOCK IT DOWN BEFORE IT STARTED AND SHIP THE INSURRECTIONISTS OFF TO GITMO. ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO WITH TERRORISTS?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When are some reporters going to get into the present and deal with today's truth. Stop praising the military for *saying* how fukced up everthing is. Praise them for keeping it from getting that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's hope Biden, first thing when he got on the job, sat down with the military and told them they fucked up big, and they better be prepared next time. I suspect he didn't because he hasn't fired any of these nincompoops. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to stop thinking like pussycats and start getting in front of this. We're getting our asses whipped every time, and we're the United States dammit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
