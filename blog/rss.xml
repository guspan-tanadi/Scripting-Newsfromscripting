			<description>Someone said tweets are like potato chips and therefore should be limited to 280 chars. I took a few screen shots of tweets that lead to long reads or watches. These are not potato chips. People think of twitter as a home for baby squirrels, this was clever marketing in the beginning, but now it's where the political and cultural world is centered. The former president of the United States was banned from twitter. The potato chip people need to let that sink in. It's a place where real communication happens. The better the tools, imho, the better it works.</description>

			<description>They like to say the apps are better than the web, but I find the opposite is true. When I click a link in the twitter app it doesn’t take me to the web. I don’t have all my tools where ever it is they take me. and When I click a link to a tweet I’m taken to a dead end. Ughh.</description>

			<title>Threadviewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new app is coming soon called Threadviewer, not quite ready yet, hopefully tomorrow. Here's how it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You give it the ID of a tweet that's at the top of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. The app loads all the tweets it can find that are replies to the tweet with that ID, written by the author of the original tweet and shows them inside a box, in chronologic order, as a nice sequence of easy to read paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It does what I need it to do. Now twitter can be a writing space for me that flows into my blog. I also have thread.center if I need it, that goes the other way. BTW, you can use this with WordPress, Medium, Substack, email, whatever you like. It's just copy/paste from the threadviewer rendering. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's an here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/11/aThreadviewerUrl.png&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a Threadviewer URL. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Twitter Thread</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote to be sucked into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Medium was founded in 2012, I was afraid they were going to do to writing what YouTube did to video, what Twitter did to short outbursts. Medium is a nice product, but it was too strong, and too much of a silo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Medium didn't exist I'd have the same fear about Substack, but they are there to keep each other from dominating. And I still hope a more distributed approach appears, esp since running a server these days is getting much easier and cheaper and is only going to get more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder why Medium hasn't directly competed with Substack. It isn't that hard to ad email subscriptions to a product like Medium. Have they done it and I missed it? I would have thought it would be automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with Clubhouse. A bit of a juggernaut. I tried it, was briefly addicted, and then for some reason I lost interest. It was a time-filler, like Twitter is, for example. When I reach a milestone in other work, I take a break by checking out Twitter. You can't do that with Clubhouse. There is no 15 minute Clubhouse break. It's either a few seconds, or an hour. I don't usually have an hour in the middle of the day to goof off, and at night I'm not at the computer and in need of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Twitter is going where Clubhouse is. I'll try it. I think it has a chance because Twitter and Clubhouse really should be more integrated. And Twitter itself doesn't live with the limits outside devs have. They can create connections we can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world somehow has missed that Twitter has a great API, and it runs fast, and they are expanding it, not contracting it. Briefly, when Dick Costolo was CEO, they made a mistake that they quickly corrected, by cutting off certain (but not all) external devs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then they've been very liberal and reliable. I love using the Twitter API. Of course I would love it even more if they got rid of the 280 char limit. I'm usually good at figuring out angles on things in tech, but I have never seen the logic behind this limit, when they allow so many other much more complex data types to be attached to tweets. I would have thought given all their other payload types that by now they would have a 64K or greater limit to the amount of text attached to a tweet&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Playing with a thread viewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been accumulating tools to use Twitter as a blog-writing tool, for times when I'm not near my desktop the main place I write.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one was a tool that, using the Twitter API, gathered all my tweets in the last 24 hours and categorized them as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Original tweets.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Replies.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RTs.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to get the original stuff first, to give me a way to jot down an idea in Twitter, so I could recall it later when I'm officially writing my blog for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It worked okay, it was great at first actually, but it required too much work to reassemble a twitter thread for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted was a tool that could gather a whole thread, like the one you're reading now, into a series of paragraphs, that could then be edited into a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there was a missing feature in the Twitter API. No way to ask for all the replies to a given tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then a few days ago while my mind was wandering, I figured it out. Get the timeline for the person, and figure out which messages are in reply to the main tweet of the thread, or to one of its replies, and build the thread outside of Twitter that way. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So now I needed a thread to test it with. Something non-trivial, that could also be somewhat meta. And that my friends is what this thread is for. Thanks for your indulgence! :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: It worked. Here's the source &lt;a href=&quot;http://threadviewer.com/1369660954150121486&quot;&gt;as viewed by the new app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If Osterholm's analysis is right, and it seems likely, the virus is going to explode again soon. What a difference it would make if we had a leader who could do fireside chats and keep us all directed in the most positive way,  as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Cuomo%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; did last year. Biden is doing the right things, but he doesn't have a good fireside manner. Cuomo was one-in-a-generation. I think that is now impossible. I think ultimately this was a product of very bad judgment on his part and journalism without perspective.</description>

			<title>My kitchen is mine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing happens when woman friends visit. They take over my kitchen. Move things around. Hide them. Put things in places they don't belong. Sometimes I find them years later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I got so used to it, and btw angered about it, that I tried to make a deal with my aunt when she and my uncle came to visit when I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside,_California&quot;&gt;Calif&lt;/a&gt;. I said if you tell me why you want to do it, I'll let you. (At least they asked, I think that was probably my uncle's influence, I should have asked him why they asked, usually they don't, they just start doing). Anyway, when I made the offer Aunt Marsha said nothing and went ahead and started cleaning and reorganizing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It. Happens. All. The. Time. And I hate it. I fucking hate it. I tell them this before they do it. I tell them while they're doing it. I warn them, don't mess with the kitchen, after they've done it, and they do it again. Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's what it says to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We like our men incapable of taking care of themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You are a man, therefore you cannot take care of yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I will do it for you. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now on their side -- I don't think there's much thought to it. I think I am invisible to them. Not a factor. Subconsciously somehow they got the idea that there is no woman who owns this kitchen therefore I do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've asked many times if they would do this to a woman friend, come for a visit and start rearranging and cleaning their kitchen. No one has said yes, but I think some of them actually do it. But most won't because it's such a sign of disrespect. I guess maybe they can see other women. Or they can relate to it, they can imagine how they would feel if their friend tried to take over &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for all men (and neither can you btw) but some of us want powerful and capable women friends. People who have big positive ideas and try to do their part to help. More than anything what we want from women is to be seen as real people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's help each other, and start by giving us all the benefit of the doubt, and assume we mean well and can and want to take care of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token&quot;&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are easy to understand. It's like buying a work of art to hang in your house. Everyone else can have a print. The print is just as beautiful, but the original can possibly appreciate in value. It's controversial because it uses the blockchain (probably the first time I've used that word on this blog) which uses a lot of energy. Isn't there a way to achieve the same without that cost?</description>

			<description>I'm thinking about selling one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/fridayDave.mp3&quot;&gt;my first podcast&lt;/a&gt;s, the one that got the ball rolling, that started my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://morningcoffeenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Morning Coffee Notes&lt;/a&gt; podcasts, and then inspired a community to develop, which caused more podcasts and on and on. People are dismissive of NFTs, and critical, but there's been no other way for a maker of new media types such as myself to get credit for our creations. Looking back, I certainly would have led the bootstrap of podcasting, even if I didn't get credit for it, someone had to do it, we needed to use the internet for audible expression and no one else seemed able to do it. But I'd like young people to know how these things work, they don't have to start companies to make a significant contribution. They can stay in their art.</description>

			<description>It took a while for me to get how common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; is. If someone says, in a discussion, that you're upset, they're gaslighting. It's wrong because: 1. They have no insight into how you feel. 2. They're changing the subject. Gaslighting is insidious.</description>

			<description>A bit of advice to people who want a vaccine but aren't yet eligable. It pays to hang around places that do vaccinations near closing time, because they're required to get extra vaccines into people's arms, if they don't they're wasted. There are, apparently, lots of cancellations and no-shows in some places, so your chances are  getting better all the time. Just want to be sure everyone knows.</description>

			<title>Virus, Democracy, Climate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our focus should be sharply on these three things.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Virus &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Democracy&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Climate&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every other issue is a distant non-priority. Yet of course the news keeps gravitating around things other than the mutating virus and people's refusal to mitigate, how we're going to get our republic back on solid ground, and what are we doing to radically change how we live so we can survive the climate catastrophes that are already here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can find a solution for the problem with Governor Cuomo. Have him wear a &lt;a href=&quot;https://uedata.amazon.com/Smartphone-Powerful-Action-Sports-Camera/dp/B016M99GAW&quot;&gt;head camera&lt;/a&gt; 7 by 24. Every word is recorded, every image, from his point of view. It should be designed like one of those lights coal miners wear, and be streamed live to Facebook and YouTube. Everyone will see and hear everything Cuomo does.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we don't need to discuss this any further. Problem solved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Virus, Democracy, Climate. If it doesn't have anything to do with these, it's a distraction. Distractions are necessary so we don't go insane. But understand that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the reasons I love writing for the blog is that I've made the best software for me for editing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't make it for anyone else. I know of one person who has adapted it for his own use, that's it. The software still is far from as good as it could be. It needs the one feature my old outliner in Frontier had, scriptability. I need to get outside the limits of the JavaScript environment in the browser and on the server, while relying on the software I've built so far, to define a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/19/suspensionOfDisbeliefAppli.html&quot;&gt;virtuality&lt;/a&gt; that is perfectly scriptable. To exist at a higher level, both as a writer and a developer. I've been to the top of this mountain before, but this time I'm taking a different path to the top. And maybe it isn't even the same mountain. That's what makes these writing/software explorations so interesing, and risky. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/plague-year-two/&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing an expert on pandemics, he exclaimed &quot;Oy oy oy,&quot; almost wearily. Now Chris is nice, as I said, but he’s a total &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy&quot;&gt;goy&lt;/a&gt;, so it was LOL funny to hear him say that phrase. Oy!</description>

			<description>I want to know more about who the listeners are for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; podcast. I bet they're amazing. I'd start by asking listeners to send in a photo of where they listen to the podcast. We'd publish them (after reviewing to be sure they're safe for work). It'd be quite a conversation starter. They have a Disqus comment section on the blog, and they get some comments.</description>

			<description>Key fact: Every time someone gets infected, the virus has another chance to mutate and thereby get around our vaccines. So it's in all our interests to reduce the number of infections, to slow mutations. Does this make sense? Somewhere in my education, I don't remember where, they taught me to think like this. Two or more processes that interact happening at the same time. It's reality. We're in a contest with the virus. It won for many months, and it's still winning, but now we have a strategy for slowing its growth. We will not eliminate it. These are basic facts most people haven't begun to absorb.</description>

			<description>I don't like the Holier Than Thou BS of the Democratic Party. If the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-never-trumpers-are-becoming-pro-democracy-republicans.html&quot;&gt;Never Trumpers&lt;/a&gt; form a new party, I might join up. I'd like a party that endorses only two things, 1. the Constitution and 2. a return to majority rule. All other issues, up to the individual to decide.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/05/whatIveLearnedAboutWhereWereAtWithTheVirus.m4a&quot;&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: What I've learned about where we're at with the virus. When will it be over? Depends on a lot of things, including many that are completely out of anyone's control, and unknowable. All we're doing basically is going with hunches, and trying to see what works. The virus our vaccines were tested against is not the same virus that's out there today. Variants and mutations make the virus a moving target. We need better monitoring, hopefully the Biden Administration is working on that. 15 minutes.</description>

			<description>All of a sudden the opportunities to get vaccinated are exploding here in upstate New York. We are over-supplied, it seems. It's always been true, the United States is the country you want to come help when you have a disaster. We were not prepared for this pandemic, but we could invent, test and manufacture a vaccine, and we are able to distribute it. We're good at this stuff. And we're big and rich enough to do it right. If the pandemic had happened with Biden as president, we'd have cleaned up the virus by now, and also gotten started of ridding ourselves of the insurance industry, which does nothing for us, and takes so much.</description>

			<description>In the podcast I said the virus was going to hit us hardest, because we feel invulnerable. Lots of other things, it's worth a listen. I'm glad I did this podcast. It was a transition point, the world changed around March 5, 2020. On the other hand as it turns out I overestimated how bad it was going to be.</description>

			<description>We should all write something that could get us fired to get this idea flushed out of the system that expression of our beliefs, even if other people don't like them, or they trigger bad memories, is dangerous.

			<description>I think all apps should be scriptable, whether they run on the desktop or in the cloud.

			<description>BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Stallman&lt;/a&gt; has a similar idea. He says everyone should give him their source code. But if you do that, you get a million silos instead of one.

			<description>All the water my house uses comes from a well 140 feet underground. The water contains some minerals, not much, because the Catskills are renowned for water quality. The pipes also contribute minerals to the water, esp when the pressure drops to zero as it did the other day when the pump failed. And again when the power went out. When the water comes gushing back after an outage, it dislodges little bits of crap from the walls of the pipe that were loosened when the support of the water suddenly disappeared. There are filters that catch the chunks large enough to cause problems in some of the devices hooked up to the water supply. But not all, some have no filters, and the bits get lodged in bad places, but then given enough time, they disintegrate and things slowly return to normal. I learned all this in the last few days. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>An idea for a social net</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An idea -- a net where no one knows your name or bio. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People listen to what others are saying without an idea of who's talking. All you know is that they were chosen to be part of the group because they're interesting, known to think well/carefully, have respect for other points of view.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are criteria to be accepted, like a university has criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe you have to take a test. I know entrance exams are inevitably skewed to favor white men. Hire a team sociologists to try to overcome that.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Limit to say 10K people. Like a good-sized town. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I live in one, so have an idea how communities this size work online. With good moderation, the communities solve problems, people help each other. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Your real world identity is secret. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All you know is that everyone in the community likely has something in common with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your screenname persists, so people get to know you but have no idea who you are in the real world. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you reveal your identity, you are kicked off the system. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I was part of such a community a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It was called CB Radio and was a service on CompuServe, an ancient and long-gone social media site. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>
