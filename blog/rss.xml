			<title>This doesn't work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay -- Trump doesn't play by the rules of journalism. He doesn't explain why he had the stolen documents. His only response is to flood the zone with bullshit as Bannon says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems on the other hand accept the rules of journalism, which over decades has come to mean avoid saying anything, so everything Dems say comes out more and more like mush. They work hard to say nothing for fear of provoking a new scandal in the press.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We view what Trump does negatively, but what about the other journalism as the sole judge approach? It doesn't work any better for us, in fact you'd have to say at this time that approach is losing. We're one election away from becoming an openly fascist country.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why, sorry to say -- I'm not sad to see the enforcers of journalism at CNN and other news orgs get fired. Because the system they are enforcing is flushing our system down the toilet. And the system, even though it's fucked up, is better than having no system at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the big journalism thinkers think this idea deserves to be part of the mix. You never see it on the op-ed pages, or part of the discussion on The Beat with Ari Melber. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're all dead now. Their opinions don't matter. So if the opinions mean nothing now, what did they mean when they were alive? I would say they meant nothing then too. And if it applied to them it must certainly apply to me. I find it relaxing to know I don't have to figure everything out, because it doesn't matter what I think. It just doesn't matter. Now innovation might matter, but most of it goes unrecognized. My uncle for example, invented a windmill that didn't need to be repositioned to catch the wind. If the wind was blowing it would capture the energy. Earlier this evening I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/1560757203870547970&quot;&gt;saw&lt;/a&gt; it had been invented again, because no one heard about my uncle's invention, except for people who loved him. Even so, I think that matters, because his ideas led to more ideas. That's very different from opinions. Ken thought all kinds of things that, to me, were bullshit. He could have saved the energy, because it didn't end up meaning anything. Also how well did they communicate their ideas? My maternal grandfather, Rudy Kiesler, Ken's father, actually got a mention in the Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for my great uncle, his brother-in-law. They said he was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/21/rudyKieslerCommunistQuote.png&quot;&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;! I spent a lot of time with him growing up and in million years I'd never have thought he was a communist. He was a voracious capitalist, but then -- he always seemed to support liberal causes. And he was a Mets fan. So maybe there was some truth to it? He definitely had strong opinions, that man, but he must not have communicated them effectively, or maybe he was hiding this from his grandhildren? Hmm.</description>

			<description>Turns out I did have something to say. I'm watching a great HBO series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Friend_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/a&gt;. It got the highest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/my-brilliant-friend&quot;&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; on Metacritic, and it is deserved. Almost like watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; (who I love) in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone&quot;&gt;first movie&lt;/a&gt;, and realizing there's going to be a lot more of this and being happy to be around to see all of it. There are three seasons, I'm only on episode 4 of season 1. I'm sure there will be a lot more to say about this.  In the meantime I'm just enjoying a beautiful film as a TV series about two children growing up in Naples in the 1950s.</description>

Now he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alfranken/status/1560430185375305728&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it was a joke.

A self-destructive idiot, who was it seems on his way back, but he should just go away quietly and never be heard from again. A punchline to a joke -- remember what it was like to elect a &quot;comedian&quot; to Congress.</description>

Suggestion to browser devs: treat viewing a feed as lifting the hood on a car or viewing the source of an HTML page. When you do that, you don't see another car interior, or another rendering of the HTML. You see a lot of technical stuff. Trust people who don't want to know how the web works will quickly hit the Back button to get back to the comfort of the user interface.</description>

			<description>Why now? RSS 2.0 will be &lt;i&gt;twenty years old&lt;/i&gt; on September 18. One month from today. I'm working on something pretty big for that day, maybe it'll be out a bit earlier, who knows. But in the meantime, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweetfeed.org/&quot;&gt;something new&lt;/a&gt; to spark a new use for RSS and Twitter -- hooking people's tweets up to feed reader apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsblur.com/&quot;&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoldreader.com/&quot;&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I once heard an interview with comedian Steve Martin, and was surprised at how serious he sounds when discussing his profession. I expected comedy, but when he talks about what he does, vs doing it, he's all business. It made an impression.</description>

			<description>My philosophy is that everything people use to write is a writing tool, and can be made better by paying attention to how people use it and most important, how they want to use it.</description>

			<description>The reason I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1559879683776331776&quot;&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt; is that soon you will be able to publish to all RSS readers from Twitter. It really works, there's some serious innovation here, and fills in a missing piece that's been there since the mid-00s. This is RSS and Twitter waking up after a long sleep.</description>

			<title>Slippin Jimmy is back for the love</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Better Call Saul spoilers follow. You have been warned! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The previous episode ended with the hero threatening to kill an old crippled woman whose mistake was trusting him. People thought this meant that his slide would continue in the finale, and it certainly did, but then it turned around -- and it became what I had hoped it would be -- a love story! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't spend 14 years with this character, all the while knowing he had a good heart, he loved his brother and Kim, and all the old folks at Sandpiper, he really did love them, only to find out at the end his heart was cold and there was no redemption for our hero. I thought that would not be consistent with the writers of the show. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the final scenes, we see the hero, sentenced to 86 years, doing the same thing he was doing at Cinnebon in Omaha, and as usual his fellow prisoners and guards had fallen in love with him, as we all did. In the final scene, he's back together with Kim, sharing a cigarette. He's still Slippin Jimmy with a heart of gold. And she's slippin around too, her ID as a lawyer hadn't expired. And the door is wide open for a sequel, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The final touch, where the actors come out one by one and thank us -- what a concept -- for our love of them. In all the finales of all the shows, great ones and not so great, I've never seen this done, and it ended this show with a heart on just the right note. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was always taught the basics of a good story are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws&quot;&gt;who, what, when, where and why&lt;/a&gt;. With Trump and his stolen top secret US government documents, we don't know who he was selling the secrets to. The what part -- we don't know either. They say nuclear secrets, but what if they got you access to world's banking system. That could be considerably more valuable. Why? With Trump there's only ever one reason -- if it makes him richer he's in. If not why bother. Our journalism repeats the same old bullshit over and over.</description>

I don't like that approach because systems with tens of millions of happy users don't get replaced, but they can foster new developments built on their strength and ubiquity.

			<description>Come to think of it, Twitter and RSS have a lot in common. Both are roughly contemporary pioneering efforts on which today's social media and news worlds are built.

			<title>Visiting Flushing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My mother died in February 2018. My father had died in October 2009. So she lived there alone for nine years. I came and went, it was nice to have a place to stay in NYC. I just took a trip to NY for the first time to stay overnight since I moved to the mouintains in 2019. And for the first time I didn't have a place to stay in NY. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://maxisnoodle.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/13/maxisNoodle.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was the hottest night of the year. I ate a fishy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/dining/wonton-soup-maxis-noodle.html&quot;&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; in Flushing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://maxisnoodle.com/&quot;&gt;Maxi's Noodle&lt;/a&gt;, one of many Chinese and Korean restaurants in the place where I grew up, only when I lived there it was a sleepy midwestern-type place you traveled through but never stopped at. I would take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bus_routes_in_Queens#Q16&quot;&gt;Q16&lt;/a&gt; bus to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing%E2%80%93Main_Street_station_(IRT_Flushing_Line)&quot;&gt;Main St&lt;/a&gt; and from there got on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Flushing_Line&quot;&gt;7 train&lt;/a&gt;, never stopping for more than the time it took for the train to leave. But it's now a destination. It felt like a foreign country. What a thing to return to where you grew up, to experience it as a white American man would in a foreign country, Hong Kong or Seoul. What was odd though, was when the locals talked the young ones talked like me. Makes sense, but strange. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When my mother died, shortly after we had the house cleaned out to get ready to sell, I realized I should have made a movie of the inside of the house. The scene of most of my childhood memories, good and bad. Now they only reside in my head. If only I had thought to make a video. That's what's funny about big transitions. When you look at the place so familiar so lived-in, why would you take a video, it never crossed my mind. Until the instant you realize, after the fact, that it's gone forever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the morning after staying in a weird hotel that smelled funny, in the stinky heat of an August morning, plotting my trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html&quot;&gt;Utopia Bagels&lt;/a&gt;, I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7687934,-73.7918902,3a,75y,231.86h,75.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srVHSLcEmp8uSz67aCZY2Lw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; (on the app) on my path at the intersection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Francis+Lewis+Blvd+%26+32nd+Ave,+Queens,+NY+11358/@40.7688738,-73.7926528,210m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c28a7fa6261b81:0x5df5b6691664bc4f!8m2!3d40.7689226!4d-73.7919782&quot;&gt;32nd Ave and Francis Lewis Blvd&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to imagine which corner it was on, what it had replaced. Turns out it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbanklocations.com/reliance-federal-savings-bank-29210.shtml&quot;&gt;Reliance Federal Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, where I, as a 5th-grade boy had my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook&quot;&gt;bankbook&lt;/a&gt;, a hand-written thing, maintained by someone behind a counter who carefully stamped the date, and wrote the amount and balance in the account for every transaction. I don't remember what I was saving for, possibly a new baseball bat or glove, or later sound equipment. And of course all that remains of that little person, the former future Dave, are little vague bits of memory. How unlikely all this was I imagine that boy would think. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Carnegie Hall vs Central Park</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I prefer to write on the open web rather than on Facebook is that if I get an Aha! idea about a feature, on my blog I can implement it. On Facebook I'm just a user. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That was/is one of the great things about the web. Anyone can develop features for it. On Facebook, just their employees can.

			<description>The idea of putting &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; into the world of the browser was a mistake. The world of news is another world altogether. The web tried, in every way to turn RSS into the web. And it was very unsatisfying for a reason, the web was designed for documents. Things that have lasting value. The news is different. It's ephemeral. You want to keep a record of it for sure, but yesterday's news has no value as news, because it's not new. It's like the difference between music and podcasts. Music you may want to listen to many times, to cherish, to attach memories to, if it's good enough, over your whole life. A podcast is one and done. Pfffft. Off to the bit bucket. It's value is over as soon as the next episode is out.</description>

Engelbart thought augmenting human intellect was his real life's work. I know because 1. he told me and 2. same with me. Augmenting human intellect sounds spacy, something only a genius could understand, which is why it's not a good term for something that's pretty simple. Using an outliner to take notes and manage a project is an example of the computer augmenting your intellect. Doing something for you that you are not as good at as a computer is. Using a spreadsheet to augment human intellect could mean doing what-if analysis on a projected balance sheet. Sharing a recipe on Facebook with a group of friends is another example. Remember, Engelbart was talking about this long before there were computers outside of research labs. What seems kind of obvious today was anything but obvious then.</description>

			<description>I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Away&quot;&gt;Breaking Away&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. First time. The idealistic teen bike rider who worshipped Italian cyclists learns that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJETB-MfpnQ&quot;&gt;everyone cheats&lt;/a&gt;. A hard lesson, one that I never learned, and keep bumping up against. Maybe bumping is too mild a word. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>
