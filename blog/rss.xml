			<title>iPhone 13 Pro, day 17</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iphone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;saga&lt;/a&gt; continues...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling pretty good lately, but when I have an interaction with Apple, I think seriously I should just write off the $1300 I paid for the iPhone 13 Pro and get a high-end Android phone. I probably won't because I'm locked in to so many Apple services. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, 17 days after buying the phone from Apple, $1300 plus tax, it is still not here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/13/upsAdvisory.png&quot;&gt;UPS says&lt;/a&gt; it will be delivered tomorrow, but they've said that every day in the last week. The weather has been great, spring-like, sunny. They say it's an emergency. I think the emergency is they don't have the phone and their system is lying when it says it's on the truck and out for delivery. It's fair to assume it will not be here tomorrow, or ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday in a call to Apple at 1-800-MYAPPLE, they said they were making an escalation request, but when I called the same number just now they said the same thing. I guess the earlier request must've gotten lost too. I tried working with Apple Support on Twitter, but they were even more obnoxious. They seriously told me it was my job to find the person to talk to at UPS who is holding up the delivery and work with them. If they had told me that when I bought the phone I would have found another way to buy it because I refuse to get involved with UPS which is an ancient rust belt company that has no ability to work with ordinary people (and they're really rude about it). Apple chose UPS, not me. I paid &lt;i&gt;Apple&lt;/i&gt; for a phone, not UPS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the response I got from Apple Support on Twitter is utterly unbelievable. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/13/appleCustomerService.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're doing something a lot of companies do on Twitter, saying they acknowledge your feeling of frustration or whatever. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; and maybe someone in sales thinks the customer likes to be gaslighted. Maybe they weren't angry before you gaslighted them, but you can be sure they are after you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I called Apple this morning and got a more professional response. I'm waiting another three days to find out if they're going to return the money. The person recited some boilerplate saying that Apple will issue the refund when they receive the phone. I stopped her and repeated &lt;i&gt;I don't have the phone&lt;/i&gt; so I can't return it.  If I were them, I'd have someone drive the freaking phone to me from an Apple store in the area. That is, if this is an uncommon occurrence. If they depend on their customers doing work for them to get their product, I expect for most people that will be a bridge too far. For me it is. When I buy a luxury item, and that's what this is, I want to be treated with basic respect. And I want to use the freaking product, not argue with Apple about who has to do what. They have to do it, I'm the customer. I paid for this experience. Geez Louise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs used to lecture on this. He told a story that I can't find a reference to right now, about how he wanted the person buying the Apple product to take it home, open it up, and have everything just work. He wanted all the glitches gotten rid of. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs+on+customer+experience+taking+an+apple+product+home+from+store&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBvnj_IQeqJI5c3sHrI_AhRy2eDX5g%3A1644761941984&amp;ei=VRMJYu7fO7ajptQP-M2FiAU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu3qra7_z1AhW2kYkEHfhmAVEQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=steve+jobs+on+customer+experience+taking+an+apple+product+home+from+store&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6BAgjECc6BAghEApKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQtRBY2yZg2ydoA3ABeACAAdABiAGFDJIBBjE5LjAuMZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;quick search&lt;/a&gt; and found lots of praise for Apple as a customer service company. Well these people who write so gushingly about their customer service prowess should check it out again. I don't think this is remotely the same company it was just a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Perhaps part of Covid burnout is the realization at how insignificant our lives are. Almost 1 million dead, life goes on. Everyone wants to get back to normal. Maybe at a conscious level we don't get that indifference to human life also applies to those of us who are still alive.</description>

Of course it did not arrive yesterday even though UPS said it would arrive by 7PM. They're saying it once again &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/todaystatus.png&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. I signed up to receive updates on delivery events and in the first email they sent the full log of UPS actions with the second phone Apple shipped after UPS apparently lost the first phone. This log starts on Feb 4. I ordered the phone on Jan 27. The log is so long that i had to take two screen shots: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/part1.png&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/part2.png&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple Support, after requesting I send them a DM on Twitter, hasn't responded after ~36 hours. $1300 plus tax, paid on 1/27, 16 days ago. We had two storms in this period, and one 2-day power outage, to be fair to Apple and UPS, but -- if they had delivered it in a timely fashion all that would have happened while I had my iPhone. They also mysteriously changed my credit card in their system and then tried to charge $1 to the account and it failed, holding the delivery up by 24 hours, and requiring me to spend an hour on the phone with an Apple person before even considering the possibility that they had the wrong number. To anyone who trusts Apple to store their data, this is something to be concerned about. Also I understand this happens frequently to customers. Maybe Apple is short-staffed, there is a labor shortage in the US. And stealing products while they are in shipment is a big problem, getting bigger all the time.</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13 Max&lt;/a&gt;. It did not arrive yesterday. For a few hours last night the UPS report went back to saying there was an emergency that supposedly prevented the delivery. But this morning it's back on the truck. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1491938203296751616&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about it on Twitter after yesterday's no-show, the fifth such day, and got a response from Apple support. I gave them the order number via DM. They wanted lots of details but what did I need to say beyond &quot;I paid the money, I want the phone, or refund the money.&quot; For a company of Apple's size this shouldn't be hard unless it's a common occurrence.</description>

			<description>I heard on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnyc.org/story/perfect-name-sports-franchise&quot;&gt;Brian Lehrer podcast&lt;/a&gt; that the former Washington Redskins have &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/washington-commanders-nfl-ae58a5d454501417d66b207259486b14&quot;&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; their name to the Washington Commanders, a stupid name. Their name should be the Washington &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/17/redskinsAmericans.html&quot;&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt;. I explained why &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/17/redskinsAmericans.html&quot;&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It's obviously the correct name, how come their process didn't come up with it.</description>

			<description>Today might be the day my long lost &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013%20Pro&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; actually arrives. It's hard to imagine why it wouldn't. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/10/upsTeaser.png&quot;&gt;UPS site now says&lt;/a&gt; it's on the truck, not yet &quot;out for delivery&quot; but that's next step. I'm optimistic. The site also says it will be here by 7PM. The weather is very nice and has been for the last few days so there's no ice or snow to deal with. Power is on. But I've yet to see evidence the phone actually exists. If it does arrive here, I'm not letting it go. I could use a nice new phone. That's why I ordered and paid for one, so long ago. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🍎&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The two synthetic superteams of 2022 are falling apart now, today -- as the trade deadline is here, the moment when head-trips bump up against reality. The Lakers and Nets, who on paper have the best teams in the NBA this year, are basically out of contention and considering restarts. Meanwhile some of the teams that grew slowly and carefully are doing great. And there are surprises, teams no one thought would be doing so well. And of course the Knicks are back to where they always are, ripping up the whole thing and starting over. For some reason I'll never understand New York can't have a decent NBA team, even though we have two teams, and some people think New York is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca&quot;&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt; of the NBA, something you have to start wondering about given our teams' accomplishments or even an ability to play an interesting game.</description>

			<description>I like the idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2022/01/27/making-the-web-better-with-blocks/&quot;&gt;block protocol&lt;/a&gt; that makes compatible writing tools possible, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt;, but I use straight JavaScript, no toolkits, frameworks, no TypeScript. I feel strongly that packages that want to tie things together should be written in straight JS, that's why I chose that as my development platform many years ago.

			<title>Beatles of software, Day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/08/164711.html?title=whereAreTheBeatlesOfSoftware&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;, from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1491504432151998470&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/09/allThingsMustPass.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;More thoughts about the Beatles and their breakup.  None of the individual Beatles did better work after the breakup. They were unique, and as individuals had moments of greatness, but they had something that almost no one ever gets, a chance to be part of something great.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software, you can try to team up with people as good as you are, or just try to lead a team of people who do your work. I've always wanted the former, but pretty sure I never got it. I don't think anyone has gotten it, not for the decade or so the Beatles were at work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In sports, esp basketball they try to put together super teams, but they never seem to work. But look at the Warriors for an example of one that happened. They are kind of like the Beatles. But you know who didn't belong on the Warriors? The one who wasn't from Liverpool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mozart didn't get to be a Beatle, or Beethoven, Bach. What if they had found a peer and worked out a collaboration?  Hemingway didn't have a band either.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some random thoughts. This has been on my mind my whole career but has been coming into focus lately.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Where are the Beatles of software?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a lot more time to think than I had to write when the power was out. I thought about the projects I've done in my long career. My goal always was to work with other people. I'm not kidding. I wanted to be part of the Beatles of software. But, what generally would happen was that people wanted to take over my projects and work on them, without me. It has happened over and over. An unmistakeable pattern. Every time I heard about it, I was really puzzled. Some of the people were software developers who should understand that when you get someone's source code you're getting a very small thing, relative to understanding all the decisions that went into it. If you take over the project you don't know any of that. And when it has happened, for example at UserLand, I knew there was trouble when one of the developers complained that there was too much code to figure out how it worked. He couldn't understand why there was so much of it! This was a guy who had shipped real products. Why would he be surprised by this? Doesn't he understand that it takes a lot of code to create something simple and consistent, so the human mind can deal with it. I have thought about his comment for years. And why didn't he call and ask me to walk him through it. I was alive, I would have taken his call and I would have helped because it would have been an example of that elusive &quot;working together&quot; thing that I've been searching for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many more examples. A friend tried to buy Radio UserLand. I would have worked with him. He didn't have to buy it to work on it. If he wanted stock I would have given him stock.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My problem is that I generate a shitload of projects, and I can't keep up with all of them so they languish. Yet for some reason all I get are predators. People who want to grab, naively, as if there were something to grab. Why doesn't anyone want to collaborate?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When someone says the first thing they want to do in Frontier (it is open source, anyone can start from where we left off) is to make an easy but very fundamental change in how it works. It would break every bit of code that had been written to run in Frontier. It meant everything would have to be written starting from scratch. Why? It's a programming environment that has had a long life. Most of the value is in the software that has been to run on top of the kernel. Whatever this new thing is, if it ever sees the light of day, it should not be called Frontier. I guess these people want to be me, and having me around would make it hard to believe that's what was happening. I guess I make what I do look like fun? Hah. It's sometimes fun, but usually hard work and sometimes it hurts. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the colleague at Harvard who told me he was taking over OPML. His exact words. What an idiot. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another person, a former friend also was going to take over OPML. He somehow convinced Harvard to let him run an OPML conference at the law school. And invited people. And they came. I can't imagine what the sessions were like. Never-never land. This was in the heyday of RSS, so I guess people figured anything I did was gold and could be just taken over. Amazed, I stopped working on OPML and I hope they all lost all the money they put into it. I have no sympathy to people who are so cold and brazen and wasteful, I can't stop thinking of words to describe how heinous it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It happened with RSS too of course. I was talking with many of the VCs who ended up backing RSS startups before there were any. I thought they were talking to me about doing a startup. It wouldn't be a ridiculous idea, I had experience in all areas, had run a software company, been part of an IPO, obviously I knew how to build a standard even with the main standards bodies and big companies working against me. It never got to term sheets, the first I heard about the investments were the announcements. I couldn't believe it. They basically hired people who knew nothing about any of it. I guess they felt I understood too much? Maybe I offended them, if so, if they were adults they would have asked about it. They all lost every dollar they put into these ridiculous startups. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then there was Adam Curry and his partner Ron Bloom. They raised $50 million to fund their podcasting startup. They hired someone to do the tech for them. As far as I know they lost all the money their investors put in. All along all I wanted out of it was to get to build a real devteam around the idea, and try out lots of approaches. It was way too early to bet on any one model. Again I don't think they had any idea what I do and how you make the tech work. Adam did understand the basic idea. There was no overlap in what I did and what they did. But they thought all they needed was to hire someone who supposedly did what I do. How could people be so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/05/15/postman.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Then there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=twittergram&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;TwitterGram&lt;/a&gt;, which was Instagram before there was an Instagram. I actually managed to sell that to an incubator, but it was so weird all they wanted was to rip me off for my expenses. I ended up launching bit.ly for them, and I was paid $25K or so. I don't think they even bothered to find out what TG was. Wasn't it obvious that Twitter had left this huge open door -- no images. We knew users loved them, Flickr was already a big deal. That one would have made billions. It was ready to go.  Again, I don't think they were listening when I told them about it and demo'd it for them. Why? Why couldn't they hear it? I wasn't keep it anything like a secret, btw, it was all over my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I could keep going for a long time here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I was thinking about the Beatles of software. The closest anyone got as far as I know was Jobs and Woz, but I don't think that lasted very long. I don't know. So 48 hours with nothing to distract, got me to look deeper and question why I keep doing this stuff. It makes more sense that I spent the last four years prior to 2021 working only for myself. Last year I spent making software for others. I put a lot of time into it, wrote good docs, etc. The next thing I do might once again be for myself. Maybe that's all there is left now. But maybe there's still some collaboration possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reality is always good imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Another person, a former friend also was going to take over OPML. He somehow convinced Harvard to let him run an OPML conference at the law school. And invited people. And they came. I can't imagine what the sessions were like. Never-never land. This was in the heyday of RSS, so I guess people figured anything I did was gold and could be just taken over. Amazed, I stopped working on OPML and I hope they all lost all the money they put into it. I have no sympathy to people who are so cold and brazen and wasteful, I can't stop thinking of words to describe how heinous it is." created="Tue, 08 Feb 2022 17:31:02 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/08/164711.html?title=whereAreTheBeatlesOfSoftware#a173102"/>
				<source:outline text="It happened with RSS too of course. I was talking with many of the VCs who ended up backing RSS startups before there were any. I thought they were talking to me about doing a startup. It wouldn't be a ridiculous idea, I had experience in all areas, had run a software company, been part of an IPO, obviously I knew how to build a standard even with the main standards bodies and big companies working against me. It never got to term sheets, the first I heard about the investments were the announcements. I couldn't believe it. They basically hired people who knew nothing about any of it. I guess they felt I understood too much? Maybe I offended them, if so, if they were adults they would have asked about it. They all lost every dollar they put into these ridiculous startups." created="Tue, 08 Feb 2022 16:58:18 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/08/164711.html?title=whereAreTheBeatlesOfSoftware#a165818"/>
				<source:outline text="And then there was Adam Curry and his partner Ron Bloom. They raised $50 million to fund their podcasting startup. They hired someone to do the tech for them. As far as I know they lost all the money their investors put in. All along all I wanted out of it was to get to build a real devteam around the idea, and try out lots of approaches. It was way too early to bet on any one model. Again I don't think they had any idea what I do and how you make the tech work. Adam did understand the basic idea. There was no overlap in what I did and what they did. But they thought all they needed was to hire someone who supposedly did what I do. How could people be so stupid." created="Tue, 08 Feb 2022 17:12:29 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/08/164711.html?title=whereAreTheBeatlesOfSoftware#a171229"/>

I actually managed to sell that to an incubator, but it was so weird all they wanted was to rip me off for my expenses. I ended up launching bit.ly for them, and I was paid $25K or so. I don't think they even bothered to find out what TG was. Wasn't it obvious that Twitter had left this huge open door -- no images. We knew users loved them, Flickr was already a big deal. That one would have made billions. It was ready to go.  Again, I don't think they were listening when I told them about it and demo'd it for them. Why? Why couldn't they hear it?

				<source:outline text="So I was thinking about the Beatles of software. The closest anyone got as far as I know was Jobs and Woz, but I don't think that lasted very long. I don't know. So 48 hours with nothing to distract, got me to look deeper and question why I keep doing this stuff. It makes more sense that I spent the last four years prior to 2021 working only for myself. Last year I spent making software for others. I put a lot of time into it, wrote good docs, etc. The next thing I do might once again be for myself. Maybe that's all there is left now.

			<title>Apple + UPS + weather</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple, UPS and snow are a bad combo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In good weather, I would have gotten my new phone on Jan 31. But the weather wasn't good, so it was delayed. On Feb 2 the case arrives. No phone, which just a guess, was stolen at UPS waiting for better weather. Apple said they were sending another phone but Apple's system lost my credit card number. That took a couple of days to sort out, and lots of time on the phone track down their system error -- somehow my credit card number was replaced on their server with someone else's number. Pretty disturbing considering Apple is a &lt;i&gt;computer&lt;/i&gt; company. So that delayed them sending the replacement for the lost or stolen phone. Too bad for Dave because that was when we had good weather. It turned bad again, with power outages, and networks down, and now the second phone is caught in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/08/upsScreen.png&quot;&gt;UPS system&lt;/a&gt;, and who knows when I'll actually get the phone. Thinking about asking for my money ($1300) back and buying the same phone at Amazon. Maybe their luck will be better. Both companies screwed up here, and neither of them has been willing to assign someone to fix the problem, and ignore what the computer tells them to do and get the phone to the customer already. I'm not at the North Pole. I have a car, the roads are clear, but it's looking like they lost this phone too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shot from Apple store gives a clear picture of where we're at.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All the Apple people have been nice, mostly overworked but polite and considerate. At one point I noted that we're just cogs being run by the computer bosses, software that ate our world, and they are making mistakes, and humans still have to do what they say. I think this is why everyone wants change. It's not nice to think where this is going. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Thank goodness for BitTorrent, I had a backlog of things that I could watch when the net is down. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=hemingway&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Hemingway&lt;/a&gt;. He was like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=beatles&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, but just one person. Much larger than life. Handsome and charismatic. He projected an avatar, but of course living up to the image he projected was impossible. As with the Beatles, how much better it would have been (imho or so it seems) if they could have been creative for decades and just been themselves. There's this great scene in Get Back where Paul and John are stressing out, and John lowers his glasses and says to Paul &quot;It's just me.&quot; What if every album didn't have to be the best one ever made. Relistening to the Beatles classics, the Beatles had a sound, and none of the ex-Beatles took it with them when they broke up. I've come to absolutely adore songs that just passed me by when I was young, and had no sense of art compared to now. I can't believe how good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt; is. I laugh every time at all different parts because it is so Beatles and they create so much beauty. BTW much of John's sound came from George Martin, as he interpreted what John wanted (I got that from watching a long interview with Martin). The Beatles were a thing. It's unfortunate it had to consume the people of the Beatles, or they didn't understand what they had created. George Harrison desperately wanted to get out from under the Beatles, but imho, the Beatles made George Harrison. BTW creative life is exactly the same today was it was then. We don't nurture creative people, create safe environments for them to develop over full lives. And there's little that glues us together. Too much focus on being a hero, inflating the avatar, which ultimately kills the creativity. We could do much better.</description>

			<title>Mac OS plist corruption?</title>

Now I have to try to figure out why these two things aren't working and fix the system so they do work. I can't work this way, and it's too much work to reinstall the OS. I want to fix it.

			<title>Is Spotify the next Facebook?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't write much &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Spotify&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;about Spotify&lt;/a&gt; because I don't use it, not like I use Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But now Spotify is unavoidable, because they've been buying podcast rights and locking them into their system. No feeds, if you want to listen the only way is on Spotify. And unfortunately for Spotify the company, that makes them responsible, if not legally, in public opinion (ie journalism) for what's said. They can claim otherwise, but that's the way it worked for Facebook and I don't see why it won't be like that for Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway it's kind of obvious Spotify wanted to own podcasting. Now, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=joe%20rogan&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, I wonder if they still want to own it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also seems obvious if they continue down this path, they're going to end up like Facebook, with a new name, and trying to be part of something vague that isn't Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And they're obviously lying when they say they value Rogan's right to free speech. Instead they're  desperately trying to preserve their $100 million investment. Better idea -- they could cut their losses, stop trying to own podcasting, while Spotify is still a decent name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook made the same mistake Spotify is making. They should have peered with the blogging world, and absolved itself of regulating speech. Instead they tried to dominate, and their brand became synonymous with all the abuse they imported from the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ek&quot;&gt;Ek&lt;/a&gt; says he won't &quot;silence&quot; Rogan. But he doesn't have the power to silence anyone. If he were to stop carrying Rogan on his network, Rogan would still have the entire open web to speak on. But this is the real issue. If Ek continues on his path he will have the power to silence people. And that would be the end of podcasting as a medium. He's a very long way from that btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ek is really saying is he doesn't want to lose his $100 million. If he told this truth, obviously no one but his shareholders would sympathize. I think if he chose to lose the  money it would be worth it. If he proceeds down this path he's going to lose a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I don't write much &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Spotify&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;about Spotify&lt;/a&gt; because I don't use it, not like I use Facebook." created="Mon, 07 Feb 2022 13:53:02 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/07/135137.html?title=isSpotifyTheNextFacebook#a135302"/>
				<source:outline text="But now Spotify is unavoidable, because they've been buying podcast rights and locking them into their system. No feeds, if you want to listen the only way is on Spotify. And unfortunately for Spotify the company, that makes them responsible, if not legally, in public opinion (ie journalism) for what's said. They can claim otherwise, but that's the way it worked for Facebook and I don't see why it won't be like that for Spotify." created="Mon, 07 Feb 2022 14:33:45 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/07/135137.html?title=isSpotifyTheNextFacebook#a143345"/>
				<source:outline text="Anyway it's kind of obvious Spotify wanted to own podcasting.

				<source:outline text="And they're obviously lying when they say they value Rogan's right to free speech. Instead they're  desperately trying to preserve their $100 million investment. Better idea -- they could cut their losses, stop trying to own podcasting, while Spotify is still a decent name." created="Mon, 07 Feb 2022 13:52:40 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/07/135137.html?title=isSpotifyTheNextFacebook#a135240"/>
				<source:outline text="Facebook made the same mistake Spotify is making. They should have peered with the blogging world, and absolved itself of regulating speech. Instead they tried to dominate, and their brand became synonymous with all the abuse they imported from the web." created="Mon, 07 Feb 2022 13:52:44 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/07/135137.html?title=isSpotifyTheNextFacebook#a135244"/>
				<source:outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ek&quot;&gt;Ek&lt;/a&gt; says he won't &quot;silence&quot; Rogan. But he doesn't have the power to silence anyone. If he were to stop carrying Rogan on his network, Rogan would still have the entire open web to speak on. But this is the real issue. If Ek continues on his path he will have the power to silence people. And that would be the end of podcasting as a medium. He's a very long way from that btw." created="Mon, 07 Feb 2022 13:52:48 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/07/135137.html?title=isSpotifyTheNextFacebook#a135248"/>
				<source:outline text="Ek is really saying is he doesn't want to lose his $100 million. If he told this truth, obviously no one but his shareholders would sympathize. I think if he chose to lose the  money it would be worth it.

			<description>What got me scrambling this morning was that the generator had run out of propane and the temperature outside was 10 degrees F. That's a pipe-freezing temperature. And the forecast for tonight was 16 (not that I knew this, I wasn't in the loop on the most basic information such as the weather forecast). Power's back on, pipes are safe, for now.</description>

			<description>I've had the power and internet out for 1.5 days. We had an ice storm, I know they're common but this is my first one. What happens I guess is that slush falls from the sky. It's warmer up there than it is on the ground. Some of it lands on the limbs of trees where it sticks momentarily. The air is so cold that it freezes. Then it happens again and again, until the limbs and branches, even the smallest ones, are encased in a tube of ice, and it's heavy. It weighs the branch down so it sags, they all sag, and some branches fall off, and a few trees just fall over (not many because earlier wind storms probably already blew those trees over). The branches that fall might be on top of power or internet lines, and some of them are over big power hardware. And when that goes out, whole towns go out. Like the area where I live. No power for 1.5 days. So I have gone out once each day at about 9AM and drove down to Woodstock where there is cell service (we have none where I live) and try to find out what's going on, read my email, etc. Then I go back home and read, and think. I can't write software because It isn't set up that way.</description>

Apparently she said the Holocaust was white people killing white people, it wasn't racial. And she was suspended for saying this, after she apologized. I'm not sure what she apologized for, whose feelings were hurt? And if they were, they could deal with it, it's not anything like a big deal. It's also true! Most Jews are white people, at least the ones I know. There are African Jews, and they are pretty black. And probably some people who look Asian who are Jews. But by and large, she was correct. And if she wasn't whose is going to stand up and tell me Whoopi isn't mone of the most thoughtful  celebs we have! She's an actual human being. I once had a long talk wtih her at a tech conference. I was a smoker then and so was she, and she came out and joined the smokers and we did what smokers do when they go outside to smoke -- we talk wtih each other about all kinds of stuff. She's a nice person. And if she's wrong (or more accurately you think she's wrong) then discuss it. Let's figure this out. But we have to stop punishing people for saying things that are obviously true that someone can get all pissy about. Now I wish I had an actual net connection so I could publish this. BTW, IU have a generator. This is only the second time it's been in use, and this is a very long period. I keep thinking it's going to run out of propane any minute. But for now, all my systems are going fine.</description>

			<description>Power and internet have been down all day. I haven't spent this much time offline in a long time. Took a drive into town first thing in the morning to be sure the power company and Spectrum were aware of the outages, checked in with some friends, and headed back up the hill. On the way down there were lots of trees blocking the road and in one place there was a down power line across the road, had to backtrack and go another way. Of course I had to put the project I was working on down for the whole day. I had a good day's work planned, and there are still a bunch of things to figure out. But my work system requires a net connection. One of the things I've been thinking about today is if there's a way around that. Update: It's hopeless. It would be a lot of work to get something running all-local, and to try to set that up without internet access would mean it would all have to work without being tested as I go. Not worth it. My internet is going to come back soon enough.</description>
