			<description>I've been raving about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Micro-Bluetooth-Speaker-Waterproof/dp/B07VSPPQXC&quot;&gt;Tribit Stormbox&lt;/a&gt; Bluetooth speaker to friends. The sound is great and large, but the package is small, sturdy, nice to hold the way an iPhone is. I have it strapped to the handlebar of my bike which I've been riding the last four days because the weather is so good. One more day, tomorrow, then it's going to cool off again. Definitely not November weather in the mountains.</description>

			<description>Sometimes people are wrong. The presidential election is one of those cases. Trump simply wasn’t doing the job. That’s an objective fact. When we get a president who is doing the job, and we elected one, the system will start working. And we desperately need it to work. So no, I’m not esp concerned about the feelings of Trump voters. They were wrong. We saved their lives. Maybe they’ll never appreciate it, but we did save their lives regardless.</description>

			<description>One of the reasons my blog doesn't work as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;an RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; is that I'm always adding links and editing text through the day. I am done by midnight before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; goes out. But people who read via RSS only see the first version of a post. RSS as a format is fine, but the installed base of readers hasn't evolved at all since the beginning.</description>

			<description>OK we just had an election in the US, and we're doing the same thing we do after every election. Trying to figure out how 70 million people could (this time) vote for Trump after seeing him in action for four years. I had a lot of trouble understanding why people gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; a second term, that was a stop-everything moment for me. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.podcatch.com/manila/gems/un/cnNov3.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/11/03.html&quot;&gt;that day&lt;/a&gt;, to preserve the moment. But this time I think maybe we're asking the wrong question. Why are so many people depressed? I think you have to be pretty sad to vote for Trump. I think that's what it's an expression of, sadness. What could we do to make living more fun? I know it's a weird question, but maybe someone has an idea. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you're an NBA fan as I am, you know all about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA&quot;&gt;Inside the NBA&lt;/a&gt; on TNT. Charles, Kenny, Shaq and Ernie. They're funny, smart, irreverant, and when they get serious, have a deep understanding of basketball. I want something like that for politics. The cable shows are dull and repetitive. If you're not going to say much at least tell some good stories.</description>

			<description>The Democrats should do some marketing, and connecting with their users (ie voters). Based on what I'm reading about the polls, they have a crude and often incorrect view of what they think and what influences them, what they look for in a candidate. Just read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/how-democrats-missed-trumps-appeal-to-latino-voters.html&quot;&gt;Hispanic voters&lt;/a&gt; in south Florida and Texas voting for Trump, when the Dems thought they had their support. &lt;i&gt;Membership in the Democratic Party should mean something. &lt;/i&gt;Or maybe we need to start another party, not to run candidates necessarily, but to organize voters. Maybe the Dems would get the idea that they should &quot;acquire&quot; this party. That's how change often happens in tech, btw. Key point I've raised over and over -- political parties and social networks belong together. The current crop of social nets are optimized for advertisers. No surprise they've made a mess of political organizing.</description>

How do we as individuals make things better other than symbolically. We still depend on the same people to rep us. The last 24 hours were glorious. Now we have to deal with reality.</description>

			<title>Throw an elbow Joe</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745665/characters/nm0817983&quot;&gt;Leo McGarry, a fictional character&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Bill Russell was getting eaten alive cuz they could never get him to throw an elbow. He didn't want to do it. So Red Auerbach told him to do it, one time, throw an elbow on a nationally televised game, you'll never have to do it again. You bet your ass they'll know the leak came from us.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed VP-elect Harris's speech last night. I was crying like a baby through the whole thing. Even though I'm not black, Indian-American or a woman, I'm a sucker for people rising through prejudice and achieving huge victories like that. I also like that she's from the Bay Area, specifically Berkeley, where I lived for a number of years, and still have friends who live there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Biden's speech was disturbing. Not because he said anyting other than what he was saying through the campaign -- he was totally consistent. But now we're on the other side of the election, and I don't think all the happy talk about working across the aisle will amount to anything, other than a sense by the Repubs and their voters, that yeah you can walk all over the Dems and there's never a price to pay.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another quote: I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Doctrine#:~:text=In%20this%20Address%2C%20Kennedy%20warned,in%20%22a%20struggle%20against%20the&quot;&gt;what JFK said&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5DODFhQ-H4&quot;&gt;inaugural&lt;/a&gt;, to the Soviets. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The equivalent from Biden to McConnell today would be...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We noticed that Trump stopped getting his Cabinet officials approved by the Senate a couple of years ago, and McConnell never said a word about it. So the first round of my Cabinet appointments will be on the house, freebies, appointed without Senate approval. Then we can have a big bipartisan conference on how we want this to work in the future. And until then, the Senate is out of the advise-and-consent business. If you don't like it, ask Nancy Pelosi if she'll impeach me. Heh.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the Repubs will squawk, loudly, and take the Dems to court. And Biden, like Trump, will ignore what the court says, if they dare rule on this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Same with oversight from the Senate. Cross that off the list too, until we come to some larger agreement about enforcing the norms that Trump and McConnell trashed over the last four years. Maybe the price is, dear Senate, that McConnell is censured and loses his party leadership. Or maybe we insist that he be sent back to Kentucky. I'm not kidding. What you all did is not excusable. We're willing to let McConnell take the fall, and then we can move on from there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But don't tell me how we're friends, we're not friends. McConnell came within a hair of turning America into a fascist dictatorship. He must've thought he'd get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/27/155932.html?title=weMustBeWorseThanTheRepubs&quot;&gt;We must be worse than the Repubs&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 27. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Repubs walk all over the Dems. But if you love America, you have to vote Democratic, because the Repubs are crazy fascists. We have to teach the Dems how to be hardass motherfuckers, and insist that they have a head-on collision with the Repubs so they respect them, and in doing so, respect us.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It sure sounds like Biden is making the same insane mistake Obama did, believing that this election is somehow transformative, or that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; is transformative, and all of a sudden, because the US is in dire trouble (as usual when the Dems take over), the Repubs will transform. They only respect you if you drive straight into a head-on collision with them without hitting the brakes. You are the president, Mr President-elect, you have to be the badass. I'm hoping you know that and this happy talk is just a veneer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written before the election was called. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So many things to observe in this marathon of an election night.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, it's nice that it isn't a nailbiter. We know the outcome. Unlike my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson&quot;&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who is beyond impatient for the networks to call the election, I'm glad that it's stretching out. I wish the 2008 election had been similarly extended so we could have had a chance to absorb the change gradually. Instead boom, he was elected, giving his acceptance speech, still gives me goosebumps, and we all went out to party in the streets. Now we're getting to savor the fullness of the moment. And the eventfulness of 2020 is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, Covid is raging. Growing exponentially. We're doing nothing to resist it. The example Trump set during the campaign, all those awful rallies, more awful because they were such good entertainment, is probably responsible for a good portion of the growth. I heard on the news that there's a high correlation between regions hardest-hit by the virus and those that voted for Trump. They see it as a conundrum, but it's obvious what the connection is. People who live in Trump Country don't see the virus as a threat. That's gotta be one of the biggest indicators. People who don't feel threatened by it are probably more likely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so here's something people don't like to say out loud. But obviously the Trump election was a reaction to the Obama election. The yin to the yang. People who don't like uppity presidents (ie blacks) probably don't care for presidents who don't know their place is in the home (ie women). They thought Trump was the perfect way to say Fuck You Try Again Assholes. Let Trump drive them crazy. Smart. It sure did that. So when enough people got tired of Trump the Dems offer up an affable white grandpa, he likes dogs! -- just the thing, but they snuck in just behind him a woman who happens to be black! We hardly noticed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At one point the other day, when it seemed clear that Biden was going to top it off, we realized oh shit it's going to be Vice-President Harris. She's really going to be VP. The glass ceiling is breaking as we speak. But you know what, the people in Trump Country noticed. They might've told the pollsters they were going to vote for Uncle Joe, thinking all the time that a black women wasn't their idea of someone who should be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Esp such an old heart. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's good that there's some time to contemplate this before it's official.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that's good is it gave Fox some time to decide how to handle this. At first they were going to refuse to call Biden President-elect Biden. That would have been a catastrophe. In the meantime, they figured it out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1324918336988221441&quot;&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/a&gt;, last night, looked into the camera and told Trump to go gracefully. They gave him an out. You have to figure if he doesn't take it, they're going to go ahead and call Biden president-elect. We had time to negotiate this. This is kind of a miracle but hardly anyone noticed. Fox isn't going to help start Civil War 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nate Silver is openly trying to figure out what happened with the polls. He seems glad that this is being drawn out too. Consider maybe the electorate was a moving target, and the polls, with all their heuristics couldn't pick that up. Things were seesawing with Trump in October. First he's in the hospital, looking frail, sick with Covid, possibly dying. That can't have been good for his polling. Then he recovers, is full of energy, pumped up on steroids, holding his normal now murderous rallies, and the Dems were holding drive-in embarrassments. &lt;i&gt;He juiced his base in late October, and it worked. &lt;/i&gt;It got people to think &quot;Hey hun, the old Trump is back,&quot; the virus didn't get him, look at the fun, and they switched their vote. They could, because Trump told them not to mail in their ballots. I think, net-net, people are being too hard on the polls, and too hard on the statisticians at the networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Meadows getting the virus at this moment and spreading it while covering  it up is the perfect epilogue for trump as something other than a tragic punchline.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Fargo digging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For a project I'm doing, I wanted to see how &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; did calendar structures. This is what I found out. It's here primarily so I can find it again later through search engines. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/myPublicProfile.opml&quot;&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; from Fargo, that I used briefly in the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014 to edit my blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I was interested in the attributes that Fargo used. I wanted to see what type attributes it used for calendars. I was surprised to see that it didn't use any. It did use a &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; attribute. And now I can see what it used that for, it was for the name of the file. It allowed you to change the text of the headline without affecting the name of the file the HTML rendering was saved in. This had come up as a question in some of the work we're doing with Old School. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For clues about Fargo, I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/blog/&quot;&gt;Fargo blog&lt;/a&gt; indispensible. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/fargoOutlines/fargoBlog.opml&quot;&gt;OPML source&lt;/a&gt; for the Fargo blog. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The news should reflect what the Trumps are really doing with the lawsuits. They're going to pitch state legislatures that the election was stolen and they should appoint different electors. The lawsuits just have to get press coverage and show up in opinion polls. They wouldn't have to flip too many states with Republican legislatures. For example: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan.</description>

			<description>Assuming Trump refuses to leave the White House, here’s the plan. Turn the White House into our equivalent of Lenin’s tomb. Seal it off but, everyone but Trump can leave, send him food and water and people can visit to see the imprisoned former president. When he dies embalm him.</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;While the campaign was still on, I didn't want to criticize the Dems for their rallies, which were basically impossible to watch. They must've been even worse to be a speaker at. You take a gifted campaigner like Obama, who could get into a lovefest with an audience, he had so many good lines like Don't Boo, Vote. The crowd would boo just to get him to say it! Or he'd say &lt;i&gt;Fired up! &lt;/i&gt;and everyone would scream &lt;i&gt;Ready to go! &lt;/i&gt;Even watching the rallies on TV would get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin&quot;&gt;love chemicals&lt;/a&gt; to flow through your blood. But the drive-in rallies, while the idea seemed cute and innovative, as an idea, were, in practice, embarrassing. I kept wondering if the Dems could have done something like what the NBA and MLB did, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportscasting.com/theres-a-surprising-amount-of-tech-behind-the-nbas-fake-crowd-noise/&quot;&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/09/05/baseball-fake-crowd-nosie&quot;&gt;crowd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/the-invisible-crowd-inside-the-nfls-fake-crowd-noise-system/2381799/&quot;&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone knew they were fake, but you didn't mind. Even though a basketball game with no crowd noise is actually kind of nice, as at a small college game, not having a crowd cheering and booing at the right times during the NBA Finals and the World Series would have been awful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the Repubs cut the corner, and went ahead and had viral-spreading events in the form of end-game political rallies. And they were wonderful. Trump, like Obama, really is in his element in those rallies. Once, because of a stubborn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaaltv.com/rochester-minnesota-news/president-trump-campaign-rally-rochester-october-30/5911428/&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_Minnesota&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, he had to give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/10/30/trump-rallies-in-rochester-with-spillover-from-250-capacity-showing-support-outside/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; to a socially distanced group of 250 people, and his heart wasn't in it, and he left early. So the Repubs cheated. I think that's where a lot of his votes came from. If the campaign had ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsGqrLkmFMU&quot;&gt;Trump on the balcony&lt;/a&gt;, febrile, gasping for air and weak, pulling of his mask, then we would have gotten the Biden/Harris landslide that the polls predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The really awful part is that the pundits, idiots, one and all, are ignoring the context of this election. As if it were a normal election where the candidates were playing on something of a level playing field. They weren't. The Repubs sacrificed hundreds of lives, and thousands of peoples' health and helped spread the virus that was already spreading uncontrollably. They weren't rallies for the presidency as much as they were rallies for the virus. Come get sick, and btw, also see the president dance. The people would have come out, just as much, for Obama and his mantras, or him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXcNgCr0nk&quot;&gt;brushing the dirt&lt;/a&gt; off his jacket, or just looking like the stud he is. Or Biden telling stories of his lost family, and how great America still is, and how it'll all come back as soon as he's in the Oval. But they didn't, and that was the right thing to do. And the pundits, who really do need to be fired, are ignoring the whole thing, and pretending the Dems are out of touch, when they were totally committed to the reality that there is a deadly pandemic that is happening at the same time as the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a replay of what happened in the final days of the primary, when people were mourning the loss of E Warren, and the impeachment was booting up. The virus was already the Big Story, but everyone was putting it off until they could get around to it. Same thing now. When we come back to the pandemic we will notice that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/us-coronavirus-100000-daily-cases&quot;&gt;100K new cases yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time record. But until we all focus on it, full time, and take our medicine, for real, we will never get out of this mode. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe next week the news can somehwat get back to reality.  And if the Biden win doesn't prove to be a mirage, we can all breathe a sigh of relief that the Orange Monster will be going back to where ever they will have him. I hear Florida voted for him, good -- he's theirs now. No backsies. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Even though a basketball game with no crowd noise is actually kind of nice, as at a small college game, not having a crowd cheering and booing at the right times during the NBA Finals and the World Series would have been awful." created="Thu, 05 Nov 2020 14:04:01 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/05/obama.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/11/05/141456.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a140401"/>
				<source:outline text="So the Repubs cut the corner, and went ahead and had viral-spreading events in the form of end-game political rallies. And they were wonderful. Trump, like Obama, really is in his element in those rallies. Once, because of a stubborn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaaltv.com/rochester-minnesota-news/president-trump-campaign-rally-rochester-october-30/5911428/&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_Minnesota&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, he had to give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/10/30/trump-rallies-in-rochester-with-spillover-from-250-capacity-showing-support-outside/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; to a socially distanced group of 250 people, and his heart wasn't in it, and he left early. So the Repubs cheated. I think that's where a lot of his votes came from. If the campaign had ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsGqrLkmFMU&quot;&gt;Trump on the balcony&lt;/a&gt;, febrile, gasping for air and weak, pulling of his mask, then we would have gotten the Biden/Harris landslide that the polls predicted." created="Thu, 05 Nov 2020 14:07:55 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/11/05/141456.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a140755"/>
				<source:outline text="The really awful part is that the pundits, idiots, one and all, are ignoring the context of this election. As if it were a normal election where the candidates were playing on something of a level playing field. They weren't. The Repubs sacrificed hundreds of lives, and thousands of peoples' health and helped spread the virus that was already spreading uncontrollably. They weren't rallies for the presidency as much as they were rallies for the virus. Come get sick, and btw, also see the president dance. The people would have come out, just as much, for Obama and his mantras, or him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXcNgCr0nk&quot;&gt;brushing the dirt&lt;/a&gt; off his jacket, or just looking like the stud he is. Or Biden telling stories of his lost family, and how great America still is, and how it'll all come back as soon as he's in the Oval. But they didn't, and that was the right thing to do. And the pundits, who really do need to be fired, are ignoring the whole thing, and pretending the Dems are out of touch, when they were totally committed to the reality that there is a deadly pandemic that is happening at the same time as the election." created="Thu, 05 Nov 2020 14:09:45 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/11/05/141456.html?title=morningCoffeeNotes#a140945"/>
				<source:outline text="This is kind of a replay of what happened in the final days of the primary, when people were mourning the loss of E Warren, and the impeachment was booting up. The virus was already the Big Story, but everyone was putting it off until they could get around to it. Same thing now. When we come back to the pandemic we will notice that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/us-coronavirus-100000-daily-cases&quot;&gt;100K new cases yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, an all-time record.

				<source:outline text="Maybe next week the news can somehwat get back to reality.  And if the Biden win doesn't prove to be a mirage, we can all breathe a sigh of relief that the Orange Monster will be going back to where ever they will have him.

			<description>Trump probably impressed the rest of the Republican Party by turning out so many voters, and keeping Congress competitive, even if he did have to spread a lot of virus to do it. Rallies make for better television if you don't mind killing hundreds of rally-goers, and making thousands sick.</description>

			<description>Funny thing, James Carville, who I love, has now been wrong about the last two elections. In 2018 he said it wouldn't result in Dem control of the House, and it did. And this time he predicted 2020 would be a landslide for the Dems, and unless some mistake has been made, not so.</description>

			<title>Morning coffee notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning sports fans!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How did you spend your night? I watched MSNBC, love Kornacki, you can have the rest of them, but I hated whenever the sound came on saying &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.9em;&quot;&gt;IT'S TIME TO CALL SOMETHING&lt;/span&gt;. It was always something like Kentucky or South Dakota, Vermont or New York. At one point I wrote on Twitter we're on the roller coaster now. That feeling of this is being done to me, I don't like it but at this point I have no choice, I'm on for the ride. I watched as Kornacki flipped over the counties in Florida, a remarkable number of which I was familiar with either from having been there or listening to any number of podcasts instructing me what to look out for. Very depressing. Oh shit. This feels like 2016, I said -- as did everyone else watching the returns. I started nodding off around 9PM and finally decided to go to bed at 10, and woke up at 1AM, and went looking to see how things had turned out and I literally screamed out loud when I saw Trump was ahead in Wisconsin. Oy oy oy. So here we are. And where is that exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well, Biden is very likely to win. And that is good news, even though they're already spinning on the webs that it would have been better if we won the Senate and lost the presidency, which is such utter bullshit. People are so stupid. Getting rid of Trump was job #1, and it seems we will get rid of him. No I didn't watch his campaign rally in the White House, and yes, I have heard it quoted, and yes, he is trying to be a dictator, and no doubt his voters will listen and believe him, and will drive their cars around running people off the road, and they might even kill people, but we're already dying in great numbers, so what the fuck difference would that make. Here's what getting rid of Trump means. Goodbye Bill Barr. Hello Paris Climate Treaty and let's get back together with the Iran deal. Let's start playing to win in international trade instead of just abdicating and sounding tough. And btw, let's get the babies out of those prisons, find their parents or at least get them into a home-like situation. And then think about all the things Trump won't be able to do if he's just a private citizen. Yes, he can be a first class asshole, and have rallies, but he will also be tried and probably convicted and go to jail. And for sure McConnell will block everything Biden tries to do, but think of it this way, Biden will block everything McConnell wants to do, something Trump didn't do. So fuck you and your fancy theories about wishing Trump were still president and McConnell would be Minority Leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's something I write every time a Republican wins, even though this time a Republican didn't win. We need to organize on a permanent persistent basis. It's not enough to ask for our money and phone banking at election time. We the non-elites have to be part of governing. You don't get to just ask for our money every four years and then say thanks now go away. We need to be part of this. Luckily we have this great technology that enables this, and we need to use it. Howard Dean was on the right track in 2004, but there was no follow-through (and of course he didn't even get nominated). Facebook and Twitter et al aren't the only models. We can create new media where people get to participate and where spamming means nothing. Today's networks are set up in a way that makes the most money for advertisers. We can set up networks that are great for governing and organizing. Until we do things will just keep getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was depressed at 10PM and 1AM but by 6AM I was over it. I'm ready for the next season in the great drama of American politics.&lt;i&gt; Let's have fun! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
