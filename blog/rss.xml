			<description>Assume Trump's devs are scrambling to get up a new social net. I'm sure they'll find something. I heard it said they won't get thru the App Store and Google Play. This is true. So guess what -- they'll have to use the open web. Politics and tech make strange bedfellows. ;-)</description>

			<description>The arguments about how you don't have free speech on private platforms don't reflect the reality of Twitter and Facebook, which have monopolistic power in the worlds they define. Those worlds are huge, powerful, growing, and most important here -- exclusive. We call them &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22silos%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;silos&lt;/a&gt; in tech, but they behave like monopolies in other contexts. They don't imho have the rights of truly private companies because they wield government-like power that can have the effect of restricting speech. Because they are silos, there's no way to route around them. This is dangerous stuff. Suppose for example the Republican Party owned Twitter. You can see how that would damage free discourse in our political system. And it's not impossible for a political entity to take control of Twitter, they're not very highly valued in the stock market. That's why the government must be involved in decisions that cut off political leaders. What made this situation so difficult is that it was &lt;i&gt;the president&lt;/i&gt; who needed to be silenced, before he could do more damage. A tough call, and a very difficult precedent. BTW, I do advocate for political parties becoming social networks. I think they already are that.</description>

			<description>Also, having the employees of Twitter and Facebook influening the censorship decisions the companies make is not good ethically. The employees should do their jobs, they should not personally have any say in who gets to use the network. We need ethical rules for professionals in tech. Here's an example from the medical profession. If you were a doctor in a hospital, and they wheeled in someone whose political opinions you abhor, you have to treat them no matter what. We insist that bakeries in Indiana bake cakes for gay couples as they would for heterosexual couples. It's easy to see when people you disagree with overstep professional ethical boundaries, much harder to see it when you do it yourself.</description>

			<description>These kinds of decisions have a lot of impact. For example, I was blacklisted from speaking at a few tech conferences probably because their sponsors didn't like the affect my work was having on their closed networks. As a result, I'm perceived to having left tech, when in fact, a couple of powerful and/or rich people pressured conference promoters to not allow me a public presence. When I complained about it on my blog, or in person to friends, they shrugged it off, kind of the way Repubs shrug off ethical failures in their work. There are consequences to this kind of back-room deal-making. By this time very few people have any sympathy for Trump, but this act sets a precedent. You may not like it when someone you support is cut off this way.</description>

			<description>Trump is leading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Cops&quot;&gt;Keystone Cops&lt;/a&gt; version of a military coup. Yesterday's speech was clearly a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwUUUqgfu-E&quot;&gt;KK&lt;/a&gt; version of a coverup. All the tracks lead back to him, as usual he didn't even try to hide them. God help us if he were even slightly more competent and slightly less narcissistic.</description>

			<description>My big objection with the way journalists talk about Facebook is that it's so naive. The questions are much much much more complicated. Shutting off Facebook, which seems to be what journalism wants, would be as stupidly disruptive as turning off Wikipedia, or even the phone network -- or for that matter, all the daily newspapers. Facebook is &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; important for information flow in our society. It's not a joke. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/thursday-7-january-2021/32578/&quot;&gt;excellent rant&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/08/naughton.png&quot;&gt;reporters had no idea&lt;/a&gt; how to cover something like the riot in DC on Wednesday. Well they don't know how to cover Facebook either. Yes it is used for some awful purposes, so is everything. We have a much bigger job to do today. One thing journalists could do to help is being more outgoing, inquisitive, and respond to direct statements like this one. We need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Sidebars to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;JN&lt;/a&gt;: 1. I wish your blog had permalinks so I could point to individual items. 2. I like strong language. The people who run these platforms are not elected, it's true. Neither are the other gatekeepers, and it would suck, imho, if they were. When someone screams fire in a crowded movie theater, as Trump is doing, it's up to the management to do something about it. Nothing wrong with that. I like the title &quot;creeps&quot; -- it fits, because like the management of Exxon, the people who run Facebook spoil the resource they monetize, in this case the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/16/inDefenseOfTheOpenWeb.html&quot;&gt;open web&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lasorda&quot;&gt;Tommy Lasorda&lt;/a&gt; is gone. 93 years old. A good run. He was manager of the Dodgers back before I hated them. But I can't say I ever loved them. I had an experience at the World Series vs the Oakland A's where we scalped tickets that turned out to be in the Dodger's wives section. They tried to have us removed, because we were very vocally advocating for the A's. Of course, this was at the Oakland Coliseum. They argued with the cops that we would have been ejected at Dodgers Stadium. You see that's the problem with baseball these days. Decorum. It was never meant to be a respectful sport, imho. Anyway, I digress. Lasorda was a famous manager of a winning team &quot;back in the day.&quot; Sigh. We're all getting old and soon we'll be dead. That's what it all means. Oh la.</description>

			<description>Another problem I have with the Dodgers is that my parents were Dodgers fans, back when they were in Brooklyn, and known as Da Bums. The name turns out to have fit, because one day they up and left Brooklyn. I understand the problem wasn't of their making, they were targeted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-robert-moses-is-to-blame-for-losing-the-brooklyn-dodgers-to-la&quot;&gt;Robert Moses&lt;/a&gt; to be the team for his new stadium which turned out to be the stadium the Mets played in. And our family, before I was really aware of these things, switched allegiance to the Mets, who were called The Amazins, which was of course sarcastic. Which is fine, because as I said -- baseball is not a respectful sport. Even when it comes to your home team. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I understand the problem wasn't of their making, they were targeted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-robert-moses-is-to-blame-for-losing-the-brooklyn-dodgers-to-la&quot;&gt;Robert Moses&lt;/a&gt; to be the team for his new stadium which turned out to be the stadium the Mets played in. And our family, before I was really aware of these things, switched allegiance to the Mets, who were called The Amazins, which was of course sarcastic. Which is fine, because as I said -- baseball is not a respectful sport. Even when it comes to your home team. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 08 Jan 2021 17:14:36 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/01/08.html#a171436"/>

			<description>Twitter should also disconnect Trump. This is hard for me to advocate, as one of the first bloggers and podcasters, I believe, at my core, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;direct communication&lt;/a&gt;. But this has gone far enough. Someone said the Constitution is not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_is_not_a_suicide_pact&quot;&gt;suicide pact&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Don't be a useful idiot. Don't RT the fascists. That's why they stay on Twitter, to outrage you and your followers. If you weren't helping them, they'd stay on their own private social net. What's ironic is that some of the worst offenders are reporters whose pubs blame Facebook for the garbage news. Their own reporters are distributing the same stuff on Twitter.</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few ideas early in the day...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We really need to get Trump out of the White House. Yesterday, as the riot was developing, I posted on Twitter that this coup could be successful. They will try again. And remember there are 50 state capitals in the US. Any of them could be next. I hope they're preparing for it. Esp the swing states. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment? How fast could it happen? The Dems certainly have enough votes to impeach. Could they must 51 votes in the Senate to have a real trial? Could they somehow get 66 votes to convict? It may end up being symbolic, but censorship is not enough. Trump being the first president to be removed from office through impeachment would be the warning we needed at the beginning of 2020. It could give the Republican senators another chance to do the right thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Communication. We need much better communication among all the American people. It's no longer acceptable that there be several versions of the truth. Radio Free America. It has to be less wish-washy and repetitive than Wolf Blitzer or as one-sided as Maddow. The NYT isn't it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Law enforcement. We have a big problem with the police, a lot of them are fascists, and support Trump. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/29/humansAreCrazy.html&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;An amazing scene in a Frontline episode in the Iraqi parliament while Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq. It was time for a purge. Saddam had decided to execute the whole legislature. The doors were locked and they started taking out people one by one and shooting them. Saddam, sadist that he was, videotaped it. So you could see what these guys were doing as they figured out, one by one, what was happening. So what did the condemned legislators do while waiting to be shot? They gave speeches, denouncing each other as the real enemy of the state, and proclaiming their love for Saddam, the best friend he ever had. Didn't work, they were all killed.&quot; They used to have video on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/&quot;&gt;PBS site&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a victim of the deprecation of Flash. If you know of another copy, please send me a pointer.</description>

			<description>I changed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/06/headerImage.png&quot;&gt;header image&lt;/a&gt; on my blog to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/06/usCapitol.png&quot;&gt;beautiful shot&lt;/a&gt; of the US Capitol. Amazing how quickly the political action moved from Georgia to DC. But all this Trump michegas is masking the big story -- the pandemic is digging in with increased virality all over the world, but especially in the US. With power as it's currently configured, we finally have a chance to help ourselves. But only barely.</description>

Amazing how quickly the political action moved from Georgia to DC.

			<description>Stacey Abrams does it right: She finds out what the people need. That's a pretty good basic method for politics. And she says, I think correctly, that as the Dems get better at that, the Repubs will have to too.</description>

			<description>I had a conversation with a friend yesterday about why I go for connecting big things to other big things. It's not for money or fame, it's about power -- for the users of the open web. Which is what got me back into software development with a passion in the early 90s. I had already lived through a couple of generations of wide open &quot;blue sky&quot; that was later foreclosed on by the bankers. I felt that the technology of the web, as with the personal computer before it, could be used to enhance communication, and that could be used to solve problems, the ones we're still grappling with today. That's why it's not enough to make cool software, though I admit I love doing that -- it's for the power it gives to people to solve our problems. I still believe in that, as I did when I first got into software development in the 1970s.</description>

			<description>Every year Mark Zuckerberg takes on a personal challenge, running 365 miles, reading 25 books. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/668630340011041&quot;&gt;In 2018&lt;/a&gt; he focused on &quot;fixing important issues.&quot; I suggested one. &quot;Stop killing the open web. Never mind fancy tech, support the features the web has had since inception. Linking, first and foremost, then simple styling, titles for posts and podcasting. Then take a vacation and kick back. We don't need boy genius heroics, just trust the decentralization you say you believe in.&quot; This is still on his todo list as far as I'm concerned.
