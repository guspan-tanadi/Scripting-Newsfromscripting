			<description>This is kind of important. Logseq now exports OPML. If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/?url=http://instantoutliner.com/pg&quot;&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt;, their outline will open in LO2. Seeing their outline open in my world is revealing to say the least. This is like joining two cultures. The Mac outlining culture with the &quot;other&quot; culture (to me) which derives from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode&quot;&gt;Org-mode&lt;/a&gt; (i am told) and wikis. I can see some interesting cross-fertilization happening.</description>

			<description>About Logseq: I love their energy, how quickly they got on board with OPML. There are lots of things I want to show that we can do &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/opmlChecklist/&quot;&gt;with OPML&lt;/a&gt;. Most important it's all about the open web, connecting people's virtual minds, not just everyone on their own island.</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment&quot;&gt;In Treatment&lt;/a&gt;. It's kind of appalling how people trod all over the therapist's boundaries. They project wildly on him. He should get combat pay.</description>

			<description>The Brooklyn Nets are not a real basketball team. They are just a shell that Kevin Durant pwned by signing with them. Kind of the way Apple didn't really buy NeXT, it was the other way around. Anyway, the Durant's &quot;Nets&quot; might win a title, or try a couple of times, but either way the train will move on and leave the Nets as wrecked as the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is a trend, it's no longer innovative, curious, fun or even good basketball. Durant was bored in Golden State. He'll get bored in Brooklyn too. Imho, they're boring right now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I started watching the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment&quot;&gt;In Treatment&lt;/a&gt;. At first it's boring, but it develops as it goes along. Some of the most despicable characters become sympathetic, and vice versa. You see real love between some of the pairs, also a lot of fear. 90 percent is conversations in a therapist's office. I found it hard to imagine how that could work, but it does.</description>

			<description>A segment this morning on NPR, a discussion between two alumni of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_High_School_(Jacksonville)&quot;&gt;Robert E Lee High School&lt;/a&gt; in Jacksonville, FL. It's in northeast Florida, an area I'm fairly familiar with, my uncle used to live in the area. It's more like rural Georgia than most of Florida. The thing that hasn't gotten through to the whites there is that slavery is still ongoing in the US. They can't yet relate to the blacks as fellow Americans. If they could, they could understand the history they cherish was slavery to the blacks. They were considered property, animals, they could be killed with impunity. Asked how he would feel if it were Adolf Hitler High School, he said it was nothing like that, but it is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; like that, only the Third Reich lasted only 13 years. American slavery lasted &lt;i&gt;250&lt;/i&gt; years. Renaming a high school is a very small step. When we are fully reconciled, all of us will see the slaves of America as our ancestors. In the South they resist even beginning going down that path.</description>

			<description>My thinking was influenced by parents and grandparents who barely escaped Germany in WWII spending the rest of their lives trying to figure out WTF happened. If we live through something like that we'll learn a lot. But if their experience means anything, probably far more questions than answers.</description>

			<title>Naomi Osaka &amp; Derrick Rose</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeVca9MwDX8&quot;&gt;great scene&lt;/a&gt; in Bull Durham where the veteran teaches the rookie how to talk to reporters. It's all cliches. &quot;Of course it's boring,&quot; says the pro, &quot;that's the point.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a ridiculous ritual. Esp with a star as young as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka&quot;&gt;Naomi Osaka&lt;/a&gt;. She has incredible talent, but when you're so young, in her case 23, most of it is intuitive, not well-understood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen that recently in interviews with Knicks star &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/04/21/how-derrick-rose-has-transformed-knicks-from-upstarts-to-winners/&quot;&gt;Derrick Rose&lt;/a&gt;. The questions reporters ask are still insipid, but at 32, having been a huge star at 22, &lt;a href=&quot;https://therookiewire.usatoday.com/2021/05/03/bulls-derrick-rose-youngest-player-nba-mvp/&quot;&gt;youngest MVP ever&lt;/a&gt;, then having his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose#2011%E2%80%9312:_ACL_tear&quot;&gt;body break&lt;/a&gt; over and over, he had to learn how it works, and now his play still has a lot of the spark he had when he was young, and even better, now he can tell you how he manages it, something he probably could not have done at 22. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find at my advanced age, in a &quot;sport&quot; where you body's age doesn't matter (up to a point, see this blog in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/07.html&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/08.html&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;), I have a much better understanding of how I do what I do than when I was an ambitious star in my 20s. I can tell you a lot more how this works than I could then, when I just had an intuitive sense of how it worked. Enough of that intuition was right so that I could make it to the next stage, and the one after that, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software, very few people stick with it through their whole career as I have. Companies still have no idea how age and tech work co-relate. But we know a lot about tennis, and basketball. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Naomi Osaka is brilliant, wonderful, a joy to behold. You can see it, read it, in everything she does and says. Her intuition says she should be allowed to be introspective while she tries to win in her sport. Her intuition is incredibly compelling. I feel of her as I do of a great movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino&quot;&gt;maker&lt;/a&gt;, or software developer. In 10 or 20 years ask her how she does it, she'll have some answers. Right now it's probably not possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My opinion only. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="It's a ridiculous ritual. Esp with a star as young as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka&quot;&gt;Naomi Osaka&lt;/a&gt;. She has incredible talent, but when you're so young, in her case 23, most of it is intuitive, not well-understood." created="Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:21:34 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/01/141749.html?title=naomiOsakaDerrickRose#a142134"/>

				<source:outline text="I find at my advanced age, in a &quot;sport&quot; where you body's age doesn't matter (up to a point, see this blog in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/07.html&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/08.html&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;), I have a much better understanding of how I do what I do than when I was an ambitious star in my 20s. I can tell you a lot more how this works than I could then, when I just had an intuitive sense of how it worked. Enough of that intuition was right so that I could make it to the next stage, and the one after that, and so on." created="Tue, 01 Jun 2021 14:22:41 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/06/01/141749.html?title=naomiOsakaDerrickRose#a142241"/>

				<source:outline text="Naomi Osaka is brilliant, wonderful, a joy to behold. You can see it, read it, in everything she does and says. Her intuition says she should be allowed to be introspective while she tries to win in her sport. Her intuition is incredibly compelling. I feel of her as I do of a great movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino&quot;&gt;maker&lt;/a&gt;, or software developer.
