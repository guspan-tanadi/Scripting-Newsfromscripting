			<title>Correcting media errors</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Mistakes heard recently (and repeatedly) on cable news.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Wearing a mask protects other people more than it protects the wearer. So if one person in a crowd of thousands wears a mask, unless it's certain that person has the virus, it's not doing much to protect anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It has been said that if the Dems win the Senate and hold the House, it doesn't matter if Trump is re-elected, Congress will remove him. Not possible. It takes a 2/3 majority in the Senate, or 67 votes, to remove the president, and there aren't enough Republican seats at stake in the election to give the Dems that big a majority, even if they swept the Repubs. However there would be enough Democrats in the Senate to require a full trial, including testimony. Recall that the Senate not only didn't convict, they didn't allow an actual trial with witnesses and compelled testimony.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Repeating Russian misinfo, even to question it, is journalistic malpractice. It's the biggest mistake journalism keeps repeating. Journalism wields a lot of power, and that power is accountable to no one. It may be a bigger problem than Citizens United or court packing by either party.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moneyball&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70201437&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. Iâ€™ve seen it before and read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, but itâ€™s good to get a refresher. Everything, not just baseball, needs a fresh look, because weâ€™ve been doing so much the same way we always have, without thought, not questioning out-of-date assumptions.</description>

			<description>I am usually interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball&quot;&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association&quot;&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; playoffs, but this year I practically ignored them. The reason, in retrospect, is that sports is all about the ritual, the continutity, the historic connection. Novelty feels wrong. For example, I still haven't gotten over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter&quot;&gt;Designated Hitter Rule&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal&quot;&gt;three-point shot&lt;/a&gt; in basketball still seems like an innovation. I like sports because they connect to the past. I went to games as a kid with ancestors who are now gone. &quot;What did the Mets do?&quot; was the beginning of every kitchen table conversation in the house I grew up in. It was the default. To this day my brain says those words when it's idle. This season was a heroic effort for both sports, esp the NBA with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble&quot;&gt;bubble&lt;/a&gt;, but the only heroism that gets me to pay attention to sport is what happens on the court and on the field.</description>

			<description>The primary rule of trolls is the rage has to build. Immunity to outrage builds up over time. What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today. That's the problem with Trump as a troll. He got stuck. He's trying to entertain with the same schtick he used four years ago. Yawn. Been there done that.</description>

			<description>I wonder if The Lincoln Project should do an ad just for Georgia that tells voters that the state has become famous for suppressing African-American votes. People overlook just where we're at on racism in this country, even a state like Georgia where a fair number of Repubs must've voted for a black man, who was elected president, and did a decent job, esp compared to the shitshow of a Republican who's president now. Remind them that there is no honor in preventing an equal citizen of your state from voting.</description>

			<title>Trump's magnificent shitshow</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/15.html#a130631&quot;&gt;told you&lt;/a&gt; that Trump would suck at the town hall yesterday, whether or not Biden was there. NBC did us all a favor by putting it on. People, you have to think. This is not 2016, when Trump was a juggernaut. Like it or not, Trump is president now, and reality has caught up with him, and with us, his subjects. The economy is wrecked, huge numbers of Americans are dead, many more seriously sick, and there's no end in sight. We're all either huddled in our houses in isolation, or out getting infected, and there isn't much of an inbetween. If there's a car accident in Wisconsin they won't be able to help the victims because there's no room in the hospitals. Trump is much more familiar with the conspiracy theories than he is with what's actually happening in the country he's supposed to govern.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So how did a meetup with actual American voters go? It was a shitshow. A glorious, Trump-humiliating shitshow. It was obvious that was how it was going to go. There's an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-by-generals-always-fight-the-last-war&quot;&gt;adage&lt;/a&gt; about people always fighting the last war. 2020 is not 2016. Trump isn't the same candidate he was then. In 2016 you would be right to be pissed at NBC. But in 2020, we should be thanking them for giving full exposure to the fake president we sadly have, and happily have a chance to remove. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Maddow I didn't even have to watch the Trump town hall. She did an incredible post-town-hall review of all the ridiculousness of Trump trying to talk to normal voters about his role as their commander in chief. Hers was the inverse of a shitshow. She was cleaning up the shit after the show. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you saw the last Trump town hall, a few weeks ago, you wouldn't be so mad at NBC. He doesn't like questions from voters. He can't call them fake news. I don't think it'll help him.</description>

			<title>My Borgen review</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fborgen&quot;&gt;Borgen&lt;/a&gt; last night. Three &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70302482&quot;&gt;seasons&lt;/a&gt;, and I would love to watch the fourth season right now. As I do my work this morning, my mind keeps drifting back to how the last season ends. How the conflicts get resolved, and the questions that are left unanswered. Every character is about to embark on something new. But they got there by stretching themselves, taking a risk, and coming out okay. Not perfectly, they pretty much all got hurt, but in the end they more or less have a clean slate, lots of possibilities, and I wonder what's next.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You end up loving them. They bare their souls to you. You see them weak, and dealing with it. To pull that off, in TV, is pretty amazing. And that all that comes through from reading titles in a Danish-language show. The characters at times switch into perfect British-accented English, mainly because they're doing something international. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No spoilers, so I can't tell you the roles the various characters play, but I will say that this is sort of like the Danish equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing&quot;&gt;The West Wing&lt;/a&gt;, only more adult, and less &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=schmaltzy&quot;&gt;schmaltzy&lt;/a&gt;. The writing is very good, but it's not Aaron Sorkin, and that's neither a plus or minus. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They also have an English-dubbed version. I tried that at first, but the subtitles were for the Danish version, and there are differences. I prefer shows, even in English, that have subtitles. I think dubbing is generally cheesy, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After finishing it, I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my BingeWorthy page&lt;/a&gt; and changed the rating from Loved to Best, the top rating. If you have the time, and can read titles, I would put this on my watchlist. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Usually when we're watching a travesty happen in Washington, a gun massacre, starting a war, giving money to the rich, there isn't much we can do but say &quot;Remember to vote two years from now.&quot; This time everyone gets to stick it to the Repubs in real time.</description>

It gives me something to compare my software to. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Little Pork Chop%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Little Pork Chop&lt;/a&gt; back in 2014. It was the one of the first Node-based web apps I shipped. A little thing I whipped up in a few days and finished while I was traveling in Europe. It was a lot of fun. After a while spammers found out about it, and used it to spray messages through accounts with no real followers, to influence some algorithm, presumably. Kind of humiliating. Now I'm ready to make it useful for people and not useful for spamming. I think. Also considering making it a personal tool for people to deploy on Glitch. I'm looking for something to put into that pot. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>PS: WordPress should do a tool that goes the other way. Lets you write a blog post in a series of tweets. I know that probably seems counter-intuitive, but I learned today a fair number of users don't like the new block editor. And Twitter is, these days, a fairly fluid writing tool</description>

			<description>I mostly write without typos, but they get introduced when I edit. I've noticed more typos than usual in the last few days. I think it's the changing of the seasons. Swimming is over until late spring. Still bike riding but some days it's too cold or wet, so I walk instead. And I'm no longer good at walking. This summer was the first time since I left California in 2003 that I was swimming every day. It's very good for me. And its absence is very unsettling. I thnk that's why I feel a bit off now.</description>

			<description>So here's a question for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davenewworld_2/status/1316398093877772288&quot;&gt;Trump supporters&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/republican-response-coronavirus.html&quot;&gt;enjoy&lt;/a&gt; making &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/libtard&quot;&gt;libtards&lt;/a&gt; cry. Do you think they're crying because you hurt their feelings? Is that what you're into? Do you also like to hurt yourself? Because the thing the libtard probably is crying about is how you're going to lose your health care, or job, or freedom, in other words how your injured dignity is going to hurt &lt;i&gt;even more.&lt;/i&gt; If you make me sad it isn't because you called me a name, it's because our once-great country has been reduced to jealousy as a popular form of political expression. I wish you were happier with your life, I really do, but I don't think trying to give your pain to others is actually going to make you feel better. I think if anything it'll make you feel worse.</description>

			<title>Theory about Georgia</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a theory why the Repubs are tanking in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At least a few Republican voters in Georgia are pissed off about voter suppression of blacks. It might not be the final straw for a majority of Repubs, but it probably is for some.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is based on something I learned in software in 1984. We shipped ThinkTank for the Mac in April. One of the first products to ship for the Mac. How did we do it so fast? We left out a lot of features, figuring we're getting a fresh start on the Mac. Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knew what ThinkTank could do on the Apple II and IBM PC, and they felt ripped off that the ThinkTank they bought for the Mac was less capable. We rushed out another version by the end of the year that came closer to matching what they expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How does this apply to Georgia? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well the Repubs never thought how some of their supporters would feel about voter suppression. Sure there aren't many blacks who vote Republican, but some of the whites don't want to vote for a party that would do what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember is that while Georgia didn't go for Obama, there were probably a fair number of Republicans who voted for him in Georgia in 2008 and 2012. People who had gotten over their fear of blacks enough to vote for one. The US is changing. As much as we emphasize that racism is still here, and it is -- we also had a black president for eight years. That is change. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That, and people know more than you think they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>WordPress added a tweet-streaming feature, described in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/wordpress-can-now-turn-blog-posts-into-tweetstorms-automatically/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; article. I followed their directions, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bullmancuso/status/1316064421844865024&quot;&gt;published a thread&lt;/a&gt;, based on a post &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/12.html#a144048&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The post also &lt;a href=&quot;https://unberkeley.wordpress.com/2020/10/13/where-is-your-soul/&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress.com, so it elminates the need for a separate app that turns a thread into a post. Makes me wonder if Substack and Medium are going to add this feature. Also does WordPress support email bulletins?</description>

			<description>I object to the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/podcasts/the-daily/abortion-rights-amy-coney-barrett.html&quot;&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Why The Left is Losing on Abortion.&quot; Once again it's a horserace. Winning and losing. And the subject is wrong. I guess &quot;The Left&quot; is losing but really it's the people of the United States who are losing. This is a terrible disease in American discourse and until we train ourselves to stop ignoring ourselves and realize that &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are the government, and insist that our journalists do the same, we will all keep losing, left, right, center, all of it.</description>

			<description>BTW, a Supreme Court justice is part of the government, and therefore governs, and since we are the government, the justice represents us. Who among us do Alito, Roberts, Kavanaugh, Thomas and Gorsach represent? Not me, not anyone I know. Probably not many Trump supporters either. So should we really be adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedsoc.org/&quot;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt;? This is the way journalism should be approaching this story, imho. But who am I. Just a voter, citizen, taxpayer. According to our rulers, insignificant.</description>

			<description>I was talking with a friend the other day, just rambling about software and how I'm not terribly focused and I'm kind of okay with that. They asked what would you like to work on if you had your way. No question about it -- outliners. We have lots of unfinished business. But it still remains a boutique category, and I'm not succeeding at getting my outliner to get enough use to get to critical mass. Other people, newcomers (from my point of view) have gained traction, like Roam and Workflowy. What I really want is to combine outlining and blogging (i.e. fluid online writing). Then I think we'd be inventing a new kind of communication on the net. I have lots of technology for that, but what I'm missing is users. This idea goes all the way back to the beginning of blogging in the mid-90s. Eventually we caved and made a blogging tool that worked the way people expected. I don't want to try to raise venture capital and start a company. I've done that before, and it just takes me away from what I love to do. It isn't my calling. And at my advanced age, there's no time for doing work that isn't what I'm meant to do.</description>

			<description>I have a couple of hours to kill today in Kingston, but it's pouring rain outside. In the old days I'd bring a laptop and hang out in Starbucks or the library. But now that we have Covid, I think I'm going to be listening to podcasts in my car. Oy. I'll have a nice latte of course from Starbucks. But I'm not going to hang out inside and risk getting killed. (Update: Better idea. I'm almost finished with Season 3 of Borgen. I think I'll download it on my iPhone and watch that. Blogging is amazing. Sometimes you figure stuff out.)</description>

From there, we could be informed of how to vote. And so much more. It would be as revolutionary as the Declaration of Independence.</description>

			<description>When you think about how Trump became president, it could be that from now on we elect people to play the role of president, more than &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; the president, and maybe they should be separate jobs. Seems a good defensive move, in case this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the future, would be to start a few shows with characters who are powerful &lt;i&gt;Democratic&lt;/i&gt; ideals for president. We have Martin Sheen, but he's a little old, and he is doing Trump-like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF3yi41gfgA&quot;&gt;cheezy commercials&lt;/a&gt; now for cheap drugs. I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geena_Davis&quot;&gt;Geena Davis&lt;/a&gt;. She played the first (and only?) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;woman president&lt;/a&gt; in a TV series in the US.</description>

I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geena_Davis&quot;&gt;Geena Davis&lt;/a&gt;. She played the first (and only?) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_Chief_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;woman president&lt;/a&gt; in a TV series in the US." created="Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:38:53 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/12/commanderInChief.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/10/12.html#a153853"/>

			<description>Is your ballot property? If someone steals your vote, have they &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfist.com/2020/10/12/california-gop-putting-out-bogus-ballot-boxes-in-at-least-three-counties/&quot;&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; your property? Can you stand your ground? If someone tries to steal your ballot can you shoot them? If you kill them, will you be forgiven? Just wondering if Republican values apply to Republicans.</description>

			<description>Perhaps what Trump voters are saying is they want a monarchy like Britain, where they can have strong opinions about people who are of no consequence (though I imagine some Brits might disagree).</description>

			<description>My friend Peter Politi said of the new BingeWorthy watchlist: &quot;A very useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/11/150652.html?title=watchlistFeatureForBingeworthy&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; as it allows someone with fleeting memory to create a list of shows that they may want to see in the future, based on others' recommendations.&quot;</description>

			<description>I was writing enthusiastically about &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Clubhouse%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, then I stopped writing, because I stopped using it. At first, for no particular reason. I wasn't finding conversations that interested me, and when I started them myself, usually &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/02/173236.html?title=clubhouseAfterAMonth#a174138&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/a&gt; happened. Then came the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation&quot;&gt;anti&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/clubhouse-app-anti-semitism&quot;&gt;Semitism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/09/30/elite-tech-app-clubhouse-under-fire-for-hosting-antisemitic-discussion-on-black-jewish-relations/&quot;&gt;meltdown&lt;/a&gt;.  It was depressing to find out that fighting for equality, to the extent that it works, would not end the hatred for my people. After that I looked at every conversation there differently. Never spoke again. I still have the app, am still a member, so this all could change, but I thought it was good to update.</description>

			<description>The only high-level language I've ever used that had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Macros.html&quot;&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;. It was really useful. Why doesn't JavaScript come with one? It could easily make code only readable by the author, but it might make it possible to smooth over design issues without waiting for the language to change.</description>
