In the house I grew up in, this is something no one ever said, because (as the theory goes) if you said it, you'd be forever reminded of the time you were &quot;wrong&quot; and they were right. You would be subordinate to this person, be it your mother, father, brother, grandfather, grandmother. Not my uncles so much, they were more on my side than the rest of them. Anyway it took me a number of years of living outside this house to realize that not everyone is like this. Some people relax when you &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/01/12/heyYouDidAGoodJobThere.html&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the magic words. They open up and say more things that you can learn from. Everyone has a point of view, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;blind men&lt;/a&gt; and the elephant. What they see as truth may not be a &lt;i&gt;universal&lt;/i&gt; truth, but to them it seems that way. And you are one of those people too. One time a long time ago, when I realized all of us can learn from everyone else, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html#5&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that we're just barking, farting chihuahas, even captains of industry like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison, with delusions of grandeur and a sense that they matter. Nothing we do really matters, in the end, but we can pretend that it does, in the moment, and if you can say something true that makes someone happy, why not? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The Mets and Braves were playing at the same time in different cities, tied for first place in the NL East, as both games went into extra innings. I was sure the Mets were going to lose because they kept doing the exact wrong thing. But the hero of September 2022 for the Mets, a man who is not known for heroics, the third baseman &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Escobar&quot;&gt;Escobar&lt;/a&gt;, came to the plate in the 10th inning and hit the ball into left field, and the shortstop, Lindor, who was on second base, came around third, as the ball was coming to the plate, but the throw was off and the shortstop scored and there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/29/escobar.png&quot;&gt;pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; everywhere. And meanwhile in the other game, the Braves were losing, so as they say it was a win-wn. But I'm not sure I can stand the stress of the post-season that's starting in a week, but actually feels as if is already underway.</description>

			<description>Wouldn't it be nice if there were a group of bloggers, people who write regularly, who are friends but might view things differently, but agree to read each other's pieces and speak up if they had something to say. They would know what they said would be read by other bloggers.</description>

			<description>Another story. When I was in grad school, in Wisconsin, I lived in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0683469,-89.387218,3a,75y,133.83h,83.15t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1siwxmm2ZOCoKITaSDRlnXwA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3Diwxmm2ZOCoKITaSDRlnXwA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D131.00456%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; with nine other students, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/08/27#a36&quot;&gt;West Wilson St&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Monona&quot;&gt;Lake Monona&lt;/a&gt; and a park with tennis courts. It was the best time of my life. Always a party to come home to, and I loved the work I was doing with computers at the university, and I had a cat named Nurse, who I brought with me to Madison from NYC. She was a great cat. When I adopted her from a cat lady in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan, who had at least 50 cats in her small apartment, she pointed out this kitten who was protecting a sickly cat from the others. That's the one I took, and I called her Nurse because that's what she was when I met her. Anyway, in Madison, Nurse found a boyfriend, I guess, and she got pregnant, and had her kittens in the big house on West Wilson. I gave her a box in the corner of my room, and people were coming in all the time to see and touch the incredible kittens she had birthed. But one morning, they were all gone! The box was empty. No Nurse, no kittens! I did eventually find her, in a drawer in my dresser which I had left open, with some socks and stuff, there she was. I didn't tell anyone because her intention was clear. Then a few days later, kittens everywhere! Nurse was sitting somewhere off on her own and the kittens were discovering all aspects of the big house they were born in and all the people. A couple of days later we put them up for adoption and Nurse went to the vet to get fixed, and when she came home they were gone and she went on with her life hunting mice and birds.</description>

			<description>Okay here's a problem. Axios has a feed. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.axios.com/feed/&quot;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt;.  When I view it in the browser it shows up fine. Even &lt;a href=&quot;view-source:https://api.axios.com/feed/&quot;&gt;view source&lt;/a&gt;. If I bring it to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.axios.com%2Ffeed%2F&quot;&gt;W3C feed validator&lt;/a&gt;, it can read it and says it's a valid RSS feed. But when I try to open it in my feed reader I get a 403 Forbidden. I assume they're only allowing some services to read their feed? I've never seen this behavior before. Anyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1575124429490855941&quot;&gt;have an idea&lt;/a&gt; what's going on? (Update: In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ScottHansonDE/status/1575156930779152385&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; Scott Hanson has the answer. They serve through CloudFlare, and they require a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA&quot;&gt;CAPTCHA&lt;/a&gt; for requests coming from Digital Ocean, and my servers are there. With that info we were able to add a route-around, so now we're receiving Axios news in our feed system.)</description>

			<description>Believe it or not &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonathanweisman/status/1574561803295608832&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; was written by a NYT reporter: &quot;Please Twitter, leave [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=maggie+haberman&quot;&gt;Maggie Haberman&lt;/a&gt;] alone. Trump lost the election, for God's sake. If Maggie had told you a little bit more before the election (she told you &lt;i&gt;a lot,&lt;/i&gt; btw), what, you think Trump would have lost ... twice?&quot; Where do they find these people. It's amazing to me that the NYT doesn't fire both of them. I took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/28/screenshot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; in case he deletes the tweet. I wrote this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/27.html#a170831&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about Haberman.</description>

Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1575023277184937989&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Twitter should warn you that the link you’re about to click has a paywall and that all you’ll see is an offer to subscribe.&quot; Reminds me of a story I heard from a PR person I hired when I was miscast as the CEO of a software company in the 80s. I was paying them $5K per month, plus hourly fees and expenses. The $5K was due whether or not we used them that month. Since we were usually short on money, I was always thinking of cutting that expense, but I didn't because when we needed them they got us far more coverage than a little company like ours could command on our own. The CEO of the firm said to me once that I was not the customer, even though I was paying them so much money. The reporters were the customers. People like you come and go, she continued, but I have to keep the relationship with the reporters going no matter what. I think it's like that with Twitter and the people who click on links. Every time Twitter lets them use us this way, we hate Twitter a little more. We become more averse to clicking links. Just sayin, they don't have a business if they don't have our attention, and they're burning it, every time an advertiser wastes that attention, not to mention it's incredibly wasteful of the advertiser's money. This problem desperately needs a solution. The users want to pay money for news, but the offers the 8000 pubs that occasionaly have a must-read article are ridiculous.</description>

			<source:outline text="I've tweeted on this subject many times and every time I do it gets Liked and RTd far more than most of my other tweets. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1575023277184937989&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Twitter should warn you that the link you’re about to click has a paywall and that all you’ll see is an offer to subscribe.&quot; Reminds me of a story I heard from a PR person I hired when I was miscast as the CEO of a software company in the 80s. I was paying them $5K per month, plus hourly fees and expenses. The $5K was due whether or not we used them that month. Since we were usually short on money, I was always thinking of cutting that expense, but I didn't because when we needed them they got us far more coverage than a little company like ours could command on our own. The CEO of the firm said to me once that I was not the customer, even though I was paying them so much money. The reporters were the customers. People like you come and go, she continued, but I have to keep the relationship with the reporters going no matter what. I think it's like that with Twitter and the people who click on links. Every time Twitter lets them use us this way, we hate Twitter a little more. We become more averse to clicking links. Just sayin, they don't have a business if they don't have our attention, and they're burning it, every time an advertiser wastes that attention, not to mention it's incredibly wasteful of the advertiser's money. This problem desperately needs a solution.

			<description>Twitter — ads that lead to the paywall of a publication are mean and stupid. They managed to convince us to buy their product, but they won't sell it to us. It's as if you go to the supermarket and want to buy some apples but they will only sell you a truckload of apples, not one or two.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/twitterdev/getting-to-the-canonical-url-for-a-tweet-85e&quot;&gt;Twitter tip from Andy Piper&lt;/a&gt;. If all you have is the ID of a tweet, how to get its url? If you look at a Twitter url, there's a screenname in there. So how do you find the name of the person who posted tweet whose id is 1574769537244958720. Turns out you don't have to. Make up a name like &lt;i&gt;mamamia, &lt;/i&gt;and form the url like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mamamia/status/1574769537244958720&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It'll find the tweet for you and redirect to the actual users screen name. Nice little hack.</description>

So what was special about that spot? An object near the button had an opacity of 0.7, and part of its rectangle extended over the button. In fact it extended over the part of the button that didn't work (ie most of it). That was weird. I tried disabling the opacity just for the hell of it, and now the button works as it used to. Does opacity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=does+opacity+have+side+effects+css&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; side-effects? I never would have imagined it would. But it appears to! I took out the opacity altogether and reported the problem fixed and the testers agree, but I have no idea what happened there.

Both games were blowouts. The Mets are 2.5 games ahead of the Braves, in first place in the NL East, and this Mets fan is happy and thanks to the Phillies and As for their help!</description>

			<description>Despite what Tim Snyder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TimothyDSnyder/status/1572988432212963329&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the obscenity of what Russia is doing with &quot;referendums&quot; -- on NPR today they reported it straight. You can get them to say anything you want. Russia doesn't even control the territory they're claiming as part of Russia! BTW, I finished the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/09/21.html#a152255&quot;&gt;Ken Burns&lt;/a&gt; special on the Holocaust and the US. The Nazis did something similar with the press. If the US did something to help Jews, they'd run press releases saying &quot;See, the Jews really do run the world, just like we said!&quot; So the US didn't help Jews. And apparently that's not the whole story. There were Nazis in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breckinridge_Long#FDR_administration_and_World_War_II&quot;&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, at high levels. We also let Nazis emigrate to the US after the war, and turned away Jews -- because the Nazis were anti-Communist. I think we should consider giving back the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I don't like it when people I follow, who are smart and funny and make a contribution, RT their abusive replies. Puts me in a tough position, I can't tell them to stop and I don't want to unfollow them. Really the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; thing to do with people who sent abusive tweets is to downvote them (a new Twitter feature) and then block them. The &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; thing you want to do is promote them. That will just get you more abuse and it stinks up everyone else's timeline.</description>

I always have -- I'm not sure what to do, am I supposed to give them an accounting of my life, here's the good and the bad. If I do that do I have to make my story sound like their story, mostly very good but just a little bad to make it seem real.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm older it's disturbing for other reasons. Who cares whether it's good or bad, nothing is either good or bad, or everything is bad, and everything is good. It's hubris to be in the business of judging good or bad. The universe is billions of years old. Everything you think is good or bad actually is irrelevant. See that's the joke. What you think matters, only matters to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hope all is well&quot; is just a nicety, it doesn't require a response, it isn't competitive -- if you want to expand it -- it means life can be a drag I know but I am thinking good thoughts about you, so at least that is something you don't need to add to your worries. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hope all is well. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's a sitcom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump says that the FBI was really looking for Hillary's emails when they searched Mar A Lago.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's what they'd say on a sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The person who plays the ex-president, deep in dog-doo -- he'd say something like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This reaffirms my belief that the Trump voter can't tell the difference between a president and a person playing president in a sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure that the anti-Trump voter is all that different, btw -- we seem to like watching the comedy of it. Watch Chris Hayes when he talks about Trump. He's not grim, he's usually laughing, and so are his guests (not all of them, I've never seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ElieNYC&quot;&gt;@elieNYC&lt;/a&gt; laugh at this kind of stuff). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't often tell you that you must watch or read something, this is one of them -- the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/video/us-holocaust-episode-1-the-golden-door/&quot;&gt;first episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Ken Burns special on the Holocaust and the US. You'll completely recognize what was going on then, because it's exactly what's going on now.  As you watch it, you'll be amazed that Americans didn't get what the Nazis were doing. Amazing story.</description>

			<title>Factoring</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Making usable and efficient software is all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=factoring&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;factoring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/&quot;&gt;Ken Smith&lt;/a&gt; this morning, an English professor, not a technologist. He wanted to know what's factoring all about. What makes Frontier better than other programming environments. It's factoring. Same thing was true of blogging. Factoring. You keep reducing, eliminating steps, until it becomes clear how to eliminate the thing you've been trying to simplify. You simplify it so much it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A couple of case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Before blogging people used CMSes to manage web stuff. They were derived from print publishing software. You'd arrange something on the screen of a computer, until it was perfect, then hand it over to a printer who would put it on paper. That's how CMSes worked too. You'd edit in one place and deploy in another. The aha moment that made blogging real, the Holy Grail I was searching for was the realization that if there was just one place, you could dramatically simplify the editing process, so much that you wouldn't need a techie around to manage it.  It worked. The &lt;i&gt;aha&lt;/i&gt; was recorded in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, of course. If you put an Edit button on the published page, you didn't need another place to do your editing. All that was hidden beind the user interface. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the same way, before &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; (and after, unfortunately) if you needed to store data from a program, you'd write it to a file. When your software was restarted, it would read it from that file. The innovation of Frontier is that it managed all that for you, in the language runtime -- so you never need to write anything anywhere. As with the blogging example, instead of two addresses, a piece of data only had one. I often wonder why no one else has stumbled across this incredible time- and complexity-saver. Bake storage into the runtime. My thought/guess is that language designers don't build apps so they don't know that this would be desirable. If they did, it &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be built into other languages.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder, why I, as opposed to other developers am always striving to simplify, looking for a way to eliminate steps, and whole concepts. I think perhaps it's because I spent years in college studying mathematics, where that is the whole purpose. Looking for the unifying theory of everything. All science is like that, I wonder why this seems to have escaped software development. Every year we (as a profession) work to make things more complex. I think it's because most developers work for big companies who are rewarded by making things more complicated, not by pure programmers (like pure math) who focus on making software disappear. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

And to limit forms of expression so that it can't devolve.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For the last 50 years we've been building social networks that grow without limit, and give the users power to say anything. We keep repeating this, and being shocked when they devolve to the most crude form of human behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Instead let's pioneer of new forms of social behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully something better than devolution, more useful at solving the problems we have. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
