She said I'd like it because the rabbi is played by my favorite SNL performer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Sherman&quot;&gt;Sarah Sherman&lt;/a&gt;. I watched it and highly recommend. It's not a great movie but it is amazing for me, a 3/4 Jewish boy from Queens, son of holocaust survivors, and I found out from this movie someone who is more uncomfortable with being Jewish than I previously understood. Everything about this movie is Jewish. The same way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/atlanta&quot;&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/insecure&quot;&gt;Insecure&lt;/a&gt; are thoroughly black. The teenagers in the movie are 100 percent comfortable with being Jewish. I don't think there ever has been a movie that approached being Jewish so naturally without any sense that they have to explain themselves. And I kept having the thought -- Why Not? -- as my discomfort came up and then faded out -- why shouldn't there be movies that share modern Jewish culture in America using comedy, without being embarrassed by it? To me this is proof that antisemitism is strong inside me, and I don't understand how it got there. If Blacks have the same thing about their race, they have used culture to help dismantle it. I watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/swagger&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;, why shouldn't I also watch a show about my own people, and accept that we have a right to love ourselves as much as anyone else does? So to me, YASNGTMBM was amazing, and did something huge. And btw, the girls who play the lead roles are incredibly sweet and cute, and I expect we'll see more from them. And yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Sarah+Sherman&quot;&gt;Sarah Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, as  the rabbi was wonderful too.</description>

For example, they changed the way downloads work in Chrome. It used to be that when you clicked a download link, a tab would open at the bottom of the window, but now it's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://mspoweruser.com/download-bar-missing-in-chrome/#:~:text=Google%20has%20moved%20the%20download,%2C%20Windows%2C%20and%20ChromeOS%20devices.&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/a&gt; behind a menu at the top of the window. How would I know that? So I kept clicking the download link, all the while starting another download of the file. Finally I looked in the Downloads folder on my Mac, and saw five downloads of the same file, creeping along slowly, because they were all competing with each other, slowing each other down. So I went to the Google search engine and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+downloads&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about downloading from Chrome, and immediately it gave me &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/28/googleAiOnChrome.png&quot;&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt;. This is new, it's the result of having turned on Google's new AI for search. It showed me where I had to go to cancel the downloads, and I did. Problem solved. I still hate Google for what they're doing to the open web, but I know how to separate the good from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Matt's 100-year web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/14/strongman.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/230826/p6#a230826p6&quot;&gt;watching&lt;/a&gt; the rollout of Automattic's proposed 100-year websites program. It's the first time I think I've seen my friend Matt personally roll something out like this, and I'm glad he's doing it, esp in this area because it lets us have an open discussion about the kind of web we want for the future. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wish instead of offering WordPress as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@photomatt/110957400714778133&quot;&gt;hedge&lt;/a&gt; against standards that change, he put his bet down the other way, by creating static renderings of the WordPress sites, and offering his services to people who use other CMSes, and saying these sites will still be here in 100 years, and thereby challenge the browser-makers of 2123 to be able to read those sites as well then as browsers could read them in 1993 and 2023.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think ultimately it'll be a better business move, because standards that move based on the will of big companies never move compatibly. The interop we have with the web wasn't created by Googles or Mozillas or the EFF. The web was created by accident, when the tech industry of the early 1990s wasn't looking. And of course they've been trying ever since to dismantle the interop gift we got from the accidental network.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Someday Automattic and Google will compete, maybe a WordPress site will be read by Google's browser, maybe not. Maybe it won't support all the features. So, if we bet on you Matt -- what happens to our websites when Google sees you as a competitor, in 2041, and doesn't want to interop with you?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The best bet is to go with the standard we have. Force Google to openly break the web, if they insist on breaking it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also consider if there's a world to read our 100-year archives, it'll mean we found an answer to climate change, which surely meant we had to learn to work with each other. So let's not give up on the web so quickly. It's what made you and I so successful. We should pass that on to future generations, the ability to quickly put something together on a whim, without much tech knowledge and not limited by what big tech companies say we're allowed to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

If you know anything about programming, you can see a really high quality collaboration going on here. Of course I am communicating with the AI. It's brilliant, as smart at programming as I am.

			<description>Someday there will be a new twitter-like service with one feature that will blow the doors off this hugely dormant product area. Just support Markdown in your posts. That's it. (Wait there's more. Let's get a really nice RSS feed going for your service, just copy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com&quot;&gt;design&lt;/a&gt; we did for Bluesky) and that'll be the knockout punch. Now federation becomes as simple as supporting these two features. No complex server stuff. Low tech and weblike.)</description>

			<description>I've been writing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=future-safe+archives+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;future-safe&lt;/a&gt; archives for many years, a way to put down $10K or so, and guarantee best efforts to keep my web presence going long after my death. But I expected it would be implemented by a long-lived university with the help of an insurance company, which is by definition a long-lived entity. It's good that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/&quot;&gt;Automattic is thinking&lt;/a&gt; about this (there is no published plan, so far just an idea), maybe they'll seek a partnership with Harvard or Oxford, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London&quot;&gt;Lloyds of London&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Waiting an hour for a shuttle bus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/26/cuckoo.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I was a bit drunk the other night, waiting for a shuttle bus at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oceanedge.com/&quot;&gt;enormous hotel complex&lt;/a&gt; I was staying at and the bus didn't arrive after an hour of waiting, and the light inebriation had turned into an annoying headachy feeling leaning toward a hangover. Sitting on the bench waiting for the shuttle while nice families and happy people went by made me feel more and more like an unhoused person, sprawled on a sidewalk in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I returned to the hotel lobby, a total of three times while waiting, asking them to call the shuttle bus driver &lt;i&gt;again,&lt;/i&gt; but on the third time they said the hotel manager would drive me to my room himself. (The room was a 10 minute drive, who knew how long a walk.) So he comes out and asks me questions to identify myself I guess to be sure I was entitled to a ride, and in answering his questions, which I felt were rude given that I had been waiting for his freaking shuttle bus for over an hour at this point (and I didn't say freaking, I said the impolite word it stands for) while I was listening for an apology which never came, which is probably part of the reason I was so irritated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later when we were seated in his SUV he told me that I needed to be &quot;civil&quot; and not use f-bombs (I was sitting quietly at the time waiting to be taken to my freaking room so I could get over this hangover that was forming) and that was enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paused and said the kind of thing you wished you would have said at the time but I never had the guts before to say. Use your imagination. He got out of the SUV and left me sitting there. I don't know what he expected me to do. I eventually got out of the SUV and saw that the lost shuttle bus had finally arrived, and I got on it, and the manager once again lectured me on proper social behavior, from outside the bus, and I looked at him and told him to literally get lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The driver then drove off, and we had a mostly pleasant converation where I explained what an asshole the manager was, noting that the driver did not disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And btw, for the record I stayed at the hotel for two nights for over $1000. So I felt I was entitled to a certain amount of respect, if not for being a human being, for paying so much money to stay at such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oceanedge.com/&quot;&gt;shitty hotel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A Conde Nast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/cape-cod/the-mansion-at-ocean-edge-resort-and-golf-club&quot;&gt;reviewer&lt;/a&gt; liked the hotel. Some people are really easy to please I guess. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's the longest trip I've taken in the Tesla, and this time, unlike my trips to NYC, I had to use the Supercharger network. I am too exhausted to write up the experience, but I learned a lot, and for the first time I let the car do the driving, with careful supervision. It's a kind of letting-go, I'm a terrible passenger, always prefer to drive. But this was fun, interesting, and gave me new respect for the technology I've been working on pretty much my whole life.</description>

			<description>The Rolling Stones are one of the best bands to Peloton to. A steady strong beat is essential. My favorite Stones song for workouts is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va66PwKQM1w&quot;&gt;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&lt;/a&gt;. It's also a great song to just listen to. I find it's impossible for your body not to rock with the beat.</description>

If memory serves, I was going west to east on I-80 in the midwest. I wanted to know where was a &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/span&gt; on my route that I could stop at to get caffeine and connect to the net. This was before wireless internet service was broadly available. I struck out. Couldn't find a way to do it. Tomorrow I'm driving west to east again, this time toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod&quot;&gt;Cape Cod&lt;/a&gt;, and will have a little time to kill in transit, and was hoping to find a Starbucks where I could load up on caffeine and hook up to the internet. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/95da70c8-28ad-4351-aabd-c42a2bd7f299&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, which offered no answer, but suggested a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/search/Starbucks+near+I-90+between+Albany+NY+and+Worcester+MA/@42.1286138,-72.3792273,10z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;Google Maps query&lt;/a&gt; that unfortunately didn't work. It just showed me Starbucks around one of the endpoints of my search, Worcester, Mass. So based on this benchmark we still live in information impoverished times.</description>

			<title>The programming priesthood</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/#1519490506000&quot;&gt;paragraph&lt;/a&gt; in Google and HTTP really resonates.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Google is doing what the programming priesthood always does, building the barrier to entry higher, making things more complicated, giving themselves an exclusive. This means only super nerds will be able to put up sites. And we will lose a lot of sites that were quickly posted on a whim, over the 25 years the web has existed, by people that didn't fully understand what they were doing. That's also the glory of the web. Fumbling around in the dark actually gets you somewhere. In worlds created by corporate programmers, it's often impossible to find your way around, by design.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To my fellow developers of the 80s and 90s, think about how we've reverted to the corporate power we helped overturn. Our generation made software in our living rooms on our own that changed the world. Think how impossible that would be today. Not for any technological reason. There are so many more young people today who know how to write software. But the idea of an individual doing something transformative in software is something very few people believe in. Sometimes I think I'm the only one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=dotage&quot;&gt;dotage&lt;/a&gt;, we can do something about this. Let's make developing network apps as easy as it was for us in the 90s. We can do it, perhaps as our last contribution to keep the doors we forced open when we were young, to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A priestly tale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of my experiences with the priesthood. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In 1987 I sold my first company, Living Videotext, to Symantec. I left the combined companies after a few months. I didn't fit into a corporate orgchart, esp one where I wasn't a developer. It was okay, I was ready to move on, I wanted to go back to my living room and pick up some of the pieces I had left unexplored at LVT. A couple of years later, I had something -- a scripting system that would allow smaller apps to work with each other, to compete in a world where monster integrated apps were becoming the norm. Small focused apps that could share data via scripting, that was the idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I needed other apps to play along. From my experience as a founder of one of those smaller companies, I knew a lot of the people who could help make this idea work, but my first stop was to meet with people I recruited and trained, the people at Symantec who came from my company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I expected it to be a fun meeting, the way our development meetings went when I was their leader, but I was shocked, when I was told, by the very same people that they couldn't work with me. &quot;You have to understand Dave we're a big company and it's much more complicated now.&quot; I thought to myself no, this is bullshit, it's not even slightly more complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the priesthood, right there. They were still my friends, I'd go out to dinner with them and talk about the old days, but they didn't want to work with me now that I was just one person and they were part of something much bigger and they thought, therefore, more significant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Today's DocServer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I've been reviewing projects that I haven't looked at in a while. Latest is &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/21/docserverScreen.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;DocServer&lt;/a&gt;, the online docs for Drummer's built-in &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt; language. If you use(d) Frontier, you'll recognize both the format of the pages and the names of the verbs. Here are the docs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=date.secondsSince&quot;&gt;date.secondsSince&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=github.upload&quot;&gt;gitHub.upload&lt;/a&gt; to give you an idea of the range of functionality, from simple data manipulation to providing glue for powerful web apps that have well-thought-out APIs. This idea goes back to the late 80s when we were pushing scriptable Mac apps over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Jazz&quot;&gt;excessive integration&lt;/a&gt;. Another idea that caught on, slowly, over time until now we take it for granted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/21/todaysDocserverScreen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Today's DocServer looks like this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/frontier/gifs/docserverscreen.gif&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the original DocServer from &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; in the 90s, a Mac app.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Here's an example, Matt Haughey's &lt;a href=&quot;http://xoxo.zone/@mathowie.rss&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?river=http%3A%2F%2Fxoxo.zone%2F%40mathowie.rss&quot;&gt;viewed in FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. These posts, as you &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/20/titlelessPostsInFeedland.png&quot;&gt;can see&lt;/a&gt;, have no titles. So we bold-up the first sentence, or if it's too long, a big part of it. They look different from titled posts, but now that we've lived with this for a few weeks, I think it works. Might still do some tweaks.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/publicFolder/&quot;&gt;Public Folder&lt;/a&gt; is a utility I depend on. Created when Dropbox eliminated its &quot;public&quot; folder. Works the same way, create, update or delete files in a special folder, and it syncs with a location on S3. Strictly doesn't have to be a public location, that's up to how S3 is configured.</description>

			<title>Happy Birthday Mom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today would have been my mom's 91st birthday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been to Facebook a few times today, and there she is. They're asking if I remember. Yes, I do. As time passes my memory softens. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had differences, but she was my mother, and as I like to say, right after &quot;Your mileage may vary and I am not a lawyer&quot; -- my mother loves me. Which means at the base level, no matter how insecure I feel, that's a constant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's been five years since her death. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But as long as I'm here, her &lt;a href=&quot;http://eve.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; lives. ❤️  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2018/02/26/eve.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Dr Eve K Winer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/cnMay2.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with her, my father and myself, on my 50th birthday, at a diner in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bayside,+Queens,+NY/@40.7785084,-73.7781672,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c261e225f2f7bd:0x7efd0c79b487a99e!8m2!3d40.7602604!4d-73.7692026!16zL20vMDRkcnRn?entry=ttu&quot;&gt;Bayside, NY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Tagging revisited</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two summers ago I was playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/07/22/135636.html?title=taggingInScriptingNews&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt; in Scripting News. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, if I enclose a bit of text in double-square-brackets it's processed by Old School as a tag. It makes a call to the tag server software, which simply adds the reference to a database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you click on a tag reference in my post, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/19/tagrefbrowser.png&quot;&gt;dialog pops up&lt;/a&gt; with the references to the tag in reverse chronologic order, and it stacks them, so you can click on tags within tags. It's a deceptively complex bit of software, built into the web page you're reading my blog on.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a core feature of the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/span&gt; category. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I stopped tagging at some poin. It's a nice thing to do, but it's for the future, and I'm busy now, and I find I'm not using it that much, still preferring to find the equivalent of tags in Google, because that requires no pre-thought and thus is likely to be more complete. And since I just started tagging two years ago, there, 26 years of my writing that never will be tagged. So I use Google every time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the technology still seems potentially valuable, for writing that's more of a product, like reference manuals, or specs or standards work, designs, stuff where the dollar value of the writing is clear. And potentially you can hire people to do the tagging, or more likely give the job to an AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you may see me tagging here in the coming days, this is why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;(as they say)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How &quot;inventions&quot; really happen</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0ozeqgB5RbPo53hFzo5MaYWqZruwem1HcKo3y69mWBKShrGUFWyhBxcvTp2C8KSqSl&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, when the EFF was fighting a patent troll who claimed to have invented podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You couldn't have had podcasting without a lot of things coming together. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Networks of writers who shared links. Blogging.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A protocol for moving links around a network. HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to attach links and recordings to. RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A standard format for recording. MP3.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive, easy to use playback devices, that could hook up to all this. iPod.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You might argue that we still haven't gotten all the pieces needed for it to really work. But one thing is for sure, &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of the pieces existed when the famous patent troll claims to have invented podcasting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Maybe we should reach not for a victory but for understanding. The patent system is making decisions about technological processes it doesn't understand. No wonder it gets it so wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Boring roofs are best</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, if I were shopping for a new house, I'd look at the roof first. I do not want an interesting roof. It must be boring and for that it should be peaked in the middle, and that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/19/houseWithABoringRoof.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/2061203742_zpid/&quot;&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; with a boring roof.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've bought three houses in my life and all have had &quot;creative&quot; roofs because I guess I find them interesting or I don't bother to look, or consider that roofs that are flat in places or have skylights, or worse have skylights in flat places, are going to have problems. Gutters get clogged and the water backs up and forms ponds. And if the ponding is hidden from view, you could think you don't have a problem with your roof when water is leaking into the wood that support the roof, and then you are in trouble. Let me say that again. You. Are. In. Trouble. One day a leak shows up in the ceiling and when you trace it back to the source you find a pond. And you realize it was right there all the time and you never saw it. And then you see a picture like this..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/19/roofrot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;You do not want this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Please. Boring roofs only. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if you're building a house, same message. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>House of the Dragon spoilers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Warning, spoilers below. You have been warned! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm finally watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon&quot;&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; -- the prequel of Game of Thrones. In Succession terms, it's as if they made a show about how Cousin Greg became such an interesting character. Or Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But: House of the Dragon is not well put together. I found it hard to get started, I rebelled against the new characters in the same location, Kings Landing, only 200 years earlier. Incongruous, distrurbing and invasive. Who are these people where's the Mother of Dragons and Cersei Lannister fighting for the throne. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I eventually did plow through all that, and just when I was getting into the characters, boooom, they're 10 years older and they're played by new actors that don't look much like they did earlier, esp the star. It's like switching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_York&quot;&gt;Darrens&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Sargent&quot;&gt;Bewitched&lt;/a&gt; only with a dozen or more characters all at the same time. Oy!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And before you could begin to figure out who was who, they went straight into a Red Wedding type thing, and I have no idea who did what to who or why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm now on the second to last episode and back into it. It's finally feeling like Game of Thrones, and I hope they don't blow it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Yeah I can go swimming most days, but it's almost never sunny and it seems it's raining every day. Welcome to the all-new Planet Earth. We have it easy here in the northeastern US, relatively speaking. Outrageous heat in the west where summer is usually cool. The fires in Maui, a place you'd never think would be inundated with fire. Our industrial world had a good run, now that's over. It's only going to get worse from here. What will we do? Hell if I know.</description>

We talked about the technological beginnings of blogging, RSS and podcasting. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I wanted to do this with Andrew because I had not respected his books in the 00s that said the online world we were creating wasn't going to be too great. I thought of course here's a guy trying to make a buck by invalidating our hard and successful work. Well it turned out Andrew had it right -- and so did we. There's no new technology that can't be abused or have serious downsides. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it, because the flipside is also true. The answers to our problems can be found in the new tech. We tend to discount the good things that came from online computer tech and there are many. I don't do many interviews, but I like to do them with old friends like Guy Kawasaki and with people who I didn't respect well enough in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+andrew+keen&quot;&gt;the past&lt;/a&gt;, like Andrew, to try to make amends. It was a good show.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Heh yes I still use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;. I do all my JavaScript programming in a suite I developed in 2014, and it's still great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning, I decided to take a minute and streamline something I'm doing a lot of now that I work from two different computers. And that involved doing something like what Jake Savin did in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/17/fatpagesConfirmaddress.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;same place&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. My comment is dated today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/17/codeAsBlog.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Every bit of code is a bit like a blog. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: If you have Frontier, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/08/17/141013.html&quot;&gt;download this file&lt;/a&gt; and open it in Frontier to get the updated bit. It's also a historic artifact, it uses a text-based file format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/faq.html&quot;&gt;Fat Pages&lt;/a&gt;, designed to be embedded in a web page that was also the docs for the bit. We came up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+fat+pages&quot;&gt;all this&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/03/31/FatPagesWithWheels.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's also a historic artifact, it uses a text-based file format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/faq.html&quot;&gt;Fat Pages&lt;/a&gt;, designed to be embedded in a web page that was also the docs for the bit. We came up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+fat+pages&quot;&gt;all this&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/03/31/FatPagesWithWheels.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 17 Aug 2023 14:17:42 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/08/17.html#a141742"/>

I don't believe them. I saw the race, and gender and age, of the black women in the Atlanta justice system, moving around DJ Trump's condemnation, the pieces of paper that should end him. I laughed out loud about how freaking appropriate this was. America is &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of us, and we all have equal power at least when it comes to voting and &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;existing&lt;/a&gt;, though assholes like Trump would have you believe only people who look and smell like him matter. Trump did the worst thing he could possibly do, played stupid, visible, not even slightly under the radar of law enforcement, games with the franchise of all Georgians. And what a great reminder America is all us. Us. E pluribus unum.</description>
