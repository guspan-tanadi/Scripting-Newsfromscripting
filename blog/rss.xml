			<description>Trump doesn't need Twitter, he could just use a blog. If he did, there would be pathways for people to find out he updated, and software that would let his followers read his latest messages, in reverse chronological order. There would be no Twitter to shut him down. Now, I'm not sure where he could go to get the blog hosted. I wonder if Blogger and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/11/messageFromWordpress.png&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; et al have considered what they'd do if he started a blog in either of those places. Thing to know is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; is a lot easier to deploy than a Twitter-like system, and it could be distributed. We looked at lots of those things in the heyday of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Napster%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; to route around the music industry. I hate that I'm helping Trump be the monster he is, but I feel obligated to share this with my followers, who probably want to think about real-world applications of distributed internet technology.</description>

			<description>Here's something positive. Re this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-trump-supporters-turned-one-mild-mannered-dc-lawyer-into-the-angry-guyonporch/2021/01/07/384be64c-5106-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NRKveronica/status/1347002291249770496&quot;&gt;GuyOnPorch and WomanInCar&lt;/a&gt; meme that became viral. Let me set the stage. The guy on the porch is an older white man. He's screaming obscenities at MAGAs (off-camera) telling them to get the fuck out of DC. Then the camera swings to a black woman in her car, and she's kind of astonished to see the white man saying what she was thinking. And she said so. I cried watching it. Later in the profile they said something that grabbed me. ‚ÄúHumphries was stunned that it was this 60-year-old White man speaking her truth. Their truth.‚Äù I wanted to give them both a big hug. We need to get our shit together. It's not just her truth and his truth, it's the truth of America. We love this country. And that means we love each other. For real.</description>

			<description>I had a post here entitled Morning Depression Notes. I deleted it. I don't need to make your day worse. But I do want to say Monday January 11, 2021 is one of the worst days ever. I somehow made it through 2020 without getting depressed. But 2021, it's a real challenge. Maybe I just want to say one thing. Let's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Participants_in_rebellion&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/a&gt; all the Republican senators, except Mitt Romney. Send them all home. They had a chance to stop this, the Dems tee'd it up for them, all they had to do was vote to convict. Sure they might have lost their jobs. They're going to lose them anyway. But they might have had a tiny little bit of residual honor, and we all could have stood up for them, when the MAGA mob comes for them. Now, let em go -- out the airlock. Good riddance.</description>

			<description>A long time ago I wanted to try Google Cloud Platform. I had to give them a credit card. I quickly decided I didn't want the service, so I turned off my test project. Now the card has expired and they're sending me emails saying that I have to register a new credit card. But my bill is $0, has been forever. I don't owe them any money and I don't want the service. I have written them feedback using their support mechanism. Yet I still get the warning emails. The easy thing to do would be to give them a new credit card. This is the power of huge faceless corporations. Even small ones can threaten your credit rating. A foot doctor sends me bills for $40 every few months. Can't talk to the doctor, they won't permit it. Or Experian had a bug that caused my credit to be hurt. It has hurt a lot of other people, I hear. This is the background to the idea of Amazon shutting off an annoying customer because people, including their employees, are hassling them about it. You better stay popular with the people Amazon cares about or you'll be out on the street. I'm not going to give Google a new credit card. Let's see what happens.</description>

			<description>Assume Trump's devs are scrambling to get up a new social net. I'm sure they'll find something. I heard it said they won't get thru the App Store and Google Play. This is true. So guess what -- they'll have to use the open web. Politics and tech make strange bedfellows. ;-)</description>

			<description>The arguments about how you don't have free speech on private platforms don't reflect the reality of Twitter and Facebook, which have monopolistic power in the worlds they define. Those worlds are huge, powerful, growing, and most important here -- exclusive. We call them &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22silos%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;silos&lt;/a&gt; in tech, but they behave like monopolies in other contexts. They don't imho have the rights of truly private companies because they wield government-like power that can have the effect of restricting speech. Because they are silos, there's no way to route around them. This is dangerous stuff. Suppose for example the Republican Party owned Twitter. You can see how that would damage free discourse in our political system. And it's not impossible for a political entity to take control of Twitter, they're not very highly valued in the stock market. That's why the government must be involved in decisions that cut off political leaders. What made this situation so difficult is that it was &lt;i&gt;the president&lt;/i&gt; who needed to be silenced, before he could do more damage. A tough call, and a very difficult precedent. BTW, I do advocate for political parties becoming social networks. I think they already are that.</description>

			<description>Also, having the employees of Twitter and Facebook influening the censorship decisions the companies make is not good ethically. The employees should do their jobs, they should not personally have any say in who gets to use the network. We need ethical rules for professionals in tech. Here's an example from the medical profession. If you were a doctor in a hospital, and they wheeled in someone whose political opinions you abhor, you have to treat them no matter what. We insist that bakeries in Indiana bake cakes for gay couples as they would for heterosexual couples. It's easy to see when people you disagree with overstep professional ethical boundaries, much harder to see it when you do it yourself.</description>

			<description>These kinds of decisions have a lot of impact. For example, I was blacklisted from speaking at a few tech conferences probably because their sponsors didn't like the affect my work was having on their closed networks. As a result, I'm perceived to having left tech, when in fact, a couple of powerful and/or rich people pressured conference promoters to not allow me a public presence. When I complained about it on my blog, or in person to friends, they shrugged it off, kind of the way Repubs shrug off ethical failures in their work. There are consequences to this kind of back-room deal-making. By this time very few people have any sympathy for Trump, but this act sets a precedent. You may not like it when someone you support is cut off this way.</description>

			<description>Trump is leading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Cops&quot;&gt;Keystone Cops&lt;/a&gt; version of a military coup. Yesterday's speech was clearly a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwUUUqgfu-E&quot;&gt;KK&lt;/a&gt; version of a coverup. All the tracks lead back to him, as usual he didn't even try to hide them. God help us if he were even slightly more competent and slightly less narcissistic.</description>

			<description>My big objection with the way journalists talk about Facebook is that it's so naive. The questions are much much much more complicated. Shutting off Facebook, which seems to be what journalism wants, would be as stupidly disruptive as turning off Wikipedia, or even the phone network -- or for that matter, all the daily newspapers. Facebook is &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; important for information flow in our society. It's not a joke. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/thursday-7-january-2021/32578/&quot;&gt;excellent rant&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/08/naughton.png&quot;&gt;reporters had no idea&lt;/a&gt; how to cover something like the riot in DC on Wednesday. Well they don't know how to cover Facebook either. Yes it is used for some awful purposes, so is everything. We have a much bigger job to do today. One thing journalists could do to help is being more outgoing, inquisitive, and respond to direct statements like this one. We need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html&quot;&gt;work together&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Sidebars to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;JN&lt;/a&gt;: 1. I wish your blog had permalinks so I could point to individual items. 2. I like strong language. The people who run these platforms are not elected, it's true. Neither are the other gatekeepers, and it would suck, imho, if they were. When someone screams fire in a crowded movie theater, as Trump is doing, it's up to the management to do something about it. Nothing wrong with that. I like the title &quot;creeps&quot; -- it fits, because like the management of Exxon, the people who run Facebook spoil the resource they monetize, in this case the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/16/inDefenseOfTheOpenWeb.html&quot;&gt;open web&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lasorda&quot;&gt;Tommy Lasorda&lt;/a&gt; is gone. 93 years old. A good run. He was manager of the Dodgers back before I hated them. But I can't say I ever loved them. I had an experience at the World Series vs the Oakland A's where we scalped tickets that turned out to be in the Dodger's wives section. They tried to have us removed, because we were very vocally advocating for the A's. Of course, this was at the Oakland Coliseum. They argued with the cops that we would have been ejected at Dodgers Stadium. You see that's the problem with baseball these days. Decorum. It was never meant to be a respectful sport, imho. Anyway, I digress. Lasorda was a famous manager of a winning team &quot;back in the day.&quot; Sigh. We're all getting old and soon we'll be dead. That's what it all means. Oh la.</description>

			<description>Another problem I have with the Dodgers is that my parents were Dodgers fans, back when they were in Brooklyn, and known as Da Bums. The name turns out to have fit, because one day they up and left Brooklyn. I understand the problem wasn't of their making, they were targeted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-robert-moses-is-to-blame-for-losing-the-brooklyn-dodgers-to-la&quot;&gt;Robert Moses&lt;/a&gt; to be the team for his new stadium which turned out to be the stadium the Mets played in. And our family, before I was really aware of these things, switched allegiance to the Mets, who were called The Amazins, which was of course sarcastic. Which is fine, because as I said -- baseball is not a respectful sport. Even when it comes to your home team. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üí•&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This is hard for me to advocate, as one of the first bloggers and podcasters, I believe, at my core, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;direct communication&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>Don't be a useful idiot. Don't RT the fascists. That's why they stay on Twitter, to outrage you and your followers. If you weren't helping them, they'd stay on their own private social net. What's ironic is that some of the worst offenders are reporters whose pubs blame Facebook for the garbage news. Their own reporters are distributing the same stuff on Twitter.</description>

The House isn't coming back into session until after the inauguration, and the Senate is adjourned until January 19. When was this decided? On the other hand, hard to blame them. They were locked down, trapped in the Capitol with who-knows-what kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2021/01/07/aide-says-trump-was-a-monster-during-capitol-siege/&quot;&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; with what weapons roaming around, and some nice officers with pistols pointed at the doors. I'd want to get out of town too, in their shoes.</description>

			<title>Morning Coffee Notes</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few ideas early in the day...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We really need to get Trump out of the White House. Yesterday, as the riot was developing, I posted on Twitter that this coup could be successful. They will try again. And remember there are 50 state capitals in the US. Any of them could be next. I hope they're preparing for it. Esp the swing states. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Impeachment? How fast could it happen? The Dems certainly have enough votes to impeach. Could they must 51 votes in the Senate to have a real trial? Could they somehow get 66 votes to convict? It may end up being symbolic, but censorship is not enough. Trump being the first president to be removed from office through impeachment would be the warning we needed at the beginning of 2020. It could give the Republican senators another chance to do the right thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Communication. We need much better communication among all the American people. It's no longer acceptable that there be several versions of the truth. Radio Free America. It has to be less wish-washy and repetitive than Wolf Blitzer or as one-sided as Maddow. The NYT isn't it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Law enforcement. We have a big problem with the police, a lot of them are fascists, and support Trump. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/29/humansAreCrazy.html&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;An amazing scene in a Frontline episode in the Iraqi parliament while Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq. It was time for a purge. Saddam had decided to execute the whole legislature. The doors were locked and they started taking out people one by one and shooting them. Saddam, sadist that he was, videotaped it. So you could see what these guys were doing as they figured out, one by one, what was happening. So what did the condemned legislators do while waiting to be shot? They gave speeches, denouncing each other as the real enemy of the state, and proclaiming their love for Saddam, the best friend he ever had. Didn't work, they were all killed.&quot; They used to have video on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/&quot;&gt;PBS site&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a victim of the deprecation of Flash.

Amazing how quickly the political action moved from Georgia to DC. But all this Trump michegas is masking the big story -- the pandemic is digging in with increased virality all over the world, but especially in the US. With power as it's currently configured, we finally have a chance to help ourselves. But only barely.</description>
