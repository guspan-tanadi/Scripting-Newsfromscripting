It's like putting curtains on your windows. Strictly speaking you don't need them. But they make the place look better. I think Bluesky is the place for that right now.

Now comes the fun stuff, spiffing up the format and getting it uploading random pics on a schedule. Then I move it to a server and just enjoy the art as it floats by.</description>

			<description>Another great ChatGPT use. I have a mental block with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression&quot;&gt;regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;. I know when to use them, but I just can't construct them. I used to be able to do it, a long time ago. Anyway, now I describe the problem to ChatGPT and it &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/57928125-b33a-4961-b860-482d35459fe7&quot;&gt;gives me back&lt;/a&gt; the expression. I don't even have to formulate the question very carefully, it figures it out. Now I can relax about it.</description>

			<description>An outliner is a combination of a text editor and draw program. You have gestures to move objects that's similar to what you can do with objects in a draw program, but you also have the use of the keyboard to write and edit text. I just realized that as I was editing a complicated JSON structure, thinking the design of this is overblow, but I'm glad I am using an outliner to manipulate it, I'd be going crazy selecting stuff, cutting and pasting. All that is at a lower level, factored out of the user experience of the outliner.</description>

			<description>A piece I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/07/07/howToThinkAboutIdentica.html&quot;&gt;about identi.ca&lt;/a&gt;, the precursor to ActivityPub, in 2008. I found it interesting to read with foresight what is coming true today, 15 years later. It's a myth that everything happens fast in tech. We waste so much time reinventing and breaking stuff, it's amazing anything ever gets done here. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Hello from the future</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This post will appear on scripting.wordpress.com, a site I started a long time ago as an &quot;annex&quot; to my blog, providing support for trackback and comments. In August 2008, I stopped posting there, explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/08/09/disconnectingTheAnnex.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, which also appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/scripting-news-for-892008/&quot;&gt;the annex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now in 2023, I'm going to start cross-posting again, for different reasons. I want to show people how you can write for a powerful blogging platform like WordPress from an outliner running on the desktop. And for some writers this is going to be ideal, and for others maybe other approaches will be useful. The important point is that people should be able to decouple writing from hosting. The way the world works now it's like having to use a different word processor just because you bought a new printer! That would be terrible, but that's the world we've created on the web. I want to start creating more choices, by going first. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about Automattic is that they believe in user choice and open formats and protocols, it's in their DNA, and they've done an amazing job of keeping the APIs running all this time! I'm using the same API today that we used in 2000 to connect &lt;a href=&quot;http://pikebeta.userland.com/whatIsThis&quot;&gt;Pike&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;! Now that is some kind of interop. Whoa. Above and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So over on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scripting.wordpress.com/2023/06/29/1475/&quot;&gt;WordPress site&lt;/a&gt; it will feel like the microphone just came on again. Someone is speaking. That would be me. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

This is new, never seen this done before. I imagine that Apple is paying Twitter to do this, or maybe not. Maybe Twitter wants to establish itself as a medium for watching, not just participating, and Apple is helping. I think we'll see more and more of that. A diminution of individuals communicating and more corporations and political parties. People who think Musk is going to regret buying Twitter are imho probably wrong. They were just barely treading water, sitting on one of the most amazing communication systems ever built. A restructuring is for sure going to cause a dip, but once straightened out, it could turn into a strong business. It's not smart to bet against a company that's as installed as Twitter is.</description>

A diminution of individuals communicating and more corporations and political parties. People who think Musk is going to regret buying Twitter are imho probably wrong. They were just barely treading water, sitting on one of the most amazing communication systems ever built. A restructuring is for sure going to cause a dip, but once straightened out, it could turn into a strong business. It's not smart to bet against a company that's as installed as Twitter is." created="Wed, 28 Jun 2023 13:18:53 GMT" type="outline" urltweet="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1673730750095712256" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/03/21/beetle.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/06/28.html#a131853"/>

			<description>When you hear journalists talk about use of ChatGPT in education they talk about ways students can use it to cheat. They never mention the support functions it can play, like a perfectly tireless and free-of-charge tutor. That's how I often use it. If I'm not sure I've remembered something correctly, I just ask ChatGPT to remind me. It's a kind of drill that was never available before unless you were a rich kid with parents who spoil them.</description>

			<description>After a good night's sleep and some reflection, I bet the reason the Harvard blogs project is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/blog/2023/03/02/blogs-harvard-edu-shutting-down/&quot;&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; is the same issue that's haunting all online service providers in 2023, moderation. Not exactly a business for a research center at Harvard to be involved in. Just a guess.</description>

			<description>Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/03/28.html&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the new Harvard blog server on March 23, 2003. You can see how we got there by reading the archive for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2003/03.html&quot;&gt;whole month&lt;/a&gt; of March. I started out in Woodside, CA, having just sold my house and packed the car and drove cross-country. I got to work real quickly. By the end of the month I had given talks at the Kennedy School and to the user's group of system managers at Harvard. It was a real rollout. We had weekly meetups at Berkman, every Thursday. All the history was recorded on the blogs. Luckily I continued to tell the story on this blog too, and that archive will remain.</description>

			<title>My friend Doc</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Doc is about to lose his Harvard blog, and he's stuck in California with too much to do and is afraid it will slip through is fingers if he has to prioritize his time so as not to be able to save it. I wrote him this email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A perfect storm. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I had something smaller happen when I was moving out of my house in Berkeley in 2010.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;My server was down, it was a serious system thing. But I had to turn over the house to the new owners and get in my car and start the trip back to NYC.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I got a call from someone deep in Amazon, their CTO who reads my blog had asked him to call to see if he could help, but I had no time. I had to leave. 1.35 million reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After that, no one at Amazon will talk to me. They must have given me a zero in their rating system. I was offered Cadillac support and turned it down. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How dare me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We suck Doc. We don't matter. I'm receiving confirmation of that every day, except from friends, who remind me that I do. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So I'm your friend -- even if your blog doesn't come with you, you're still my friend. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

Why can't they do it for me? I've been spoiled by ChatGPT which actually parses the words I type, and gives me the answers I asked for. For example, I have a Google Workspace account, set up by someone else. I want to add new email addresses to my account. I can't find out how much I'm already paying for the email addresses that are already allocated. I do know the total amount, $26/month. It's way too much money for what it's doing, btw. Basically I'd like to give it instructions in my language. &quot;I'm thinking of adding five new email addresses, how much will that add to my monthly bill?&quot; Then if I decide to go ahead, I could just tell it, in my own language -- &quot;add them please.&quot; Pretty simple, right? It's what I would say to a human being, and the human would get it. And so would ChatGPT. Why can't Google Workspace? See how much software now has to be redesigned to meet the expectations of people who expect the ease of use of ChatGPT?</description>

			<description>It's possible that Elon Musk is happy with his purchase of Twitter even if the market cap is down by a lot by some measures. It's still the place of record on the net. Nothing else comes close.</description>

			<title>Question the W3C's advice re RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The net-net of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/feedvalidator/issues/106&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; this week with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; and their hosting or pointing to a modified &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; spec is that at this time, before trusting any advice it gives based on RSS, you must be sure that it's covered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;original spec&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the discussion we had with the W3C, the sysop of their website &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/feedvalidator/issues/106#issuecomment-1600956714&quot;&gt;said clearly&lt;/a&gt; and I believe innocently that the modified &quot;version&quot; of the spec is what they're using to guide the validator.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But there are no versions of RSS 2.0. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's frozen. It says it clearly in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, which explains &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/24/roadmap.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;why it's frozen&lt;/a&gt;, developers need stability. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;All that happened over twenty years ago. And it worked. RSS is one of the most broadly supported formats on the web. It's the basis for podcasting. It's widely supported by news orgs and blogging software. All kinds of systems have been built around RSS. Twenty years of development.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the W3C's defense, I gather they inherited the validator, and the people who wrote it originally were trying to steer people away from RSS to another format. They wanted their ideas in all our feeds, and used the validator to get their way. In the end their steering people to the other format didn't do any real damage that I could see, just added unnecessary confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I have to draw the line at the W3C. We respect them and &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;matters&lt;/i&gt; that they respect RSS, the roadmap first and foremost. I'm not trying to get them to fix the validator, just know that the spec they're citing is not playing by the rules. We need the W3C to support RSS, not undermine it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it's perfectly OK for any validator to offer advice based on an extension in the form of a namespace, or a profile, or based on a format not named 'RSS' (which can of course be anything you want) but you can't claim to be validating against RSS if you're citing a modified version of the spec. There are no modifications allowed, that's part of the spec. It's a rule, and a validator that breaks that rule is not validating RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I believe I've explained this from every possible angle. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Net-net, until it's fixed -- be careful with the W3C's advice re RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Takes place in Baltimore, the story centers on a 14-year-old star-to-be and his life in the same city as The Wire, during the early days of Covid, based on the life story of NBA star &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt;.  An urban version of Friday Night Lights, which I had been working my way through, loving the first two seasons but the show got pretty bad by the third imho. Season 1 of Swagger is very good. I'm on episode 7. Season 2 starts tomorrow.</description>

I suppose that was a virtual reality experience then, and to this day our computer screens are no competition for the real world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/22/koosman.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Jerry Koosman at Shea Stadium, in the 60s, in full color.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The purpose of this work is to help it become a unchanging thing, to foster growth in the market that is developing around it, and to clear the path for innovation in new syndication formats. Therefore, the RSS spec is, for all practical purposes, frozen at version 2.0.1.

			<description>&lt;i&gt;It worked.&lt;/i&gt; RSS 2.0 has stood the test of time. Lots of innovation has taken place in the namespaces, and the core has stayed intact. There were a lot of people who wanted to control and own RSS when I wrote that. If it hadn't been frozen they'd still be fighting over the basics. We've made a lot with RSS and we're going to make a lot more. It'll be important in the evolution of social media, podcasting, blogging and more. This is what the roadmap says. It worked and continues to work.</description>

			<title>Write specs for humans</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I like to write specs for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho too many specs are organized the way a computer would want them, the way software is organized. Establish basic vocabulary in layers then and assume the human reader will know how to put the pieces together to do things. Never answer questions a busy developer would have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Humans like it the other way around. Show me how to do X, Y and Z, the most common things people want to do with the API, and then later explain how the pieces fit together. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of AI, computers can now read what humans read. So you should just write your specs for humans and it'll work fine for computers too!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Gotta change with the times. 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This should probably be filed under &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;Rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: Heh.

			<title>God is an ice cream truck</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As a baby in a carriage, my mother would get an ice cream treat and share it with me. I thought ice cream was pure god food. I know this because when I see a picture of an old time Good Humor ice cream truck, my most primitive consciousness experiences it as a miracle that's about to happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My inner-infant delights, pure ecstasy, immortality! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;100 percent unadulterated love. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/06/20/goodHumorIceCreamTruck.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;How I felt pure love as an infant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's a lot of talk in the webs about locking them out. Big words but &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/19/not-that-kind-of-open&quot;&gt;not much power&lt;/a&gt; behind them. They will, in an instant, have millions more users than the existing ActivityPub services will, so the question really is -- who's being locked out? It was never a good bet that the architecture of ActivityPub would somehow be able to resist Silicon Valley-scale social networks. That doesn't mean there are no answers, just that bluster isn't one of them. You have to &lt;i&gt;think. &lt;/i&gt;</description>
