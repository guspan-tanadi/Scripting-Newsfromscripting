			<description>&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/25/chickenOnWhiteHouse.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I heard yet another piece on NPR this morning wondering why Biden's approval rating is so low. First question, who has ever shown that this number means anything? Esp at the end of July, the middle of the summer two years before he's up for re-election. Second, the reason his approval rating is so low is that he's old and frail. On the other hand, I know he's in great shape. But when he's giving a prepared speech, the makeup is bad, or the lighting, but his eyes have the beady look of a very old person. And he is terrible at reading speeches. The intonation is all wrong. There's nothing human about it. I imagine they've hired coaches to try to improve this, but he hasn't gotten better. Funny thing is, when he's doing a press conference, which is very rare, he's great! His mind is sharp, he's an excellent communicator. You quickly forget how old he is. My guess is that his handlers think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/25/joe-biden-2020-public-gaffes-mistakes-history&quot;&gt;famous Biden gaffes&lt;/a&gt; are too expensive, so they play it safe with the prepared remarks approach. I don't think it's working. It's the source of &quot;he's too old.&quot; And ultimately who cares what NPR thinks anyway. Stop worrying. Let Biden be Biden.</description>

			<description>No wonder &lt;a href=&quot;http://rss.land/&quot;&gt;rss.land&lt;/a&gt; is such a mess. No one has been caring for it, for 20 years. People try to own it, exploit it, and when they fail, dump it. In that way it's amazing how strong it is. Even though we haven't been caring for RSS, it keeps going.</description>

			<description>Why isn't there a Reproductive Rights Pac like the NRA. One that rates candidates on their support for women. One that we can give money to that they in turn give to candidates that campaign on Reproductive Rights. It's not enough to be for it, you have to campaign for it. Of course people will say it's Planned Parenthood, but they do more than that. I'm talking about a PAC that's focused on making abortion rights a major issue in all elections until the Dobbs decision is reversed.</description>

Much better to have a constant first-person view, allowing your mind to zone out while your body works. An improvement beyond that -- have the speed correlate with how fast you're pushing the bike. And give me a boost, so if I'm going 10 mph, make it feel like I'm going 30. As if a strong wind was at my back. Often when you have the first person point of view in these classes it feels as if you're walking not riding, there's no feeling of speed. And you pedal harder and there's no change. I know that this would be hard to do and expensive, but (ahem) the bike and the classes are pretty freaking expensive too. Or better yet, let Nintendo write the software. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A perfect bug report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm always getting on about how to do a great bug report, I thought I should show you a perfect one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;A small UI thing I noticed was I clicked the X in the News Box to dismiss the box and then opened the settings again and the &quot;Show news items in a small box at the top of the screen.&quot; was already checked when I expected it to be unchecked. Clicking the Ok button returned the News Box.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It has all the required elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What they did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What they expected to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What actually happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be a formal process, or particularly long. Just the facts, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/dragnet-jack-webbs-joe-friday-never-actually-said-just-facts-maam-comedian.html/&quot;&gt;Jack Webb never said&lt;/a&gt;. The facts the developer needs to find and fix the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also like the part up front where they say &quot;A small UI thing...&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

You're supposed get the feeling that you're riding there, I guess, but it's terrible. I tried it a few times,  but yesterday I figured out why it's so bad. They keep changing the perspective. First you're seeing what the teacher sees. Then the camera goes off to the side, you're watching the rider. Then you're in a drone 200 feet above the rider, then the drone is looking down on the mountains or seascape or whatever. Then it goes back to the first-person perspective. I guess whoever designed these classes has no idea what it's like to ride? You only have one perspective and you get into the zone on it. But switching like that makes me feel sick! Literally makes me feel nauseous. I have to put my eyes somewhere else until the ride is over, but every so often I forget and there's that awful feeling again. Exercise is a meditation. Your mind does its own thing while your subconscious relaxes, just exerting and getting the body chemistry going to a nice place. And just when you're starting to zone out -- boom -- reality changes drastically. Again and again and again ad nauseum. Nothing in the real world works that way.

I've been enjoying my &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013%20Pro&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but I've been wanting to try the pro version of the Pixel. I've been carrying two phones -- the other a Pixel 4a. Looking forward to trying the same thing without limits. I got the one with 512GB.</description>

			<description>Is there doubt that at least some of the insurrectionists would have killed congresspeople if they had the chance? Maybe it was all bluster, but imho probably not.

			<description>This year's RSS project is much like the project I did writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/rss091&quot;&gt;the 0.91 spec&lt;/a&gt;, the one based on actual practice, not a spec-writer's idea of how the base of feeds should evolve. I'm a big believer in following the spec, but if the spec is wrong -- that seemed to be what the devs were saying you have to do some more thinking. &quot;See what's out there&quot; is my motto, before making any assumptions. One of the reasons the only method for reading feeds in my project is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;mailbox-style reader&lt;/a&gt;. I want to focus on what works and doesn't, before adding any alternative ways of viewing news. The mailbox style is what's out there in rss.land. That's where you start in 2022, because 2022 is not 2002.</description>

			<description>BTW, the validator situation is pretty bad. Apparently the original feed validator isn't working, and the W3C put up a fork of it a while back, but it seems to be giving different advice now. I think perhaps one of our projects should be to write an apolitical feed validator. One written from the point of view of apps that have to understand feeds. Basically saying -- if you do it this way it'll work better for your users, and forget about the various different standards groups who wanted to replace it. RSS got badly spammed that way.</description>

			<description>Yesterday on my linkblog I included a link to the NYT obituary for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Dow&quot;&gt;Tony Dow&lt;/a&gt;, who played the older brother on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave It To Beaver&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jtm1XTVqPz0&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; people of my generation grew up with.

So far it's going well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's an unusual project, a bit like traveling back to 2002, and then considering the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; world as it exists now, and try to do something with the incredible amount of data flowing by, but with limited tools to actually see what's available. That, of course is exactly the challenge. To create tools that suit each type of data people push through feeds and make it visible and useful to people who want it. There's a wide variety from linkblogs like Hacker News, to description-only feeds from the NYT to full text from WordPress sites. And podcasts. And the totally possible Twitter feeds. And who know what else will be possible. We haven't been creative here for many, many, many years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I remember a long time ago when I worked at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing#Time-sharing&quot;&gt;timesharing&lt;/a&gt; company. We had a big computer facility in New Jersey and I worked in Manhattan. We leased our customers teletypes where they would type queries and we're send back data. They could also program in BASIC. My job was to write tools for them so they would run them and use them for hours and of course very hour was money to my company, so I was incentivized to come up with things they'd use a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the most fun I had was writing a scroller of headlines from an AP wire we had hooked up to the system. You'd just leave the app running and it would show you the news as it happened. People got addicted to it. Really simple. No one says it has to be complex to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A reporter asks if Jan 6 is a &quot;bridge too far&quot; for Trump as an at-large criminal (they didn't put it that way). If it isn't what would be? If he nuked a major American city? Would that be enough to put him in jail. Do people listen to their own words?</description>

			<title>A screed of no importance</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Knaster&quot;&gt;Scott Knaster&lt;/a&gt; who was a doc writer at Apple in the heyday of the Mac, and who went to General Magic and then Google, has been going through his various closets and digging out things from the ancient software past. He dug up original &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/25/userlandFrontierDisks.png&quot;&gt;Frontier disks&lt;/a&gt; from 1992 or so and posted a picture to Facebook. Here's what he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hey Dave, I was watching the Cooperstown inductions today including Gil Hodges, and I thought of you. I was a big fan of the 1969 Mets. Then later I was cleaning up old stuff and found these discs, thought of you again. I hope you’re doing well!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These disks brought up a story, which I shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid022PujwpmPkX8GVRYBFBbsbjsdtkJuFXuudew4G8TdR5pAAPzprJxxpgMfvts8vjV7l?comment_id=440585781308326&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, and now here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Frontier on the Mac  was about 30 years ago believe it or not. People born in that year, cute little babies in cribs, are now 30 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That experience completely wrung out my last hope for corporate platform vendors. Not only did I get a close-up look at Apple, but I also got to know the platform people at Microsoft and Aldus. Corporations have too many conflicts to pull it off. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A wise Apple would have let us run scripting on the Mac, and let us put it where ever we wanted. What they ended up with was a pure corporate creation, runs only on one OS, and has its utility crippled by an idea that top execs understood -- &quot;Programming in English.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_Corporation&quot;&gt;Aldus&lt;/a&gt; had a deal with developers, they'd wait two releases before crushing them (ie pulling the features of their plugin into the main product). At least they were up front about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft people were mostly nerds and they gave their programmers a lot of freedom. I hooked up with one of the devs on Microsoft Word, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.c2.com/?DavidLuebbert&quot;&gt;Dave Luebbert&lt;/a&gt;, and we had a scripting party, and Word was the most scriptable app out there, even though no one knew. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;After that experience, I left software. I realized there wasn't going to be anything left for me, because no matter what I did, i'd either have to work inside one of these beasts, and I didn't see that working out too well, or they'd just anihilate us if we achieved any success, even if we did it on their terms.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A year later -- I got a demo of HTTP and I saw the answer. It's like being a devotee of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_in_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#R'hllor&quot;&gt;Lord of Light&lt;/a&gt; in Game of Thrones. Oh there's the answer -- Unix! (I programmed in C on Unix before going to the Apple II.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm doing one more push folks, no one has been doing anything with RSS for many years, even though it's very much still out there. I've had a productive year. Really good software almost ready. We'll see if there's any hope for independent developers in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's bad politics to alienate a whole gender</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I hate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley&quot;&gt;Hawley&lt;/a&gt; but he's onto &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/11/11/1054615028/is-masculinity-under-attack-sen-hawley-wants-to-defend-the-men-of-america&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems probably unintentionally do things to push male voters away. He, and the Repubs are milking that for all it's worth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can argue the righteousness of it, but it's bad politics to alienate a whole gender. Bad for winning elections, assuming that's what the Dems want to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also by making him &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=hawley&amp;geo=US&quot;&gt;famous&lt;/a&gt; you're helping him, even if you say nasty shit about him. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GeorgeLakoff&quot;&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt;. People don't care whether you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2021/11/07/josh-hawley-masculinity-porn-video-games&quot;&gt;like him&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/josh-hawley-masculinity-obsession-1254776/&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;, but when you push him, you're creating a bigger space in their minds labeled X where X is the name of the asshole you're writing about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm doing it right now, I know it -- can't think of a way of avoiding it and still make the point.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bet the Dems could pick up 10% more male voters just by doing a little marketing saying the Dems care. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But she misses an important point. Men saw what happened too. And while we were effectively silenced in the public debate, men do vote and that's a private thing. I don't doubt that #metoo contributed to more men voting for Trump. So there's another reason to regret forcing Franken to quit without any process, it was stupid politics. I think something similar contributed to Elizabeth Warren's failure as a presidential candidate in 2020. I enthusiastically supported her at first, but then I guess trying to get stronger women's support, she said some awful things about men. It didn't get any press, but I, as a man heard it, and as far as I was concerned it disqualified her. A president has to be for every American, regardless of gender. A woman president is also a president for men. And we can vote. We will I hope have a woman president someday, and when we do, she will appeal to all genders. Men can be feminists, but if you think that equates to attacking men for being men, you won't win. Men still have a lot of votes.</description>

			<title>Do you feel you're better than me?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1550156845976879104&quot;&gt;A poll on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason I ask is that I'm often surprised when people act as if they are better than me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Like a person I knew before he was super rich, when I suggested we might work on something together, responds as if I was a lunatic to think he would bend that low. I'd love to ask why he responded so negatively, but I can't do that, because I don't want to go there, to really hear the nasty bits or intonations inside this person. But I wouldn't mind knowing if I didn't have to be present when he gave his answer. It's kind of like what Woody Allen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azquotes.com/author/291-Woody_Allen/tag/death&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; about death. &quot;I am not afraid of death. I just don't want to be there when it happens.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have friends from another country, a country that in general feels superior to America. The friends have always acted as if they were better. It sometimes comes out as a joke, but the behavior is there too, indicating that like most jokes, they are also truths. Anyway I think &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; better because my country is a lot bigger and richer than theirs, we have more nukes, and we create more kickass tech and culture. But then I remember my own country is net-net such a jackass internationally, and I remember that we also had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; for 250 years, and we still haven't turned the corner on that. But you have a queen and I know you think that's a positive, but I think it's quaint and more than a bit sad. A family of fat boring people who supposedly have a special connection to god? Please spare me. We have people like that here too, and we're trying to put them in jail. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically the lesson is this -- we all suck. Judge us on what we've done, our actions. Inside we all have ugly thoughts, the question is how much do you act on them. If you think I've created something interesting, consider that perhaps I could do it again. If I've been generous maybe I am generous. Maybe you have prejudices. I can't tell you how many times I've been dismissed as too old to do what I actually did. Like the time, at a conference, a young person asked if I knew what a podcast was, with a doubtful look on her face as if oh god I can't believe I'm actually talking to someone this ignorant. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I find I do it too, and I've tried to consciously overrule my prejudices, and consider the possibility that someone who doesn't look like they could know anything actually does. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Which Markdown?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/discussions/6#discussioncomment-3187614&quot;&gt;Joseph Zitt&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;It's very cool that you're supporting Markdown -- but which Markdown are you using?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This of course is a great question. I answered it, the way all Markdown questions are answered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Of course as you know there is no One True Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The approach we all take with Markdown text is to stay within a reasonable subset of the syntax, and hope for the best. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I go by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;, which I keep in an icon in the chrome of my browser, easy to reach for. And it seems to work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the Markdown processors I use --&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the client side -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/code/markdownConverter.js&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; called MarkdownCoverter, which I downloaded many years ago. I seem to recall it's the one that StackExchange uses, so I figured it's got to be pretty good. In all the years I've been using it there haven't been any complaints as far as I know.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;On the server side -- I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked&quot;&gt;markd&lt;/a&gt;. I don't recall how I decided to use this one, but it has also served me well.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As I understand it Gruber likes the way it has evolved. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The shit does kind of hit the fan when it comes to using Markdown in something like RSS where interop is the primary thing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But this was one of the first enhancements I wanted to get out there in 2022, the 20th year of RSS 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: See the previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/19/152235.html?title=devNotesForMarkdownInRss&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/18/163658.html?title=twitterRssMarkdown&quot;&gt;day's&lt;/a&gt; posts about Markdown in RSS feeds.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
