It's slavery. We never purged it from the American character. We never had truth and reconciliation. Slaveholders never paid for slavery. And their descendants are still among us, passing down the legend of slavery as an honorable institution, through the generations. We haven't dealt with it yet. And until we do, it will be the undercurrent of everything. It's just coming back to the surface now. It's always been there.</description>

			<description>I ordered a bread from a local baker and when I got it it was fresh out of the oven but not sliced. It was then, for the first time in my life I realized the truth that there is nothing like sliced bread.</description>

			<description>Mac users who also use Ubuntu: Do you force the Mac to be like Unix, by mapping the Ctrl key to the Cmd key and vice versa? Or do you put up with the difference, and remember which machine you're using as you type? I'm hitting as I start using Ubuntu as my writing machine. Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1482065198949318658&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I wish there were an easy way to exchange the Control and Alt keys on Ubuntu 20 so it works like a Mac.&quot; I failed to mention that I'm using VMWare Fusion to run Ubuntu, and it looks like there is a way to do it there.</description>

			<title>The High Road</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html#6&quot;&gt;Que Sera Sera&lt;/a&gt;, October 1996.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To anyone who wants to lead -- show us software that's fun and empowering, get us interested and excited. Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted. We're at a crossroads now, do we go back to the mess of the past or do we learn to enjoy the que sera of it all, and stop seeing threats everywhere we look?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much of the energy is about defeating and destroying, so little is about creating. People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans. They forget that no matter how rich and intimidating each leader of our industry is, or would-be leader, none of them predicted the world we live in now, and by extrapolation they are powerless to control the world we will live in in 1997 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll do my part: here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I finally am able to use Linux as a GUI machine, not just a command line thing. But it's burning my brain cells that the Cmd and Ctrl keys are in the opposite places as on my Mac (and in my brain). It's easy to change key mapping on the Mac, but on Ubuntu, you have to do some pretty horrible stuff.</description>

			<description>With yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/165018/covid-vaccine-mandate-struck-down&quot;&gt;Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; about Covid and OSHA, I think we're firmly in illegitimacy territory.

			<title>Sinema for president?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr -- it might work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1481836126495256576&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; asking people to identify Sinema as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;bribed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blackmailed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;held hostage&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;insane&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had not considered another possibility -- she wants to be president! This came up in a tweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1481997298078990336&quot;&gt;forwarded&lt;/a&gt; by  the innovative Democratic campaigner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first thought: no way, maybe option #4 is correct after all, but then on reflection, it would increase interest in the primary and that's a good thing. Nothing is worse than a primary with candidates who all appear to be losers or bore you to death in their speeches, or worse make you feel uncomfortable (Biden, Hillary Clinton). And I don't want another Obama, I feel wounded by his presidency. Left us in a bad place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then I realize, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI5Z7Zg64YM&quot;&gt;Sinema&lt;/a&gt; is a good speaker, based on video of her back when she gave speeches. This crazy personal insurrection of hers has done one thing, it has made her much more famous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People vote for candidates who are confident and make them feel good about themselves, like they matter. That's pretty much it. I wish it were otherwise, but there's a lot to be said requiring a leader to be able to lead. Yes it matters where they lead us, but to a lot of voters, their thoughts don't go that far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've beem thinking about who I want to run in 2024. My two main interests are Jay Inslee and Gavin Newsom. Both are confident, good speakers, and their politics are  straight Democrat. I think they are our best shot at winning, and yes that's the primary concern. We simply can't have another Republican president and not go completely to hell. Please don't ever overlook that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/mylogseqblog/2022/01/13/000005.html?title=changeNotesForV041&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog&quot;&gt;myLogseqBlog tool&lt;/a&gt; fixing a couple of bugs reported on day one. There's also a note there on how this will evolve. Right now all the loose-ends are showing, that's because I know almost nothing about LogSeq. As the people from LogSeq-land get familiar with this, they will no doubt have ideas about how to better integrate this software so it's super easy. This is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=bootstrap&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;bootstraps&lt;/a&gt; start.</description>

I always loved the imagery of this event. A cooperative venture, one team building from east to the west, and the other from west to east, meeting at a middle point, and thereby creating one great thing. Working together. Built during the Civil War.</description>

			<description>At some point, people we think of as independent software developers today will be thought of by Apple and Google as terrorists. The people won't know what to believe. In the future, even saying what I said here will be seen as terrorism.</description>

I find I can't do the most basic things in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=logseq&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt;. I know there must be keystrokes for basic actions like creating a new subhead or moving a sub around structurally. The menus don't have anything for outlining (that I can find). I was able to get by because I can now edit LogSeq documents in Drummer (!) -- it took me about 1/2 hour to realize I could do this. Oh the wonders of interop. I'm on Day 2 of my quest to hook up LogSeq to Drummer blogging. The first product of this work will be a JavaScript app that converts a LogSeq journal folder into a calendar-structured outline in OPML. We're creating a new idea universe here, and it's coming together quickly. I love being in the middle of these projects.</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-queens-gambit&quot;&gt;Queen's Gambit&lt;/a&gt; again. It's so refreshing. The lead character, Beth Harmon, is so attractive, appealing, I want to see everything she says and does. She totally commands attention. And admiration. I once had a girlfriend who was as beautiful and brilliant like the character, smart and clever and ambitious. The show is such a fantasy, and very motivating. It makes me want to do brilliant work just to get her approval. I know it's just a story but it's also real in a sense, as my inner life. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. And it's good as a re-binge as well.</description>

			<title>What's your price Joe?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Manchin is a tool. Obviously he's being paid off. We even know how. That said, perhaps we can put together a GoFundMe to get him even more money than his backers are giving him, to do the right thing. If he can be bought, in other words, why don't we just buy him??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be something for Wolf Blitzer to talk about. They could even have a box on CNN saying how much money had been raised so far. Reporters could ask Manchin all the time if $5 million isn't enough, what is your actual price?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He would say &quot;I don't have a price&quot; and we'd just..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't say!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/09/185121.html?title=noCellCoverage&quot;&gt;No Cell Coverage&lt;/a&gt; issue. I got a note that said to: 1. Turn on Airplane Mode. 2. Turn on Wifi. The thought is that should be enough to get the iPhone to stop trying to find a cell connection and thus stop draining my battery. If this works, all I'll have to do is remember to turn off Airplane Mode when I return to civilization.</description>

			<description>It would be interesting if one of the paywall'd pubs also offered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=ez-pass&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;tollbooth&lt;/a&gt; or pay-as-you-go option. It's possible I could end up paying more per month that way, but as a reader I'd feel better about it. I have too many subscriptions for things I never use. That really tarnishes the brand in my mind, esp after I unsub, which I inevitably do.</description>

			<title>Why LogSeq?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure some &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; users are puzzled that the change notes outline all of a sudden has a bunch of stuff about LogSeq in it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To a web outliner user who might not have heard of the product, or of the nascent &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/a&gt; category, it could seem odd. My interest comes from the growth of the TFT category, and its close proximity to my products, and the potential for interop.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have put out a format for interop -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt;, but I've decided I don't want to wait for its broad adoption in the category to get interop. It's similar to  when RSS 0.90 came out when I already had &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scriptingnews%20format&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;scriptingNews format&lt;/a&gt;. You have a choice at that point, you can have interop right now, or you can wait for a consensus that may never come. In the first case you have the chance to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; the consensus, in the latter, you have to wait for others to agree. It's why I've noted in the past that the person who goes second has all the power. So I chose in this case to go second.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if I want to interop with TFT products, why LogSeq?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;First, when I approached them, they responded, and listened, and followed up. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Second, they have an open product, you can interop with it without getting in a locked trunk. What you look for in interop is a level playing field, that it be a peering arrangement, and that your interop partner can't shut off the connection without losing their users. LogSeq meets all those requirements. They are committed to being open. It's not just a thing they say, it's how they've built their product.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Third, the format is simple. I am familiar with it, having created a similar format for my outliners in the 80s called .HEAD. I know what it can and can't do. There's enough that we can do with the LogSeq format that makes for interesting projects built on the interop. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Fourth, I like the team! They have a fresh can-do go-get-em attitude that is very refreshing. You don't see this very often in the US (they are in China). One thing that makes interop work better is if there's compatibility between the people. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I have to make a disclosure that I wish I had been able to make in November. I have made a small investment in the company. They have not announced this yet, and they asked me to wait until they do, but I feel I've already waited too long. I need people to know that I have a financial interest in the success of the company. But I also wanted to send a signal to them, to the users of our products, to the Tools For Thought category, to developers and others -- that we can compete and still see our success as beneficial to each other. This space is so large and under-developed that we can work for many years building on each others' strengths. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think what we're doing is substantially different. The focus of my projects tends to be in publishing and tools for development. I see their product as being useful in that context, but I don't think there's a big conflict. If we are able to co-exist with products that support OPML, surely we can do the same with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/4#issuecomment-1008016791&quot;&gt;progress report&lt;/a&gt; on the interop work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But the truth is the baby might have just farted and thought it was cool. Whatever it is you're angsting over might not have anything to do with you. Most of the people on the planet are living their lives not thinking about you at all. Maybe they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be thinking about you, but they aren't. Sorry.</description>

			<description>I love getting emails from PR people who offer to send me products based on what I write here. Not sarcastic. I got an message from a publicist at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://knopfdoubleday.com/imprint/pantheon/&quot;&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, which publishes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/239452/station-eleven-television-tie-in-by-emily-st-john-mandel/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that the Station Eleven HBO series is based on. I thanked her for the offer. I read the book when it came out, still have it, and realize I may want to re-read it after seeing the series. But at first I was confused, I thought she was offering to send me the graphic novel (ie comic book) that's at the center of the story, Dr. Eleven, but that doesn't exist. I think it would be immensely popular if it did, that is of course if it was good. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Asking for help with software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want help, you have to put the effort in, first. You can't expect people to help you if haven't checked your work.  First you have to carefully read the docs. Not just once, but two or three times. Then stare at the problem. Try changing something and see what happens. Maybe the docs say one thing but you're observing something else. What did I do wrong? You have to ask that question first. We all make mistakes, there's no shame in it, but it's not good to show no effort before sounding an alarm. Esp when the person you're asking for help from is doing it as a volunteer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing I've learned from far too many years using computers, I'm usually the one who made the mistake, though it's tempting to assume the software is wrong. When I say &quot;usually&quot; --- I mean once in a thousand times the software was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was a situation the other day when the user appeared to be reporting that the software had completely failed. We're now months into the shipment of the software, and I was pretty sure this part worked. I depended on it myself. The user gave me no information other than he thought the software was broken. I closed the issue and moved on. I can't work with people who aren't at least a little humble. And nothing is so urgent that I should stop everything I'm doing and help a panicked user who won't even do a little work to try to figure out whether they misunderstood or made a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problems I like helping people with are ones that are dished up in clear terms -- this is what I saw, I expected something else to happen (please explain), I read the docs (be sure you actually have) and tried a few things (explain) but I can't figure it out. When the explanation is so clear I recognize the issue and am able to quickly help. I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; helping people. I don't like doing other people's work for them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There's nothing in there that limits its uses to only tech stuff. Intentional. In fact I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/09/28/162837.html?title=yourOwnDocserver&quot;&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; about this on 9/28 of last year.</description>

There's nothing in there that limits its uses to only tech stuff. Intentional. In fact I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/09/28/162837.html?title=yourOwnDocserver&quot;&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; about this on 9/28 of last year." created="Wed, 05 Jan 2022 19:18:33 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/01/05.html#a191833"/>

It would be as big a breakthrough as S3 was in 2006. Actually it'd be more like the introduction of the floppy disk to the Apple II in 1978 or so. Really it's amazing how long this niche has been left unfilled. User-owned storage that their apps can use, provided by Amazon please. It has to be Amazon. I understand finally that's what all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=web3&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;web3&lt;/a&gt; michegas is about. The Blockchain vendors insist they have the solution to this festering sore of a problem. Of course tehcnologically -- far from it. But for some reason Amazon has been unwilling to fill the need. I think rushing to one form of storage rather than providing a cloneable API is foolish. We can have it all, and we should insist on it.</description>
