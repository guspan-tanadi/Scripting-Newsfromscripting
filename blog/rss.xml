In hindsight, how foolish was it for Facebook to change its name to Meta. Google is still Google now whatever they changed their name to (yeah I remember, but it takes some effort to pull it up, and as I'm doing it, I'm reminded how much I don't care) Alphabet. These geniuses should study &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)&quot;&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, their brands got tarnished, trampled, humiliated, charged and convicted. But the smart money is on &lt;i&gt;responding&lt;/i&gt; to the problem, not running away from it, which 99 out of 100 people recognize this as.

Think of another brand that sinned -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke&quot;&gt;Coca Cola&lt;/a&gt; with New Coke. They admitted they were wrong, and got rid of the mistake, not the brand, and they're still #1.</description>

			<description>I've spent the last week trying to do my normal development work on a laptop. And at the end of the week, I'm kind of getting the hang of it. The secret is to use Dropbox again, not just to manage servers (as I have been, but am transitioning away from because Dropbox on Linux is unwieldy), but to keep several editing places in sync without too much chance for error. This morning I lost some changes I made to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/264&quot;&gt;Sally's Reader&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a really simple app, and not very mission critical, yet, so it was easy to re-do the changes. But that got me thinking about how to get it to work more smoothly and reliably. I've had various systems over the years for this, and it'll be interesting to do it again. Luckily all the saving and opening of projects flows through two scripts, and I wrote them both, and they work very reliably. So I'll add some features, already am doing that. Feels good actually, didn't think it would.</description>

			<description>Journalists are concerned that replacing them with AI writers would make the news less trustworthy.  On the planet I live on, when I read a news story about something I know about it's filled with bullshit and lies, ones that could easily be corrected, but they just copy what they found on Wikipedia. Thus I am pretty sure that stories about stuff I don't know about are filled with similar bullshit. On those same subjects, ChatGPT gets it just as wrong, probably because the bot is relying on the same Wikipedia article that had the original lies in it. If journalism really wants people to have to truth, try giving it to them instead of complaining about how your jobs are in jeopardy.</description>

			<title>APIs of the 2020's</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/03/02/roomFreshener.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://prodromou.pub/@evan/110045336289311841&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Prodromou&quot;&gt;Evan Prodromou&lt;/a&gt;, one of the originators of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;. He says basically everyone should get behind it and stop inventing new formats and protocols for the federated social web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Without any judgment, it seems to me that ActivityPub should have started with RSS 2.0, building whatever new features they needed on top of it. But they didn't. I don't know why. We were going down that path, but then one day I saw that all the people I was collaborating with were meeting with Google and out of that came a completely incompatible protocol, which I believe became ActivityPub.

I think at this point that's the best we can hope for. And in that spirit I offer the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; which did that for blogs.

I doubt it, but hope is still possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, before you pat me on the head and thank me for &quot;fighting the good fight&quot; (which I hear as &quot;loser&quot;) remember this one motto: You can fake caring but you can't fake showing up. Put some skin in the game. You've been sitting on the sidelines your whole life. If you think we can make the new network useful and fair and learn from our mistakes and experience, get in the middle. There's no point accumulating capital if you never spend it. Now is a good time to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

These people are beyond stupid. Why don't they take a minute to think about how you develop a new medium. Is it done by adding a few sentences to a spec? I don't think so. You get an idea, in this case it came from Adam Curry (thanks) and start figuring out how it will work. Then you make the software for both publishing and listening, and then publish Grateful Dead music, thinking all the people will now figure it out but they don't. So you try something else and another thing, and you give up for a while. Then you meet an NPR guy and ask him if he wants to try this idea out. For some reason he says yes, when everyone else said no or didn't listen. So you get that going, and it's great and for sure you figure now everyone will get it, but they don't. So a year later in frustration you decide to put out your own show, and do it again and again, and leave the freaking mistakes in, and because of that people get the idea that Hey if that schmuck can do it, I bet I can too, and 20 or 30 people start doing it, and it's fun, and from there, it builds and after four years you have the start of a new medium. And no that idiot journalist did not give this new medium its name.

Look at that new bullshit thing Facebook just came out with.

You can stop reporting that it set records. They just came up with a new design and name for Instagram and said it was setting records, knowing that the reporters were bored of hating Zuckerberg, and now were ready to say he's cool again because he is trying to embarrass the &lt;i&gt;Asshole Du Jour&lt;/i&gt; for journalists everywhere, Elon Musk. The thing you should say about Bluesky is that it's freaking nice that these people made a nice UI and backend for the social web and give it away for nothing. Yay Bluesky for believing in all of us. And come on if you think moderation is so great and you think it can be done for free, why don't you volunteer to do it. Yeah I didn't think so.</description>

I'm more driven to write. I’m a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;natural born blogger&lt;/a&gt; or NBB. We write because that’s what we do. The first impulse is to write. First thing I want to do when I sit down to work is write and when I’m thinking about more things to do, I’m usually writing about it.</description>

It was fairly painless, but it did break some pages. If you have an &lt;i&gt;img&lt;/i&gt; element in the HTML or use the &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; attribute in OPML, and the url of the image is on HTTP, the browser will refuse to load it, and at least on Chrome it'll look like it's still loading for a long time, possibly forever. For most of these, I'll never get around to fixing them, it just is what it is. So HTTPS despite the hype, no matter whether you convert or not, still breaks the web, and Google must know all about this and doesn't care. If a platform vendor really cared about the web as a platform, they'd look at the risk in reading an img over http and say wtf, let it go. They're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt;, they have you by the balls, you know it and they know it.</description>

			<description>This bit of arcania has also crept into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. As you may know &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is now on HTTPS, it has to be because it's managing identity for itself, and if a feed item has an image only accessible over HTTP, the browser won't load it. I guess all feed readers have this problem, and I guess images from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; have always been broken? But this isn't how I remember it. Hmmm. Maybe they're doing something special, like accessing the image through a proxy running outside of Chrome's control. Haha if so &lt;i&gt;holy shit.&lt;/i&gt; Either it's a security problem or it isn't. I really don't think images need to be protected, but what do I know. In any case, from this point on, my images will be HTTPS too.</description>

			<title>Twitter approaches textcasting</title>

They kind of snuck that in there quietly? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see them support Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can edit your tweets for up to an hour. That's pretty good imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is basically checking off the boxes on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if their competitors are noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also a nice RSS feed coming out of Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let me enclose an MP3 for a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There are people at the company who believe in the open web (or at least there were at one time) and some of them have the ability to launch projects to be part of the open web, but by the time the project has to get approval from one of the top execs, it dies -- because Zuck et al have hearts of stone, and think they can have anything that isn't nailed down, and think anyone who believes in being fair to users and competitors is a chump -- a Mother Teresa type, someone to laugh at not work with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are very few people in the world as greedy and mean as Zuckerberg. Never underestimate how cold his heart is. And never believe he will do anything that benefits anyone but him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I put &lt;i&gt;dominated&lt;/i&gt; in quotes because it's obvious that the market defined by the startup is going to be huge. But it's better if the new area is dominated by a mega corp, that is for the established billionaires. For the rest of us, it sucks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It all depends on what users do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly with podcasting, we were able to confuse the bigco's enough for long enough that the users learned they were entitled to choice and they suspected any effort to lock them in.

I'm here, I am typing into &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, but not enough people are hearing it. Don't believe Facebook has good intentions. If they did, they would hook the main Facebook product up to the open web, not the new one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time from some other names of the open web generation to step up and help. Facebook is going to run over the nascent federated social web the same way &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/21/170042.html&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; ran over &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. That cost us a decade or more of open growth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But we can put a roadblock in Facebook's way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aaai.org/working-together-on-our-future-with-ai/&quot;&gt;founders of AI&lt;/a&gt; spoke up. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Well the founders of the open web could have a word too.

			<description>Facebook hasn't done anything to support the open web. All they've done is put it in a press release and post an email to a mail list.

			<description>I was just filling out a form that asked for my social media addresses and noticed how I don't remember how to specify the addresses for Bluesky, Mastodon and LinkedIn. I had no trouble with Twitter and Threads, though I have a lot of trouble remembering the name of Threads. I think Bluesky is headed in the right direction, by letting people specify a domain name. A service that made this a bit easier for non-technical users could help here.</description>

The idea of social networks being conversational hasn't been true for a long time.

Congrats to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/&quot;&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; for coining a term that has so much lasting value. Everything turns to shit.

			<description>Twitter is so fucked. Every time I visit Twitter it's the same messages at the top of my timeline, from July 5. Is this how Twitter ends? Locked on July 5, 2023 forever. It was a good day but it wasn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; good.</description>

			<description>I'm going through my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Cooper&quot;&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt; phase. Again. When I was a teen I loved the band. I always felt kind of ashamed of it. I used to go to their concerts to see what he'd do this time. I must have seen him guillotined a dozen times. He knew what fascinated teenage boys. Anyway the song rolling around in my head today is the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbS2Zrcl6g&quot;&gt;Dead Babies&lt;/a&gt;. It's a really awful song, I guess that's why I like it so much. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Posts without titles in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; now does a better job with posts without titles.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a screen shot of two posts in a timeline, neither of which have titles, followed by one that does have a title, so you can see the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/11/postsWithoutTItlesCollapsed.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;Two posts without titles. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new thing is the bold text at the beginning of each untitled post, so you can more easily see the structure as you scroll through it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another new feature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's also a max height to a post but if you click on the body it expands to reveal the full text. Click again and it goes back to compact size. It took a bunch of iteration to get to this, it's better than what Facebook and Twitter do, where you have to carefully position the mouse to see the rest, and after expanding, the place where you have to clock to collapse it moves. In this scheme, stay right where you are and click again to collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/11/twoPostsWithoutTitles.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;First post has been expanded, second not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
