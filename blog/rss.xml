It supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt; so you can get instant notification of updates. I expect to plug this into other stuff I'm working on.

			<description>I replaced the picture in the Facebook and Twitter metadata, so when you paste a link to bingeworthy.io, you'll get a more meaningful &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/24/bingeworthyScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;. The place holder in the first version was a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/12/11/breakingBad.png&quot;&gt;Mr White&lt;/a&gt; from Breaking Bad and in version 2, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/16/schittsCreekCast.png&quot;&gt;Rose family&lt;/a&gt; in Schitt's Creek.</description>

Words like &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt; should not be thrown around casually. Death is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)&quot;&gt;heavy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=death&quot;&gt;word&lt;/a&gt;, and should be reserved for real death, not an imaginary stupid metaphoric death.</description>

			<description>More on Friday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bidens-acceptance-speech-election-interference-steve/id1514968525?i=1000488856251&quot;&gt;Lincoln Project podcast&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Steve Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; said everyone in 2016 in DC knew Manafort was a Russian agent. This reminded me of when when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier#Publication_by_BuzzFeed_News&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed published&lt;/a&gt; the Steele Dossier, and the rage of other journalists that they had disclosed unverified information to the public, even though the dossier was being widely circulated in DC at the time. I was glad &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; took the side of the people. There should be little difference between what insiders know and what the public knows. Some things are so important, people should take risks, esp if they want the rep of being a patriot as Schmidt clearly does. Anyway it turns out &quot;collusion&quot; was too polite. The Trump campaign in 2016 was actually run by Russia. This is now an established fact. This should get huge headlines.</description>

			<description>I took my car to a special place that has techniques for cleaning awful smells out of cars. My car, a little over a year old with less than 10K miles may be a total loss because of the family of mice that colonized and then died in its air conditioning system. So I had to rent a car. When I got it, it was clear that it had been smoked in. So I asked for another car. Waited a half hour in the hot sun. The next car also had been smoked in. Impatient, I didn't ask for a new one this time. So I traded in a car that smelled of dead mice for one that smells of (to me) sickness. I haven't smoked since June 14, 2002. It's not a nice smell for me. There must be a lesson in this, but I'm not sure what it is.</description>

			<description>If Trump is re-elected, I think the country has to split in two. I don't think we, in the so-called blue states, can handle another four years of Trump. We'll have to find a way to opt out. I feel for all the people of color, immigrants and Jews in the red states. We have to provide for their migration. Either that or we rebel. But the Constitution, if it allows a man like Trump to be elected and then re-elected, is not worth preserving imho.</description>

They say it never happened. But, I remember, my family was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ps+149+qieems+ps+92+pairing&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/03/19/106947848.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0&quot;&gt;pairing&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ps149q.org/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ps92q.org/&quot;&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; in white &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights,_Queens&quot;&gt;Jackson Heights&lt;/a&gt; and in black &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens&quot;&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt;. My brother went to the Corona school, and I stayed in the Jackson Heights school. Of course I was a kid, so I wasn't really aware of what was going on beyond there were more black kids in our class. It also occurs to me that we moved not long after this happened, further east, to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburndale,_Queens&quot;&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; where there were no black neighborhoods to pair with. I don't know what motivated my parents to move, and it's too late to ask them.</description>

I don't know what motivated my parents to move, and it's too late to ask them." created="Sun, 23 Aug 2020 19:37:18 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/23.html#a193718"/>

			<description>Heard a report this morning on NPR, interviewing older Trump voters, and while they say his behavior is awful and he lies, and he's botched the virus response, they're still voting for him. Why? They don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, white supremacy. I don't think the Democrats are going to say this but it needs to be said. &lt;i&gt;White supremacy is on the ballot this year. &lt;/i&gt;It may be the single decisive issue. Not the virus, not the Constitution. But the right of whites to dominate. I wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/135804.html?title=whiteSupremacyIsOnTheBallot&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is hard to explain, but imho important. I'm going to work on better ways to explain, but for now you have to read slowly, carefully.</description>

			<description>This morning I changed &lt;i&gt;racism&lt;/i&gt; in the title of yesterday's post to &lt;i&gt;white supremacy. &lt;/i&gt;I think thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going through now in the US. Totally unanticipated that the joy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2008/11.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; would be followed by such upheaval. The US wants to shed racism, or does it? I didnâ€™t realize we were still having this argument until recently.</description>

			<description>Following up on yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/21.html#a174124&quot;&gt;hypothetical&lt;/a&gt;, assuming people from blue states relocated to sparsely populated states, let's do an example. The population of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=population+wyoming&quot;&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; is 579K. The population one of the boroughs of NYC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=population+queens+ny&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, is 2.3 million. So if 15 percent of the people in Queens relocated to Wyoming, that could yield three more non-fascist Electoral College votes, one member of the House and two Senators.</description>

			<description>Facebook, now that you've merged friend requests and notifications of new posts from friends, the fact that spam friend requests are out of control has become a more serious problem. I don't want to deal with the spam while checking out what my friends say. And there's a small chance a friend request is not spam, and there isn't enough info in the list to tell. So I just delete all of them. I get about 10 spam friend requests every day, or at least that's what it was before they got merged with other stuff. Either get the spam under control, or re-separate them.</description>

			<title>White supremacy is on the ballot</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Racism and misogyny are on the ballot this year. Even white men can now feel the effects. I think that's what the last twelve years in the US have been about. Here's the story. George W. Bush was so awful, we needed an antidote, and we liked Obama. We liked how sassy he was, and smart, and how well he spoke, his confidence and ambition. The whole package. It was his moment. Trump is the reaction because there were a lot of Americans who felt tremendous fear and resentment in having a young sassy (they'd probably say uppity) black man as president, no matter that he brought the economy back from the wreck that the Repubs left us. Remember how they drove it into a ditch.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So in 2016 it was Trump vs HRC. But before that it was Sanders vs HRC. That's where I, a white man, learned how men keep women down. In the debates I was so angry that Sanders interrupted and screamed over HRC, his arms waved into her space. She had to take it. Could she respond in kind? No way. Not sure what the women's equivalent of uppity is, but it's a real thing. And because she was my candidate, I felt it, felt it in a way I had never felt it before. I was enraged by it. But it seems most people couldn't even see it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people who hated that a black man was president sure as hell weren't going to follow him with a woman president. No matter that she's smart as a whip, would have been a great president, and look who she was running against. What a slap in the face for women as equals -- that so many people chose a huckster, buffoon, Putin surrogate, man-child, tax evader, draft dodger, rich kid, criminal, instead of HRC. It really says something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This morning while getting ready to write it hit me. The last four years have been a symbolic lynching of Barack Obama. Anyone who still approves of Trump, if they have a mind, must be driven by rage, the kind of rage that results in a young confident black man being strung up on a tree. They're willing to let a virus decimate the country in order to express their rage. Anyone who votes for Trump this time, imho, should lose the right to call themselves an American. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was something of a puzzle to me why racism became the big issue this summer, as the virus was raging through our population. But it would have been even if there had been no virus. Maybe we don't realize it at a conscious level, but the humiliation of the last four years, even for white men in the US, has been that the hatred of blacks and women in our fellow Americans has been exposed, they can't hide from it now. It's out there for everyone to see. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It took a fully competent African-American president and a fully competent woman candidate for white men to really see it. Some of us &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; the idea of putting racism and misogyny behind us, and others hated it. But it's fully out there now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Apple hates devs, always has</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1980-something I was invited to give a talk at Apple along with a reporter from the NYT. The idea was that we would give feedback to Apple people to help them work better with developers and the press. I took the assignment seriously. I showed up with a list of requests, things Apple could do to give their platform an advantage over the IBM PC, their chief competitor at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I finished, Apple people lined up to give &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; feedback on how ungrateful I am. They do all the work and I make all the money and get all the glory. Funny thing, because I viewed it exactly the other way around. They had real salaries and benefits. I was always skating on thin ice. There were plenty of times when I didn't have any idea how I was going to pay the bills. They never had that concern. They could break me, I couldn't break them. They had all the power. They resented that the VPs at Apple would take my calls or respond to my emails, and those emails would be circulated with notes like &quot;Please do something about this,&quot; which of course resulted in nothing happening other than more resentment. The bosses didn't listen to them, but then again, they didn't listen to the bosses either. They really held the keys, the top people at Apple had no clue about how computers worked, so they were at the mercy of the people in the room who expressed their displeasure with me that day in the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I did have friends at Apple, people I could take to lunch and ask wtf just happened. It turns out that the rank and file at Apple hate everyone. They hate their bosses, their bosses' bosses. And the press. And most of all, developers. On top of the list loudmouth developers like me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What can you say. Some things never change. They were wrong then, developers saved their jobs over and over. Now they don't need anyone to save their jobs, they're floating on a vast ocean of cash. But someday they will need devs. When it works there's tremendous synergy between developers and platform vendors. But employees of the platform vendors are usually big obstacles to success. They hurt, feel unloved, unappreciated, underpaid, dispensible, ripped off. And I don't know of anything that can be done about that. As they say, it is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="When I finished, Apple people lined up to give &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; feedback on how ungrateful I am. They do all the work and I make all the money and get all the glory. Funny thing, because I viewed it exactly the other way around. They had real salaries and benefits. I was always skating on thin ice. There were plenty of times when I didn't have any idea how I was going to pay the bills. They never had that concern. They could break me, I couldn't break them. They had all the power. They resented that the VPs at Apple would take my calls or respond to my emails, and those emails would be circulated with notes like &quot;Please do something about this,&quot; which of course resulted in nothing happening other than more resentment. The bosses didn't listen to them, but then again, they didn't listen to the bosses either. They really held the keys, the top people at Apple had no clue about how computers worked, so they were at the mercy of the people in the room who expressed their displeasure with me that day in the 1980s." created="Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:35:09 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/133242.html?title=appleHatesDevsAlwaysHas#a133509"/>
				<source:outline text="I did have friends at Apple, people I could take to lunch and ask wtf just happened. It turns out that the rank and file at Apple hate everyone. They hate their bosses, their bosses' bosses. And the press. And most of all, developers. On top of the list loudmouth developers like me." created="Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:37:38 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/133242.html?title=appleHatesDevsAlwaysHas#a133738"/>
				<source:outline text="What can you say. Some things never change. They were wrong then, developers saved their jobs over and over. Now they don't need anyone to save their jobs, they're floating on a vast ocean of cash. But someday they will need devs. When it works there's tremendous synergy between developers and platform vendors. But employees of the platform vendors are usually big obstacles to success. They hurt, feel unloved, unappreciated, underpaid, dispensible, ripped off. And I don't know of anything that can be done about that. As they say, it is what it is." created="Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:38:05 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/22/133242.html?title=appleHatesDevsAlwaysHas#a133805"/>

At the end they say that what the NBA has done is too expensive to replicate elsewhere, but -- it's not true. The NBA is doing what China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Iceland, Singapore, Vietnam did. How did I learn about this?

			<title>Biden nailed it</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's DNC went by quickly. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1296681978029322241&quot;&gt;funny&lt;/a&gt;. The speakers spoke warmly of Joe Biden, including Bernie Sanders. Everything was great until the moment Biden stepped up to speak. His first few sentences were awkward, the words were vague and muffled. I started to get up from the chair, not wanting to listen. I thought I'd clean up and go to bed, but I decided that I have to sit through this, so I did, and I was quickly riveted and glad to hear him touch on all the important points, ones that no one had made through the week. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Until that point I thought Michelle Obama's speech was the best. I thought Barack Obama's was weak. I don't think the Constitution is the strongest appeal, it's the lack of leadership, we're all left to fend for ourselves against a virus that's killing huge numbers of Americans. We could deal with a little authoritarianism, I feel, if it was in the cause of saving our lives. The fear isn't rooted in the 170K Americans who have already died, it's the next 170K and the ones after that. We all want to survive this. With Trump in for four more years, our chances of not being destroyed by the virus are zero. I think that is by far the strongest appeal. And until Biden, amazingly, in four days of the DNC, no one had made it. He didn't quite make it explicitly either, but he came pretty close. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I often feel there's this divide between our leaders and the people. And I don't kid myself, the divide is there between Biden and us too. All the stories about how he gave people his phone number, or sat down and talked for hours with a random person, those are touching for sure, and even if they are real, I know he'll never call me. It was the equivalent of having a beer with Bush or shooting hoops with Obama. I wish one of these politicians had a practical vision -- of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;political social network&lt;/a&gt; that mobilized us 365 days a year, every year, not just when there's an election. Biden is not that person, nor is Kamala Harris. When they're elected they will govern like Obama did, and will be vulnerable to the same Republican sabotage that he was. But. Biden was not awkward. His speech was more a fireside chat than a DNC acceptance speech. Yes, I am convinced he is on our side, relative to the current president. A low bar for sure, but it grabs me emotionally, also physically, cheering, sobbing. It would be such a relief, on Election Day, to find we had come together and elected Biden and Harris in such large numbers that everyone will see what a fool Trump is, even his most vocal supporters, and we'll tell him to STFU, with one voice, and just retire in disgrace to his bunker in Russia. It's a dream I allow myself to have. And it was supported by Biden's speech last night. That's political speech at its best. It was a good thing I sat my butt back down and listened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I thought I'd clean up and go to bed, but I decided that I have to sit through this, so I did, and I was quickly riveted and glad to hear him touch on all the important points, ones that no one had made through the week." created="Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:28:57 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/132553.html?title=bidenNailedIt#a132857"/>
				<source:outline text="Until that point I thought Michelle Obama's speech was the best. I thought Barack Obama's was weak. I don't think the Constitution is the strongest appeal, it's the lack of leadership, we're all left to fend for ourselves against a virus that's killing huge numbers of Americans. We could deal with a little authoritarianism, I feel, if it was in the cause of saving our lives. The fear isn't rooted in the 170K Americans who have already died, it's the next 170K and the ones after that. We all want to survive this. With Trump in for four more years, our chances of not being destroyed by the virus are zero. I think that is by far the strongest appeal. And until Biden, amazingly, in four days of the DNC, no one had made it. He didn't quite make it explicitly either, but he came pretty close." created="Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:30:24 GMT" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/132553.html?title=bidenNailedIt#a133024"/>
				<source:outline text="I often feel there's this divide between our leaders and the people. And I don't kid myself, the divide is there between Biden and us too. All the stories about how he gave people his phone number, or sat down and talked for hours with a random person, those are touching for sure, and even if they are real, I know he'll never call me. It was the equivalent of having a beer with Bush or shooting hoops with Obama. I wish one of these politicians had a practical vision -- of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;political social network&lt;/a&gt; that mobilized us 365 days a year, every year, not just when there's an election. Biden is not that person, nor is Kamala Harris. When they're elected they will govern like Obama did, and will be vulnerable to the same Republican sabotage that he was. But. Biden was not awkward. His speech was more a fireside chat than a DNC acceptance speech. Yes, I am convinced he is on our side, relative to the current president. A low bar for sure, but it grabs me emotionally, also physically, cheering, sobbing. It would be such a relief, on Election Day, to find we had come together and elected Biden and Harris in such large numbers that everyone will see what a fool Trump is, even his most vocal supporters, and we'll tell him to STFU, with one voice, and just retire in disgrace to his bunker in Russia. It's a dream I allow myself to have. And it was supported by Biden's speech last night. That's political speech at its best. It was a good thing I sat my butt back down and listened." created="Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:32:13 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/27/bidenActionFigure.png" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/08/21/132553.html?title=bidenNailedIt#a133213"/>

			<description>I wonder why the DNC didn't create an actual crowd for one or two speeches. It can be done safely. Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P3X9AiN8E4&quot;&gt;eulogy&lt;/a&gt; Barack Obama gave for John Lewis. The audience was very much part of the event. I think last night's keynote by Kamala Harris would have been more effective in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Maybe they'll create such an event tonight for the presidential nominee. I went to Obama's acceptance speech in Denver in 2008 in a football stadium. Quite an event.</description>

I'm sure they've thought it through, but next year we'll know a lot more about living with the virus than we do now. Look at how much we've learned in the last six months. Net-net, we'll do better in terms of human lives, if we give it more time. Work up to it slowly. Maybe have conferences on campus but do everything else online. Create projects for people to do collaboratively. I know the economics are dismal. But I think it's better if universities die to keep students alive rather than the other way.</description>
