			<description>Just got a note from Matt Mullenweg &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1603767093739941889&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; they're going to support &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto#titlelessfeedshowto&quot;&gt;titleless feeds&lt;/a&gt; in WordPress. Couldn't be happier.</description>

			<description>Also on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; they say &quot;it's like podcasts -- but for reading.&quot; That's brilliant. Probably leaves a bunch of people scratching their heads. But this is where we're going. Making the world of text work as smoothly as the world of audio. Next step is to work on interop. So I can copy a full-featured &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcast&lt;/a&gt; item from an app that doesn't support all the features (like Twitter or Mastodon) and paste it into one that does (like NetNewsWire or FeedLand), and voila -- everything is there. It's a simple change that would make it impossible for any participant in the network to lock you in. Your ideas would be free to move instead of being locked up. Feeds get us most of the way there, but there's a little more to do.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lonseidman/status/1603770626275266561&quot;&gt;Lon Seidman&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Funny how my RSS reader keeps working perfectly fine well over a decade after I set it up. No bans, no algorithms, just dutifully spits out what I'm following each time I Iog in.&quot; That's because if someone tried to lock you in you'd just switch. Having something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; under an industry keeps it honest and respectful of users.</description>

			<description>A weird thought. Musk gets upset and calls a timeout. Twitter goes off the air for 24 hours. As Judy Tenuta &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; -- It could happen. ;-)</description>

			<description>Last night I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/15.html#a023149&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; here announcing a new feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; that lets you connect an email address to your account. I just wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/151&quot;&gt;more detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of what's going on with a place to ask questions if you're having trouble. This is important, it's a backup against a problem with Twitter. Better safe than sorry! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, it's worth noting that your subscriptions are public info, so even if for some reason you couldn't log onto your account you could still access your subscriptions, because anyone can. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; are here. You can even get them &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=podcasts&quot;&gt;by category&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Something that was forgotten from the old days of blogging. We don't blog to make money, rather we blog as part of what we do to make money. Important difference. Since I switched back to full blogging in 2017 and not writing for social media, after some time building tools, and re-learning how to ship stuff from my blog, I used it to launch FeedLand earlier this year, and the results have been outstanding. People are using it. That was the goal. Blogging makes bigger things possible. It's how I organize my work and work with the people who use the product of my work. We observed this in 2004 and beyond as we launched podcasting. It happened a lot faster than with blogging, because we had blogs to promote podcasting. This stuff builds. When we get interop the power tends to expand as a multiple, not linearly.</description>

Here's an example of such a thread, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.masto.land/@dave/109518506487530508&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/15/outlineStructureForMastoThreadScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the outline that came from in Drummer. It's been a while since I added a feature to Drummer, and it seemed the new Mastodon capability in my toolbox seemed like a good opportunity to do that. I'll write up a howto for this shortly.</description>

			<description>The idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is like podcasting. When you create a podcast it isnâ€™t bound to one player. Every podcast can be played by any player. It isnâ€™t like that with text, but it could and should be. It will happen only if devs and users work together.</description>

			<title>Adopt an NBB</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think we should all adopt a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB&lt;/a&gt; and help them get started blogging and tied into the feed network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need leaders from outside the geek community. And they need help finding their way through the web of interconnected services. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Open systems are harder to navigate than the silos. This is a fact, always will be so. But a human concierge could mak the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am sending private pitches to various people offering help. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ditch the business model. Blogging won't pay for itself that way. But in other ways the benefit is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;* NBB == Natural Born Blogger&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, yesterday we paused new signons to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. There were a lot of reasons for this. First, I didn't want a lot of users. I think of FeedLand as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt; global feed management system. Not wanting in any way to compete with the huge systems, to create yet another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1602663488157089795&quot;&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; like Twitter. I felt that we already had too many users for my liking. At some point the load on the server is going to be a problem, I wanted to stop well before we got to that point. Also, I want to do some development that would be harder with new users coming online. Remember this is not a corporate site. I am the only person working on the software and I'm responsible for keeping the service running at a technical level, and dealing with trolls, spammers and abusers, which thankfully have not been a problem yet, but I know from experience that it's just a matter of time.</description>

			<description>There's this great line in Sleeper where the character played by Woody Allen was asleep for 100 years and when he woke wanted to know how the world was destroyed. They said a guy named Albert Shanker got a nuclear weapon. That's a 1970s NYC joke. If you knew Albert Shanker, you'd get it. If they were remaking the movie now instead of Albert Shanker it'd be Elon Musk and instead of a nuke it'd be Twitter and instead of being science fiction it'd be true. Now that's still an Albert Shanker joke, but soon there will be plenty of Elon Musk jokes. Lots of them. I'm never wrong about things like this btw. ;-)</description>

			<title>Why you stopped blogging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was a choice between:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. All the tools of the web, esp linking (which is itself a social network btw).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. The very limited writing tools of Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You chose the latter because that's where the people were.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Personally I never stopped blogging, I kept trying to get my blogging to fit in with Twitter, Facebook, Medium, etc. In 2017 I gave that up, and just blogged as a blog. I accepted that most people wouldn't read what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realized my writing had become crap because I was trying to get it into all those places. I realized that was too much to give up, that writing was how I grew intellectually, and accepting the limits of the business people at the social networks was killing my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Too high a price.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We could use what we've learned from podcasting and apply it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/whatIsADocument/#1669299984000&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;, to create a wonderful worldwide open and huge writing environment that isn't tied to a single company and isn't limited. And no we do not need anything more than the web to do it.</description>

			<description>The web has not gotten nearly the respect it deserves as a writing environment. It's been crippled by neglect, greed, complacency and cynicism. And jealousy -- professional writers are contemptuous of the idea of amateurs writing brilliantly. But it's not too late.</description>

			<description>BTW, this was the first time I wrote one of these HowTos that is part prose and part code. I love the way it turned out. I didn't plan on talking to feed reader devs on behalf of writers, but I think we all need to focus on who we're doing all this for, and it's primarily writers imho and then readers, and to the extent that programmers matter, it's just teeeny little bit. If this were a restaurant, we've designed things solely from the point of view of waiters, ignoring chefs and diners. That's how far off course we've gotten. We value tech too much esp when tech has done such a bad job as we have in feed reading user experience.</description>

			<description>No wonder the writing and reading environment of the web in 2022 is so awful. We ignore the writers and the readers. Every time one of us speaks up, we get a chorus of agreement from other writers and readers, and then totally ignored by the developers. One example I'm constantly reminded of, because I often read the NYT on my iPad, it &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; interrupts my reading to put up a dialog asking if I want to read the article in their app. Even worse, they wait long enough so that I have already started reading the article. It's as if they &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; me to hate them. They say the app is much better. Well, I don't want to do that, for good reason, and it's none of their freaking business but there's no way to turn this dialog off. I pay them a lot of money to read their articles. And every time I open one of their stories on my iPad I'm reminded how much they hate me, and vice versa.</description>

			<title>How to find new feeds in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Talking with a friend who uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; today, the question came up as to how you find new feeds that might be interesting. So here are a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you don't want to do a lot of work, start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt;. I subscribe to a lot of feeds, more than anyone else. Now here's the cool part. If you see a checkbox that isn't checked that means you aren't subscribed to it. Just click on the checkbox to subscribe. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Start with a feed you like, on your &lt;i&gt;Feed List&lt;/i&gt; page. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/11/feedlistScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the title of the feed, which takes you to the &lt;i&gt;Feed Info&lt;/i&gt; page. At the end of the page is a list of other people who subscribe to that feed. Click on a name to see their Feed List page. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;i&gt;Recent users&lt;/i&gt; from the first menu. It takes you to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?userslist&quot;&gt;list of users&lt;/a&gt; who have recently used FeedLand. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/11/recentUsersScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Click on any name to go to their feed list. There are the checkboxes again. You can play with the sort order on the Recent Users page, you can see the people who have used FeedLand the most (that's the &lt;i&gt;Hits&lt;/i&gt; colum) or are subscribed to the most feeds (the &lt;i&gt;Ct&lt;/i&gt; column) or have been using it the longest (click twice on the &lt;i&gt;Started&lt;/i&gt; column). &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

They ask you to look at posts and rate relevance, sources, context. None of the messages have profanity or are abusive or personal (some contain assumptions that are).

			<title>My manifesto for feed reader developers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;First, credit and respect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt; for helping steer Mastodon to titleless feeds. That's a mega-contribution to moving toward turning the web into a functional writing environment instead of the utterly broken mess stemming from when Twitter and Google Reader couldn't come together on micro-blogging and feeds. Imagine if they had worked it out. We'd be so much further ahead. That was in 2007. Writing on the web has been broken since then. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now most feed readers imho are broken, even the beloved products we depend on every day. We can love them even though they're wrong. I can't be mushy about this. Wrong is wrong. But we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/titlelessFeedsHowto&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; that is both code and prose, I say what I think the purpose of feeds are, to serve writers and readers, and there is no room for the wants of programmers, esp when it's so easy to do what the writers want us to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been nice about this for a long time. We need to get together, users and developers and get this fixed so we can start adding more features to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/whatIsADocument/&quot;&gt;common feature set&lt;/a&gt; of writing environments for the web. We can easily get unstuck if we decide to get unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A prototype for a feed reader</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than just preaching how feed readers could easily accommodate both titled and title-less items, as I have been, I put up a prototype that illustrates, with real data. It's not a lot of work, I developed this from scratch in one full programming day. Still have a little work tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it deals with three test feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frss.nytimes.com%2Fservices%2Fxml%2Frss%2Fnyt%2FWorld.xml#&quot;&gt;NYT feed&lt;/a&gt;. It's an easy case because the NYT feeds are uniform. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News feed&lt;/a&gt; contains both titled and title-less posts.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/titleless/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;My Mastodon feed&lt;/a&gt;, where all items are title-less. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will publish the source tomorrow, and hopefully skilled UI designers will have a look and then maybe we can approach the developers at each of the feed reader developers, and get past this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I know people don't like Tesla these days, but I still feel like it's a privilege to drive my Model Y every time, even though I've been driving it for over a year now. It's a feeling of able-ness no car has ever given me. And that's the feeling my new eyes give me. I've been dis-abled seriously for years now. And my vision never really worked, even when I was a kid. I remember getting glasses for teh first time in second or third grade. I never knew there was so much writing in the world, everywhere. It's like that except at an age where such discoveries are pretty rare. I think this experience will fade away as my new eyesight becomes the norm, but for now, it's given me a new youth-like experience, pretty cool.</description>

			<description>A fact I've observed. Most programmers who work on web content systems not only aren't writers, they don't make an effort to know or understand writers.

			<title>Feed items without titles</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to be true to the intent of the author of a feed, and create a good experience for the reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the real world some feed items have titles and some don't. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/08/itemsWithoutTitles.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. I've put red arrows pointing to the items that don't have titles. You could argue I suppose that they should have titles. That I should take a 9-word item and give it a two-word title. But I don't do that. And it shows up in my feed without a title, because the item does not have a title. And that's not up to anyone but me, the author of the feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/08/readerviewitemswithouttitles.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of how a popular feed reader displays those items. It isn't terrible, but it's imho wrong. The first item has a [no title] message where a title would go. Why? Look at it from the human reader point of view. What information does that convey, above what the writer was saying, in bigger type and in bold. &lt;b&gt;NO TITLE&lt;/b&gt;. I don't know about you but to me that looks like criticism, an error message, from the software to the person who wrote the post. Sometimes all the posts show up with that message. This time only one did. And for the others, they repeat the first bits of the post. Again, why? The human read them once, why put the same words they just read on the screen again? That seems quite wrong to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now I don't know why they designed their software this way, but I can guess -- when they started they designed it assuming all posts had titles, and it took a while before they discovered that some items don't. So they shoehorned those into the app without disrupting the design of the product. But this has been going on for a very long time, many years, basically since Google Reader decided, incorrectly, that all feed items must have titles. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Mastodon supporting RSS, and Mastodon booming in popularity, feed readers should expect to see a lot more feeds with items without titles, unless for some reason Mastodon does what Twitter did many years ago, under pressure from Google Reader to add titles to items, and just withdraws the feeds. All because they couldn't adjust to a reality they hadn't planned for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so what's the answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Never display NO TITLE. It's not a good use of your space, the reader's time and it's wrong. The author didn't use those words. They're your words. You don't have a right to put your words in space reserved for the words from feeds. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Instead display the first words from the description element of the item where you would put the title. If there are too many words, flow them into the space you've allocated for the description, but &lt;i&gt;do not repeat words&lt;/i&gt; from the description. Again, you'd displaying something that isn't in the feed. The author did not repeat the words, so you can't do that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's it, unless I'm missing something, and if I am, tell me. You can send me email, dave@scripting.com, and if you don't want me to publish it, say so and I won't. I don't want to embarrass anyone, I just want to solve this problem and move on to a feed world where feeds with items without titles are handled well by the reader software. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, one more thing, some feeds will have both kinds of posts, items with titles and items without. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; is like that. The item for this post will have a title because the post has a title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Okay so what's the answer?" created="Thu, 08 Dec 2022 14:30:32 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/08/141610.html#a143032">
					<source:outline text="Never display NO TITLE. It's not a good use of your space, the reader's time and it's wrong. The author didn't use those words. They're your words. You don't have a right to put your words in space reserved for the words from feeds." created="Thu, 08 Dec 2022 14:30:51 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/08/141610.html#a143051"/>
					<source:outline text="Instead display the first words from the description element of the item where you would put the title. If there are too many words, flow them into the space you've allocated for the description, but &lt;i&gt;do not repeat words&lt;/i&gt; from the description. Again, you'd displaying something that isn't in the feed. The author did not repeat the words, so you can't do that." created="Thu, 08 Dec 2022 14:31:48 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/08/141610.html#a143148"/>

				<source:outline text="That's it, unless I'm missing something, and if I am, tell me. You can send me email, dave@scripting.com, and if you don't want me to publish it, say so and I won't. I don't want to embarrass anyone, I just want to solve this problem and move on to a feed world where feeds with items without titles are handled well by the reader software." created="Thu, 08 Dec 2022 14:33:01 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/08/141610.html#a143301"/>
				<source:outline text="BTW, one more thing, some feeds will have both kinds of posts, items with titles and items without. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; is like that. The item for this post will have a title because the post has a title." created="Thu, 08 Dec 2022 14:34:11 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/12/08/141610.html#a143411"/>
