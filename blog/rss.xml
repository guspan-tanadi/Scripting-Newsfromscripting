It's got stuff that Mastodon's RSS feed doesn't. This is &lt;i&gt;awesome. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>I know Facebook is supposedly evil, but it has been a constant for me, because i can communicate with friends I've had for decades as if we still lived in the same city we used to, even though many of them have moved back to where they came from (as I did). I don't think Facebook is any more or less evil than any other system where I'm a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster&lt;/a&gt; spinning a wheel and someone else is going to make billions off of the collection of hamsters.</description>

			<title>The holy grail of social media</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks designed for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Facebook, Google stood in the way of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But itâ€™s all reforming now, not the way people thought it would just a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s fair to assume there will be more change in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why are new social nets so nice?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I ran a BBS in the early 80s, weâ€™d get hacked from time to time, and usually theyâ€™d wipe the database, which left us with a fresh start, and for a while everything would be nice and simple, until it got all clogged up again. So there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_lining_(idiom)&quot;&gt;silver lining&lt;/a&gt; to getting hacked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another phenomenon that might be at play. Remembering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clubhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, the voice-only twitter, was wonderful until it became a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2017/08/origins-juggernaut-jagannath/&quot;&gt;juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; then it was filled with spam and influencers, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/14/understanding-comradery.html&quot;&gt;comradery&lt;/a&gt; that people loved at first was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So Twitter is old and clogged. Its rules are more or less set in stone. A new network, where there isn't much of a caste system, or it can be avoided, has more potential. People are on somewhat of a level playing field. The trolls haven't gotten organized yet. Whatever it is, Bluesky is nice. But it will get clogged too, and they should prepare for that by being more open to different uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing they're all missing is that these are writing environments first, so studying writing on computers would make sense. If they did, they'd instantly get some important new ideas for features users would love. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Going outside, gardening, bike riding, swimming, maybe the Mets? Is it time for that yet? I don't know. Oy. Such problems.

			<description>There are so many things wrong with Bluesky. I've started to list them on Bluesky itself, but I seriously doubt any people on the team will pay attention. What we need more than anything are social networks that don't bury their heads in the sand and try to do it all themselves. They're making the same mistakes Twitter made, but 17 years later, with the benefit of hindsight that they are not using. And they re-invent old things, when the world solved those problems a long time ago. For example, they handle links the same way I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815211629/http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News format&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. Great, it was a good idea, but it didn't happen that way, instead we use HTML. How could they believe that it will work this way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;Prior art&lt;/a&gt;. Please. Yes I like the user interface because it is so much like Twitter it's like comfort food. But that isn't enough. We liked a lot of things for a while, but then the limits will catch up. Again what we need is what's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec. &lt;b&gt;A social network that works for writers&lt;/b&gt;. I put that in bold because no one seems to be able to hear this. Okay back to life, I'm done with pissing in the wind for today. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Paraphrasing what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/&quot;&gt;Les Moonves&lt;/a&gt;, former CEO of CBS said about Trump in 2016. &quot;[Trump] may not be good for America, but [he's] damn good for CNN.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can raise the price of ads with Trump. That's obviously what CNN hopes to do. Trump, who has been deprecated by Fox, needs a mainstream outlet. There's no mystery why all the people in the town hall audience were Trump supporters, that obviously was a Trump condition. He probably chose the reporter, the questions, and came prepared to get talked about, which appears to be happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't see it, I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/10.html#a122516&quot;&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; when he was on.

			<description>I think we should work together to create a great library of Hello World apps for all social networks, regardless of our feelings about their value. Some people value Nostr, some like Bluesky. I know people who believe in Twitter. Why should our software care? I want to make all these systems equal in some way. It's a good time to be inclusive, imho. Hello World-level interop is a good place to start.</description>

Obviously I've known about it for years. There have been some really egregious outbursts, like the time I was invited to Mozilla to explain &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; from my point of view and it was an ambush. The source of the hate in some cases must be jealousy -- I guess they feel constrained by having jobs inside shit companies that they feel that limits their creativity. They must think what I do is easy, and if only they had the freedom to create whatever they want they could do what I do. I've seen that in action. I also write publicly and I try to be interesting in the way I write, partially because I write to amuse myself, but I also try hard not to make it personal. I don't mind telling Jack Dorsey, for example, to sit down, because he's a very public figure and his actions have big consequences. Just one example. I also feel free to say that I think the culture of Silicon Valley is poisonous. The rest of the world seems to have caught on to that idea. Or some people just don't like me as a person. But that's no excuse to behave awfully. I find that when I do something awful, I hurt myself more than the other person. I learned that a long time ago, so I try hard not to do it. I empathize with them a bit, they feel pain and try to give a little of it to me. Something like this just happened on Bluesky. A &quot;joke&quot; about exactly what I'm writing about here. I thought about responding to it on Bluesky, but instead blocked the troll and respond here instead. You should care about how you treat people, especially people who your peers have decided it's okay to hate on. You don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to behave badly. And if you do that's your choice, it's not something you can blame them for. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

A lot of immature people running wild. A frat-house atmosphere. And saying Mozilla is shitty is not much of a distinction, most if not all Silicon Valley companies are shitty. I think the underlying cause is that there are far too many programmers. If we had better (and fewer) platforms and tools then individuals could make their own software, they wouldn't have to work at companies. I'm certainly a test-case for that.

I finally found a way that works. Before starting, go to the old iPad, and in Settings, choose a command that prepares the iPad for the transfer by backing it up to iCloud (I don't remember what the command was, but they make it easy to find because they apparently remember you're trying to do this). The iCloud service is free for this purpose. Then wipe the new iPad and when it boots up, it'll offer an opportunity to use the iCloud backup. By choosing this, you remove the old iPad from the update. This is important because if it isn't involved, it can't time-out. Then let it update the OS (you don't have a choice) and once that's done, let it go ahead and use the iCloud backup. This means you have to stick around while it's updating the OS, a process that takes about 1/2 hour. The good news is, after that, it will do the transfer without any more interaction. I came back a few hours later and the new iPad was exactly like the old one. It remembers all your passwords, so you don't even have to enter them again. I think Apple could make this work better by writing some docs that tell you to do basically what I've said here, and save the users a lot of time, and since I already returned a new iPad because I couldn't get this to work, they would make real money from making this work better. I bought a &quot;renewed&quot; iPad which costs considerably less than a new one, and none of this money went to Apple. BTW, I think &quot;renewed&quot; in my case meant a new iPad in shrinkwrap, from a couple of years ago, that was never sold for some reason. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I think Apple could make this work better by writing some docs that tell you to do basically what I've said here, and save the users a lot of time, and since I already returned a new iPad because I couldn't get this to work, they would make real money from making this work better. I bought a &quot;renewed&quot; iPad which costs considerably less than a new one, and none of this money went to Apple. BTW, I think &quot;renewed&quot; in my case meant a new iPad in shrinkwrap, from a couple of years ago, that was never sold for some reason. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 11 May 2023 11:15:15 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/18/indianaJones.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/11.html#a111515"/>

			<description>I've been using Bluesky, it's more inviting to Twitter users than Mastodon. But most of that is cosmetics. The Mastoverse could be made easier. Factored. Facelift. I don't think it would necessarily be hard, but it might be politically controversial. Most important, there needs to be simple-to-use toolkits that support the common API between all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;A/Pub&lt;/a&gt; apps, so every developer doesn't have to reinvent the interface. API calls that look exactly like what the user does, create post, edit post, reply to post, view replies, get timeline, etc.</description>

It insists on installing a new version of the OS before proceeding. While that is happening the original iPad times out. When I try to restart the transfer, it hangs. Come back hours later, still hung. Then I tried to get the new machine to restore factory settings but it wouldn't accept my password, after a long wait. Tried it three or four times and thought maybe it needs wifi turned on to do this. It does. Okay now, with the new machine restored to factory settings, it has started the new OS install again. I started this at 7AM, now it's almost noon. I did do other stuff. My wifi is fast btw, so installing a new version here should be fast relative to other setups. But after all this time I don't believe I'm any closer to having the transfer of data even start. It's starting to look like reinstalling all the apps and data by hand would be faster. (Update: He's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/10/installNow.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of where the new iPad gets stuck. That little star thing is spinning. I tried clicking on &lt;i&gt;Install Now&lt;/i&gt; and nothing seems to happen. I'm just going to leave it there and come back in a couple of hours.)</description>

			<description>Podcasting is for places your eyes are doing other important things. Driving, walking, running, watching stuff. This is why YouTube is not a great place to serve podcasts from. The positioning is wrong. YouTube requires use of your eyes. I know it's not technically a requirement, rather it's a positioning thing.

I don't follow very many people there, and I don't know how I would do that quickly enough for it to color my impression. There's so much more on Twitter. As much as insiders are repelled by the new Twitter management, and I'm one of them, I think most people who use Twitter are far above that, to them it's just noise, and life goes on as always. There was a very interesting episode of Succession last night, and there are lots of good memes on Twitter. I haven't seen anything on Bluesky. But as quiet as Bluesky is, it makes Mastodon look even quieter. Ultimately we join these networks for companionship, it's a trip to the water cooler, or a walk around the block during a workday, or while watching a sports game. The new services have a steep hill to climb. The focus on technology has largely been a distraction in that context. What matters, as always, is not the tech -- but the people. And Twitter is still far ahead of the others, despite all the wishful thinking to the contrary.</description>

			<description>It's great to see people using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc&quot;&gt;JavaScript implementation&lt;/a&gt; of XML-RPC, released in 2019. There appears to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/issues/20&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with integer parsing in Java on Linux vs Windows. I'm ready to update the package if we can get to the bottom of what the issue is.</description>

			<description>I wish GitHub would let me write an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; renderer for them, so when it encounters a file with a .opml extension, it gets the HTML text from my driver. There's at least one OPML file in every one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories&quot;&gt;my repos&lt;/a&gt;, containing the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/source.opml&quot;&gt;project source&lt;/a&gt;. I edit all my code in an outliner. This is an art that should get exposure. It'm not exactly a nobody in software development, I've been developing this style for a long time. And tools to go with it. Anyway, back to work &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>One thing I don't like about Mastodon is that I get so many comments from people who feel superior to those who use other systems. It's always bullshit. Just like people who used Macs felt superior to Windows users. Just an example. The world likes to judge the quality of people based on superficial bullshit like that. If you reply to something I post saying you're superior because you use (whatever) I will think you're an asshole, so just skip it. I might even say it to you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Default is another word for run</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The US government is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1700s/1791_First_Bank/&quot;&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That means you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond#United_States&quot;&gt;deposit money&lt;/a&gt; with the government, and it will pay you interest.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A lot of people put their money in the government bank, even though it doesn't pay the highest interest, because unlike all other banks, it's thought to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Savings_Bonds#:~:text=They%20are%20considered%20one%20of,of%20the%20United%20States%20government.&quot;&gt;safest place to put money&lt;/a&gt;. When you want it back, to spend, or give to a relative or friend, or invest in stocks, the odds are nearly 100% that you will get the money.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why do people feel that way about the US government bank? Because it's one of the core values of the US. The first treasury secretary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/alexander-hamilton-debt-national-bank-two-parties-1789-american-history-great-courses-plus-180962954/&quot;&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, set it up this way. In all the years since 1776, through a civil war, depressions, two world wars, the United States has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; met its obligation to return money to lenders. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now sometimes terrible things happen, and a bank can't give money back to depositors. What happens then is: 1. There's a run on the bank by depositors and the bank fails. Depositors lose their money, or 2. Some larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposit, and the run stops, because confidence returns among creditors. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;larger institution&quot; often is the United States government, because it is the most solvent bank in the world for the simple reason that we are the only entity that can print money that will be accepted everywhere in the world. It's an incredible privilege to have. Imagine if you could buy anything you want just by writing a check. It wouldn't matter if you &quot;had&quot; the money, because you can print the money. It's as if the check itself were worth money. It's why all the comparisons to smaller countries like Greece are ridiculous. Greece can print money if they want to, but people will only accept dollars not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma&quot;&gt;drachmas&lt;/a&gt;. We can have anything we want and as much of it as we want and all we have to do is invent the money to pay for it! (Obviously if we abused this privilege in a way that seriously hurt the world economy there would be a problem, so we don't do that.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Okay, now suppose one day, just for the hell of it, the government decides to try defaulting, for some reason that's hard to fathom. Remember, we have the ability to pay the bills. It's as if you told Visa or MasterCard that you weren't paying your bill, but please don't ruin my credit rating because I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; pay, it's just that I don't want to. By defaulting I mean, a depositor goes to the bank and ask for their money, and the teller hands them a card that says &quot;Sorry no money for you.&quot; Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt; in Seinfeld. As a depositor you would be very angry and you'd tweet about it to tell everyone what happened, and they'd all go to the bank and demand their money, and voila, you have a run on the bank. That would probably be the first thing that happened after a default. Everyone who had money on deposit with the US government would demand it back so they could put it somewhere that wasn't managed by lunatics. But because we're defaulting we give everyone the &quot;No money for you&quot; card instead of their money. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What normally happens in a bank run, a larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposits, can't happen here because there is no institution larger than the US government. So what happens? No one knows. But it won't be good, that's for sure. We got a small taste of it in 2008 when a relatively small bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers&quot;&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, was over-extended, and a run resulted, and as a result other banks who had money in Lehman, couldn't get it, they started defaulting, and the economy of the &lt;i&gt;whole world&lt;/i&gt; froze. Shipping stopped. Airlines couldn't fly. It was a very scary time. The US government started writing checks, huge checks, and we just got through it by the skin of our teeth. But again, this time, it's the US government defaulting and no one can play that role in this meltdown.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If we're lucky, and people believe they can trust China or the European Union, they might write off the assets they have stored in the US, and never use our bank as the safest place to store value, because we all lost so much in the run that followed the default. We'd start storing value in Chinese or European currency. And the US would become an ordinary country, with no special ability to print money that everyone accepts. It won't be a recession in the US, instead we will see an invisible support for our economy disappear in an instant. Some of it already disappeared, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades#Background&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; we flirted with default. But if we actually default, the US economy will become much less potent. We no longer will have the ability to print money to pay our bills. Now some people will tell you that's a good thing, but they're the worst kind of idiot. It's like saying it's better to be homeless because you don't have to pay rent. We won't have an idea how our lives are elevated by this privilege until we lose it. It's been there for our whole lives. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/07/soupNaziSeinfeld.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soup_Nazi&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt; in Seinfeld. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are some inaccuracies here. I am not an economist. But I think I do correctly understand the big picture. We learned a lot about it in 2008 and after. This isn't something you want to screw around with, but that's what we're doing anyway. It's even more insane than what the British did in Brexit, and that's hard to do! So let's not do it. Call your Congressperson, especially if they're Republican, and let them know you understand what they're doing and you will work tirelessly against their re-election if they don't withdraw their support, immediately, for default. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

It's as if you told Visa or MasterCard that you weren't paying your bill, but please don't ruin my credit rating because I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; pay, it's just that I don't want to. By defaulting I mean, a depositor goes to the bank and ask for their money, and the teller hands them a card that says &quot;Sorry no money for you.&quot; Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt; in Seinfeld. As a depositor you would be very angry and you'd tweet about it to tell everyone what happened, and they'd all go to the bank and demand their money, and voila, you have a run on the bank. That would probably be the first thing that happened after a default. Everyone who had money on deposit with the US government would demand it back so they could put it somewhere that wasn't managed by lunatics. But because we're defaulting we give everyone the &quot;No money for you&quot; card instead of their money." created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:23:28 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/07/121635.html#a122328"/>
					<source:outline text="What normally happens in a bank run, a larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposits, can't happen here because there is no institution larger than the US government. So what happens? No one knows. But it won't be good, that's for sure. We got a small taste of it in 2008 when a relatively small bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers&quot;&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, was over-extended, and a run resulted, and as a result other banks who had money in Lehman, couldn't get it, they started defaulting, and the economy of the &lt;i&gt;whole world&lt;/i&gt; froze. Shipping stopped. Airlines couldn't fly. It was a very scary time. The US government started writing checks, huge checks, and we just got through it by the skin of our teeth. But again, this time, it's the US government defaulting and no one can play that role in this meltdown." created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:27:52 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/07/121635.html#a122752"/>
					<source:outline text="If we're lucky, and people believe they can trust China or the European Union, they might write off the assets they have stored in the US, and never use our bank as the safest place to store value, because we all lost so much in the run that followed the default. We'd start storing value in Chinese or European currency. And the US would become an ordinary country, with no special ability to print money that everyone accepts. It won't be a recession in the US, instead we will see an invisible support for our economy disappear in an instant. Some of it already disappeared, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades#Background&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; we flirted with default. But if we actually default, the US economy will become much less potent. We no longer will have the ability to print money to pay our bills. Now some people will tell you that's a good thing, but they're the worst kind of idiot. It's like saying it's better to be homeless because you don't have to pay rent. We won't have an idea how our lives are elevated by this privilege until we lose it. It's been there for our whole lives." created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:32:06 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/07/121635.html#a123206"/>

Nor does mine. Here's why I think that. Most of my relatives had strong opinions and stated them often and did not welcome dissent. My father and mother. Both grandfathers. My maternal grandmother. Uncle Ken. They all had opinions about everything. Sometimes they even changed their minds, to their credit. And one hid something about himself that I learned later from Wikipedia (amazingly my maternal grandfather was a communist, still not sure I believe it, Wikipedia is often full of misinfo). Anyway the point is that all the people I listed are now dead. If anyone cared about their opinions when they were alive (I don't think anyone did) they certainly don't care about them now. Soon enough you and I will be dead. So go ahead and have the opinions if it makes you happy. But if it makes you miserable, as it often did for my relatives, consider not bothering because simply does not matter. And the stupid thing is we've built our networks around the idea that opinions matter. Think of all the wasted bandwidth and server space. Maybe it'd be better if the AI bots win. At least they don't repeat themselves all the time with complaints about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti&quot;&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt; and whatnot. BTW I loved all the people I listed above even if I didn't enjoy their opinions very much.</description>

			<title>Ideas for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If I were in trying-to-work-with-Twitter mode, I would suggest...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Along with the monthly fee, add a certain number of API calls to every user who pays. Then devs could make products for them, without having to pay Twitter. Make the thing self-funding so individuals could play not just corporations. Twitter is more of an end-user thing than a corporate thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For  $1 more per month, include some JSON storage for the user, accessible to the apps they grant access to, thus moving into an area AWS should be in but refuses to go. Storage that goes with identity for people not just techies. A retail-ized version of Amazon S3. It will be an &lt;i&gt;enormous&lt;/i&gt; business. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'd comp devs who make software, and give them a special icon so people know to ask them for features. Incentives. Think like a businessperson not a school marm. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You want to really clean up?  Co-promote the developer products and share revenue. It doesn't cost much to buy developer love.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: As a free addon for users, give each paying user an RSS feed, a good one. I will help you do this really well, no charge.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The mother of all bank runs</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Defaulting on the national debt will be like the crash of Lehman Brothers in 2008, only a lot worse, because we were able to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/06/prowess-definition.html&quot;&gt;prowess&lt;/a&gt; of the US dollar to prop up the banking system when Lehman fell. There's nothing that can prop up the dollar that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is not about the economy being strong or weak. It's about whether we have an economy at all. Not just the US but the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Emphatically: There is no economy without the dollar playing that role. it's not a matter of weak or strong, it's about the &lt;i&gt;existence&lt;/i&gt; of an economy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of economics that's more like physics.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let me put a different way. If it weren't for the US government bailout that barely worked little old Lehman Brothers would have crashed us into a new global dark ages. That's what they meant by &quot;too big to fail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The US is a big fucking bank. If it crashes there's no one to bail it out. Welcome to your future, no health care, transport, food, electricity, no TV or internet. Everyone for themself. Not a recession. A collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; that the Repubs are hellbent to crash us into a new dark age, it's that the people are so uneducated, and that includes journalists, that they don't get that this is what's at stake or they don't want to say it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be the mother of all bank runs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/06/us-gov-default-impact.html&quot;&gt;write about this&lt;/a&gt;. I agree with what it said. &quot;It is estimated that about two-thirds of the US national debt is held by US citizens and institutions.&quot; So if we default, I guess, that's who we're ripping off, though the Repubs never talk about that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
