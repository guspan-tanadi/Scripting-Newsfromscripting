			<description>Bingeing report. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/band-of-brothers&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt; all the way through. It's good, but I had forgotten how bloody it is. Since I was in that mode, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-2022&quot;&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix. Same idea, with 2020's production, a different war, and from the other side. I think the next thing will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/they-shall-not-grow-old&quot;&gt;They Shall Not Grow Old&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I think an AI could have plotted this path for me.</description>

			<title>FeedLand roadmap</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of new stuff here and I don't go into great detail. There is a link to a place to comment or ask questions at the &lt;a href=&quot;#a161849&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;FeedLand is a feed management system for individuals and groups. So far it's only been offered as a free service on the web. This roadmap explains how that will change.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The next version will by default &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; use Twitter for identity. When you sign up you'll specify both a name and an email address. Both must be unique. An email confirms. Click the link and you're sent back with the credentials your browser needs to access your account. The usual dance. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I do not plan to transition &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;feedland.org&lt;/a&gt; to work this way. Recall that we haven't been accepting new members since December 12. Everyone who uses it has a Twitter identity and it's working, and I don't want to screw with that. As long as Twitter is willing to let us use their identity service, we'll keep using it on this server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the big news: The new FeedLand server software will be available as open source, so anyone will be able to run a FeedLand instance. It's a Node.js application. Uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to hook up an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; bucket for special features like RSS feeds for Likes. At first email sending will be via &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ses/&quot;&gt;Amazon SES&lt;/a&gt;, the method I currently use. It will be possible to plug in new drivers to use other email services. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The open source model is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/license/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; which uses GPLv2. I want to make it as easy to set up a FeedLand instance as it is to start a new WordPress server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People can set up commercial services to host FeedLand for individuals and groups. Every instance is set up to do that. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's efficient software. I'm spending about $25 a month to host feedland.org for almost 1000 users. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The client, which runs in the browser, will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be open source. I don't want to spawn a bunch of incompatible forks. I want FeedLand and its API to be solid. By maintaining control of the client, which btw need not be the only client, I can help be sure that we're starting a developer community with some basic rules about interop. If you want to run FeedLand it has to behave like FeedLand. I've been down this road and watched others go down this road. I think this is the right way to start. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Typical use-cases: A university department maintaining a FeedLand server to gather new writing from other departments at other universities on topics of interest.  Workgroups at companies. It would make a lot of sense for a news org to offer a FeedLand service to readers and their internal news writing staff. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't have dates for any of this. But at this point the path is pretty certain, so I felt it was time to say where FeedLand is going. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Friday I posted an earlier version of this roadmap on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;FeedLand support&lt;/a&gt; repo. I'm sure there will be other changes to this document as we go forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have comments or suggestions, you can post them as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/166&quot;&gt;comments to Friday's post&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>I don't use WordPress very much, but recently I had a chance to try out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/&quot;&gt;block editor&lt;/a&gt; and my reaction was that I can't imagine writing this way. If you're a writer who uses WordPress, do you use the block editor, if so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1614261301466865664&quot;&gt;what do you think&lt;/a&gt; of it?</description>

It's worth another listen because he's explaining why news is like it is, from the point of view of someone who was an insider for years.</description>

			<title>Defaulting, explained simply</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who can understand the rules of baseball or football, who can play poker or Monopoly, can understand the rules of defaulting.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the US were to default the same thing would happen to the US that happens to a person if they fail to make a payment on a loan. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Foreclosure, the lender seizes assets to cover the default.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Your credit rating goes down and cost of borrowing goes up. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today, before default, the US defines what money is. If we create a dollar that's worth a dollar. No other country has this power.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world lets us do this for them because a dollar is considered the safest way to store value. That's why the US dollar is the world's dominant &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar&quot;&gt;reserve currency. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However if we default, there goes the safety. It's gone, and that kind of trust, built over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/alexander-hamilton-debt-national-bank-two-parties-1789-american-history-great-courses-plus-180962954/&quot;&gt;hundreds of years&lt;/a&gt;, once lost will never come back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then we really will be as poor as the oligarchs want us to think we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, why are the oligarchs who own all our sources of news, willing to let a default actually happen? I think it's a good chance it's due to inbreeding, narcissism, stupidity, selfishness and resentment. They don't believe they will suffer personally if the US turns into an economic basket case. Maybe they won't. For sure, that's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; they care about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep waiting for a news article that doesn’t gloss over the real impact of defaulting. If news were run like journalism this would be the horserace of the millenium. A story with a billion angles. We'd all tune in every night to hear how bad it'll be. But they clearly aren't interested in that. They're interested in keeping their jobs. That probably also explains why we're not responding to the climate crisis or the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The theory they had was that it had something to do with the reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/third-party-twitter-apps-tweetbot-twitterrific-echofon-down/&quot;&gt;outage&lt;/a&gt; at Twitter. Only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tangentially&quot;&gt;tangentially&lt;/a&gt;. The cause was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; item &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/13/nolink.png&quot;&gt;without a link&lt;/a&gt;.

So the software lost its mind and went boom. Easy to find, the error message and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace&quot;&gt;stack crawl&lt;/a&gt; were the last thing in the log. Adding a protection against such a situation was also easy. This is how software gets mature. Sooner or later every weird case shows up and hopefully it will be patched well and documented, so next time it happens the email goes out as it's supposed to. This is all part of the &quot;It's even worse than it appears&quot; philosophy of Scripting News. And, how was this related &lt;i&gt;tangentially&lt;/i&gt; to the outage at Twitter?

			<title>Medium gets Mastoicized</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was smart for &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/medium-embraces-twitter-alternative-mastodon-with-launch-of-its-own-community/&quot;&gt;Medium to embrace Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It gets people talking about Medium again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What comes next? Setting up a Masto-instance is easy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Will Substack, who stole Medium's thunder, be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=substack+mastodon&quot;&gt;next&lt;/a&gt; to embrace Mastoicism?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Mastodon will become WordPress? Just support Markdown and get rid of the character limit and Masto is almost there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time every day using Mastodon and use WordPress only when i'm testing for compatibility with WordPress. Mastodon is much closer to what I think a centralized blogging host should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I keep wondering how this will evolve. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I'm working every day on &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. Quietly. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be a very hard job I imagine to make Medium an ActivityPub node. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure ActivityPub gets you all that much, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm still betting heavy on RSS, just enough syndication.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some random end-of-day thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Let RSS be RSS</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: RSS is how we move documents around the web. That it works so poorly is because the big social media companies want it that way. We need products and services with big installed bases to serve as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterweight&quot;&gt;counterweights&lt;/a&gt; and help pull RSS out of corp-tech control.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How I got there...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/11.html#a175023&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; something provocative about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;HiMY SYeD read it, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@HiMYSYeD@mstdn.ca/109662819679711900&quot;&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt;, on Mastodon: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What Mastodon is to ActivityPub...&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;WordPress is to RSS.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first response was:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Interesting analogy.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Something to think about.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After pondering a bit...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There are other products that could claim ownership of RSS -- like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Google+Reader%22&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which still controls the market almost 10 years after its demise.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And Twitter, by &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; supporting RSS is also a big definer of RSS, in a negative way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I think we'll be on solid ground once RSS defines itself and the products get out of the way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I think that's the key point&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS has never had a chance to be itself. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Right from the start, all kinds of people and companies sought to own it. No one succeeded at that, but each of them diluted it, added confusion, took some of its power away and gave back nothing in return. Very typical approach of tech to open tech they didn't create. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until we can get RSS leading, as itself, and not being carved up and controlled, we won't really have a good way of moving documents around the web, which is what RSS is for, btw, imho. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All the usual disclaimers apply.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I hope people at WordPress read this. Right now they're in the best position to help RSS if they're inclined to do so. There aren't many companies I would credit with possibly wanting to do that. Slack was one, and Automattic is another. I still have to write the howto doc for what it would take for that to happen, subject to discussion of course. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>My new old Mac laptop</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got my 2015 MacBook Pro. Two problems to start.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It came with Mojave installed. I got this machine because the software I want to use specifically does not run on Mojave. I didn't realize this until after I had copied a huge number of files to the machine via Time Machine backup. I will have to do this again.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Today they're selling the same $600 machine &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/12/pricechange.png&quot;&gt;on Amazon for $389&lt;/a&gt;. I wish I had an idea what the price range was. I could have waited a few days. I thought $600 was a good deal, but it's a ripoff.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so I thought this morning I'll just copy a High Sierra installer to the hard drive and run it, but Mojave won't run it. The app is there, but it's grayed out. Who knows why. Presumably it won't run on this machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Next up I went into Recovery mode to install the OS that's in ROM, it was El Capitan. As the machine is rebooting after install it freezes with a totally cryptic error message. Here's a photo.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/12/appleErrorMessage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;A not very encouraging error message from my new MacBook.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After restarting, the message is gone. I found I couldn't restore from a Time Machine backup because it comes from a machine more advanced than El Capitan. So I then did the minimum to get the machine to boot up, went into the System Preferences app, turned on file sharing and copied an install app for High Sierra. It's running it now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Update: After a lot more bullshit work, I think I'm pretty close to having the laptop working the way I need it to. If so, I will be able to travel and still keep up with my development projects. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>WordPress is in the way. I've avoided saying this because I like Matt, but at some point, it being in the way has to win out. And since when do I not say something because I like the person who made it. It's in the way. I would like to see it move out of the way. I will write a piece soon explaining how they could, and should, do that.</description>

			<description>Even though I have far fewer followers on Masto, I get much more engagement there than on Twitter. Has it been productive? Hmmm, not sure about that. But I have hope that it will result in collaboration.</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin&quot;&gt;Banshees&lt;/a&gt; movie is supposed to be a comedy of sorts but it was so painful to watch, not much room for laughter. And I guess I didn't really watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans&quot;&gt;Fableman&lt;/a&gt; movie, walked out after the opening scene. Spielberg's movies have declined into self-obsession. He thinks we're so freaking stupid and he's so freaking wonderful. Come on man do another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)&quot;&gt;Jaws&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was a movie. One thing I got from Banshees is that the Irish say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feck&quot;&gt;fecking&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder if it means what I think it means. Anyway, I'm looking for something great to watch, and have fallen back to re-watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. It's been so long since I last watched it that it seems pretty fresh. I long for that kind of story-telling, but they don't seem to make shows like that these days.</description>

			<title>How you know you're gaslighting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; when you tell another person how they feel about something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I see myself doing that, I hit the brakes hard, and go for a walk and think about it. And over time I've trained myself not to believe I know how other people are feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Esp people who I only know from reading their emails or blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Programming is rough when you were prepared to work on hooking up the sound system in the penthouse on the 173rd floor, and instead you have to work in the basement where the boiler is spewing all kinds of crap, but you're not clear if it was always doing this and you're just seeing it now because now you're listening.</description>

			<description>In my first job out of college I was in a similar situation and I thought to myself they shouldn't put programmers in offices on the 39th floor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building&quot;&gt;Empire State Building&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigapplewindowcleaning.com/this-is-how-the-empire-state-buildings-windows-were-once-cleaned/&quot;&gt;windows&lt;/a&gt; that open. I found that thought both disturbing and comforting. I guess I figured out the problem, because I'm still here 47 years later. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Likes considered harmful?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrodivergent.com/2023/01/07/the-problem-with.html&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; about whether Likes are harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of my observations from the thread, all in favor of Likes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Like button on various systems is a way of acknowledging that you saw something and thought it was noteworthy. Since micro.blog doesn't have a Like button, what's the proper way of saying that? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a person who writes posts that get zero response here (and not on other systems) I wish people had a less-committed way of saying they saw something I wrote. That would be a little bit of feedback where currently I get none.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I see something on Micro.blog that I would Like on another system, I don't comment, I just do nothing, not because I'm bashful or overly quiet, rather because this is a language, and a comment has different meaning from a Like. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In real life there's all kinds of non-verbal communication. you can nod your head, smile. We've come up with a similar language online, I don't think there's any more meaning in this. We're being human. Not a huge surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a parallel. My TV doesn't have a brightness control. It's an expensive screen, and I imagine that the designers of the system figured &quot;we have a computer in this that knows how to automatically adjust brightness based on room light.&quot; But it doesn't work properly, I don't know what the problem is, but there are times the TV is useless because you just can't see what's on the screen, because the lack of a brightness control. Maybe if TVs never had brightness controls I wouldn't miss it, but they do in my mind, require one. Same thing here. &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; is something that's part of the language of social media. To try to deny that at this stage is kind of pointless imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been in this position myself in the past, trying to buck a larger trend, and the pressure really does get you to support the common way, the sooner you do it, the sooner the pain goes away. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &quot;considered harmful&quot; is borrowed from a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra&quot;&gt;Edsger Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;goto statement considered harmful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I need it because I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of my development process, all my build scripts run in Frontier, and while they could be converted to JavaScript, they'd be more complicated and it's a lot of work, and it's worth spending $600 to save all that work. Someday I want to do it because I'd like to use Drummer and its built-in scripting language for the same purpose. I learned a lot about why people choose older Macs. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(company)#Sale_to_CBS&quot;&gt;pre-CBS&lt;/a&gt; Fender guitars, which still sell at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Pre-cbs%20Fender%20Guitars&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-153677-346401-4&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=102&amp;keyword=&amp;crlp=632052376936_&amp;MT_ID=&amp;geo_id=&amp;rlsatarget=dsa-1456167871416&amp;adpos=&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=&amp;loc=1023511&amp;poi=&amp;abcId=&amp;cmpgn=18786426719&amp;sitelnk=&amp;adgroupid=144636292002&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr403s3aqhTbcuAgTH_yfHqEEFmps2tzdZFrHidJRllPpY8VuLIH0mcYRoCf2IQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt;, even though Fender sold to CBS in 1965. Maybe Macs peaked? Anyway -- I should get the &quot;new&quot; computer next week, and I'll let you know how it goes.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/246&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I've got a problem with an app that uses the MySql package in Node running on a Mac. I'm getting a &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17px&quot;&gt;ER_CON_COUNT_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; pretty close to startup. I'm taking the message at face value but it's hard for me to believe it's true that my app is making too many connections because I just doubled the max connections from 100 to 200 and still got the error on the very first query it tried to make. The problem goes away when I reboot the machine, but only for a little while, eventually it starts doing this again. This is in an app that has been running without these kinds of errors for months. I haven't tried running the app yet on another machine, but I'm beginning to think this is a not-resolvable issue. I thought I'd pass it by the SQL gurus that read this blog on how to debug this.</description>

Excellent brand advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And one taught me something I won't forget.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/11/13/onlineAdvertisingIsNowDead.html&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;: Perfectly targeted advertising is just information.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Winning Time</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Time:_The_Rise_of_the_Lakers_Dynasty&quot;&gt;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Almost finished with the ten episodes of Season 1 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/winning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty&quot;&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like it for a bunch of reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly&quot;&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt; who plays &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Buss&quot;&gt;Jerry Buss&lt;/a&gt; the new owner of the Lakers when the season starts. He also btw is really good at audiobooks. I'd listen to any book he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=John+C.+Reilly&quot;&gt;narrates&lt;/a&gt;. He's Mr Affability. And perfectly cast for the role of Buss.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like the style, it's a little weird at first, but it's clever, and they break the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall&quot;&gt;fourth wall&lt;/a&gt; a few times, to good effect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that the style reminds me of one of my favorite movies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rFx6OFooCs&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, also a sports movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like sports movies/shows. And I especially like basketball. It's my favorite sport.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like the story how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley&quot;&gt;Pat Reilly&lt;/a&gt; became the coach of the Lakers and led them to dynasty. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like how Kareem became friends with Magic. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that the guy who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Haywood&quot;&gt;Spencer Haywood&lt;/a&gt; is the same actor who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_Barksdale&quot;&gt;Avon Barksdale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Field&quot;&gt;Sally Field&lt;/a&gt; plays Jerry Buss's mother! She's awesome as always.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like all the actors and roles. That's unusual. With such a huge cast you'd think there would be one impossible to watch character, but no, they're all interesting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that they will have lots of potential seasons, next up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson&quot;&gt;Phil Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and how he became the next dynastic coach of the Lakers. And don't forget &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant&quot;&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal&quot;&gt;Shaq&lt;/a&gt; who probably won't show up until Season 3 or 4. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave it the highest rating &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fwinning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty&quot;&gt;on Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. It didn't get great reviews. When I finish it, I'll read some of them to see what I missed. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
