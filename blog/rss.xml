			<title>A feed reading breakthrough</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The feed list page in FeedLand is also a feed reader.  A new kind. All the feeds you're subscribed to are listed in reverse chronologic order. Click the wedge next to any feed to see the five most recent items in the feed. Each time you expand an item it gets the latest stuff. I never anticipated people using this as their only interface to FeedLand, but it works. So I'm thinking about ways to improve it. That's why it's good to have users. You never know what kinds of patterns will develop. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/feedlistExpanded.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/feedlistExpanded.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of my feed list showing the stories from the BBC expanded. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU9yE_axytQ&quot;&gt; a video demo&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Our feed peering service</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Built into &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; is a way to move updates to feeds efficiently and quickly. We use the protocol that's built into RSS 2.0 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. I'm finding out that more people are supporting the protocol than I thought. Last time I checked all WordPress sites support it for example. micro.blog supports it. Since I'm spending more time there these days that was a nice surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I'm describing here are the feeds that users write in FeedLand, not the ones that FeedLand gets from reading feeds. This is a very new feature, here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/13/yourFeed.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;These are feeds that emanate &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; of FeedLand. When I write about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/12/170955.html?title=twowayRss&quot;&gt;Two-way RSS&lt;/a&gt; -- I'm talking about FeedLand and hopefully many other writing products. I'm trying to show people how to do this, and why you would want to. If you make a feed reader you might want to include a simple feed writer.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; that's in the screen shot, above. You literally are editing a feed. Any feed reader can subscribe to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it has some extra features that you can use, notably -- the text is provided both as HTML in the description element, and in Markdown in the source:markdown element. The intention here is to seed the use of markdown in feeds, something I was writing about in the summer, when I was developing this feed editor. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to provide a websocket-based service for apps to hook into, to not only get new items in this format, but also updated items. I think since we're starting fresh on federation let's have realtime updating built in from the start. And Markdown support. All the while producing an RSS feed that all feed-reading software understands. No breakage. But a way to move forward. Back when RSS 2.0 was first specified in 2002, there was no Markdown. If there had been we would have built on it as we did with MP3 for podcasting. And while we're at it -- there's OPML in there so tools for thought integrate beautifully with RSS. (I haven't forgotten about OPML.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So this is a heads-up. Not sure exactly what form this service will be in. But it will really be simple, that's for sure. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What I really want from AI is for it to sort all my writing into an index, like the index in the back of a book.  i've got 28 years of writing on my site, and there are definitely threads running through it, but i have never been able to visualize those threads. I want the AI to do an editorial job that would be insurmountable for a human. I know I've tried at times to work with editors on that, and they see the scope of it and just give up. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; btw -- if you have an AI and would like to try it out.</description>

			<description>There are a couple of new features in FeedLand, &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/changenotes/2022/11/11/205211.html?title=newButtonsOnNewsItems&quot;&gt;documented here&lt;/a&gt;. With the first, the Document icon on each news item (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/11/twoNewIconsScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;), you can now link to individual items from a news page on FeedLand, and can of course share that link with others. They will not need to log in. I realized we needed this the other day when I wanted to point to an episode of a podcast, not the podcast feed. We didn't have that ability, now we do. And, a bonus is that we can point to long-form feed items in a comfortable to read format instead of in the middle of all the other items. I found this very useful reading stuff this morning on my iPad. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?item=427416&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a story from The Atlantic. And an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?item=435534&quot;&gt;untitled post&lt;/a&gt; from today's Scripting News. I have to say, I feel so much more powerful now that I can improve my reading environment so easily.</description>

With the first, the Document icon on each news item (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/11/twoNewIconsScreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;), you can now link to individual items from a news page on FeedLand, and can of course share that link with others. They will not need to log in. I realized we needed this the other day when I wanted to point to an episode of a podcast, not the podcast feed. We didn't have that ability, now we do. And, a bonus is that we can point to long-form feed items in a comfortable to read format instead of in the middle of all the other items. I found this very useful reading stuff this morning on my iPad. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?item=427416&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a story from The Atlantic. And an &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?item=435534&quot;&gt;untitled post&lt;/a&gt; from today's Scripting News. I have to say, I feel so much more powerful now that I can improve my reading environment so easily." created="Sat, 12 Nov 2022 14:31:38 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/11/12.html#a143138"/>

			<description>Why we need Twitter. Elon Musk &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591313397362352130&quot;&gt;nails it&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter.&quot; Exactly. If we depended on professional journalists for this story they;'d be so confused all that we'd hear is mush. But the insiders are on Twitter, and the story that's coming out at least has some truth behind it. Journalism always tells the same bullshit story. (Which varies a little from time to time, the only consistent thread is how much you, little person, depend on us for all the truth we think you can handle, limited by our pathetic understanding of the facts.)</description>

			<description>ActivityPub and RSS have to come together. It should be possible for a site that produces RSS feeds for each user to peer with a site that uses ActivityPub in the same way. They should have started with RSS, imho, and added whatever they needed via a namespace. I said this in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109329535083378801&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, and was pleasantly suprised by the collegial response. So hopefully you all understand that when I'm saying things like &quot;I need to get my linkblogging tool hooked up to Mastodon,&quot; I've taken part of the problem and put it in simple terms. The goal in coming up with open formats and protocols is to maximize interop. Now we have to go back, and if possible, build a bridge between RSS and ActivityPub.</description>

			<title>Journalism is botching the blue checkmark story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of facts:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have had a blue checkmark for years.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Last year I could have changed the name on the account to anything I want.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's new is that anyone can buy a blue checkmark and do this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you think people who they gave blue checkmarks to are inherently less prank-oriented than the new ones, that's your story. But what journos are reporting as news is not in fact news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Today I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden items in a new kind of feed were getting link elements when there were no item-level link elements in the feeds. Okay so I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/reference-entry-link.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what I'm dealing with. My workaround which is ugly, is to consider the link element on an item to be a ghost (ie ignore it) if it has the same value as the guid element. It's bullshit. Nothing in the design of RSS allows me to infer this. But that's what happens with egregious hacks. To live with them you have to do more egregious hacks. And that's why, my friends, code never is done. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md#111122-by-dw&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; the problem.</description>

			<title>Feed writing in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A big new &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; feature today -- it's now two-way.

Any FeedLand user can have a feed. You of course must be logged-in to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Ffeeds%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;where my feed is&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's very simply an RSS 2.0 feed, public -- which you or anyone else can subscribe to in any app that can read an RSS feed. That includes feed readers like Feedly and NetNewsWire, but it also, innovatively, can included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, a system created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/&quot;&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/a&gt;, in place of a blog I write there. To someone reading my feed on micro.blog, because I have included my FeedLand feed, it appears as if I wrote the post there, not over here. And why shouldn't it work that way. This is an example of what I call &lt;i&gt;Two-way RSS.&lt;/i&gt; It's common for blogging systems to support outbound RSS, where what I post there is available outside the blogging system, but it's mind-blowingly powerful if it goes the other way. Very few non-feed reader reading systems support inbound RSS, but imho if they would, web writing would be revolutionized. All kinds of ad hoc connections would be possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Two systems I'd like to support this idea are:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Substack -- then I could use any writing tool that produces RSS as output to write essays that then could be received via email. CLearly they already have the technology to do this because they have a feed reader that can subscribe to sources outside of Substack. It's one simple step (imho) to let authors write using their own favorite tools rather than Substack's writing tool, which is nice, but I like the writing environment I already have, as do many other writers. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon -- if they did, any app that produced an RSS feed could peer. The Fediverse would then extend futher than it can with ActivityPub because RSS is so widely supported, and easy to implement. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will of course have more to say about this new direction for feeds on the web including a chance to reboot with a safer way to write HTML alsk known as Markdown, another drum I've been beating fairly regularly, lately. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/125&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; where, a couple of days ago, I introduced this feature to the inner circle of FeedLand users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Ideas for Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started thinking and the ideas kept pouring out. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Re the blue checkmarks, leave them alone. Make a very clear statement and stick to it. Blue checkmarks are Twitter Classic.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let's come up with some more colors -- silver, gold and black (to correspond to different levels of credit cards perhaps).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyone can buy a silver checkmark. It means that other people, with a single click, or by hovering over their tag, can find out their real name and whatever other verifiable info the user wants to share publicly. The info comes from the credit card company.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;With gold, you get more services and they cost more. Twitter will make introductions to other members who might share interests with you. With this Twitter could get into the businesses of match.com or linkedin.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Black is reserved for Friends Of Elon, whatever that means. People who hang out and smoke weed or travel on Twitter Tours. The kind of perks credit card companies offer. Hey you could even partner with Amex or whatever. Good deals on a Model Y or Starlink. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hey here's another idea. There must be a pool of good names that have been abandoned years ago. Those might be worth money. I'd like to buy a few if they're for sale. Or buy a TLD, maybe .twtr and allow their twitter names to be portable in some sense as afforded by DNS's flexibility. Thinking out loud here.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;BTW, while I have your attention I used to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyt&quot;&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;, and the NYT didn't mind. It goes back to the beginning of Twitter and NYT support for RSS. I'd pump links to NYT articles through this Twitter account. Never got an explanation why it was suspended. If you like the ideas can you ask them to let me use that account again? It was fun. Free advertising for the paper of record. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

When I change the title of a story the guid in the RSS feed for the site changes, so if you're reading me in a feed reader, you'll see the story again with its new title. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog#v0723----11722-by-dw&quot;&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; for the bug, just haven't deployed it here yet. And my apologies.

You have to actually try to buy an ad on Twitter to get it. Their ad system is designed for professional advertisers. They start right off with terminology that no normal person understands. All I know is the one time I considered promoting a tweet, just to see if it worked, I ended up backing out after the first or second question. Instead, they could make it &lt;i&gt;easy. &lt;/i&gt;Ask for a credit card (assuming they don't already have it from some other purchase). Then ask which tweet the user wants to promote (unless they came there by clicking the &quot;promote this tweet button&quot; on the tweet they want to promote). Then ask how much they want to spend (suggest an amount, &quot;most people spend $18 the first time they promote a tweet&quot; for example). Click Submit and off you go. And please follow up with the user by email. Make sure they know how many impressions they got. And you might as well offer a money-back guarantee for the first few tweets. After all the whole thing cost Twitter exactly nothing. And make sure people get their money's worth. It'll be like gambling, fun at first, then addictive. And the money will just roll in. And you can forget about bullshit like paywalls and membership fees. That's nickel and dime stuff. Here we're talking about Google-like money! And with some of the profits you can afford to pay people who produce sticky content that keeps people coming back. You have all the stars, make sure they feel appreciated (something Twitter is doing very badly now, really always have).</description>

			<description>Quick update on my eyes. A week ago last Friday I had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/28.html#a133050&quot;&gt;stop wearing a contact lens&lt;/a&gt; in my right eye so it could be measured for surgery I'm having late this month. The contact lens interferes with the measuring. I was very apprehensive about this, but it worked out rather well. I do see double in some situations, and depth perception is a problem that I have to always be conscious of, but driving is not a problem as I feared it would be, because all the distances there are far, and there's no problem with depth perception. A couple of days ago a wild turkey walked into my path and I was absolutely sure I was going to hit him, but swerved adeptly in an instant, and he took off at the same moment, and the turkey lived and I was impressed that my eyes and brain were able to work well together. But I do notice how small all the type is on the computer and how, if there are ways to make it more accessible, I sure don't know where they are. So I feel my way around while typing, and I'm sure I leave typos in there. This Friday I go for the measurement and then I can (I think) resume wearing the contact lens. But I kind of like not having to put it in and take it out every day. Maybe I'll stick with this approach.</description>

A week ago last Friday I had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/28.html#a133050&quot;&gt;stop wearing a contact lens&lt;/a&gt; in my right eye so it could be measured for surgery I'm having late this month. The contact lens interferes with the measuring. I was very apprehensive about this, but it worked out rather well. I do see double in some situations, and depth perception is a problem that I have to always be conscious of, but driving is not a problem as I feared it would be, because all the distances there are far, and there's no problem with depth perception. A couple of days ago a wild turkey walked into my path and I was absolutely sure I was going to hit him, but swerved adeptly in an instant, and he took off at the same moment, and the turkey lived and I was impressed that my eyes and brain were able to work well together. But I do notice how small all the type is on the computer and how, if there are ways to make it more accessible, I sure don't know where they are. So I feel my way around while typing, and I'm sure I leave typos in there. This Friday I go for the measurement and then I can (I think) resume wearing the contact lens. But I kind of like not having to put it in and take it out every day. Maybe I'll stick with this approach." created="Tue, 08 Nov 2022 13:16:41 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/11/08.html#a131641"/>

			<title>Twitter is mostly bullshit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't get anything from being in a club with journos. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't get anything from reading bullshit press releases from politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or people who make their rep by competing to be the biggest asshole on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My art is creating new media. I want to hang out with similarly minded people and people who want to use new media and help build it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We got stuck in a rut in Twitter for 16 years. Maybe 5 of those years were spent exploring new ideas.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1589246937685200896&quot;&gt;Podtrust query&lt;/a&gt;. I have both an iPhone and an Android phone. I like to listen to podcasts of course. I drive in areas w/o cell coverage. I need a podcast app that doesn't stream the MP3s, rather it downloads the MP3 and plays it straight through. So far all of them stream.</description>

That could be a big deal. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#basic-droplets&quot;&gt;price sheet&lt;/a&gt; for virtual machines at Digital Ocean. Never mind what all the numbers mean, look in the far right column and see how much one machine costs. $4 a month for the cheapest. It's pretty capable. You could host a service for a hundred people on one of those.</description>
