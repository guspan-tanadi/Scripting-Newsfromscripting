His ads are sooo good. The ads of course were written by the BCS writers. We need those kinds of ads to save America.</description>

			<title>What This Means To You</title>

Journalism could have said that despite what the candidate is saying this is what Repubs do when they gain control of a state government, esp one in the South. So when you vote for the Republican, no matter how you feel about Critical Race Theory, he's doing to do X, Y and Z which are things that most Americans find hideous. And btw, the Democrats could do that too. They are awfully nice to their Republican friends. And the result is we're doomed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When Trump was first running in 2016, only &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/01/173412.html?title=bestJournalismOfTheDecade&quot;&gt;one reporter wrote a story&lt;/a&gt; explaining what a Trump presidency would be like. They should have all been doing it. All the time. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/18/125952.html?title=weMustSaveOurselves&quot;&gt;Saving ourselves&lt;/a&gt; begins with telling ourselves &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=occam%27s%20news&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;the truth&lt;/a&gt;, and realizing that journalism and the Democrats are not doing that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Summary of the above. Journalism should always clearly answer the question: What This Means To You. Don't run the piece until you can answer it. And maybe consider getting some new reporters who can. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The Supreme Court is bullshit</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don't care how it became 6-3 in favor of the fascists, that's where it is now, that's not the United States, and that's not the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's bullshit. I don't care if the Dems don't have the votes to fix it. It's still bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bullshit is bullshit. Pretty simple folks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What is Electric Drummer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As we're starting to test the Linux and Windows versions of Electric Drummer there have been some basic questions. I thought I should respond publicly so people understand what we're doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Electric Drummer&lt;/a&gt; or E/D for short, is an app that runs on the desktop, hosted by its operating system.  Like a word processor or a graphics program. It's most like &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/building-hybrid-applications-with-electron/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; editor, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=drummer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-tab outliner for note-taking, organizing and publishing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It runs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful environment that makes cross-platform apps easier to create and manage. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D saves files on your local file system as any desktop app does. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It can also hook up to your web Drummer account for outlines that you want to make public. It's how I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. The outline that I edit is on my local system,. It's also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/blog.opml&quot;&gt;public file&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be accessed by the CMS when I ask it to render my blog from the outline. The public file is stored in my web Drummer account. It's a nice combination.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;E/D is a scripting system, like web Drummer is. It will be able to access the local file system, and also will be able to run a server, none of which are possible from the web app. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There is already a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of E/D that has been available since October 10, when Drummer shipped. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's the same as web Drummer, a few commands work differently because it runs in a different place, but it's the same code, same outliner, same UI, same bugs (!), etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

As you may know, I've written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog&quot;&gt;Node app&lt;/a&gt; that flows LogSeq journal writing to a Drummer blog. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KLTransit/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. It does the whole thing, except it should be baked into LogSeq. Setting up a Node app and running it externally is both too difficult for an average user and too many steps. We already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog/issues/1#issuecomment-1013997158&quot;&gt;great techie user&lt;/a&gt; who I worked with me to get the Node app working, who is up to speed on using the software. He can guide the process, we just need a dev to work with him. I'm available to help too, to the extent that I can. If you are a LogSeq plugin dev, please post a note in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog/issues/1&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, and we can hopefully get started right away. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

I've decided to make the Mac work like Windows and Ubuntu, swapping the Ctrl and Cmd keys, but for some reason my Bluetooth keyboard is not showing up in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/01/17/modifierKeyboardDialog.png&quot;&gt;list of keyboards&lt;/a&gt; whose modifier keys you can change. The list is empty. I tried disconnecting the keyboard and reconnecting, no luck. I guess I should try rebooting the machine. If you have an idea, reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1483084855818784771&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Thanks!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>I can tell today is going to be &lt;i&gt;one of those&lt;/i&gt; days. My power went out overnight, but luckily I have a generator this winter (newly installed in the summer) and it automatically kicked in. But there are no outages listed on the Central Hudson outage map. Oy. I'll make the best of it.</description>

			<title>Political marketing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Do I have anyone following me who is a political marketer? Is there such a thing. We need them now.  The way you fight this, and it's getting late, is by demonstrating the opposite.   Famous people of different races visibly doing things to help each other. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MU4F79oyfT&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to do.  We should be wearing buttons, small ones, with MLK's image on it. People of all colors. Americans. Showing support for all of us, esp people whose ancestors were slaves.   We have to urgently heal this huge wound.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to do, we need to show each other that we are here, in great numbers.   I don't like huge national marches, what I'd love more than anything is people showing their passion for voting. Not just in November, but every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let's meet up at our polling places for coffee and a sandwich and good old political talk. Talk about what we want. Yes there will be trolls there. But let's hope we outnumber them. I think we will always outnumber them, but can we get out there and show it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And we need to use online advertising.   Campaigns should NEVER GO OFF THE AIR.  This a vestige of TV-based media, last generation.  And they should raise money and pay for themselves.  And speak with power, not powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We've lost the marketing war, with a Baby Huey type character as the other side's spokesperson. We have much better people, but we lack the political organization and understanding of how little time is left.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They start out easy at the beginning of each week, and get harder progressively until the Sunday puzzle which only great crossword solvers can do, like my mom. It was one of the things we could do together. I'd fill in a few of the answers and come back later to find the whole puzzle solved. She said she didn't mind that I did the easy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post recently started publishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/crossword-puzzles/daily/&quot;&gt;free crosswords&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I'm a paying NYT subscriber, their crosswords cost more, even for me. I find the Post crosswords are just as satisfying and clever as the NYT ones, and the price is great. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As far as I know I have never been the answer to a clue in a NYT puzzle, or for that matter on Jeopardy. And I've never written a NYT guest column. I will be able to die a happy man when I've checked all these boxes. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we turn to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;. At first I looked at it and thought it was too much trouble, but then I read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2022/01/13/164646.html?title=solvingWordleWithLetterFrequency&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; by my friend Ken Smith, the English professor from Indiana, who explained how to approach it mathematically. The idea is that your first word should have as many of the most likely characters as possible, which are the vowels and N, R, S, T etc. Then I don't know the best approach for the second word or third. What I've been doing is taking the matches from the first word, and there are bound to be one or two, and use them in the second word. If the position is correct, use that letter in that position, to make it a bit like a crossword, except there is no clue. Repeat in the third, fourth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've played Wordle twice and both times got extremely lucky and solved the puzzle in the third word. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; Scrabble. No patience for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Mac users who also use Ubuntu: Do you force the Mac to be like Unix, by mapping the Ctrl key to the Cmd key and vice versa? Or do you put up with the difference, and remember which machine you're using as you type? I'm hitting as I start using Ubuntu as my writing machine. Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1482065198949318658&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I wish there were an easy way to exchange the Control and Alt keys on Ubuntu 20 so it works like a Mac.&quot; I failed to mention that I'm using VMWare Fusion to run Ubuntu, and it looks like there is a way to do it there.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/10/24/QueSeraSera.html#6&quot;&gt;Que Sera Sera&lt;/a&gt;, October 1996.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To anyone who wants to lead -- show us software that's fun and empowering, get us interested and excited. Gates, McNealy, Ellison et al never do that. We've tried it their way before, look at the stagnation that resulted. We're at a crossroads now, do we go back to the mess of the past or do we learn to enjoy the que sera of it all, and stop seeing threats everywhere we look?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So much of the energy is about defeating and destroying, so little is about creating. People believe in others, not themselves, and are disappointed when they are left out of the big plans. They forget that no matter how rich and intimidating each leader of our industry is, or would-be leader, none of them predicted the world we live in now, and by extrapolation they are powerless to control the world we will live in in 1997 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'll do my part: here's an invitation to truly embrace the creativity of others. Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion. Establish a policy that nothing will be announced unless it can be shown that someone else will win because of what you're doing. How much happier we would be if instead of crippling each other with fear, we competed to empower each others' creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I finally am able to use Linux as a GUI machine, not just a command line thing. But it's burning my brain cells that the Cmd and Ctrl keys are in the opposite places as on my Mac (and in my brain). It's easy to change key mapping on the Mac, but on Ubuntu, you have to do some pretty horrible stuff.</description>

			<description>With yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/article/165018/covid-vaccine-mandate-struck-down&quot;&gt;Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt; about Covid and OSHA, I think we're firmly in illegitimacy territory.

			<title>Sinema for president?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr -- it might work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1481836126495256576&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; asking people to identify Sinema as:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;bribed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;blackmailed&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;held hostage&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;insane&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I had not considered another possibility -- she wants to be president! This came up in a tweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi/status/1481997298078990336&quot;&gt;forwarded&lt;/a&gt; by  the innovative Democratic campaigner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeTrippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My first thought: no way, maybe option #4 is correct after all, but then on reflection, it would increase interest in the primary and that's a good thing. Nothing is worse than a primary with candidates who all appear to be losers or bore you to death in their speeches, or worse make you feel uncomfortable (Biden, Hillary Clinton). And I don't want another Obama, I feel wounded by his presidency. Left us in a bad place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And then I realize, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI5Z7Zg64YM&quot;&gt;Sinema&lt;/a&gt; is a good speaker, based on video of her back when she gave speeches. This crazy personal insurrection of hers has done one thing, it has made her much more famous. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People vote for candidates who are confident and make them feel good about themselves, like they matter. That's pretty much it. I wish it were otherwise, but there's a lot to be said requiring a leader to be able to lead. Yes it matters where they lead us, but to a lot of voters, their thoughts don't go that far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I've beem thinking about who I want to run in 2024. My two main interests are Jay Inslee and Gavin Newsom. Both are confident, good speakers, and their politics are  straight Democrat. I think they are our best shot at winning, and yes that's the primary concern. We simply can't have another Republican president and not go completely to hell. Please don't ever overlook that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/mylogseqblog/2022/01/13/000005.html?title=changeNotesForV041&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog&quot;&gt;myLogseqBlog tool&lt;/a&gt; fixing a couple of bugs reported on day one. There's also a note there on how this will evolve. Right now all the loose-ends are showing, that's because I know almost nothing about LogSeq. As the people from LogSeq-land get familiar with this, they will no doubt have ideas about how to better integrate this software so it's super easy. This is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=bootstrap&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;bootstraps&lt;/a&gt; start.</description>

I always loved the imagery of this event. A cooperative venture, one team building from east to the west, and the other from west to east, meeting at a middle point, and thereby creating one great thing. Working together. Built during the Civil War.</description>

I find I can't do the most basic things in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=logseq&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;LogSeq&lt;/a&gt;. I know there must be keystrokes for basic actions like creating a new subhead or moving a sub around structurally. The menus don't have anything for outlining (that I can find). I was able to get by because I can now edit LogSeq documents in Drummer (!) -- it took me about 1/2 hour to realize I could do this. Oh the wonders of interop. I'm on Day 2 of my quest to hook up LogSeq to Drummer blogging. The first product of this work will be a JavaScript app that converts a LogSeq journal folder into a calendar-structured outline in OPML. We're creating a new idea universe here, and it's coming together quickly. I love being in the middle of these projects.</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-queens-gambit&quot;&gt;Queen's Gambit&lt;/a&gt; again. It's so refreshing. The lead character, Beth Harmon, is so attractive, appealing, I want to see everything she says and does. She totally commands attention. And admiration. I once had a girlfriend who was as beautiful and brilliant like the character, smart and clever and ambitious. The show is such a fantasy, and very motivating. It makes me want to do brilliant work just to get her approval. I know it's just a story but it's also real in a sense, as my inner life. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. And it's good as a re-binge as well.</description>

Something we did a lot of twice in the past...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hooking up Mac apps using IAC.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Hooking up web apps using XML-RPC and Menu Sharing. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here we are again, but this time OPML is the common language.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Manchin is a tool. Obviously he's being paid off. We even know how. That said, perhaps we can put together a GoFundMe to get him even more money than his backers are giving him, to do the right thing. If he can be bought, in other words, why don't we just buy him??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It would be something for Wolf Blitzer to talk about. They could even have a box on CNN saying how much money had been raised so far. Reporters could ask Manchin all the time if $5 million isn't enough, what is your actual price?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He would say &quot;I don't have a price&quot; and we'd just..&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You don't say!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_npm.asp&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; Is a mess that could be cleaned up if we had the will to do it. There's no reason we use so many different packages. Node should have an extensive library of built-ins. And there should be a professional review process in place before key components are updated.</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/09/185121.html?title=noCellCoverage&quot;&gt;No Cell Coverage&lt;/a&gt; issue. I got a note that said to: 1. Turn on Airplane Mode. 2. Turn on Wifi. The thought is that should be enough to get the iPhone to stop trying to find a cell connection and thus stop draining my battery. If this works, all I'll have to do is remember to turn off Airplane Mode when I return to civilization.</description>
