			<description>If you're a developer who wants to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;create standards&lt;/a&gt;, you might check in with other people who have worked in the area, describe the problem, ask if they have ideas. I try to do that. Unfortunately the people mostly don't respond, but sometimes they do. It's how we avoid having two or more ways of doing exactly the same thing. And the second person is the one who has the power to set a standard, not the first. So it's the power move if your goal is really to try to set a standard.</description>

			<description>Have you ever noticed -- if you ask a programmer to do something and their first reaction is a vehement &lt;i&gt;no way are we doing that&lt;/i&gt; then they come back a week later and they've implemented it. I learned never to take a hard no as a for-real no. Good developers keep coming back to the idea if it's interesting enough. Sometimes it ends up as disastrous as the programmer initially thought. I could tell you stories. But also sometimes it's how killer features get into products at the last minute.</description>

			<description>FeedLand tweak. Now when displaying a linkblog item, instead of (link) we say what domain the link goes to. That's how we do it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from that approach. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/25/domainForLink.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>I'm having random problems accessing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; today in Chrome on a Mac. It's just an S3 bucket, chosen so there would never be any difficulty getting through. I wonder if you all are experiencing this? The browser just sits there, wheel spinning. Eventually it sorts itself out, it seems. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/258&quot;&gt;respond here&lt;/a&gt;. (Obviously if you see that, you're probably not having problems getting through, but maybe you did earlier.)</description>

			<description>Funny story. When I ask Alexa to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFz3vdyirR4&quot;&gt;Here Come Those Tears Again&lt;/a&gt; by Jackson Brown, it plays the song, then plays it again, and again and so on. I guess it gets tripped up on the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=define+again&quot;&gt;word&lt;/a&gt; in the song name? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Come_Those_Tears_Again&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of the song is quite moving. Background vocals by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Raitt&quot;&gt;Bonnie Raitt&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Blue Sky questions</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Basic questions to ask of any would-be successor to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is there a character limit in Blue Sky?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does it support simple styling: bold and italic.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#How_hyperlinks_work_in_HTML&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Titles?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you edit posts?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Does it support enclosures, for podcasting?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How about two-way RSS, nice to have. Hook up to simple networks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My criticisms of Blue Sky, having never tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's invite-only. Really? On an open protocol? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's founded by Jack Dorsey, a nice enough fellow, who should sit down after the huge mess he left us with Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The FeedLand platform</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the FeedLand platform has been ready to be released as open source for some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland&quot;&gt;https://github.com/scripting/feedland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But I haven't been focused on that kind of stuff, so I didn't want to create an expectation that there would be a lot of support. That's still true, but the product deserves to be out there, so very quietly last week I made the feedland repo public. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/database/database.md&quot;&gt;SQL commands&lt;/a&gt; that create the FeedLand database. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I decided today was the day to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/24/151114.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about it, because I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/issues/31&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the database that I want to ask questions about from people with expertise in MySQL, and can't do that publicly without referring to bits that are in that repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Don't read -- spoilers!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was both impossible to watch at times, and in some ways the best most revealing most fun episode ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two sons are complete fucking idiots. And Shiv is her father's daughter and the son he never had. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The moral of this story is the feminist complaint, she was obviously pushed aside because of her vagina, in favor of the idiot penises. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And like the previous episode which ended with Kendall smiling (over something stupid), this one ends with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/24/shivSmile.png&quot;&gt;Shiv smiling&lt;/a&gt; (over something clever and kind of evil). So I guess in the next one it's Roman, right? Five episodes to go. Two more siblings, plus Tom and Greg. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Who's smiling at the end of the last episode? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Washington Post did some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3AsTRnv&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; (free link, no paywall) to discover the sources behind &quot;AI like ChatGPT&quot; -- and they have a dialog you can use to find out how often certain sites are used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Documenting-the-English-Colossal-Clean-Crawled-Dodge-Sap/40c3327a6ddb0603b6892344509c7f428ab43d81?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template&quot;&gt;Google's C4 dataset&lt;/a&gt; (whatever that is). So of course I checked to see how much data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is included. The answer: 710K tokens, which is 0.0005% of all tokens. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/scriptingquotes.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Some comps: &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.com/&quot;&gt;daringfireball.com&lt;/a&gt; had 610K, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seths.blog/&quot;&gt;seths.blog&lt;/a&gt; had 750K and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kottke.org/&quot;&gt;kottke.org&lt;/a&gt; had 590K.</description>

We like our basketball players to have a reason to want to win, who don't feel they're doing anyone a favor by showing up to play the freaking game, and don't practice race-hate on Twitter. New York is a diverse city, and proud of it. Welcoming the Nets back to NYC. No more carpetbaggers please. And &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; no more Brooklyn Nets/Nazis. Thanks.</description>

It was the class that weeded out those who would get graduate degrees from those who would not. The class project was to write a compiler for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122103/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ohearn/Algol/intro.html&quot;&gt;Algol-like language&lt;/a&gt; that the professor desgined. He gave us a set of test apps that we had to compile and run correctly. I didn't get it. I thought code generation was like a magic box. Somehow the machine had a copy of every program you could write, and when it saw you were asking for that one, it would just spit out the code. Knowing what I know now, this was a ludicrous idea, but it's the best your mind can do when you just don't get it. Then there was the moment when I did get it. I started writing a code generator for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop&quot;&gt;while loop&lt;/a&gt;, and plugged it into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler&quot;&gt;compiler-compiler&lt;/a&gt;, and saw what it generated worked. From that point on, it was just writing code. Same thing with the web. I thought of big data centers, until I visited one of the most popular sites on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Underground_Music_Archive&quot;&gt;IUMA&lt;/a&gt;, and found it was just an old Sun terminal and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box_form_factor&quot;&gt;pizza box computer&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on the floor in a random dusty one-room office in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Cruz,+CA/@36.9758914,-122.04748,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808e441b7c36d549:0x52ca104b2ad7f985!8m2!3d36.9741171!4d-122.0307963!16zL20vMGwwbWs&quot;&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;. That's it? I couldn't believe it. So I'm sure there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gestalt&quot;&gt;gestalt&lt;/a&gt; like that for &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the magic is a bit of software, as magical (or not) as my compiler, or the pathetic Santa Cruz machine with the huge net presence. I'm sure there's something very mundane behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR64EF3OpA&quot;&gt;curtain&lt;/a&gt;, but for now I love the magic of it and I don't believe the explanations that say it's stupid.

			<description>Another ChatGPT use-case. There's an open source package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;medium-editor&lt;/a&gt; that I use to edit text in most of my products. I believe it's popular, but because of its name, it can be hard to use a search engine to find technical information about it. I wanted to make an instance of the editor the focus by default when its created. I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/20/medium-editor-package-familiar.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT how to&lt;/a&gt; do it, and it gave me fantastic docs, because it could sort out what Google simply can't. Incredibly useful. It will, if it works, result in a product that &quot;feels good&quot; -- people probably won't even notice that it did anything unusual. This is what make software excellent. (Update: Still scratching my head over this.)</description>

			<description>Hey the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/18/030519.html&quot;&gt;corner-turn&lt;/a&gt; worked. Last night's emails went out with the linkblog items coming from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;new feed&lt;/a&gt;, and if I hadn't said anything I bet most people wouldn't have noticed the markdown styling wasn't rendered on one of the items. Otherwise, no glitches to be seen.</description>

After reading the book many years ago, I had a teacher named Jeru, whose tapes I have put on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeru.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;, who said many wise things that made a huge difference in my understanding of myself. But he also said one thing that I think was too judgmental -- that most love relationships have the partners taking turns acting like children. We, the students, laughed, as if to say -- yes but we're smart enough to not do that. To which I, Dave, now 25 years older and hopefully a little wiser, say yeah okay, that's cool, but please -- that's bullshit. Because we're &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; acting like children, all of us, because that's what we are. 99 percent of our energy comes from the child, maybe 1 percent from the intellect, the adult. The fun of life comes from the child. At our core, where our joy lives, we're kids, human puppies. Our partner is our best friend, and we play together and make huge messes, but our parents (our intellects) are watching over us, and are ready to step up if there's danger. But as long as it's fun, let the kids play. Most relationships I've had have been love-starved. We're expected to live up to an impossible standard, something out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave it to Beaver&lt;/a&gt;. Ward and June, Wally and the Beaver. All I've ever wanted is someone to let me love them, who I could learn from, who would read my stuff and laugh at my jokes and tell me I'm a good boy. I really meant what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/04/014347.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; about getting from my human partner the same kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/04/014347.html&quot;&gt;love a dog gets&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so I tore up the pillows and pissed on the carpet. But you still love me right? Here let me get you the stick, now please throw it so I can be a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/23/161945.html&quot;&gt;good boy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; again.</description>

			<title>How to use the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/110225906594359425&quot;&gt;use the web&lt;/a&gt; to work with each other, you are using the web correctly. Almost no one does that. Instead people use the web to draw attention to themselves. The replies I get are mostly people trying to tag their names along with something someone else wrote to get more flow for them, more followers. It's a strategy. It's basically spam. It's not very social imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the replies may &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like they're addressed to you. Literally they are addressed to you. But they're not &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; you, they're for bots basically, or people behaving as bots. Mastodon is mostly like Twitter in this way. I have had some interactions that were legitimately about working together, but they're few and far between. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>ChatGPT desperately needs customization. I'd like to get my Amazon Music history connected to it, so I can ask it to create a workout playlist for me. I can describe what kind of music works for me, a strong fast beat, big bass drum and guitar. Something I can sing along to is good. And I like a certain set of bands from the 70s and 80s, so we might as well start with that. Now I'm going for a 40-minute walk. Program the music please and put it on my phone and off I go.</description>
