			<description>If the open web had a good lawyer we could stop Spotify from calling their radio programs &quot;podcasts&quot; because it's a fraudulent claim. It's like saying a car gets 800 miles per gallon when it gets 30 mpg. It's a lie. People expect podcasts to work in any player. Spotify is lying</description>

			<description>I was having breakfast with a local friend the other day and we were talking about the Beatles. He is not a fan. He cited as an example that Hey Jude is too long, at over 7 minutes. I had never thought about that. I expected that it was meant to crowd out other music on FM radio, where the standard song length was more like 3 minutes. He said he didn't know about that. I said if it were tech instead of music that would definitely have been the motivation. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+hey+jude+so+long&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; it up.</description>

Do most people even know who's responsible for this societal shift? Why don't they get more attention in the news? Maybe because they own the news orgs.</description>

			<title>The iPhone 13 epilog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/gaslight.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As I reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/15.html#a193031&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; Pro arrived yesterday. So the embarrassing saga is over. Now I want to clean up, by finishing the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Apple sent a total of three iPhones to me. After the first one was lost, the second one got jammed up in the system too, when Apple charged the wrong credit card $1 for an unspecified reason and they had changed my credit card number, so the charge was rejected. The email I got saying this happened had none of this information so I waited, hoping the problem would clear without me having to call them, but no such luck. Turns out that delay doomed the second iPhone because while it was in transit we had a huge ice storm that knocked out power in Ulster County for two days. The iPhone was left in the UPS warehouse, probably in Kingston, and probably was stolen while it was waiting for everything to come back online.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After trying to get help from Apple Support on Twitter, I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/142419.html?title=myEmailToTimCook&quot;&gt;email to Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of Apple. Within an hour of sending the email, I got a phone call from someone in &quot;Apple Retail Executive Relations&quot; who was empowered to blow through the problem. A third iPhone was sent, this time via Fedex, which is, in my experience, much more reliable in this area than UPS. But something funny happened before the third phone was delivered at 2PM Eastern yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 12:45PM or so, I heard a UPS truck park outside my house. It stayed there for about ten minutes. I went out to see what was going on, and could hear the driver in the back sorting through packages. It usually doesn't take that long. I shouted out to him through the open door, but he didn't answer. So I went back in the house to take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; with my Pixel 4a, in time to see him drive off without making a delivery. My guess is that the UPS computer had told him to come here to make a delivery, and when he got here, the package wasn't on the truck? I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; to prove this actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;UPS truck before it left without making a delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's not much more to say that isn't spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/142419.html?title=myEmailToTimCook&quot;&gt;email to Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll just leave it there, except to say at all levels Apple people knew what the right thing to do was, but their system wouldn't let them do it. That is, until we got to someone who was at most a couple of hops from the CEO, who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; empowered to solve the problem. As a long time Apple user, I got my first Apple II in 1979, I'd hate to see Apple be in the toilet bowl of uncaring bigco American rust belt e-commerce, where people are peripheral devices to poorly designed computer systems created by lawyers and accountants and in some cases psychopaths. For evidence of that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/dmExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;see the DMs&lt;/a&gt; that the Apple Support people sent. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor&quot;&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock&quot;&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt; were still alive and making movies, they could be characters in one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)&quot;&gt;psycho dramas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="Apple sent a total of three iPhones to me. After the first one was lost, the second one got jammed up in the system too, when Apple charged the wrong credit card $1 for an unspecified reason and they had changed my credit card number, so the charge was rejected. The email I got saying this happened had none of this information so I waited, hoping the problem would clear without me having to call them, but no such luck. Turns out that delay doomed the second iPhone because while it was in transit we had a huge ice storm that knocked out power in Ulster County for two days. The iPhone was left in the UPS warehouse, probably in Kingston, and probably was stolen while it was waiting for everything to come back online." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:53:03 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog#a135303"/>

Within an hour of sending the email, I got a phone call from someone in &quot;Apple Retail Executive Relations&quot; who was empowered to blow through the problem. A third iPhone was sent, this time via Fedex, which is, in my experience, much more reliable in this area than UPS.

				<source:outline text="At 12:45PM or so, I heard a UPS truck park outside my house. It stayed there for about ten minutes. I went out to see what was going on, and could hear the driver in the back sorting through packages. It usually doesn't take that long. I shouted out to him through the open door, but he didn't answer. So I went back in the house to take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; with my Pixel 4a, in time to see him drive off without making a delivery. My guess is that the UPS computer had told him to come here to make a delivery, and when he got here, the package wasn't on the truck?

That is, until we got to someone who was at most a couple of hops from the CEO, who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; empowered to solve the problem. As a long time Apple user, I got my first Apple II in 1979, I'd hate to see Apple be in the toilet bowl of uncaring bigco American rust belt e-commerce, where people are peripheral devices to poorly designed computer systems created by lawyers and accountants and in some cases psychopaths.

			<title>My email to Tim Cook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Monday February 14, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt; 18 days for a new iPhone to be delivered, I sent an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifewire.com/how-can-i-email-apple-ceo-tim-cook-1171298&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook and as a result &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog&quot;&gt;two days later&lt;/a&gt; I had the phone. Here's a copy of the email. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Cook: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I ordered an &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; Pro from the Apple online store on January 27. I paid $1300 plus tax. I also bought a leather case, which was delivered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've spent hours on the phone with Apple people, tried using the support address on Twitter, and have gotten conflicting advice from Apple people, and they've lost the case a couple of times. Also at one point I got an email from Apple saying I had to change something about my account, without saying what it was. It turned out Apple wanted to charge my account $1, and my credit card number had been changed on your system to something other than my credit card number. This may be the most alarming thing about this experience. How could that have happened?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bought my first Apple product, an Apple II, in 1979. I was an early Apple II developer, was one of the first Mac developers. I've created a lot of software for your platform and done a lot of business with Apple, and I'm also a longtime shareholder. I have never seen this company so incompetent, uncaring and unprofessional, apparently as a matter of corporate policy. The employees I've had to deal with are not proud of your company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paid Apple $1300, not UPS. If they screwed up, and it's likely they did, telling me to go to UPS is no answer. I didn't choose to use UPS, you did. And if they screwed up, fine, either give me my money back or get me the phone, now. I really want the product, but more than that I want to be treated as a customer, with the basic respect that requires.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been writing about this on my blog since I made the purchase. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;search query&lt;/a&gt; that will get you the full account. If you study this case, you'll see you need to do a lot of work on the customer experience, and empower your employees to solve problems, instead of pointing the finger at other companies and giving assignments to customers about dealing with your vendors. I've heard the story about how Apple people can't solve an obvious repeated failure on the part of your company. That's a system that is going to lose you your reputation for being tops in customer service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope you can help. I either want an immediate refund or to have the product delivered soon. And in all this mess, no one has ever apologized. I think that would be the place to start. And not an indirect apology like the one I got from the Twitter support team, which began: &quot;We’re sorry to hear your delivery is stalled...&quot; I've enclosed the full message as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/dmExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;attachment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter and RSS in 2022</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When Twitter went from 140 to 280 chars, there was an opportunity to re-think the connection between Twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;280 chars is enough to communicate a few thoughts, with optional room for a title. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also, the integration of a thread-writing tool in Twitter made it easier to chain tweets together, to form a full document. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is, imho, enough to make RSS a viable connector between Twitter and the rest of the world. This is significant because RSS is a simpler API than Twitter's API. It will open Twitter up to more applications&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As an experiment I wrote a Node.js service that periodically reads my tweet stream and publishes an RSS feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Titles. I can put a title on a tweet with Markdown-ish syntax.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited length posts. RSS has no limit on document length. With threads, neither does Twitter. So I'll just roll up threads into a single RSS item. I haven't implemented this yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links. My plan is to use Markdown syntax for &lt;a href=&quot;https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. It's right there. Why not use it. Again, not implemented yet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Other RSS concepts such as pubDate and guid are all easily synthesized from the metadata Twitter provides through its API.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Styling. Why not allow *any* Markdown in tweets, properly interpreted for the RSS item representing the tweet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create a feed viewer for RSS feeds that emanate from Twitter, so we can easily view and debug the code that does the translation, and then start adding more features. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These feeds will work with all RSS-compatible feed readers that can handle items without titles (which is redundant btw, RSS titles have always been optional).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, RSS gets a fresh start, a new way of generating feeds from an editing environment miliions of people use. Twitter wins because its API is more broadly applicable, and it can immediately start fostering a decentralized community. It should happen quickly. We've been down this road before. And we can do all this with the existing Twitter API. Important point. No waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last time the combination of Twitter and RSS was seriously considered was when Twitter itself supplied an RSS feed. But that was in the time of 140 chars, with no thread tool, and further, Twitter duplicated the text of the tweet in the title and description elements of each RSS item. The dominant RSS reader of the day, Google Reader, made no special allowance, so it repeated the text in their user interface, and it was ugly and distracting, didn't fit in with the other feeds people were reading.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also did a tweet-to-RSS service. Instead of duplicating the tweet in the title and description elements, I omitted the title, which is optional in RSS 2.0, but Google Reader didn't handle RSS items without titles. So that was a dead-end too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google Reader is long gone and Twitter no longer has RSS feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1492891287095320578&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; with the new style of tweet developing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>iPhone 13 Pro, day 17</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iphone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;saga&lt;/a&gt; continues...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling pretty good lately, but when I have an interaction with Apple, I think seriously I should just write off the $1300 I paid for the iPhone 13 Pro and get a high-end Android phone. I probably won't because I'm locked in to so many Apple services. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, 17 days after buying the phone from Apple, $1300 plus tax, it is still not here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/13/upsAdvisory.png&quot;&gt;UPS says&lt;/a&gt; it will be delivered tomorrow, but they've said that every day in the last week. The weather has been great, spring-like, sunny. They say it's an emergency. I think the emergency is they don't have the phone and their system is lying when it says it's on the truck and out for delivery. It's fair to assume it will not be here tomorrow, or ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday in a call to Apple at 1-800-MYAPPLE, they said they were making an escalation request, but when I called the same number just now they said the same thing. I guess the earlier request must've gotten lost too. I tried working with Apple Support on Twitter, but they were even more obnoxious. They seriously told me it was my job to find the person to talk to at UPS who is holding up the delivery and work with them. If they had told me that when I bought the phone I would have found another way to buy it because I refuse to get involved with UPS which is an ancient rust belt company that has no ability to work with ordinary people (and they're really rude about it). Apple chose UPS, not me. I paid &lt;i&gt;Apple&lt;/i&gt; for a phone, not UPS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the response I got from Apple Support on Twitter is utterly unbelievable. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/13/appleCustomerService.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're doing something a lot of companies do on Twitter, saying they acknowledge your feeling of frustration or whatever. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; and maybe someone in sales thinks the customer likes to be gaslighted. Maybe they weren't angry before you gaslighted them, but you can be sure they are after you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I called Apple this morning and got a more professional response. I'm waiting another three days to find out if they're going to return the money. The person recited some boilerplate saying that Apple will issue the refund when they receive the phone. I stopped her and repeated &lt;i&gt;I don't have the phone&lt;/i&gt; so I can't return it.  If I were them, I'd have someone drive the freaking phone to me from an Apple store in the area. That is, if this is an uncommon occurrence. If they depend on their customers doing work for them to get their product, I expect for most people that will be a bridge too far. For me it is. When I buy a luxury item, and that's what this is, I want to be treated with basic respect. And I want to use the freaking product, not argue with Apple about who has to do what. They have to do it, I'm the customer. I paid for this experience. Geez Louise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs used to lecture on this. He told a story that I can't find a reference to right now, about how he wanted the person buying the Apple product to take it home, open it up, and have everything just work. He wanted all the glitches gotten rid of. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs+on+customer+experience+taking+an+apple+product+home+from+store&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBvnj_IQeqJI5c3sHrI_AhRy2eDX5g%3A1644761941984&amp;ei=VRMJYu7fO7ajptQP-M2FiAU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu3qra7_z1AhW2kYkEHfhmAVEQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=steve+jobs+on+customer+experience+taking+an+apple+product+home+from+store&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6BAgjECc6BAghEApKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQtRBY2yZg2ydoA3ABeACAAdABiAGFDJIBBjE5LjAuMZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;quick search&lt;/a&gt; and found lots of praise for Apple as a customer service company. Well these people who write so gushingly about their customer service prowess should check it out again. I don't think this is remotely the same company it was just a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Perhaps part of Covid burnout is the realization at how insignificant our lives are. Almost 1 million dead, life goes on. Everyone wants to get back to normal. Maybe at a conscious level we don't get that indifference to human life also applies to those of us who are still alive.</description>

Of course it did not arrive yesterday even though UPS said it would arrive by 7PM. They're saying it once again &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/todaystatus.png&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. I signed up to receive updates on delivery events and in the first email they sent the full log of UPS actions with the second phone Apple shipped after UPS apparently lost the first phone. This log starts on Feb 4. I ordered the phone on Jan 27. The log is so long that i had to take two screen shots: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/part1.png&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/part2.png&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple Support, after requesting I send them a DM on Twitter, hasn't responded after ~36 hours. $1300 plus tax, paid on 1/27, 16 days ago. We had two storms in this period, and one 2-day power outage, to be fair to Apple and UPS, but -- if they had delivered it in a timely fashion all that would have happened while I had my iPhone. They also mysteriously changed my credit card in their system and then tried to charge $1 to the account and it failed, holding the delivery up by 24 hours, and requiring me to spend an hour on the phone with an Apple person before even considering the possibility that they had the wrong number. To anyone who trusts Apple to store their data, this is something to be concerned about. Also I understand this happens frequently to customers. Maybe Apple is short-staffed, there is a labor shortage in the US. And stealing products while they are in shipment is a big problem, getting bigger all the time.</description>

			<description>Update on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13 Max&lt;/a&gt;. It did not arrive yesterday. For a few hours last night the UPS report went back to saying there was an emergency that supposedly prevented the delivery. But this morning it's back on the truck. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1491938203296751616&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about it on Twitter after yesterday's no-show, the fifth such day, and got a response from Apple support. I gave them the order number via DM. They wanted lots of details but what did I need to say beyond &quot;I paid the money, I want the phone, or refund the money.&quot; For a company of Apple's size this shouldn't be hard unless it's a common occurrence.</description>

			<description>I care about interop between people, more than I do about interop in software. I've been saying that here for a long time, called it &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=working%20together&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt;. It's harder for people to work together if their software doesn't.</description>

			<description>Today might be the day my long lost &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013%20Pro&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; actually arrives. It's hard to imagine why it wouldn't. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/10/upsTeaser.png&quot;&gt;UPS site now says&lt;/a&gt; it's on the truck, not yet &quot;out for delivery&quot; but that's next step. I'm optimistic. The site also says it will be here by 7PM. The weather is very nice and has been for the last few days so there's no ice or snow to deal with. Power is on. But I've yet to see evidence the phone actually exists. If it does arrive here, I'm not letting it go. I could use a nice new phone. That's why I ordered and paid for one, so long ago. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🍎&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The two synthetic superteams of 2022 are falling apart now, today -- as the trade deadline is here, the moment when head-trips bump up against reality. The Lakers and Nets, who on paper have the best teams in the NBA this year, are basically out of contention and considering restarts. Meanwhile some of the teams that grew slowly and carefully are doing great. And there are surprises, teams no one thought would be doing so well. And of course the Knicks are back to where they always are, ripping up the whole thing and starting over. For some reason I'll never understand New York can't have a decent NBA team, even though we have two teams, and some people think New York is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca&quot;&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt; of the NBA, something you have to start wondering about given our teams' accomplishments or even an ability to play an interesting game.</description>

			<description>I like the idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2022/01/27/making-the-web-better-with-blocks/&quot;&gt;block protocol&lt;/a&gt; that makes compatible writing tools possible, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt;, but I use straight JavaScript, no toolkits, frameworks, no TypeScript. I feel strongly that packages that want to tie things together should be written in straight JS, that's why I chose that as my development platform many years ago. Actually I'd prefer if we stuck to the JS we were using in 2013. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

I wanted to buy it for a reason. But Apple doesn't have a button their customer service people can press when they understand that the company's system is torturing a customer and to escalate it to someone who can give the person their money back and maybe a nice present to indicate that they are somehow valued. There is no such button. And btw, Apple says the phone is &quot;out for delivery&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/08/upsScreen.png&quot;&gt;UPS says what they said yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, basically we can't find the phone in our system because of COVID or bad weather, which translates to &quot;we left the phone somewhere where it could be stolen.&quot; Of course if it arrives I will let you know. 🍿</description>

			<title>Beatles of software, Day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/08/164711.html?title=whereAreTheBeatlesOfSoftware&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;, from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1491504432151998470&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/09/allThingsMustPass.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;More thoughts about the Beatles and their breakup.  None of the individual Beatles did better work after the breakup. They were unique, and as individuals had moments of greatness, but they had something that almost no one ever gets, a chance to be part of something great.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In software, you can try to team up with people as good as you are, or just try to lead a team of people who do your work. I've always wanted the former, but pretty sure I never got it. I don't think anyone has gotten it, not for the decade or so the Beatles were at work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In sports, esp basketball they try to put together super teams, but they never seem to work. But look at the Warriors for an example of one that happened. They are kind of like the Beatles. But you know who didn't belong on the Warriors? The one who wasn't from Liverpool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mozart didn't get to be a Beatle, or Beethoven, Bach. What if they had found a peer and worked out a collaboration?  Hemingway didn't have a band either.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some random thoughts. This has been on my mind my whole career but has been coming into focus lately.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
