			<description>Why doesn't Dr Fauci have a daily briefing carried by all the networks. Okay we know Trump wouldn't let him, and as long as he's employed by the US govt, Trump can probably stop him. But what if Fauci decided he would be more effective outside of government? Who would bankroll such a venture, as a public service? &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<description>There's a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955&quot;&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt; in programming -- we must change our software so as not to, internally, invisibly to users, use terms like black or white, master or slave, etc. I'm editing some code now that has the concept of enabled and disabled. Can you imagine if we have to purge this from our tech vocabulary? The economics of such changes are mind-boggling. And the breakage. What if we used such a term in one of our standards? A frozen one? An ancient one? What then?</description>

			<description>The problem with journalism exposed in the age of Trump is they don't do anything. You say oh they're not supposed to. Voice from nowhere, etc. But they rarely carry stories of people who do things. Mostly Trump. Occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt; or but just for a while. That's it. Why does it matter now? Because we've been needing to do things since November 2016. We figure it out when it's too late. It's a repeating pattern. Maybe we need national activism more than we need journalism? We need something different or else we're hosed.</description>

			<title>An EFF to watch the EFF?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The EFF started, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&quot;&gt;30 years ago today&lt;/a&gt;, with the right idea, defending speech on the then-nascent net. I gave them $5000 at startup, but ultimately they sold us out to the big tech companies. Now we need a new EFF to reign in the original EFF.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I blogged about my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/03/29.html#breakWithEff&quot;&gt;break with the EFF&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. Subsequently I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/05/05/#a1399316366&quot;&gt;objected&lt;/a&gt; to how they defended podcasting from a patent troll, and ultimately the effort to give &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;control of the web to Google&lt;/a&gt;, that was the absolute last straw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are no longer defending electronic freedom, they are protecting the rich monopolists. Ugh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Hamilton and Brockmire</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I subscribed to Disney-Plus so I could watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)&quot;&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Parts of it I liked, but for the most, it was very Disney. I wasn't expecting that for some reason. I was prepared to be inspired but it never happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I then subscribed to Hulu so I could watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockmire&quot;&gt;Brockmire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is very good and very not-Disney. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Azaria&quot;&gt;Hank Azaria&lt;/a&gt;, the voice for so many great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_cast_members&quot;&gt;Simpsons characters&lt;/a&gt;, plays a washed up baseball play-by-play announcer who ends up in a washed up Pennsylvania town, announcing for a team called The Frackers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's LOL funny. Really good. And Azaria, as you might imagine, can play any character that requires character. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I discovered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/09/featureInGitHub.png&quot;&gt;new feature&lt;/a&gt; in GitHub. If you create a public repository with the same name as your account, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/scripting/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;readme.md&lt;/a&gt; file in that repo is displayed on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting&quot;&gt;GitHub home page&lt;/a&gt;. Of course it's Markdown. Might be interesting to integrate some of the status-editing features I'm working on into this. It supports basic web stuff, as you would expect from a techies site like GitHub. Okay this might be fun. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸŽˆ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Last night at the beginning of Maddow they had a tour of the Covid ward at a Houston hospital similar to the ones they did in NYC hospitals a couple of months ago. First we watched a woman die. She was infected at the funeral she held for her husband who also died of Covid. Then they interviewed a patient who explained she was being careful, yet caught the virus anyway. This is how it works when the density of infection goes up, you encounter more virus as you move around, and with more density the chance of you getting infected goes up. That's what they're dealing with in Houston. It was excellent, but they were all Democrats. It would be helpful if they interviewed a banker type, in trouble, in a ward, worrying about the horrible death looming in front of him. Let them see a Republican dealing with an unavoidable awful reality. Might scare them into wearing masks and thereby decrease the density of the virus and &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;save my life&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>Senators, go to Jacksonville!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-national-convention-rnc-coronavirus-gop-senators-jacksonville/&quot;&gt;Republican senators&lt;/a&gt; are apparently &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to Trump's convention in Jacksonville.

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/08/131602.html?title=reallySimpleJavascript&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about striving for simplicity in using JavaScript, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awbjs&quot;&gt;Allen Wirfs-Brock&lt;/a&gt;, who has been involved in JavaScript language design for many years, and was editor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/&quot;&gt;ES6 spec&lt;/a&gt;, responded thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Because of JavaScriptâ€™s &quot;donâ€™t break existing code&quot; policy, often the only way to fix an existing problematic features is to leave it alone and add a better alternative. This inevitably leads to profiles that include the better features and leaves out the deprecated ones.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You probably donâ€™t use &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt; , but most commercial JS devs seem to. There are probably thousands of configuration profiles for it that enforce various style guides and and subset preferences. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://standardjs.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Standard Style&lt;/a&gt; is popular but controversial both because of its self-assumed name and because of the positions it takes on semicolon usage and other conventions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Regarding choice of function forms, my preference is to use the &lt;code&gt;function hello () {}&lt;/code&gt; form in most situations where I wanted to define a named function, both global and local.  Iâ€™d generally reserve arrow functions for cases where Iâ€™m passing an anonymous function as an argument or otherwise using it as a first class value.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Iâ€™d probably only use &lt;code&gt;const hello= () =&gt; {};&lt;/code&gt; in situations where I need to name a function that needs to reference the this binding of its surrounding environment.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://nakedjen.com/&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; works in a place where people must wear a mask, so she gives out a lot of masks every day. She's going to make custom masks that have a message. That's the first part of this story. Second part, we both started a campaign called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt;, where we promote stories and ideas that save people's lives in this age where lives have all of a sudden become cheap, something our government is promoting (the cheapness, not the saving). So Jen has designed a mask that has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22+%23savemylife&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;#savemylife&lt;/a&gt; message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png&quot;&gt;MLK&lt;/a&gt; instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;#blacklivesmatter&lt;/a&gt;. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?</description>

			<title>Really Simple JavaScript</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1280388653433356290&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that showed what the author thought was a cool feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1280388653433356290/photo/1&quot;&gt;labels&lt;/a&gt; in JavaScript. Labels are 1/2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto&quot;&gt;goto&lt;/a&gt; statements, which we know are &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; to readability and maintainability. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure when I try to grok someone's code that uses this feature, it'll be hard to figure out how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been developing software for a long time. The functionality for users is always at the top of my mind. Getting software rock solid and ideally not requiring any maintenence, that's what I'm aiming for. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; thinking about how I can use some new cool feature in the language. I want my code to be as boring and predictable as possible. To look exactly like what it does. Sometimes I get there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm using software that I wrote 30 years ago right now, as I write this. That's pretty good for standing the test of time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm thinking the right thing to do for JavaScript is to define a profile, a subset of the language, which if you stick to it, will enhance maintainability and readability, and therefore is more likely to work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example, right now I can think of three syntaxes for defining a function. The profile would allow one. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;function hello () {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;const hello = function () {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;const hello = () =&gt; {return (&quot;hello&quot;)}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see all example code stick to the profile. Of course once there was one such profile, there would be N.

You might think, of course it is, this is the US, but a lot of the people who are taught that history are not descended primarily from Europeans. So it isn't their history.</description>

			<description>Last night on MSNBC they just now started talking about how Puerto Rico was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine&quot;&gt;canary in the coalmine&lt;/a&gt;. That should have been topic #1 as it was happening. Moderator, ask your pundit, geez if he'll leave Puerto Rico to die, do you think he'll care whether we live or die? And then wonder what if we get hit by a calamity that isn't local, that affects the whole world. Why do they leave the tough questions on the table until it's too late. The point of the canary is to pay attention when the canary dies. When you're about to die, it's too late. It's so repetitious, they say the same things over and over, for weeks and months. Yet all the important questions, the obvious ones, go unasked.</description>

I don't comment on them very often, I've learned that's a good way to get the online equivalent of a kick in the balls.

Apparently not. So we are stuck in this mode until when? Could a vaccine work if there's no possible herd immunity? Anyway, this is like one of those classic fables or myths about the people who were so divided, so hated each other, that they couldn't get together to fight a disease that they can't overcome until they can work together. It's like that famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf&quot;&gt;O Henry story&lt;/a&gt;, which I won't spoil in case you haven't read it.</description>

It's like that famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/1-the_gift_of_the_magi_0.pdf&quot;&gt;O Henry story&lt;/a&gt;, which I won't spoil in case you haven't read it." created="Mon, 06 Jul 2020 14:32:32 GMT" type="outline" permalink="http://scripting.com/2020/07/06.html#a143232"/>

			<description>I've been thinking of getting a new Twitter account. I'm pretty sure the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I've had since 2006 has a flag on it that says &quot;Don't suggest it.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/08/16/ifAnyoneFromTwitterIsListening&quot;&gt;Explained here&lt;/a&gt;. I think this stems back to the controversy about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22suggested+users+list%22+twitter&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Suggested Users List&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually did phase it out. And something was done to my account. My follower count, at one time one of the top ten accounts on Twitter, hasn't grown in many years. So maybe it's time to start over, and see if I can have more followers without whatever was done. Anyway, some of the names I've considered are taken: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/boomer&quot;&gt;boomer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elgrande&quot;&gt;elgrande&lt;/a&gt; (a few friends call me that), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uncledavey&quot;&gt;uncledavey&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite titles), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scripting&quot;&gt;scripting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scriptingnews&quot;&gt;scriptingnews&lt;/a&gt; (not sure what this account is), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/savemylife&quot;&gt;savemylife&lt;/a&gt;. Or I could use one of the many names I already have. Then there's the question of how to transition? I think about it sometimes, but I never actually do it. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/03.html#a195806&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I figured out that the not-pleasant burnt smell in the air came from fireworks. That was incorrect. A neighbor is having work done on trees. I live in a forest, where trees are a big deal. They're always falling over, and then you need to cut them up and haul the wood away or chop it into firewood. When you cut trees with a chain saw the wood burns, and it doesn't stop burning when the cutting is done. And that adds a stink to the air, like a fire that was put out with water. That's what I was smelling. I know this because I had some trees cut last year, and the stinky smell stuck around for a week. It's the sad smell of a dying creature. On the other hand, when you wake up on a summer morning with dew on everything, and a nice warm feel to the air, with a bit of residual chill, the forest smells like life. It's a wonderful smell.</description>

			<description>After Trump is gone we have to get rid of the cancel cult. Itâ€™s an ugly side effect of the power of online communication. When Trump uses it in his campaign itâ€™s one of the very few things heâ€™s right about.</description>
