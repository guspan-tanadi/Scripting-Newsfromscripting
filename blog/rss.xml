			<title>A tale of two podcasts</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two podcasts, one good the other one awful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good one was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/18/978687605/could-trump-be-convicted-of-criminal-charges&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a long interview with New Yorker reporter, Jane Mayer, about whether or not former president Trump could be tried and convicted of a criminal offense. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The awful one was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-rebecca-traister.html&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein interview&lt;/a&gt; with Rebecca Traister, a reporter for New York magazine, about Andrew Cuomo. It was about how offensive and sexist governor Cuomo is, but the ironic thing, that I can't believe Klein couldn't hear, is how incredibly offensive &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; was being, in a sexist and racist way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first thing that hit me the wrong way is she described a conflict between Cuomo and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio as a &quot;dick swinging contest.&quot; That quote (about 9 minutes into the interview) is as bad as anything Cuomo is accused of saying, and she did it publicly, with a member of the press listening, and he didn't say a word, didn't question it. Try to imagine something like that being said about two women politicians, using the female equivalent of &quot;dicks.&quot; You'd never hear it, and a respectful discussion of politics can't be at that level. It's not just disrepectful of the people she's talking about, but it's disrespectful of the audience and the interviewer, and the NYT which hosted the interview. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;She admits she was furious that her &quot;liberal peers&quot; were liking Cuomo's leadership, leadership we desperately needed at the time, but that is not grounds for removal, and you have to wonder, could New York Magazine, and Klein, have found a more dispassionate person to tell this story, someone like Jane Mayer, for example. And maybe present another side of it, about what it was really like for us one year ago. Why were her liberal peers so willing to overlook their dislike for Cuomo? Perhaps because they, like the rest of us, were scared out of their minds. Just a theory. (I certainly was.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Later in the interview she admits her issue is with &quot;white, male politicians.&quot; I turned the interview off at that point. This isn't a scandal, as she almost admits, there was vulnerability, a coverup perhaps, a mistake for sure, in a perilous time, and now, the fear having subsided, a bit (and imho irrationally) the opportunists move in. That's a story I'd love to hear on a future Ezra Klein podcast. How and why did we give journalism so much power, was it a good idea, and how can we put it back where it belongs -- with the people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Traister should run against Cuomo next year, and her writing should be clearly labeled as partisan, but come on, we have to do better. And Klein, you can't support this kind of partisanship without at least questioning it, or properly labeling it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A fair journalistic treatment of this supposed scandal has yet to be offered, by anyone. The best indication of that is that the people aren't buying the product that journalism is offering, for some reason, a big majority of NY voters are not calling for his head. Maybe it would be worth finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Another podcast I listened to recently was a Fresh Air interview with author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978185402/novelist-kazuo-ishiguro&quot;&gt;Kazuo Ishiguro&lt;/a&gt;. I'm reading his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972841445/klara-and-the-sun-is-a-masterpiece-about-life-love-and-mortality&quot;&gt;Klara and the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, based on listening to the interview, and &lt;i&gt;loving&lt;/i&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: On this day a year ago, I proudly scored a thermometer. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A year of pandemic-imposed isolation takes a toll. This might be the worst moment of the year. It's rainy and cold. Spring keeps teasing, but it never comes. There's nothing you can do that would be a normal rainy day. When the sun comes out, this weekend, I hope it'll feel better. I'm sure it will.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Fox's business model: Getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism&quot;&gt;libs&lt;/a&gt; upset. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's simple. Their audience likes to hear about liberals freaking out. If you can make them cry, even better. All they have to do is come up with a few things that piss off the libs every week, and they're gold. And if the libs don't get upset, you can just lie and say they did.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Imho they aren't the only news org doing this.  As Maddow says, watch this space. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it's not my business model or any other kind of model to get anyone upset. Quite the opposite. I want to get everyone to work with each other. It's my impossible dream. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When the libs are angry, Fox is happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>It's not really a scam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been fascinating to watch writers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/210317/p16#a210317p16&quot;&gt;come to grips&lt;/a&gt; with the idea that Substack is not a level playing field. They recruited some famous writers, paid them advances, in some cases (apparently, not verified as far as I know) of up to $250K. The rest of the writers got nothing but the opportunity to make money from their newsletters. By seeding the market with this money they could honestly say that some writers were making six figures from their Substack work, implying perhaps that you could too. Maybe you could. But honestly -- you won't. The system they've set up doesn't work that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One writer called it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so&quot;&gt;scam&lt;/a&gt; but I'm not sure that's a good word for what's going on. It's more like &quot;business model&quot; or &quot;growth strategy.&quot; This is how the tech industry works. They do whatever it takes to create an illusion of potential growth, then they sell that to seed investors, who in turn sell it to angels, then to Series A and B and so on, and ultimately to the public. Huge amounts of money are raised, and none of it goes to the writers who keep the wheels spinning, in the case of Substack and their ilk, writers. And the writers who may think of themselves of savvy tech journos are scammed, that's where the real scam is, they largely did it to themselves by believing the fairy tale that they could get rich off writing, or even make a good living. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, this is not new. Medium has been paying writers for years. I know several of them and have confirmed it. I found out by questioning why they wrote for Medium, when it seemed against their values. The answer: they needed the money. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I regularly make offers to work with writers on easy writing and distribution systems without the constraints. But you all keep going for the tech industry business models. They get rich, and we're always starting over. When you decide you want to do this for real, with your eyes open, learning from all the experience, write a manifesto and call for open source devs to help you, and then we can get something going. But until the writers lead here, you're going to keep having your hearts broken and the tech for writing on the web will continue to go nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was having a philosophical conversation the other day about the difference between an app being scriptable or having an API. This has always been a big question. It's like this question: when does an actor become a star? Aren't they doing the same thing? Yes, they are, but no they aren't. An app being scriptable means that its API went through a process, it was conceived from a user's point of view. The designers looked at the user interface and made sure everything you could do there was also possible in a script. The terminology matched the UI. You didn't have to learn a new vocabulary. There were examples provided that showed how to do things the app couldn't do on its own, things that a user would want to do, and would inspire a script-writing user to want to do more. You're looking for the tiny fraction of users who in their hearts are developers, but don't know it yet. These people make software system devs don't think of, and aren't impressed with, because what drives the user-programmer is utility, not programming prowess. Further if you tell them they're programmers, they'll disagree for a long time -- no, I'm a lawyer, no I drive a bus. No I do this or that. But eventually quite a few will come to see that they are programmers. Then, as the programming priesthood takes hold, these people are confined to niches where the devs thought to add a scripting interface. That becomes a platform and the process begins again.</description>

			<title>When your parents die</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing you learn when your parents die, the people whose goals and dreams you studied for your formative years, is that our goals and dreams don't matter  much.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that matters is that my mother made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/17/evesQuilt.png&quot;&gt;quilt&lt;/a&gt; for me because she wanted me to have it after she was gone. That she walked my brother to school one day 50 years ago and someone took a picture so I can put it on the wall of my living room today. She planted trees on her street, trees that wouldn't give shade until she was long-gone. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That my father wrote about what he learned about using a computer to organize his work, with software I had written. The time after I was home from the hospital and he took me to the toy store and said I could have whatever I wanted. I have no recollection of what I chose, but I remember that he did it. I imagine that day he was glad I was okay. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The things they give you, their love, the small incidental memories -- they end up mattering more than any of the battles they fought or the impossible dreams they never achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Following up on Roam</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got some feedback to my series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/15/144714.html?title=aboutRoamsProduct&quot;&gt;questions/observations&lt;/a&gt; about Roam's product, which does appear to be an outliner after all. This was my most basic question. I could see that users had the ability to control detail with a familiar expand and collapse operation, but could it reorganize according to structure, the second major feature of outlining? Text on rails. It does have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I have a couple more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is there a directory of interesting public graphs created by Roam users.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it a web? Can I link to other people's graphs? What if I create my own Roam-like product, can my graphs be incorporated into other people's?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Observations&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I spent some time a few years ago brainstorming with Ward Cunningham, the great wiki dev, about how we could combine outlining and wikis. We didn't figure it out. It seems Roam, or one of the products it has inspired, may have it. Andrew Shell, who has spent more time with Ward recently said he had the same thought.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I should really spend some time learning this product, but it's hard to find that kind of time. This is one of the problems with software development. It's not like listening to music, which you can do while you are driving a car, or seeing a movie, which takes at most a few hours. Learning to use a software product can take months or even years. Very few products get used by most developers, which is a big reason we keep reinventing each others' wheels.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Long story&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I have to distill this down to something shorter, but don't have the time right now..&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I first showed up in Silicon Valley, after spending a couple of years in Madison making my first outliner (and getting a CS degree), I was disappointed to find out that someone else had thought of outliners before I had, years earlier, and had developed one, and made a big splash, of sorts -- but opinion-leaders were just as puzzled about his product as I found people were with mine. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Now I'm having a different feeling, after I stopped trying to make outliners pop up everywhere, and turned to other interesting products such as system-level scripting, RSS readers and web CMSes -- that now a new generation of devs is trying again. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We had tens of thousands of users of our outliners in the 80s, not millions. People who use outliners are rare, I found. I think it may be possible that doesn't have to be that way, there's nothing very hard about using an outliner, but people have to be interested in how they organize and use info, to see the possibility of tools to make that more efficient, and most people aren't that interested.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The product didn't take off until it did something other than outlining -- presentations. Some people asked if they could just have the outliner, and others wanted just the presenter. Which raised the question, why are these two very distinct functions, in one app? Shouldn't they be split into two, so users could plug them into other tools? This is a big idea, that still hasn't seen its day in the sun.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;That made me turn to making glue that could combine the features of products to make a hybrid product. That's the germ of an idea that led to Frontier. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, when I knock on any developer's door and ask about their connections to the outside world, this is what I'm getting at. I once approached a company making a notification system if they supported &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.co/&quot;&gt;rssCloud&lt;/a&gt;. They said it was a third-party opportunity and sent me back a link to their developer site (it cost money to be a developer, btw). This felt like when I approached &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/06/whatHasPodcastingAccomplis.html#yesPodcastingIsHugeHeSaysButLookAtHowItsDominatedByNprThatMeansRadioWonHeSaysThePromiseOfPodcastingWhichWasAnOverturningOfTheHierarchyWasALosingProposition&quot;&gt;WBUR&lt;/a&gt; at the dawn of podcasting to offer to work with them on a new kind of public radio, and they sent me a prospectus for giving them money. Or the time in 1978 that I cold-called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/18/pressFreedomIsNotMyFreedom.html&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt; and told them I knew how to create a computerized encyclopedia and would they like to work with me, and they sent a salesman to try to sell me books! The guy was persistent, we kind of became friends, but he never understood one word of what I was talking about. Heh. I guess it was hard to understand that someday they would be on the web, but this was way before the web existed. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Anyway, I want to know what kind of product Roam is making. One that welcomes the rest of the world, or one that wants to be its own world. Not really judging, just trying to understand. It's like asking if you want to be a cop or the Chief of Police. (A rabbi, or god?)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: Ultimately I personally decided I wanted to be a cop. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;👮‍♂️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PPS: Anyone else working in this area, if you're planning an API, let's collaborate, I have some working code in this area. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PPPS: I wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Michalski&quot;&gt;Jerry Michalski&lt;/a&gt; has looked at this? He was and is an advocate of a product called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jerrysbrain.com/&quot;&gt;The Brain&lt;/a&gt;, it seems a lot like Roam too. If Jerry likes it, that means something, imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's about it for now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was telling one of the devs I work with yesterday about Lotus 1-2-3's macro language. I'm going in that direction again, I think the web needs a scripting language. Not one written for devs, but for people who think of themselves as users. That was the thing about 1-2-3. Also Hypercard. And my own product, UserLand Frontier. The idea that there are programmers who would reject the idea that they are programmers. It's a very subtle idea, people who are great hackers in the sense that they will work endlessly to find a way to do the thing they must do, who will develop a deep understanding of the problem they want to solve, but not as much depth on the nature of programming. Mitch Kapor was one of these people. He wrote a product in 1980 or so called VisiPlot. Written in BASIC. It sold really well. Programmers didn't like it. But they sold a lot because it worked really well with Visicalc, the leading spreadsheet of the day. He went on to found Lotus, and they put a macro language into 1-2-3, and the loop was closed. A user created a tool for other users to create tools for other users. The beat goes on. I love the idea of empowering users to create the products they want out of the components us &quot;serious&quot; devs create.</description>

			<description>I had a bunch of errands to run today and thought to get my car washed, to get rid of all the caked-on mud from the winter. It was so dirty, you couldn't even tell it was a white car. When I pulled up to the car wash the guy was just waiting for me, far away from the entrance way. I kind of got annoyed and opened the window and asked if he worked there. He asked if I have a mask. I wasn't wearing one. This is the attitude of a vaccinated citizen. Sometimes we forget to wear the mask, even though I know that's no excuse. Rather than say &quot;Hey bud, I'm vaccinated,&quot; I just put the mask on. I felt a bit ashamed because I used to be so militant and vigilant about masks. I wonder if other vaccinated folk are having a similar experience.</description>

			<description>About politics, I'm not one of those people who cherry-picks bits of news to support a cherished theory. I try to see all the info that's available to me, and I do change my mind, sometimes in a very big way. I used to vote for Republicans, don't ask me why, I can't believe it myself. But I stopped that nonsense in 2004, and ever since I can't imagine why any sane person would. I also know that Andrew Cuomo was part of a very nasty campaign against Ed Koch on behalf of his father, Mario Cuomo, when both were running for mayor of NYC. They were &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/ed-koch-held-decades-long-grudge-against-cuomos-over-vote-for-cuomo-not-the-homo-posters&quot;&gt;picking on Koch&lt;/a&gt; because he was a single man, questioning his sexual orientation. Back then this was nasty bullshit, but it didn't disqualify his father. Today, if the word ever got around, if people knew the slogan they were using, it would probably ruin Governor Andrew, as it should. To this day I can't hear the name Cuomo without thinking of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=cuomo+homo&quot;&gt;bit of nasty&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the Cuomos ended up fucking themselves, and they deserve it.</description>

			<description>I'm also curious about how short people's memories are, apparently, and if people have any thoughts about how close the journalists came to throwing out Joe Biden's candidacy for president in April and May of 2020. Now, as president, he's doing a great job (I think he is, despite my not supporting him in the primary). But he was almost Frankened. There was no process with Biden, it was as if by magic, the journalists decided to give him a pass, and let him run for president without making an issue of the accusations of sexual assault. No explanation. They just erased our memories and went on. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_sexual_assault_allegation&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; didn't forget. :-)</description>

			<description>I think business, politics and journalism must have a code of ethics, and that includes treating everyone fairly. But we don't do that. We destroy lives of innocent people in the name of justice, which is exactly why I oppose the death penalty. Decisions about life and death must not be part of a political process, and neither should someone's banishment from public life. If the charges stick, if we believe the person is really guilty, first take steps to protect potential victims, then have a process for determining innocence or guilt, and apply that process to everyone equally, regardless of whether they are a nominee for president, governor of a big state, or just some random schmuck. This is America. We believe in protecting people from mobs. We are nothing if we allow mobs to tear people down. And we are living through a period where people do just that. This is not acceptable.</description>

			<description>I'm sure at the time many people thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; was doing god's work by protecting America from un-Americans. That was really a concept in postwar America. American citizens who were un-American. Now, from the perspective of history, we can see how wrong that was. And I'm sure in the future, if America survives, we will look at this time the same way.</description>

			<title>Personal publishing machines</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sad moment. I was doing a lookup for a bit about a programmer of my generation, I wanted to write about some of his ideas. I found they had a lot about him in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://computerhistory.org/&quot;&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;. I started looking around at the other people they interviewed. I knew all of them, they knew me. But for some reason my ideas and my work are not part of their record. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why? Probably because I was the main blogger in Silicon Valley in the early days of the web. You've seen how they respond to journalism. How do you think they felt about one of their own writing publicly about what he thought of what they were doing. I was hoping they would join me. That's how I develop. By doing. And then building the software to support what I'm doing. That imho is part of the history that belongs in the Computer History Museum. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they must be missing a good 50 percent of the story. The literature of the web. They didn't understand how these were not just personal computers we were developing, they were personal publishing machines. Now in hindsight, they should adjust the image they're trying to project into the future. These machines were used for something they have never appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Fingers crossed about tonight's email. If you're reading this at midnight on Tuesday morning, it worked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

When they get dirty, I throw them in the washing machine with the clothes. And re-stack them. And they're nicer to use than napkins.</description>

			<title>About Roam's product</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my correspondents on Twitter, I think I'm starting to figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=roam+research&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roam's&lt;/a&gt; product. I am guessing about some of these things, using the blogger's ethos, put your mistakes out there for everyone to see so you can learn faster. :-) &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Roam's world an outline is computed, not stored. There is no &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; file for an outline, as with my outliners. There is a database with blocks of text, and they are connected to other nodes/blocks through links that are represented textually by double-square brackets or with a hashtag as in Twitter. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In Roam, the outline hierarchy is a way of browsing the results of a query. I've often thought of this as an interesting way of doing things, and even have an experiment up that I think is Roam-like, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=roam&quot;&gt;thesaurus.land&lt;/a&gt;. It's a way of navigating a database of synonyms, using an outline structure as the presentation format. It works.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can you reorganize an outline in Roam? I haven't heard about anyone doing that. This is one of the reasons I'm not sure Roam actually is an outliner. In my world, an outliner has two defining functions: 1. You have control of detail, via expand and collapse and 2. You can reorganize according to structure. The text is on rails. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;People expect by entering all their ideas into Roam's database that there will eventually be serendipities, things they will learn by seeing connections they had not seen before. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You are expected to use Roam for all your note-taking. Many people see Roam as a replacement for Evernote. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In my world, OPML support is not incidental. Each of my outliners is a church, but the religion is OPML. There is no lock-in in this world. You can use any other tool that can read or write OPML. So when I ask if Roam supports OPML, I'm asking if their product can play with products that are compatible with mine. This is like asking, imho, if a news reader can deal with RSS. With OPML the standard is rock solid. For some reason no one has screwed with it (thankful).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Can I use my own editing tools to get my ideas into their database? I don't know. I suspect a developer could create a bridge. Most of my writing is available in OPML. There are lots of examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; that holds my blog content starting in May 2017. The rest of it is on the web, and I can provide a zip archive for a developer who wants to try importing all 26-plus years of my blog. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Cuomo, BBC, men, women and hate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why do I write so much about men, women and hate. Because I guess it's taboo, and my life was in many ways formed around dysfunction between genders, and I feel fear when I see a man taken down, fear that it's going to happen to me. I'm pretty sure many other men feel the same, because I've been in places where men can talk privately, and this is a big topic, the fear that our lives will be ruined. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Even so, I don't think I'm alone as a man who seeks the approval of women. This might be the single driving force in my life, probably going back to birth. I kid you not. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I appreciate not being &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=excoriate&quot;&gt;excoriated&lt;/a&gt; for touching this third rail. I tiptoe up to this topic, but then I'm getting older, with less at stake, and the world is crumbling anyway, so why not take a chance. I think there may be a resolution possible, maybe it'll come at the last minute, in time to get us focused on solving the problems we share, not just the ones that divide us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wrote earlier...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just heard, on the BBC, about a book entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Hate-Women-Misogyny-ebook/dp/B08QY6PXX5/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Men Who Hate Women&lt;/a&gt; written by a woman. I don't doubt that there are men who do hate women. On the other hand, I also don't doubt that there are women who hate men. Maybe if we worked on all the hate, what an idea that would be. In the interview the author said that hate speech by men includes the statement that not all men hate women. We always have to be so careful because you never know what's going to be considered hateful. Not hating women and saying so is not hate, imho, it's more like pleading for mercy. To think it's hate is straight out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6146-war-is-peace-freedom-is-slavery-ignorance-is-strength&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;. Further, it's exactly this kind of crap that makes people fear women, because they can ruin a man's life so easily. I've seen it happen. And when it does, it does not, imho, in any way help anyone. It's just more of what you hated about men being applied to men, and probably feeding more hate all around. You can't stop hate with fear. Also: every man had a mother, and early in life that little man was putty in that woman's hands. If you want to fix the problems, and make life better for women, you have to work on women's attitudes too, and help that little dude love &lt;i&gt;himself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/invictus&quot;&gt;Invictus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/70118779#:~:text=2009%20%7C%20PG%2D13%20%7C%202h,Watch%20all%20you%20want.&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, a 2009 movie about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela&quot;&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; and rugby in South Africa. It's not an incredibly great movie, but it's worth watching to learn how Mandela treated the whites who oppressed blacks during &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid&quot;&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;, which was ended, as Mandela became president. It's hard to summarize the whole philosophy in a short blog post, but I'll try. When you win, try to protect the dignity of the people you defeated, assuming you have to live with them. He would say the women's movement in 2021 is doing it wrong, by aiming to destroy the lives of men. It may make you feel good in the moment, but it's only going to perpetuate the problem, perhaps even make it worse, as the fear becames betrayal because some men who are charged really are innocent, and that turns into the hate we &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; want to try to overcome. Everyone suffers when people are abused. I know this first hand, from the experience of my parents and how that was passed down to my generation. The thing to do is to stop all abuse, learn where its roots are, and help people overcome the history that makes them view the world the way they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Earlier today the NYT published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/opinion/andrew-cuomo.html&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; about Cuomo &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/14/nytEditorialScreen.png&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The governor has lost his political allies and the public’s confidence.&quot; There's no question about the first part, lots of Democratic office-holders in New York have called for him to resign. But there are no polls that show that he's lost the confidence of the voters. For a few days last week I thought it was over, he should resign, because they're never going to let him be a functioning governor again. But I get an email from him every day, and he's going forward with the business of helping New Yorkers deal with the pandemic. Without him, we'd be as adrift as every other state. So I say, stay in office Governor Cuomo. Let the investigation run its course, let the people see, clearly, what the charges are, and how they're substantiated, and then we'll talk. The idea that such a huge decision that has so much affect on New Yorkers, should be made in a rush, without our participation &amp;mdash; no one has made that case yet. This is our decision to make, collectively. Times editors get one vote, the same as every other voter in New York. And imho, it's wrong for them to say the public is losing confidence and then offer no evidence to back that up.</description>

			<description>I wonder if they have arguments within the NYT Editorial Board about whether or not &quot;the public&quot; is something they can fudge. When they say &quot;the public&quot; is losing confidence in the governor, should they back that up with data, or just say it because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8UZn7PmyXc&amp;t=58s&quot;&gt;feels right&lt;/a&gt; to them.</description>

			<title>Cuomo</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone polled New York voters on whether they want Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign? I haven’t seen any results. The journalists and politicians pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; out just like they’re pushing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/13/politics/andrew-cuomo-chuck-schumer-kirsten-gillibrand/index.html&quot;&gt;Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; out now. Why not have a &lt;i&gt;somewhat&lt;/i&gt; democratic process? Wouldn’t the cause be better served?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why Cuomo matters. First, being fair to everyone matters. And when you see someone rushed off, as is happening with Cuomo, and what happened to Franken, and other people you probably never heard of, this has a nasty side-effect with people who identify with Cuomo and Franken and the others. They think you're going to do the same to them. Some would say if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about. Hah. You know where that comes from. That's the kind of shit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; used to say about people who worried about being purged in one of his un-American trials. It's a common thread, and totally anti-democratic. We believe in due process here, not in mob rule. And what's happening here is mob rule, even if you aren't willing to say so publicly, you know it is. Take a close look at why you're not willing to say it publicly. What does that say about where you live. And what does it say about you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The more they try to rush Cuomo's resignation, the more I want it to stop. I'm a NY voter, btw.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Threadviewer update</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Threadviewer is back up. I have to admit to having serious brainfog about this project, but I slowed down, and did some more verbs docs, and just got it working much better than it was previously. Here's the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370863807715762179&quot;&gt;test thread&lt;/a&gt; and here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://threadviewer.com/1370863807715762179&quot;&gt;threadviewer view&lt;/a&gt; of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That should continue to work, even as I post more tweets through the night and into tomorrow (knock wood). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It should also reflect any additions and deletions to the thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;However after 24 hours, it will disappear. Obviously that's not good! But one step at a time. I want to make sure this much works as I expect it would. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>What we want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure we all want the same thing, what's fair, to be ourselves, for people to care about us. I don't think it matters what our identity is, at the core, we're pretty similar. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing we have in common is that we believe and share lies about each other. That keeps us isolated and from working with each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Rule I believe is our salvation. Respect the differences, and always when you can, give the benefit of the doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If someone says someone else is evil, focus on what you know not what they say.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why I wanted the vaccine</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who I have known for a long time, who I love very much, who is one of the smartest people I know, who I would trust with my life, who says she does not want the vaccine. I have told her I'm going to write about it, without naming her, because the goal isn't to shame her, not even slightly, but rather to explore why I was enthusiastic to receive the vaccination, and to be open about it, to share my thoughts and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First, why I wanted the vaccine. The main reason: I was horrified to think of dying alone, suffocating, feeling awful, surrounded by people who were overworked and exhausted. Your body is theirs. Your life is in their hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are harsh places. It's never quiet, the lights are always on, people come and go at all times. You're in pain, weak, and groggy from the meds they give you, and you have to grapple with whatever the future holds for you. I've been there myself, with parents who were gravely ill, this is not a place you want to go in good times, and it most definitely is not a place to be during a pandemic, where the odds of survival, if you're sick enough to be in the hospital, are awful. 1 in 10, say. So you're lying there, feeling terrible, with no one to help your soul through the most difficult thing a person has to do, knowing you're almost certainly not getting out of there alive. The fear of dying that way overwhelms me. I'd do almost anything to avoid it. Take a vaccine, twice? Sure! No problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay so what about the other side. Why would you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to take a vaccine. I listened, and skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandemic.solari.com/family-financial-disclosure-form-for-covid-19-injections/&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt; my friend sent. And I thought about it. Conceding that the vaccine makers are all big companies with problems in their history, I also know they went through a vetting process with the FDA, and other regulators elsewhere. Yes, it's possible that the government officials could be bribed, but I honestly don't believe they were. Had it only been the Trump government that was supervising it, I would have been more suspicious than I am now. I'd say I'm 95% confident that the FDA can be trusted, and they say the vaccines can be trusted so that's 95% good enough for me. Considering the risk of the awful death I outlined in the first part, this would be enough for me to risk it. But there's more. Suppose the government was in cahoots with the drug manufacturers, what is the probability that that fact would not leak? That's where my real trust lies. I think most professionals in every profession want to do it well. But in this case, &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; doctor and researcher would have to be in on it. And that's just not possible, imho. The world doesn't work that way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As much as I love and trust this friend, I also have a friend who is a biomedical researcher who I've known since he was a little person, five or six years old. A real brat who grew up to be a wonderful friend, who I have been talking with since the beginning of the pandemic. He's now in his mid-30s, and because of his field, had early access to the vaccine. He took it. The question of me not taking it never came up in our talks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I follow lots of doctors' advice. Some of it has been awful and left me with disabilities. Ones that I can live with and are not painful, and ones which are actually hard to live with. So I am very skeptical of the competence of individual doctors. But I also understand that their prescriptions are the result of a huge amount of testing, statistics, cost and risk analysis. With vaccines, they aren't just prescribing a treatment for individuals, I also got the vaccine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is true of all medicine. The drugs we take to control our diseases aren't designed for each of us individually, they are designed for all humans, we are all assumed to be the same, because there's no other sane way to do it. That's why they print the side-effects warnings on the labels, so we know that while this treatment works for most people, for some it will hurt them, and for some it &lt;i&gt;will kill&lt;/i&gt; them. I don't want to die that way either, but I understand statistics and probability and I also understand that I am part of a community, and my health affects yours in a pandemic, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's more to the story, but this is enough for now. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="I have a friend who I have known for a long time, who I love very much, who is one of the smartest people I know, who I would trust with my life, who says she does not want the vaccine. I have told her I'm going to write about it, without naming her, because the goal isn't to shame her, not even slightly, but rather to explore why I was enthusiastic to receive the vaccination, and to be open about it, to share my thoughts and experiences." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:06:02 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a160602"/>
				<source:outline text="First, why I wanted the vaccine. The main reason: I was horrified to think of dying alone, suffocating, feeling awful, surrounded by people who were overworked and exhausted. Your body is theirs. Your life is in their hands." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:08:17 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a160817"/>
				<source:outline text="Hospitals are harsh places. It's never quiet, the lights are always on, people come and go at all times. You're in pain, weak, and groggy from the meds they give you, and you have to grapple with whatever the future holds for you. I've been there myself, with parents who were gravely ill, this is not a place you want to go in good times, and it most definitely is not a place to be during a pandemic, where the odds of survival, if you're sick enough to be in the hospital, are awful. 1 in 10, say. So you're lying there, feeling terrible, with no one to help your soul through the most difficult thing a person has to do, knowing you're almost certainly not getting out of there alive. The fear of dying that way overwhelms me. I'd do almost anything to avoid it. Take a vaccine, twice? Sure! No problem." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:41:49 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a164149"/>
				<source:outline text="Okay so what about the other side. Why would you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to take a vaccine. I listened, and skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandemic.solari.com/family-financial-disclosure-form-for-covid-19-injections/&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt; my friend sent. And I thought about it. Conceding that the vaccine makers are all big companies with problems in their history, I also know they went through a vetting process with the FDA, and other regulators elsewhere. Yes, it's possible that the government officials could be bribed, but I honestly don't believe they were. Had it only been the Trump government that was supervising it, I would have been more suspicious than I am now. I'd say I'm 95% confident that the FDA can be trusted, and they say the vaccines can be trusted so that's 95% good enough for me. Considering the risk of the awful death I outlined in the first part, this would be enough for me to risk it. But there's more. Suppose the government was in cahoots with the drug manufacturers, what is the probability that that fact would not leak? That's where my real trust lies. I think most professionals in every profession want to do it well. But in this case, &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; doctor and researcher would have to be in on it. And that's just not possible, imho. The world doesn't work that way." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:12:08 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a161208"/>
				<source:outline text="As much as I love and trust this friend, I also have a friend who is a biomedical researcher who I've known since he was a little person, five or six years old. A real brat who grew up to be a wonderful friend, who I have been talking with since the beginning of the pandemic. He's now in his mid-30s, and because of his field, had early access to the vaccine. He took it. The question of me not taking it never came up in our talks." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:23:12 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a162312"/>
				<source:outline text="I follow lots of doctors' advice. Some of it has been awful and left me with disabilities. Ones that I can live with and are not painful, and ones which are actually hard to live with. So I am very skeptical of the competence of individual doctors. But I also understand that their prescriptions are the result of a huge amount of testing, statistics, cost and risk analysis. With vaccines, they aren't just prescribing a treatment for individuals, I also got the vaccine for everyone else." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:24:48 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a162448"/>
				<source:outline text="This is true of all medicine. The drugs we take to control our diseases aren't designed for each of us individually, they are designed for all humans, we are all assumed to be the same, because there's no other sane way to do it. That's why they print the side-effects warnings on the labels, so we know that while this treatment works for most people, for some it will hurt them, and for some it &lt;i&gt;will kill&lt;/i&gt; them. I don't want to die that way either, but I understand statistics and probability and I also understand that I am part of a community, and my health affects yours in a pandemic, and vice versa." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:36:56 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/03/12/160715.html?title=whyIWantedTheVaccine#a163656"/>

			<title>Slow down to hurry up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm juggling too many balls in my development work. I just lost about 24 hours tracking down a problem. I had some code outside of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitter&quot;&gt;davetwitter&lt;/a&gt; module that really belonged in there, so after a half-day of working on something else, I decided to quickly move the code from where it was to where I wanted it. However since I was actively developing the davetwitter module, I included it using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; call to include a copy of the file, without going through NPM; and here's the key thing, in one place, and in another I used NPM. I couldn't understand why a properly initialized config object at startup would all of a sudden be completely uninitialized when I used it later. The answer was there were two davetwitters, one initialized the other not. A sloppy mistake I would never have made in a bootstrap. This kind of thing only happens when factoring. I guess the moral of the story is I should only attempt these integrations at the beginning of the day, when no other project is loaded into my brain, and I'd be more likely to spot these kinds of mismatches. In the end it cost me a lot of time to try to do it quickly. That's a lesson I've had to learn many times, and still am learning. I even have a slogan for it -- &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Someone said tweets are like potato chips and therefore should be limited to 280 chars. I took a few screen shots of tweets that lead to long reads or watches. These are not potato chips. People think of twitter as a home for baby squirrels, this was clever marketing in the beginning, but now it's where the political and cultural world is centered. The former president of the United States was banned from twitter. The potato chip people need to let that sink in. It's a place where real communication happens. The better the tools, imho, the better it works.</description>

			<description>They like to say the apps are better than the web, but I find the opposite is true. When I click a link in the twitter app it doesn’t take me to the web. I don’t have all my tools where ever it is they take me. and When I click a link to a tweet I’m taken to a dead end. Ughh.</description>

			<title>Threadviewer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new app is coming soon called Threadviewer, not quite ready yet, hopefully tomorrow. Here's how it works. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You give it the ID of a tweet that's at the top of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;. The app loads all the tweets it can find that are replies to the tweet with that ID, written by the author of the original tweet and shows them inside a box, in chronologic order, as a nice sequence of easy to read paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It does what I need it to do. Now twitter can be a writing space for me that flows into my blog. I also have thread.center if I need it, that goes the other way. BTW, you can use this with WordPress, Medium, Substack, email, whatever you like. It's just copy/paste from the threadviewer rendering. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's an here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/11/aThreadviewerUrl.png&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a Threadviewer URL. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1370040083055796229&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote to be sucked into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/11/160039.html?title=morningTwitterThread&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Medium was founded in 2012, I was afraid they were going to do to writing what YouTube did to video, what Twitter did to short outbursts. Medium is a nice product, but it was too strong, and too much of a silo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Medium didn't exist I'd have the same fear about Substack, but they are there to keep each other from dominating. And I still hope a more distributed approach appears, esp since running a server these days is getting much easier and cheaper and is only going to get more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder why Medium hasn't directly competed with Substack. It isn't that hard to ad email subscriptions to a product like Medium. Have they done it and I missed it? I would have thought it would be automatic.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with Clubhouse. A bit of a juggernaut. I tried it, was briefly addicted, and then for some reason I lost interest. It was a time-filler, like Twitter is, for example. When I reach a milestone in other work, I take a break by checking out Twitter. You can't do that with Clubhouse. There is no 15 minute Clubhouse break. It's either a few seconds, or an hour. I don't usually have an hour in the middle of the day to goof off, and at night I'm not at the computer and in need of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now Twitter is going where Clubhouse is. I'll try it. I think it has a chance because Twitter and Clubhouse really should be more integrated. And Twitter itself doesn't live with the limits outside devs have. They can create connections we can't.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The world somehow has missed that Twitter has a great API, and it runs fast, and they are expanding it, not contracting it. Briefly, when Dick Costolo was CEO, they made a mistake that they quickly corrected, by cutting off certain (but not all) external devs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since then they've been very liberal and reliable. I love using the Twitter API. Of course I would love it even more if they got rid of the 280 char limit. I'm usually good at figuring out angles on things in tech, but I have never seen the logic behind this limit, when they allow so many other much more complex data types to be attached to tweets. I would have thought given all their other payload types that by now they would have a 64K or greater limit to the amount of text attached to a tweet&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
