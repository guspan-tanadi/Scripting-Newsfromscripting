			<description>If you're shocked by how Musk processes stuff, carve out a little time over the holidays and watch the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(season_1)&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. I lived in there from 1979 to 2008, and I was surprised at how real the show was even though it's a comedy.</description>

			<description>Another good thing to stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)&quot;&gt;Moneyball&lt;/a&gt;, which is on Netflix through the end of the month. I love sports movies, and this is a first class baseball story, but it's also about math, and courage, and it's one of Brad Pitt's best &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt_filmography&quot;&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt;. I must've seen it five times before watching it the other day. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; is good too.</description>

I first learned how to modularize big projects with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Pascal_Programming/Units&quot;&gt;UCSD Pascal units&lt;/a&gt;. The Apple II version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/18/erikSandbergdiments1983ThinktankReview.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; was constructed out of units. But it wasn't until today that I realized there is an equivalent to that in JavaScript. Not sure they even have a name, but if you create a function that's designed to be called via with the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; verb in a certain way, it behaves just like a unit, if you know that. I wish someone had pointed that out to me earlier, but I doubt there are very many serious UCSD Pascal devs using JavaScript in the same way. On the server of course we have packages which totally are units, that was clear from the start.</description>

			<description>The second thing I realized is that if I were teaching a second semester Comp Sci class I would first have the students write the app side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth&quot;&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt;, and struggle with all the weird concepts and awful docs that usually accompany OAuth installations, and then as a follow-up project, I'd have them write the other side of OAuth, the one that makes all the weird rules and has shitty docs. I'm doing that now for the first time, and wish I had done it a long time ago. I think it's actually easier to write your own OAuth server than it is to use someone else's. I'm making sure btw that the example code is pristine absolutely obvious, and you should be able to just plop the code down in your app without any fuss or muss. At least those are my goals. We'll see how it turns out. ;-)</description>

			<description>On &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html#a150537&quot;&gt;WordPress supporting&lt;/a&gt; title-less feed items: I'm really happy to see them do this. We're in a moment where we might be able to straighten out this huge problem with the web, that limits how we can integrate systems that support short and long posts. We've been divided since Twitter gave up on their RSS feeds, a long time ago. Mastodon required some convincing to stick to no titles in their feeds, rather than give in. And WordPress stepping up to make this transition means we have more reasons for other feed displayers to do so. So this is totally a win for RSS, and I see that as a win for me because &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;my product is interop&lt;/a&gt;. I made that switch a long time ago. I make products too but interop comes first.</description>

			<description>I've been seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1604983112609325056&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; saying that the W3C is spinning out of MIT and it's not going well. Not sure how much we depend on the W3C. They appear to be controlled by the big companies, and they've rarely been interested in building on my work, instead reinventing it. So if the W3C goes away, well I don't know if I'll miss it.</description>

Like going to a diner in Ohio to find out what Trumpsters are up to as if that were measuring anything credible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am an extreme liberal, esp when it comes to the web. My creds are excellent. And I love my Model Y. I feel like its a privilege to drive it every time I get in the car. And I've owned some terrific cars in my life. There are some cars that are just great to drive. So great that their flaws are not relevant. That Elon Musk is tied to the product is unfortunate. But until I drive a car that's equal to the car I have, I'm not going to bend to the bullshit the press is putting out there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also still use Twitter. I'm not going to let Musk chase me off. He'll have to suspend me if he wants me off. I would regret that. I've been on Twitter since 2006. Musk can do whatever he wants, Twitter is big enough for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I voted for Obama twice, Hillary and Biden. So fuck you if you think driving a Tesla is like being a MAGA.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two things are completely disconnected, and the press is working overtime to try to connect them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I see what you're doing and this is why I hate journalism. Kick back and stop inventing the news. Report it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Textcasting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is like podcasting but for text. A blog is a way to make text that can be cast. So is a microblog. Or a chat app. The idea is that they should all be able to accept and pass on text without losing elements they don't understand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if I pass a titled item through a system that can't handle titles, no problem, but if when it transmits the text it must pass on the title. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A short list of required features must be supported, in transit, including simple styling, links, optional titles, unlimited length, enclosures for podcasting, ability to edit. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This won't happen overnight, but the apps that do this will be ones that are fair to users, and will build a broad set of varied apps that all work on the same data. No lock-in is possible with this approach. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Mastodon and RSS, as precedents</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A series of tweets dashed off in the middle of the night on my iPad.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like the precedent Mastodon sets. A server product installed by users. A slow rise as opposed to an overnight success. A dominant competitor falls apart just enough to let a new entrant rise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also love the precedent RSS has set. Enduring a long PR campaign against it by tech giants, VCs and pundits, it persisted, having no employees or burn rate it just needs users to keep it going until both twitter and Google Reader are gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Bet the naysayers didnâ€™t see RSS surviving through all that, but they donâ€™t study history. Basic formats like RSS once entrenched never go away. Somewhere under NYC the pipes laid in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stuyvesant&quot;&gt;Peter Stuyvesant's&lt;/a&gt; time are still carrying water to NYers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere deep inside every Chromebook there beats the heart of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12018/why-did-ibm-make-the-pc-bios-source-code-public&quot;&gt;IBM ROM BIOS&lt;/a&gt; clone still handling all the events from the keyboard.  And RSS is there now to provide Mastodon a solid path to informing people who donâ€™t even use the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We pick up from where we left off when Twitter and Google Reader plopped their fat asses down on the feediverse. Hopefully we donâ€™t let that happen again but I have my doubts as users flock to VC products just as dominant as those who are now vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We can now write postmortems on twitter. We know where all the promise, dreaming, vision, puffy news pieces led â€” it always was a powerful weapon waiting to be used that way, we donâ€™t know itâ€™s limits, but weâ€™re going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Also on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; they say &quot;it's like podcasts -- but for reading.&quot; That's brilliant. Probably leaves a bunch of people scratching their heads. But this is where we're going. Making the world of text work as smoothly as the world of audio. Next step is to work on interop. So I can copy a full-featured &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcast&lt;/a&gt; item from an app that doesn't support all the features (like Twitter or Mastodon) and paste it into one that does (like NetNewsWire or FeedLand), and voila -- everything is there. It's a simple change that would make it impossible for any participant in the network to lock you in. Your ideas would be free to move instead of being locked up. Feeds get us most of the way there, but there's a little more to do.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lonseidman/status/1603770626275266561&quot;&gt;Lon Seidman&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Funny how my RSS reader keeps working perfectly fine well over a decade after I set it up. No bans, no algorithms, just dutifully spits out what I'm following each time I Iog in.&quot; That's because if someone tried to lock you in you'd just switch. Having something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; under an industry keeps it honest and respectful of users.</description>

			<description>A weird thought. Musk gets upset and calls a timeout. Twitter goes off the air for 24 hours. As Judy Tenuta &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; -- It could happen. ;-)</description>

			<description>Last night I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/12/15.html#a023149&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; here announcing a new feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; that lets you connect an email address to your account. I just wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/151&quot;&gt;more detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of what's going on with a place to ask questions if you're having trouble. This is important, it's a backup against a problem with Twitter. Better safe than sorry! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, it's worth noting that your subscriptions are public info, so even if for some reason you couldn't log onto your account you could still access your subscriptions, because anyone can. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&quot;&gt;my subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; are here. You can even get them &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/opml?screenname=davewiner&amp;catname=podcasts&quot;&gt;by category&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Something that was forgotten from the old days of blogging. We don't blog to make money, rather we blog as part of what we do to make money. Important difference. Since I switched back to full blogging in 2017 and not writing for social media, after some time building tools, and re-learning how to ship stuff from my blog, I used it to launch FeedLand earlier this year, and the results have been outstanding. People are using it. That was the goal. Blogging makes bigger things possible. It's how I organize my work and work with the people who use the product of my work. We observed this in 2004 and beyond as we launched podcasting. It happened a lot faster than with blogging, because we had blogs to promote podcasting. This stuff builds. When we get interop the power tends to expand as a multiple, not linearly.</description>

			<description>The idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is like podcasting. When you create a podcast it isnâ€™t bound to one player.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I think we should all adopt a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBB&lt;/a&gt; and help them get started blogging and tied into the feed network. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need leaders from outside the geek community. And they need help finding their way through the web of interconnected services. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Open systems are harder to navigate than the silos. This is a fact, always will be so.

I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/163100.html?title=starlinkSetup&quot;&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; installed as a backup, and it wasn't working very well last time I tried it, presumably because it didn't have a good view of the sky. I thought this might change in the winter when all the leaves are gone, and I'm happy to report that it did.

			<source:outline text="Good morning, my Spectrum wifi service got slow this morning, then very slow and then went out a few minutes ago. I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/12/163100.html?title=starlinkSetup&quot;&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; installed as a backup, and it wasn't working very well last time I tried it, presumably because it didn't have a good view of the sky. I thought this might change in the winter when all the leaves are gone, and I'm happy to report that it did.

			<description>BTW, yesterday we paused new signons to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. There were a lot of reasons for this. First, I didn't want a lot of users. I think of FeedLand as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt; global feed management system. Not wanting in any way to compete with the huge systems, to create yet another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1602663488157089795&quot;&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; like Twitter. I felt that we already had too many users for my liking. At some point the load on the server is going to be a problem, I wanted to stop well before we got to that point. Also, I want to do some development that would be harder with new users coming online. Remember this is not a corporate site. I am the only person working on the software and I'm responsible for keeping the service running at a technical level, and dealing with trolls, spammers and abusers, which thankfully have not been a problem yet, but I know from experience that it's just a matter of time.</description>

			<description>There's this great line in Sleeper where the character played by Woody Allen was asleep for 100 years and when he woke wanted to know how the world was destroyed. They said a guy named Albert Shanker got a nuclear weapon. That's a 1970s NYC joke. If you knew Albert Shanker, you'd get it. If they were remaking the movie now instead of Albert Shanker it'd be Elon Musk and instead of a nuke it'd be Twitter and instead of being science fiction it'd be true. Now that's still an Albert Shanker joke, but soon there will be plenty of Elon Musk jokes. Lots of them. I'm never wrong about things like this btw. ;-)</description>

			<title>Why you stopped blogging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was a choice between:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;1. All the tools of the web, esp linking (which is itself a social network btw).&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;2. The very limited writing tools of Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You chose the latter because that's where the people were.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Personally I never stopped blogging, I kept trying to get my blogging to fit in with Twitter, Facebook, Medium, etc. In 2017 I gave that up, and just blogged as a blog. I accepted that most people wouldn't read what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I realized my writing had become crap because I was trying to get it into all those places. I realized that was too much to give up, that writing was how I grew intellectually, and accepting the limits of the business people at the social networks was killing my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Too high a price.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/wavs/curly1.wav&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2014/03/13/curly.gif&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
