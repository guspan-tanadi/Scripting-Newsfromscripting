			<description>BTW, my plan is to hook &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; up to any protocol people come up with. And when I say RSS, I mean all flavors including RDF and Atom. I don't just have advice for other people, sometimes I give myself advice too. I think it's time to love RSS again. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Actually I adore them all. They are amazing people. Not only do they have great memory, but think about all the things they know. I also think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings&quot;&gt;Ken Jennings&lt;/a&gt; is the obvious best choice to be the Jeopardy host because he's such a great Jeopardy player, is immersed in all aspects of the game and he really connects with the players, and therefore the fans at home. They are all such wonderful unabashed nerds. I've been watching the show since I was a kid, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Fleming&quot;&gt;Art Fleming&lt;/a&gt; was the host, when I watched it with my mom.</description>

			<description>We're curing ourselves from Covid the way people who smoke while they quit smoking aren't actually quitting. To quit, you stop. If you take your masks off, that's like buying a pack of cigarettes, and having one or two and then finishing the pack and then getting another. I speak as an ex-smoker for over 30 years. I had all kinds of plans for quitting, but the only way to do it is to quit. We'll never get out of the Covid hole until &lt;i&gt;all of us&lt;/i&gt; commit to it and then follow through. Otherwise it's going to continue to be a lingering tragedy.</description>

My face feels naked without it. The other day I went into the supermarket without a mask and had to go back out to the car to get one. In that moment I got to think about why I wear a mask even when others aren't. It's because I want to send a message to my fellow shoppers that I care about their health. I was raised to be a considerate person. So many people were raised to be self-centered and pissy. I never want to see myself that way. Anyway it was really annoying how quickly the airlines took down their mask requirements. I suggest if you want to make your feelings known to them, stop flying until they bring the mandates back.</description>

			<description>There's a new trend in journalism where editors &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1516093318974824449&quot;&gt;turn away from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, thinking of it as a waste of time.

			<title>Site licenses</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1986, my little software company was in a weird place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had a great product almost ready to ship for the Mac. Everyone was psyched, MacUser and MacWorld, the people inside Apple, the people we leaked it to in the industry. But we were broke, couldn't make payroll. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My board was tired of the roller coaster, they told me to shut the company down. I told them they were crazy, we're sitting on the best product anyone has ever made, and the market is totally ready for it. The Mac was finally selling in huge numbers, after they fixed all the problems, and most other software devs were shutting down their mac development in the year before, we were going to have the booming mac software market virtually to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No deal. The board wouldn't put up the $400K we needed to get to shipping the product. So I went to my best friend at Apple, and told him what was going on. We were going to have to shut down before shipping the product you want so badly. I begged for their help. Man did they help us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First they gave us the money we needed to stay open as a loan. We had to put the source code to the product in escrow. We also did a second deal. They bought a site license for the product, everyone at Apple would get a copy, and in return they'd give us 40 new Mac systems with lots of memory, printers, networking. And they gave us 10 more Macs to give to our board members, which was also really smart. None of them had Macs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason I told this story is the power of the site license. I would have paid them all to use the product, because once the hardware company is standardizing on your product, you'll never go out of business as long as they're in business. And the inverse was true too. If we all had Macs maybe we'd stop thinking about making software for PCs. Back then Apple had guts and smarts. Quite a combo. Probably because they too had gone through tough times and were emerging from them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the best year of my life in the software world, and I've had some good years. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Let a thousand Twitters bloom</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A rambling brain dump about Twitter and Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Self-moderation is going to be a huge deal. Maybe something like self-driving Teslas. Which the driver controls, btw. It isn't a passive thing. If a Musk company can do that, yeah I think they can give users more control over the bullshit they have to deal with on Twitter. The thing is Twitter has been stuck since 2006 when it started. They hired people to make the system run reliably, which is fantastic, hat's off, but it needs a few more things to be able to realizae its potential as a world-scale notification system for all kinds of networked writing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe to make something workable you have to start something new, not in a half assed way.. Or maybe a no-bullshit capitalist like Musk can make it come about from the chaos of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most people have no idea how software works and is made. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A Twitter-like webservice at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;. With better docs and a JavaScript API that doesn't require developer to run a server (big deal). Effortless install on Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Let a thousand Twitters bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interop baked in from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Look, Elon made buying a car a completely online experience, moving around huge amounts of money and metal and an explosion in demand. Buying a Tesla was like buying a Mac in 1984 or an iPhone in 2007, except they're doing it 365 days a year for years. And buying a StarLink is just as easy and just as much of a sensation. If this is easy to do why do so few companies do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, if Musk was trying to buy my bank, I'd be all for it. That's how bad their software is. All banks have shit software, btw, near as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you think he can't run Twitter when he can run StarLink and Tesla, please. And why should Twitter be stuck in the mud like it has been since inception. It desperately needs some fixes, and at a minumum must be made easier to peer with. Developers can do all the work if they just add a few simple features that they probably already have implemented. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was an Apple dev in 1997 when Jobs came back. Musk is like Jobs in that he won't be scared to make the big changes that are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're lucky a guy like Musk is hanging around and willing to take on this job. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And as usual the journalists see a teeny little corner of the picture and are screaming about that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I love all the Beatles songs, but get the most, these days, out of John Lennon's songs. I learned that Lennon only partially completed his songs, leaving a lot of the work to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin&quot;&gt;George Martin&lt;/a&gt;. Keep that in mind when you listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt; (my favorite Beatles song) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtUH9z_Oey8&quot;&gt;Strawberry Fields&lt;/a&gt;, as examples. The orchestral bits are pure Martin.</description>

			<description>I have the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; for a blog. I'm sure there's better search software out there, but no one else has the sheer quantity of blog-writing over so much time in a searchable index. There are bits missing here and there, and I'm determined to fill those bits in -- but the archive goes from October 7, 1994 at 11:27AM to the present day. A lot of stuff happened in that time, and some of it happened right &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I hope someday it proves to be a useful resource to people studying this period, with the usual caveat, assuming the human species survives. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Because the weather has been delightful here the last few days, I'm afraid I got no work done this week. I basically gave up today and spent time in the sun, reading, listening to music, went for a walk, did some shopping, took a long nap in the afternoon. I guess I was overdue for some downtime. It is a wonderful time of year, winter truly is over. We will still get some coldish weather, no doubt, but the glory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains&quot;&gt;Catskills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuz5TKzaJoE&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon.

I'm also glad to see the Warriors are back in the mix with the same big three and no Kevin Durant, who I will be rooting &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; every time he takes the court. I hope Boston blows the Nets out so that embarassment for the great city of New York is over for another year. Maybe they want him back in Oklahoma? I'm interested to see if James Harden can get it together to have a good long run, and while he has never won a championship, hmmm, I don't know. He played on the Nets this year, and for that reason I question his motivations. I do not like artificially created superteams designed to win championships. And of course they rarely do. So hopefully that chapter of the NBA will be over.

			<title>Musk's Twitter, first comments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to be optimistic about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-14/elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter-for-54-20-a-share&quot;&gt;Musk's Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/14/muskLetterToTwitter.png&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; comes to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, none of the CEOs of Twitter going back to the beginning were &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;natural bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. Musk is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When he was joining the board, I thought that was good because having a user on the board of a tech company is pretty unusual, and would be a good thing. Having a user as the CEO -- even better. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there's too much religion in the UI of Twitter. Musk's ideas have been pragmatic. On the right path, imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am a customer of Tesla and StarLink, and both companies appear to be run well, and what they do is imho harder than running Twitter, which basically is the kind of service the tech industry is good at running.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My main concern with Musk as the new owner of Twitter is that Trump will be back. I think it was proven beyond any doubt that Twitter can be grossly misused, and the company has to be ready to stop its service from being used in such a harmful way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Free speech is not an absolute -- the old Shouting &lt;i&gt;fire&lt;/i&gt; in a crowded movie theater &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt;. Trump used Twitter to organize the overthrow of the US government and almost succeeded at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am also concerned that Musk will curtail the Twitter API, which is incredibly useful and under-exploited by the company and its users. I've built a lot of tech on top of the API, and would miss it if it were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I am a shareholder of Twitter and would prefer to continue to hold my stock. I was holding it as a long-term investment. Not interested in selling it at this time. Was hoping for a much larger return.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just some early morning thoughts on this topic, sure to be much discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update #1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A reader asked why I was concerned that Musk might curtail the Twitter API. Basically, because I've seen things like that happen over and over in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been through this before with Apple. When Steve Jobs returned he shut down Mac internet devs, by bundling open source versions of what our products did, somewhat. Enough to kill our markets. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When a new owner comes in and finds projects with serious staff that aren't generating revenue and have no clear purpose, they at least think about dropping them. Great example, again with Steve Jobs -- not that I disagree with what he cut, he just made huge cuts in some things that were really good and unique for a tech company, like their internal library. Most of what he cut were boondoggles, some of which competed with independent products that were better than Apple's. In other words they were spending money to hold back the market. Foolish. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update #2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;FWIW, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;warned in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter's price was too low, and that a Republican backer like Shelly Adelson or the Koch Brothers could buy it and make it run like Fox News. It's a good thing they didn't because for sure Trump would still be using Twitter to organize his coup.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;People who responded said it'd never happen because Twitter's balance sheet was too weak to justify an acquisition. They missed that not all of Twitter's value shows up on its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Sources Go Direct, explained</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sources Go Direct is a concept I've been promoting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22sources+go+direct%22&quot;&gt;long time&lt;/a&gt;, without a simple one-page explanation of what it means. Here's my attempt to solve that problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The term focuses on the flow of news. Before the web news flowed from sources to reporters to readers. Some readers were sources of course. And sometimes reporters were sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/05/07/fdBox.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;The web &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+disintermediated&quot;&gt;disintermediated&lt;/a&gt; news reporting as it did to other things. It's a fancy word that means that people went around the intermediaries. So travel agents which used to be a big thing, were replaced with Expedia and Kayak. We got information about real estate from Zillow. And the sources of reporters got blogs, and then Twitter accounts, and started going directly to the users of news. Of course there still are travel agents, and when I bought a house recently I used an agent to help me, but I did a lot of researching myself on Zillow. And there are still reporters, of course, and they use the tools that sources use, that's how they get the information they pass on to their readers. We're much better informed these days about lots of things. Some info we get through intermediaries and some we get directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the late 90s and into the 00s, we needed the term Sources Go Direct to focus our reporter friends on the role bloggers were playing. They jumped to the conclusion that we were trying to be reporters. Most of us were not. We had expertise we wanted to share that wasn't getting out through journalism. So we took matters into our own hands as soon as the technology gave us the means to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was making Mac software in 1994 and reporters were saying there was no new Mac software. I wanted  to correct that misunderstanding, so I started what eventually came to be called a blog, and then podcasting. All to get around a clogged bottleneck of news flow about something that was important to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>StarLink setup</title>

As a user, once it's set up, you're just using wifi. I ordered it as a backup for my land-based net connection from Spectrum, which sometimes goes out where I live in the mountains in upstate NY. StarLink is made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacex.com/&quot;&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, which like Tesla, is a company run by Elon Musk. Anyway, I read how simple it was to set up, so I opened the box and put it together myself and it worked. These are my notes from the setup.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a guy who normally does installations on my house, but I couldn't wait so I set up StarLink myself. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's incredible how it unboxes. No instructions, none are needed.  Here's what you get:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dish: Three parts, a dish, a stand and a pipe that connects the dish to the stand.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A wifi router with jacks for power and a cable that connects to the dish.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A 100 foot cable to connect the dish to the router. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What I did, what happened&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put the dish outside, plug in the router, connect the dish to the router and turn everything on.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I didn't get a video, but the dish moves itself around to find the clearest view of the satellite. It's out of a scifi movie. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;But the app on the iPhone still says Booting.. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I imagine it's getting an over-the-air update?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Where we're at...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I can connect to the wifi from all my devices, they just don't connect to the internet yet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Update: now instead of booting it says searching.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Will keep you posted. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/12/gatheringdata.png&quot;&gt;Gathering data&lt;/a&gt; on obstructions. Usually takes 12 hours! It's like a rocket ship. It's got a little software Mission Control built in. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's working. I have it connecting to the internet.

			<title>What if writers had choice</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for one or two service providers who are ready to offer users a choice of writing tools. To not force them to use &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; writing tools, their storage, and at best, offer a way to back up their writing. As a writer I want to use the tools I like best, and perhaps send them out through more than one channel. I don't want to be locked in, and forced to transcribe my writing for every possible service I might use.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see someone like Substack or Medium, for example, who says &quot;Write your stuff in your favorite writing tool, export it in Markdown, and give us the link. We'll take it from there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That way you could:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Use a tool that fits your writing style perfectly.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Developers would be incentivized to create such tools.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You could use more than one service, say use Substack to manage your mail list, and Medium to manage your web presence, and Facebook for discussion among your friends, Slack to discuss among your work colleagues. (BTW, Slack has a good enough API to do this already.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Great archival services could come about because they could be one of the services you cc on your writing.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Service providers could make custom toolkits to make it easy for tools to adapt to this interface. No need to master their whole API when all your users want is to shoot a story over for publication, indexing, rendering or storage.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Who knows what else will come about. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It takes two vendors to define a standard, and then there would be reason enough for all to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's amazing that we have this incredibly powerful network, but the business models of service providers protect their services by not allowing writers a choice in writing tools.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Like walking into a store. Or just driving their car. The camera is looking at the driver, then focuses on what's happening outside, to get your mind to consider that. It's at this point that you know that something momentous and bad is about to happen. In some movies it's a car crash. Or the star gets shot. Or someone runs in front of the car. There are some movies where the director doesn't prepare you for The Bad Thing, and if it's done well it can be very disturbing (if you've seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=The%20Departed&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;The Departed&lt;/a&gt; you know what I mean). Anyway, today I was walking in the springtime garden outside my house, with all the debris from fallen trees and branches. It was a rough winter. And I become conscious in a way that happens sometimes. It's uncomfortable because you connect to your animal-ness in a way that's a lot more real than usual. I always get nervous that something momentous and bad is about to happen. The feeling of consciousness in the moment and the movie-maker's technique are the same thing, and it's why you have the feeling of dread watching the movie, and in real life. Only in the movie the bad thing always happens and in real life (so far) it never does.</description>
