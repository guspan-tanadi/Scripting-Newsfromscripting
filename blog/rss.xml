They made the announcement in a vague way and with just seven days notice. I think there's a good chance they'll realize that this is a shitty way to do it, and will take it back, on one hand, but on the other hand, let's get out of here now. This is not a good place to develop products. I hoped they would leave this part of their API alone, and I expected more notice, but it didn't turn out that way. It is what it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A disclaimer, all of what I write here today is seat-of-pants. I don't know how this is going to turn out, but right now I want you, if you use my products, to prepare for a complete shutdown, just in case. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, esp for products that were designed only to enhance Twitter, they will not come back. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thread.center/&quot;&gt;thread.center&lt;/a&gt;. It only works with Twitter, so when the API is gone, I will just shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two products I care about most are &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;. I will do everything I can to transition them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; which I have left running even though Drummer is a better version of the same product, will not transition. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both Drummer and Little Outliner have commands to download all your outlines. You should do that &lt;i&gt;now. &lt;/i&gt;There's no excuse for you losing any data, and I will not help get your data after Twitter shuts off the API. Take care of yourself. Download your stuff. Now.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For FeedLand there's nothing to worry about. All your data is public, so even if for some reason you cannot log onto FeedLand, you will still be able to get your data because you don't need to log in to get it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; for more notes about the transition. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I am just one person. I won't stand for people treating me like a corporation with a staff of people working on this. I am not more powerful than you are, so remember that when you ask for help. There will no tolerance of abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if you have questions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/251&quot;&gt;here's a place&lt;/a&gt; to ask. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I have some advice that's imho worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Go some place natural. Alone. Where no one knows you or who you know. Subtract everything that defines you as a pundit or friend of the rich and famous. No gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Swim. Get massaged. Try being quiet. Talk about your childhood. Find yourself, the person you've been hiding from.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just be another random person, one of seven billion, because that is the truth. That is who you are. Who I am. Who everyone is. When you really feel it a weight comes off. None of this shit matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can now settle the age-old debate about what is and isn't a podcast. If at the end of your show, and in promos, you say &quot;Available where ever you get your podcasts,&quot; then it's a podcast! If you don't say it, then it ain't a podcast!

I was right in the middle of their demographic when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;TV show&lt;/a&gt; aired between 1966 and and 1968. I watched every episode. I had all their records. There was kind of a stink around them, perceivable even to an 11-year-old. People would say they weren't musicians, they weren't playing the instruments, and they were the kind of act only teenie boppers (like me!) could like. But Andrew Hickey in this episode dispels all that, explaining how they were a really important good musical group. They were friends will all the musicians of the day who we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; respect. All but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micky_Dolenz&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the Monkees is gone now. They were nice people apparently. It gives me a warm feeling to know they were better than who the cynics said they were.</description>

			<source:outline text="This week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-162-daydream-believer-by-the-monkees/&quot;&gt;500 songs podcast&lt;/a&gt; is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees&quot;&gt;the Monkees&lt;/a&gt;. I was right in the middle of their demographic when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;TV show&lt;/a&gt; aired between 1966 and and 1968. I watched every episode. I had all their records. There was kind of a stink around them, perceivable even to an 11-year-old. People would say they weren't musicians, they weren't playing the instruments, and they were the kind of act only teenie boppers (like me!) could like. But Andrew Hickey in this episode dispels all that, explaining how they were a really important good musical group. They were friends will all the musicians of the day who we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; respect. All but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micky_Dolenz&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the Monkees is gone now. They were nice people apparently. It gives me a warm feeling to know they were better than who the cynics said they were." created="Wed, 01 Feb 2023 21:31:44 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/01/theMonkees.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/02/01.html#a213144"/>

			<title>Slavery is who we are</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We must teach all American kids of all races about slavery the same way German kids learn about the Holocaust. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I regret that we didn't learn about slavery in public school in NYC when I was a child in the 60s. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I only found out by reading books about slavery, which I did over the last few years after listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/1619/id1476928106&quot;&gt;1619 Project podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, which were eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;divInlineImage&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgInline&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/01/undergroundRailroad.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;The new underground railroad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
