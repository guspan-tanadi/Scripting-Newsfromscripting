If the user subscribes to an outline that's served under HTTP, the browser won't let us read it, because (I guess) they think we're loading code or private data. Neither is true. By definition the outline is public. There will be a workaround, we can call a server to read the file. I could be spending the time inventing new stuff, instead I'm mopping up after the EFF and Google.</description>

			<description>I chimed in on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109902923171500510&quot;&gt;Masto thread&lt;/a&gt; about whether the standard is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109904059935718937&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; or ActivityPub. I was also asked for my advice which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@davew/109903212060834214&quot;&gt;freely gave&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>How do you know?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/08/18/bigLittleLies.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I went through my midlife crisis in the 90s. Till then, my life was directed toward success. Something I wanted ever since I was a small child. I wanted to do something great and creative. Maybe invent something. I wanted my life to have meaning. I wanted to make a difference. And I wanted to be recognized for my accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I arrived in the 90s with most of the boxes checked. Then I waited for the feeling of satisfaction. I waited for everyone whose approval I yearned for to approve of me. Nothing. Emptyness. All the approval felt conditional, hollow, not based on any understanding of who I am. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So, did I approve of myself? No, not in any way. I was living a lie. Trying to design myself to fit into everyone else's idea of a worthwhile man. I wasn't listening to myself. I was letting other people define me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still had another hill to climb, to learn how to listen to the internal chatter always going on inside me. All the voices, who were they and what did they want? Which were the powerful ones, and which were just nagging critics. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I started writing publicly frequently, and then every day. I took risks, and told stories that didn't used to make it to journalism. I was offered a writing job at Wired. And I developed software to support this new activity, and in the process created something new, and this time wasn't aimed at fame and fortune, checking the boxes. It was simply something I wanted to have. Not saying the software I did before was just for checking boxes, that was never the case. Just that this was the first software I made that had nothing to do with checking the boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I did was start therapy in 1994. Eight years on the couch. Talking about myself. Being heard by someone whose job it was to listen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first big discovery came a couple of years in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated with something a relative did. I said &quot;I know what he's doing right now.&quot; I was sure of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The therapist asked: &quot;How do you know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That stopped me. I said: &quot;I don't know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I asked: &quot;Why didn't you ask that before?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Therapist: &quot;I've been asking all along, this is the first time you responded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The big lesson was, as you dream your way through life, before you make a decision, check with your senses to see if the perception was right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Always ask yourself how you know what the other person is doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from 1997 that goes into much more detail on this idea. &quot;I know this sounds geekish, but it pays to use the scientific method in relationships with other people.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The archive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’ve been writing on web 28+ years and all of it is archived in machine-readable form, no scraping needed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m fascinated by the idea of a ChatGPT type app digesting all my writing so I can ask &quot;myself&quot; various questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Some writers are scared of having their archive turned into the learning material for an AI chatter, but not me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'd love to be a guinea pig.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If you need a license I will provide.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Let me know. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The idea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The bot would appear to be me. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;So you'd say -- how old are you?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And it would answer -- 67.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What do you think of microsoft?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And then it would come up with the answer i would come up with.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, I've now been through switching two HTTP apps to HTTPS, and what they say about it being easy to retrofit is just marketing, ie nah, it's no more true than Node is single-threaded. In some cases, for a simple static website, it can be totally automatic. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;. It's a miracle, if you think HTTPS is a requirement. But if you're talking about an app like &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;, it's a pretty large undertaking, with cascading problems, and fraught with opportunities for breakage that could be hard to find (I'll let you know in a year or two, knock wood). Using HTTPS means you have to use it in everything the app comes in contact with. Google and EFF as bright as they are haven't anticipated every way of building software on the net. This was a lesson I had learned before. We thought converting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/personal-computers-software-first-idea-processor.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; from the IBM PC and Apple II to the Mac would be easy. Ultimately we had to write a new product from scratch. The assumptions were different. But in that case &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; made the choice, not Google and the EFF.</description>

In a perfect world I'd be able to plug one in. But we are very far from that. We were closer in the late 80s and early 90s. That was my goal then, to turn the apps of a GUI into toolkits for people who wrote scripts to connect them to create their own applications. Why should I have to write a whole word processor to have a new feature that no one else knows they need. If I could hook my emailer up to my outliner, I would get better use of the drafts I wrote. The ultimate goal is to do all my writing in my favorite writing app, and send &lt;i&gt;pointers&lt;/i&gt; to the writing to the other apps, emailers, chat apps, CMSes, there would be only one original, and if I made a change to the original the updates would flow to all the places I sent pointers. Again we were much closer to this 30 years ago than we are now. But I think we have a chance to start fresh now with these goals. That's when you want to do this kind of integration for interop, at the beginning, before there are any apps. It's very hard to retrofit later, I can't say I've ever seen it work.</description>

			<description>I was looking for a simple list of ingredients for a nice pot roast and made the mistake of looking on Google first, and was bewildered by all the bullshit. Then I thought, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/16/potroast.png&quot;&gt;this is a job for ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. All the business model bullshit prevents the web from being able to answer a simple question. ChatGPT filters out the bullshit and gets right to the point. What is so complicated about that.

			<description>There's this great scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt;. McCartney and Lennon are disagreeing, it's getting personal, or heavy in some way. Lennon looks at McCartney, big pause, and says &quot;It's just me.&quot; The founders of the Beatles. The biggest rock stars. The whole franchise. On the other hand, they were nobodies together. Now everyone thinks we're so important, but come on, it's just me. Funny thing is, when you're a nobody you're desperate to be somebody. And when you're the biggest somebody there is, you yearn to be a nobody again.  Nothing ironic about it, it's almost mathematical. BTW, if you find this clip on YouTube, I'd love to include it with this post.</description>

			<description>Drummer users, we're almost ready to switch over to the new Drummer. If you want your files moved to the new server, you have to register your Twitter address and email address a new utility app. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/177&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; carefully. It takes less than a minute. All you need is access to the Twitter account you used for Drummer and to know what email address you want to use for your Drummer identity.</description>

			<description>What if friends treated their friends as nicely as they treat dogs. When you sensed they needed a little support, you'd look them in the eye and say &quot;Who's the good girl?&quot; Rub behind the ears and when they sit give them a treat. Inside of us, everyone, including you, is a little pup who just wants to know they're in the right place doing the right thing.</description>

The revulsion was gone. These were two New York teams, roughly comparable, and there weren't any carpetbaggers or Nazis on the floor, at least none that I knew of. The weird feeling was pride. This is NY basketball. I like it. Both teams have a good foundation to build on, and lots of first round draft picks in the bank, so there's hope for more talent. But don't import people who already have their championship rings who expect us to root for them. We want a unique experience, suitable for our great city. I'm still a Knicks fan, but I could see myself rooting for the Nets. BTW, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/heat/miami-news/nba-top-performers-of-the-day-feb-13-jalen-brunson-has-big-game-to-lead-knicks-past-nets&quot;&gt;Knicks won in a blowout&lt;/a&gt;, that also contributed to the good vibe. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If I were giving advice to NBA team owners, don't sign players who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant&quot;&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving&quot;&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt;. No one wants to see a team win just because they bought famous players with no hunger, and no link to the hometown. I love where the Knicks and Nets are now. I think NY is the best basketball city in the NBA.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It'd be cool if the Knicks or Nets bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; in for the rest of the season. For the fans!

Or just fun. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Have the announcer say this when he scores... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carrrrmmmmellllllllllo&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Anthony!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have to, only put him in in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_time&quot;&gt;garbage time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's Melo!

I've been in that place, with Apple, a number of times. It would be really poor form for a Windows developer to gloat. I hope friends who have invested in other platforms remember the Golden Rule.

			<title>ChatGPT clearly has a place</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/16/simcity.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1624392828154712064&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; is worth money. I've given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chatgpt&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; programming jobs like the ones the author descibes, and it's saved me huge amounts of time. Last one was asking how to do something with the Twitter API. I could have spent fifteen minutes trying to find it in the docs, or on Stack Exchange, but I got the answer instead in a few seconds, and there was no bullshit, no preambles, just the answer to the question I asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another example. Last summer I had a medical problem, and the local clinic that I go to is having problems keeping people on staff. My normal primary care physician, who I loved, had just retired (in her 40s) so I had to see three different doctors, and they all guessed wrong about what was afflicting me. Finally I got a new doctor and after two visits and one visit to a specialist, we had it nailed down, I got treatment and it's getting better. That's a full year of dealing with a problem because no one doctor could focus on the problem long enough to see what the problem was. As an experiment I tried entering the symptoms  to  ChatGPT and it warned me I should see a doctor, but then proceeded to get the diagnosis correct. This is the kind of thing that will save lives, improve overall health, and help our awful health system in the US cope with the fact that doctors are retiring because they have burnout jobs. It might even help the doctors cope with that reality and maybe not burn out in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact is that most of medicine is doing what ChatGPT does so well. Getting some data and then applying best practices. We all get the same treatment for the ailments we have and most of them are ordinary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Occam's Razor&lt;/a&gt; maladies (ie it usually is what it looks like it is and it usually is what everyone else has). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Journalists, who do most of the writing about news, immediately focus on how it might affect their careers, and imho educators zoom past the purpose of education, to create more better-educated people. As a kid, I had a party the day my parents bought us an encyclopedia. That meant we could settle arguments by getting facts. We could've gotten them before but that would've meant a trip to the library. Better tools make for better information. ChatGPT is a revolutionary tool. Kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista&quot;&gt;Alta Vista&lt;/a&gt; was when the web first came out. I'm sure people screamed that it would screw up something. People always say that about change, esp people who are invested in the way things are. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there will be negative consequences of ChatGPT, but I'm sure we're not in a position to see what they are now, based on experience with similar changes. And maybe we'll look back on this moment twenty years from now, and not be able to imagine what life was like before we had this fantastic tool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One of the funny things about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/10.html#a020506&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; is that they pitched developers saying &quot;Now you can create your own formats!&quot; I'm sure they meant it, but once &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot; title=&quot;All about RSS.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; was established, they tried to replace it with an incompatible format. Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; wasn't as powerful as Apple or Google, and their format didn't replace &lt;a href=&quot;http://reallysimple.org/&quot; title=&quot;All about RSS.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. But, imho, when you push an open tech and someone takes you up on it, you should help, not fight them, ie if you really meant it.</description>

			<title>A stressful week</title>

It was supposed to be the week we launched testing of feedlandInstall, enough of a stretch on its own, but it also simultaneously became the week that Drummer had to be converted to a new identity system and HTTPS, all happening at the same time, thanks to the implosion of the API at Twitter. It's okay, it is what it is. I went into it with my eyes open, I knew there could be a day when we had to quickly get out of TwitterVille. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This added some extra chaos to the feedlandInstall process because the products share a package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;, and I had to make changes to how it works to get Drummer working, and there was a risk of FeedLand breakage as a result, and some breakage has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will get there. A new Drummer without Twitter for identity and a new open source release of FeedLand's server so a thousand instances can bloom. Everyone will want to be part of a FeedLand workgroup the same way they are joining Mastodon instances. Communities of feed readers serving larger communities of news users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa&quot;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; responds to things you say when you didn't say &quot;Alexa,&quot; which contradicts everything Amazon says about privacy. If it doesn't listen, then how does it wake up exactly? BTW, Google does this too. Sometimes I'm recording a voicemail or a podcast using my iPhone and my Pixel 6 starts responding to what I am saying. It's funny, even cute, until you realize &lt;i&gt;it wasn't supposed to hear any of that. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

Under development, not yet ready for users. But here's something cute. If FeedLand supports HTTPS in all its functionality, it will end up demanding that people with feeds support HTTPS too, and will fail for those who don't. If we continue down this path, I will be doing Google's work, helping them take ownership of the web. Here's the deal. Suppose you're displaying an item from a feed that includes an image. Suppose that image is served from an HTTP website, but your reader is running HTTPS. You won't see the image. The browser will refuse to load it. This came up when Scott Hanson tried to look at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/08/022722.html&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from Scripting News that contained a painting from René Magritte.

I'm trying to think of a way I could &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; give aid and comfort to the enemy. There might be a way. I don't want to betray the open web. I might be willing to do a lot of work so I don't force the owner of that site to support HTTPS (which I know he won't do because he is me).

Why build something huge if the idea is small. The cost of staying with Heroku would have been totally diseconomic when full servers could run all my apps for $10 a month. Why should I pay Heroku $500 for the same thing, even though I had to do a lot of work to dig out of the hole. Now with Twitter, I think I'll just bow out, and let other people find out if this is workable or not. I'll leave my servers running, and if they stop working, we'll figure out what if anything to do then. None of the apps I've made that depend on Twitter are worth $100 a month to keep running. That's another story, because the Twitter ecosystem for cool utilities was practically non-existent. All that energy from now on clearly is going to Mastodon where there is no vendor who can turn the cart over, at least not yet (don't rule it out, it could happen).</description>

There are features that used to work in Drummer that won't work in the new version. I am shipping the first open source version of FeedLand at the same time, working on both -- and this is really precarious work. Drummer will work as an outliner. The scripting features will mostly work, the Twitter verbs obviously will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; work. Your public files will be at different addresses. As I've said before I'm one person, doing the best I can. I expect people to be appreciative and supportive, friendly. Thanks in advance. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>One of my favorite things on Twitter are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/lists/1389951899424677888&quot;&gt;art channels&lt;/a&gt;. The curators post reproductions of famous works of art. And occasionally RT another art channel they feel is related to their artist, that their viewers would enjoy. It's a way to broaden the art you get to see. When they talk about how horrible Twitter is they leave out stuff like this. However, without use of the API these channels can't exist, and since each is a labor of love, it's unreasonable to expect them to pay for it.</description>
