			<description>I'm starting to think about the finale of Succession. I listed to the Succession &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/?river=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omnycontent.com%2Fd%2Fplaylist%2Fd83f52e4-2455-47f4-982e-ab790120b954%2Fd24f5c7c-6413-4cd5-b874-abf101388631%2F4d22931d-dfa6-4665-93e9-abf10138f0ef%2Fpodcast.rss&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and heard the showrunner say he really liked the finale of Six Feet Under, which is one of the best. I asked ChatGPT to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/02/dave-winer-s-background.html&quot;&gt;summarize&lt;/a&gt; the finale of Six Feet Under, Mad Men and The Sopranos.</description>

There's always been confusion about the power of individuals, even the richest ones -- imho they don't have the power to change the world, even though they're in the middle of the big change. If they weren't there someone else would be. The changes happening now can only happen because the systems they depend on are already in place. As individuals we get to make art from the change, give it style, a message, make it usable (or not), make it come into existence a bit faster perhaps. But the change itself is coming from evolution, not from individual people.</description>

			<description>In a voicemail to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_Malik&quot;&gt;Om Malik&lt;/a&gt; yesterday I observed that these things are not chatbots. I don't like the word chat. They have a chat-derived UI, true, but I find I go there when I have a question, much like I go to a search engine. It's a way to search a database that's also capable of writing. I'm looking for docs that might not exist, if so the software will try to create it for us. Much more useful than Google. As much of an advance over Google as Google was over Yahoo's directory.</description>

			<description>Learned yesterday that Twitter is turning off version 1 of their API. So even if I wanted to pay, I'd have to do a bunch of dev work to stay on their system. Makes the decision to walk away that much easier. No way I would choose to spend my very limited time on such make-work.</description>
