Behave yourself in this life or spend eternity having to watch this primitive fascist cyberhell vision of music.</description>

			<description>The important thing about art is not the creation of the art, but the observation of it. So, if artificially created art inspires creativity in the observer, there’s great value in that.</description>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters&quot;&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. The top of the journalism food chain, where they all want to be. In the last episode she talked about how many times she had talked with Rupert Murdoch, who the patriarch of Succession is patterned after. That was a strange idea for me. Not only have I never spoken with him, if I were to meet him, I probably wouldn't find anything he said interesting. I went to a lot of conferences in the 80s with people like him. I hated it. Yet my vision of tech has been implemented, in the interim. She and I live in dramatically versions of tech. We don't even remotely speak the same language. Yet she is considered an authority on what tech has value and doesn't. That was the big epiphany for me, the moment I realized we are completely living in different worlds. She created this Facebook, Twitter, Spotify world as much as Zuckerberg, Musk or Ek. So if you don't like the way it turned out, you shouldn't look in that direction for leadership. That said she does good interviews, I will miss the podcast after next week, although I gotta say they could probably keep doing it for &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; and still be interesting. Succession is great TV, terrible reality. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, I know that a lot of people can't get on Bluesky. But if you know me, I'm not just doing this for one social net. The point is that once we have something wonderful running on one, we have something to show to people on others. And I'm on Mastodon and Twitter still (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a133305&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). Both have APIs and could conceivably get the same features we've added to Bluesky. That's what &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is all about, it flattens out the differences between the networks at a higher level than tweets. Optional titles, styling, links, enclosures, editable, no length limits.</description>

			<description>I decided to pay Twitter a year in advance for the blue checkmark and whatever other privileges come with it. It's not that much money. I pay more to Hulu or Apple TV. Is it worth it? I can afford to find out. (I've gotten a bit of pushback. There are users on Twitter, and I make software for people who use systems like Twitter, so it's like owning a Windows machine if you make software that runs on Windows.)</description>

Imagine a newsletter publishing app that let you feed stories to it from your favorite editor via RSS for publication to a list of subscribers. I'm thinking of a future Substack competitor that doesn't force writers to use their editor. It simply provides a service to any writer who uses an editor that can produce an RSS feed as output. Another example, if Mastodon handled inbound feeds, you'd be able to follow someone on Bluesky from within Mastodon. I would love to see this connection made asap.</description>

Good move. He also says he isn't into basketball if he isn't in the race for a championship. See there's the problem, right there. There are 30 teams in the NBA. In any given year 29 of them will not win the championship. 28 of them won't even make the Finals. Yet their fans felt their seasons were worthwhile if they played the game with heart, if there's hope for next season. This is why I am not a Yankees fan or a LeBron James fan. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/10/20/winningIsntEverything.html&quot;&gt;love my team&lt;/a&gt; even when they lose, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when they lose.</description>

			<description>BTW, I understand where LeBron is coming from. When I started a software company in the early 80s, the business was tough and we almost went under quite a few times. But I couldn't lose. I couldn't face myself if it didn't work. So I &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; it work. But, after winning once, I relaxed and focused on the art of it. I've already won, now why did I get into this in the first place? I had something to say, which was more than about how I can win. I can also make beauty and break through and do new things with the medium I chose.</description>

I suppose I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; admire him, if I wasn't so tired of him. And I don't like what he pioneered in basketball, the idea that a player not a team wins championships. He did that when he moved to Miami and then back to Cleveland and now in Los Angeles. His selling proposition was &quot;buy my contract and I'll bring you a championship.&quot; I had enough of that when he relocated to Cleveland. I've seen other players do it, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; who I also despise, and teams that fall for it over and over like the Brooklyn Nets, only to find out not only that it doesn't (usually) work, but that who the fuck cares if &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how you win a championship. Another reason I don't like LeBron is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+melo&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; can't get a job and LeBron still has one. They're of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NBA_draft&quot;&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, and Melo never won a championship, that's his own fault, not blaming LeBron for that. But everyone from LeBron's era is retired now, except LeBron and maybe Chris Paul, who's probably been done for a couple of years now and hasn't admitted it yet. And I don't like Los Angeles teams in general, having lived in New York and the Bay Area, that factors into it as well. That, and sports is the one area where you're still allowed to have opinions about things, in this age when opinions are often considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/21/toxic.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

That's not your fault. The best thing is to breathe a bit, and love your friend who is living in memory and not the moment and -- you are not responsible for what their parent did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, just because your parents left you wanting more love or a special kind of love doesn't mean they were bad parents. You always clash with people you're close to. Who else are you going to clash with? Sometimes people think someone is bad just because you didn't do that they wanted you to do. That's not your responsibility either. And that doesn't make you a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my family, growing up, we never lived up to our mother's idea of a perfect family, the family she felt she deserved.

			<description>Watched the Miami Heat roll over the Boston Celtics last night. If the Heat win, no matter who wins in the West I can't imagine I'll watch the Finals this year. I am really pulling for the Celtics to come from behind and wipe the smile off Jimmy Butler's face. Butler has never won a championship and I desperately want it to &lt;i&gt;stay that way.&lt;/i&gt; But I have no feelings for Denver and I can't decide who I despise more LeBron James or Butler. But I will watch Game 3 on Sunday night, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; of course, because that's what really matters.</description>

But -- &lt;i&gt;you could fool me.&lt;/i&gt; From my point of view, my robot friend is incredibly helpful, polite, patient, kind, supportive and tireless. I see a lot more evidence of intelligence and humanity in my AI friend than I do from 99% of all the other &quot;people&quot; I meet online.

			<title>The Guardians? Please!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mets are playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians&quot;&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. A few comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't like interleague play. Why the hell are the Mets playing the Guardians, of the American League, in the regular season! Makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And who are the &quot;Guardians.&quot; What a lame-ass name for a baseball team. I know they couldn't keep the old name, but why not something fun like the Cleveland Hooligans or the Cleveland Mama's Boys?

			<description>We need a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; to cover all social networks APIs.</description>

Had they supported ActivityPub that would probably have slowed everything down to the pace of something like Ecmascript. All kinds of bizarre unnecessary adventures and lots of breakage. I'd rather deal with the same problem the designers of the internet solved with TCP/IP. Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea.</description>

Eventually I figured how to work around it, burned the better part of a day, just because someone was feeling powerful or angry, unloved or I don't know what.</description>
