			<description>200K Americans died while Woodward sat on the tape. American lives. People like you. If you can rationalize their deaths then you're part of the problem, as is Woodward and Trump. A chain of depravity.</description>

			<description>In medicine, if they're testing a drug and discover for sure it saves lives without harmful side-effects, they're obligated to stop the test and give everyone the drug. No more control group. No more placebos. It's ethical. Sometimes the information you uncover makes a difference, and holding onto it has an unacceptable cost. Same in journalism. Same in everything.</description>

			<description>In June, I was interviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson&quot;&gt;Walter Isaacson&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/26.html#a193208&quot;&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pacific-content/trailblazers-with-walter-isaacson&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about podcasting. They only used a few bits from the recording to tell their story. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/04/isaacsonAudio.m4a&quot;&gt;full recording&lt;/a&gt; of my side of the interview. About 40 minutes. You can't hear the interviewer's questions, but it's not too difficult to figure it out. As always I'm very long-winded. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, when they say a billionaire like Jeff Bezos made $60 billion in 2020, that's paper profit. The gains will be lost when the market crashes, as it is sure to do. It's not like having the money in a savings account. We're in a big market bubble now, maybe the biggest ever.</description>

			<description>If you think only in terms of public opinion, you’re in a trance. You’re not a pundit on CNN. How do you know if you do it? Here's an extreme example. I say geez it would have been so easy for the reporter to save a few thouand American's lives. And you say, but I don't think his base would care. So perverse, even depraved. Yet I had that exact exchange repeatedly on Twitter last night. Think about how dehumanized you've become. These are people. Their families and friends were devastated by their deaths. They suffered terribly before they died. And they died! Geez Louise. Where is your humanity. And btw, no one, and I mean &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; people give a shit about your punditry. You should factor that in as well.</description>

			<title>Nick Arnett, California fire fighter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've known &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickarnett.net/&quot;&gt;Nick Arnett&lt;/a&gt; since he was a tech industry analyst in the 80s when I was the CEO of a software company. Since then, he has re-invented himself many times, always in public service. These days he's a California fire-fighter, working on the front lines. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/arnett.nick/posts/10158685257688197&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the following on Facebook. I'm reposting it here with permission. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m starting to hear conspiracy theories about the fires. Although I understand the appeal to the part of our brains that longs to believe someone has control, they are still quite disturbing. Today, I heard that people believe this is all intentional, intended to destroy rural America. I can’t help but think this puts us far closer to civil unrest or war than I’d ever have imagined possible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Equally scary is how entrenched the beliefs are, even though we know that the rumors are conspiracy theories promoted and encouraged by enemies who wish to bring about our downfall. They are succeeding, again far more than I would ever have imagined possible.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure there are big solutions. I am certain of the truth and power of my favorite words from Mother Theresa: Do small things with great love. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Voting is a small thing for each of us. Do it based on what you love, rather than what you oppose.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A cynic might ask, and our country is full of cynicism,  what difference would it have made if Woodward had disclosed what Trump said in March, in March. Well, it might have saved &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99oE_Yw4YA&amp;feature=emb_logo&quot;&gt;this woman's father's life&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life.&quot; We've got to start caring about each other.</description>

			<description>I bought two Biden/Harris lawn signs on Zazzle for about $50 including shipping. They let you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zazzle.com/co/cart?rnd=637352537975121016&quot;&gt;share your cart&lt;/a&gt;, nice feature. Wish the price were a lot lower though. I want to see Biden signs everywhere.</description>

			<description>About mail-in ballots. 1. Why not count them as they come in? 2. When people say they take longer because they have to verify your signature, that's exactly what they do when you vote in person, at least everywhere I've lived (lots of places). By definition that process takes 24 hours. I'm guessing it takes longer to count mail-ins because they have fewer people doing the work?</description>

			<description>I would prefer if there were no debates this time, but if there have to be debates: 1. It should be done virtually. I don't want Trump giving Biden the virus. 2. No interruptions. After your time is up, your mike is turned off. They should practice this so it works perfectly.</description>

			<description>Things I use my outliner for -- writing my blog and publishing it, writing all my JS code, project management, list-making, decision-making, design. You see outlines in every product, but no one puts a lot of effort into developing them. Most programmers, it seems, aren't good at connecting the dots and seeing trends in our work and then factoring based on those observations. I use two outliners. One is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/09/16/concordOurGplOutliner&quot;&gt;Concord&lt;/a&gt;, in an Electron shell. Its feature set is an almost exact copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;, with a few extra features to support my blog-writing. And I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; on my Mac for writing JS code, because I have a well-developed code management system that runs in Frontier. I also write little utilities that are quicker to write in Frontier than they would be in Node, but I have hopes of tackling that job and making Node a real scripting system. I no longer use the server apps we developed in Frontier. Most of them have been ported to Node. Many advantages to doing that, unfortunately none of those compare with Frontier for server programming. What Node has is a huge community that writes lots of packages that I can use. As far as I can tell I am the whole community in Frontier. Eventually that had to give, and it did. I found a good teacher to help me get started in JS in 2013 or so, and boom off to the races.</description>

			<description>When criticizing a product, it's a good idea to hedge your criticism so you don't look like a complete fool when it turns out you were wrong.

			<description>The day after Election Day in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, I went for a walk around midtown Manhattan. It looked just like it did the day before. Nothing changed about the city. But I felt like people looked at each other differently. Did this person vote for Trump? Do they think I voted for Trump? I wanted to wear a button that said &quot;I voted for HRC.&quot; Or better, I'm on the other side. I came up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MLK button%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;MLK button&lt;/a&gt;. I bought a thousand of them, and gave them away. I still wear it some days when I'm out in public. It was a more general &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/blackLivesMatter/&quot;&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/a&gt;. It said people are sacred and differences should be celebrated. And we're scared, so let's be there for each other. Today almost four years later, I suspect if you walk around Manhattan things are visibly different, and it's at least indirectly because Trump has been president for four years. Four more years? Hard to imagine how transformed this country will be then.</description>

			<description>Has anyone tried using polling to find out where the Covid-19 hot spots are? The kind of polling that asks who people voted for? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1302995546718769161&quot;&gt;Like this&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The bad thing about all the open corruption in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=trumpolini&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; admin, is they aren't all as sick and crazy and Trump, and know if they leave office, without Trump or someone worse in charge, they will go to jail. So they're going to fight like hell to keep him in office.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also if you accept the premise that they're also hell-bent on building a fascist reich, and I do, the virus is a powerful ally that Hitler never had. Hitler had to wait to start exterminating his enemies until he had absolute power locked down. Trump doesn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He can target death by cutting off funding strategically, by geography, economic status, age, race, or forcing people to do things that will expose them to the virus. They're already doing it, for example forcing schools to open. That translates into death and disease, as you know.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People ask what if Trump refuses to leave. Let's see if we can figure it out. He watches TV all day. I assume he’ll continue to do that. I suppose we‘ll have to sign loyalty oaths to him. Penalties very harsh for not doing so. What else? I bet his health continues to deteriorate, which means perhaps Melania will be running the country, or the Trump kids. There won't be any checks and balances, I guess.</description>

Totally voluntary. There's no requirement you include that data.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If the news org wants to stop FB, just don’t include that metadata.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, the metadata is saying FB, please include this information when someone links to this story. It's kind of pissy to then complain that they included the information you asked them to include. If you want them to not include the information, mate, stop asking them to. It's really fucking simple. I'm sure there are plenty of Australian programmers who can explain it to you. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, view the source code of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/06/145953.html?title=australiaAndFacebook&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Near the top of the page look for &amp;lt;meta&gt; tags with the og: prefix. Those are put there for Facebook. There are others, with the same info, for Twitter. It's smart to put those in there, they're kind of like ads. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I'm not a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Facebook%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.
