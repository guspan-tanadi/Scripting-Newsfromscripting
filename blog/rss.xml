			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was a playoff game of the characters of Succession, after two full seasons, we've gotten to know them, and now they're all ready to wrestle each other at the same time. I laughed all the way through the episode. The craftwork. Sat on the edge of my chair to absorb it all. It's a lot like post-season baseball, where you get as many as seven games to get to know all the players. I don't think this is the World Series yet, but we're getting close. Everyone's still in the game, and new people are showing up, more powerful than ever. And it seems the most powerful ones are the women. At one point Kendall says as much. I love this stuff. (And btw, the Dodgers and Red Sox lost the actual playoffs, so we're left with Atlanta and Houston, and I don't care for either team. Onto the NBA season.)</description>

			<description>Watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_May_Destroy_You&quot;&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/a&gt; on HBO over the weekend. It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/i-may-destroy-you/season-1&quot;&gt;highly rated&lt;/a&gt;, but I had not heard of it before last week. Very unusual show, artsy, emotional, a page-turner. Twelve half-hour episodes, quick binge.</description>

			<description>I've been dealing with some complicated problems with JavaScript dates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, which is the blogging CMS that Drummer uses. It's the same software I use to build Scripting News. I had to take a step back on the project yesterday because I was having so much trouble wrapping my head around what exactly the problem was. It was showing up in India and the Far East mostly. We didn't hit this set of problems with &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, because the blog rendering happened on the user's machine, so there was no timezone difference. And oddly, there is no problem with the RSS feeds of sites in the Far East. But at some times during the day if you posted something new from India, Malaysia or Australia, it would not appear on your home page. Anyway, it's great to have a bunch of smart super-interested people. It's very early days in Drummer Land, and the people really want their blogs to work, and of course I want this even more than they do. But I've never dealt with these issues before and they are mindfucks. You can read about it in this thread on the Drummer support site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/88#issuecomment-950206243&quot;&gt;starting here&lt;/a&gt;. I am figuring it out, it seems, I hope, Murphy-willing.</description>

It's a tiny little place that thinks it's everything when in fact it's a bunch of factories filled with grunts, and due to the pandemic it's not even that anymore.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enes_Kanter&quot;&gt;Enes Kanter&lt;/a&gt;, an NBA player for the Boston Celtics, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EnesKanter/status/1450869180283203589&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying the leader of China is a &quot;brutal dictator.&quot; And of course China is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/nba-china-boston-celtics-enes-kanter-slams-xi-over-tibet.html&quot;&gt;shitting its pants&lt;/a&gt;. This is a big problem. They don't understand that there's a line they're not allowed to cross. In the US, Kanter has a right to his opinion. And the leader of China &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a brutal dictator.  And even if there's some question about it, Kanter is allowed to say what he thinks. This is a similar problem to the one they're having at Netflix with Dave Chappelle's show which I have not watched. I find him incredibly offensive. I'd love to have a private conversation with him where I ask what he's trying to accomplish. I find his stories humiliating. Is there some lesson I'm supposed to learn? If so, could we skip to that part. Anyway, I won't watch him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/business/media/netflix-protest-dave-chappelle.html&quot;&gt;Employees at Netflix&lt;/a&gt; were offended too, and they want Netflix to remove him. That's just as wrong as what China is doing to pressure the NBA about Kanter. One more. The NYT fucked up when they fired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+donald+mcneil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. I think even the assholes who forced him out would agree, as their coverage of Covid is now bullshit, where before McNeil was canned, it was stellar. They had no place trying to control what appears in the NYT. They just work there. It's a platform for speech, I think even the most jaded and cynical reporter at the NYT would agree with that. And just because you get a paycheck from the NYT, that doesn't empower you to control other people's speech, same as China and Netflix. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/10/20/194852.html?title=whenPeopleLoveRss#a194954&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that when Zuck rolls out his new thing next week, we'll find out if the journalists properly understand their role. There will be no fake news yet on their new platform for them to complain about. But I guarantee you it will restrict speech in an effort to appease the journalists. Will they see this, and call bullshit? Or will their vanity and narcissism prevail. Obviously they don't care about our speech, but will they mind being so visible about not honoring it?</description>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; from the beginning, just to see how all the michegas got started. Seeing the first appearances of all the characters. The special relationship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/succession-roman-gerri-relationship-timeline.html&quot;&gt;Roman and Gerri&lt;/a&gt; is flirtatious from the first meeting. Cousin Greg plays a starring role in the first few episodes. And my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt; is in the show, via proxy, only this version of Denton gets revenge over the rich capitalists who were tormenting him (no spoilers beyond that). Season 3 of Succession started last Sunday, it's just getting better all the time. One of the best TV series ever.</description>

			<description>How could a court decision on abortion not be political? It's as silly as saying you could go swimming without being immersed in water, or breathe in a vacuum.

I can see we're going to need a new structure, because people aren't finding a lot of it, and there's more coming.

			<title>When people love RSS...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A rambling &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1450818199805640709&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from this morning that somehow fits together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people say they love &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, it's not specifically &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; that they love imho, it's the open format, no-lock-in philosophy of software development. If your data can move around the net effortlessly, that's what you love, and that's what you give up when you use a silo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing you can be sure of, when Zuck announces his new &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Zuckerverse&lt;/span&gt; thing, it'll be locked up and owned by him and his stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He can't pay all those employees if you're free to move out of his universe any time you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be lots of eye candy, but he has the only keys to the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of a story. In 1980 i went on vacation to Jamaica. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the cab from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Montego+Bay,+Jamaica/Negril,+Jamaica/@18.3492139,-78.2606069,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8eda2a5dfd77e2b1:0xfcd69adb5acc5766!2m2!1d-77.8938895!2d18.4762228!1m5!1m1!1s0x8ed90d8512302c85:0x7bc0f136de355913!2m2!1d-78.3472424!2d18.2683058!3e0&quot;&gt;Montego Bay to Negril&lt;/a&gt;, the driver pointed out a town with lots of new modern-looking shacks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He said they were a gift from Cuba.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They had front doors, but no back doors. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think about it. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been very critical of the way journalism covers Facebook, because they miss the human freedom part of the story, which is just as important as the fake news part. But of course journalism is only concerned with the freedom of journalists, not &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; freedom. In fact journalism would probably prefer if we had no means to speak publicly, if we just got our ideas from them. Only thing is they don't have any ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm absolutely 100 percent sure that when they get a chance to kill Zuck's new invention, they will ignore (or miss) the controls over our freedom in his new world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure it'll be designed to make the journos happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whether they buy it or not, that's another question. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Right now the big issues are abortion, COVID, climate and fascism. That’s a pretty good set of issues. Run some freaking ads on social media. Never stop campaigning, every day of every year.</description>

			<description>I was pretty sure the Dodgers would crush the Braves, but wow, the Braves are up 2-0. Gotta love it. I'm sorry if you're a Dodgers fan, but I was born in Brooklyn and people such as myself don't forget. I also remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mlb-overturns-utley-supension-breaking-tejada-leg-article-1.2554514&quot;&gt;Chase Utley broke the leg&lt;/a&gt; of the Mets shortstop during the 2015 playoffs. I also remember when I sat in scalped seats during the World Series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_World_Series&quot;&gt;in 1988&lt;/a&gt;, in the Dodgers wives' section and they tried to get us thrown out for rooting for the A's who won, btw. I really feel justified in hating the Dodgers, but honestly even if I wasn't, I would still hate them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Micro.blog and Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just before Drummer shipped I sent an email to Manton Reece, the developer and runner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, asking if he was interested in being the first blogging system to hook up with Drummer via the OPML bridge. The same interface we use in Drummer to connect to Old School. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2021/10/18/drummer-and-microblog.html&quot;&gt;Well here it is&lt;/a&gt;. He works fast. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Just watched the video -- I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; how he did it.

			<title>Colin Powell lied for war</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing how people are kvelling over Colin Powell.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His speech at the UN was chilling, implying but not directly saying that Iraq had nuclear weapons and was getting ready to use them, and we had no choice but to go to war with him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No one would have believed Cheney, Rumsfeld or Rice. They got the only person in the Bush administration who had credibility. If Powell was willing to say this, it must be true, we had to act. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a lie. A way to transfer wealth from the US Treasury to the war industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people act naive as they do horrific things, seriously -- he knew what he was doing. Powell wasn't a tool, we were the tools. He abused our trust. And in death he doesn't deserve the acclaim he's getting. Too many people died because of his lie.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think you have to be very young and very healthy to be medication-averse. There are some people who make it to old age without needing medical care. My mother was one of those people, she didn't get sick until she was in her 80s. Me, on the other hand, I would have died before I was 10 if it wasn't for health care and antibiotics. I had a ruptured appendix, mis-diagnosed by a doctor as a stomach ache. Okay so medicine fucks up, a lot. I have limited vision because two eye doctors gave me bad advice and did surgery, the first fucked my left eye and the second made it worse. My hearing is blown in my left ear, because a doctor used a device to clear out earwax that damaged my eardrum. So now loud noise, including loud music, makes my head vibrate in an unpleasant way. Too bad, I used to love loud music. &lt;i&gt;But I am alive. &lt;/i&gt;My life having been saved twice by medicine now. So when medicine says &quot;take this vaccine it'll make you safer against a horrible disease&quot; -- I take it. Gladly. Why? Because I get how medicine works to an extent and am appreciative for the life I would not have had were it not for medicine.</description>

			<description>In the back of my mind is the question of could we get a Linux version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; going. That would send this project into the stratosphere, imho. Even after a year's work, Drummer is still a shadow of Frontier, which I use as my development platform for all of this. That's how I'm so productive. Invest as much time in tools as you do in product, and some years, invest all your time in tools. BTW, when I say a Linux version -- I mean an exact clone. The benchmark is whether it runs my software, not that it's a cool project. With these things it's the base of apps that matters. I think the language designers at big companies have lost the tune. The apps are what matters. That's why I program in JavaScript -- it's where all the code is. And that's why projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logrocket.com/what-is-deno/&quot;&gt;Deno&lt;/a&gt; (A different arrangement of N O D and E) are such a bad idea. And deprecating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; verb? Only the most commonly called function the whole fricking language. Deprecated!! Someone has lost their sense of what matters. It's as if one day they decided the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tappan_Zee_Bridge_(2017%E2%80%93present)&quot;&gt;Tappan Zee Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is too cool to drive cars over, so we'll require people to convert their cars so that the wheels are inside and the seats are outside. Always going backward is a good way to never get anywhere. BTW the Tappan Zee Bridge Is a beautiful bridge. It carries exactly the same traffic the old one did.</description>

			<description>I have a thing. If they're &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/16/weather.png&quot;&gt;forecasting rain&lt;/a&gt;, showers or even a thunderstorm, and it's not raining when I want to go out for a ride, I go out anyway. Worst that can happen is I get soaked, I reason. And I usually make it home in time. And often as soon as I walk in the door it starts to pour. That's exactly what happened today.

			<description>We know what we have to do -- we should be campaigning like everything is at stake (it is) instead we're hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhilArballo/status/1449427514397442048&quot;&gt;weak statements&lt;/a&gt; like this. It's not his fault, btw -- the national Democrats are looking in the wrong direction. I don't know how they can do it, but they are. Where is the Lincoln Project, why aren't they turning out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlJqf_9YYj0&quot;&gt;ads like this&lt;/a&gt;, every day, about abortion rights? This is the big problem that the Democrats keep making. To them campaigns are about elections, but they're really about everything, 365 days a year. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops. The campaign never stops.

Learn how to get your browser to do a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=browser+hard+reload&quot;&gt;hard reload&lt;/a&gt;. Always try that first.

			<description>A friend asked if it was true that Spotify now owns podcasting. They read something in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/03/wiredWebIsDeadFreeGift.png&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; that said they did. They're idiots. Or trying to get clicks. Or maybe they're idiots &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; they're trying to get clicks. Anyway -- no, Spotify does not own podcasting. As long as people say &quot;subscribe where ever you get your podcasts&quot; at the end of their podcast you have nothing to worry about. I'm not even going to link to the Wired article.</description>

			<title>The mobile app I want</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;An iOS and Android app. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It can manage multiple notes. They are simple things, simple styling, multiple paragraphs per item. Of course Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It stays in sync with something that's accessible over the web, kind of like an RSS feed just for me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I tell Drummer, Roam, whatever -- where to hook into it. And it appears in my writing world as a flat outline. I can edit in both places. So I can put a note from my desktop into this mobile world, and write something while I'm out and about that hooks into my larger writing world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Super important: Not part of Apple or Dropbox or whatever's world. Then I would have to go through them to get my own writing, and eventually they will break me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's amazing how broken this shit is now. I'm almost broken in Apple's world. And Dropbox blew up what we were doing a few years back. We're about to get evicted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. But Linux, RSS, OPML and Markdown keep chugging along. And Twitter too btw. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/10/13/140500.html?title=whyWeUseTwitterIdentity&quot;&gt;They've&lt;/a&gt; actually been very good, even though the hype says otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was talking with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+dave+jacobs&quot;&gt;Dave Jacobs&lt;/a&gt; last night and we got around to what should be done with &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;. The only thing to do when a tech company gets too big, is to force them to unbundle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling&quot;&gt;Bundling&lt;/a&gt; is how their size becomes a problem for us. So, for example, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; owning the dominant search engine and the dominant browser means they're inevitably going to turn the web into a perfect way to continue to own search. That's all that's going to matter to them. But the web has more to do. Google doesn't care. Facebook has also been successful at strangling the open web, forcing all writing on the net to flow through them. Or at least keeping it from flowing outside of them. If Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/18/1269.html&quot;&gt;fat ass&lt;/a&gt; wasn't squatting over the web, there would be a lot more movement. That might not solve the problem of Nazis ruining the world, but at least it gives the rest of us a chance to organize and solve the other vexing problems we have to deal with. RIght now all we're tasked with doing is making Zuck even richer, and even Zuck must be bored with that by now. The task for FB is to make it easy for the rest of us to run our own FB's and stay in touch with the people who use his FB. That's what happens when you get as big as they are. And it's far from an unsolvable problem. In fact they already have all the software written.</description>
