			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/02/nomorebloggers.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;Having fun with AI&lt;/a&gt;. I asked the OpenAI chatbot to write a story about the demise of bloggers now that OpenAI can do all the writing. It added journalists all on its own. I assume some pundit can use this in an op-ed for the NYT or Washington Post about the dangers of AI. Which I then asked OpenAI &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/02/oped.png&quot;&gt;to write&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>If you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; you can follow my Mastodon posts &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.social%2F%40davew.rss&quot;&gt;via this feed&lt;/a&gt;. Just click the Subscribe button and you're in. Mastodon, unlike Twitter, provides an RSS feed for each user. A huge advance in the state of the art. I hope Twitter takes note and adds this feature.</description>

			<title>Users as advocates</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1598839749740855296&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is how users advocate in their own interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Mastodon adds a feature that users value, demonstrably, by RTing the call to action and subscribing to the feeds in their favorite feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we find out which readers do it well and which do not. The ones who don't will be motivated to catch up. Once users make it an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And other social platforms will be motivated to follow Mastodon's lead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when Mastodon supports RSS, and there's demonstrated user support, Twitter must add the feature. It's a fundamental law of tech. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Once Twitter has a competitor, all kinds of things are possible that weren't before. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1598332913568841735&quot;&gt;This is a huge deal&lt;/a&gt;. If I type a web address in a tweet, Twitter figures it out and hots it up in the rendered tweet. All of a sudden a tweet can link out to lots of places. Let's hope next up is Markdown support, optional titles, unlimited length and podcast enclosures and then you better believe WordPress and Tumblr will have to do it, and that will provide impetus for Mastodon. Here we go. Please keep going Twitter.</description>

Let's say I buy a Metrocard to ride the NYC subway. Every time I slide the card through a turnstile, what is that called? Is it a micropayment? Or I have an EZ-Pass responder on my car, so I drive through where the toll booths used to be without even slowing down. I don't know how much that costs, but I assure you there's nothing &lt;i&gt;micro&lt;/i&gt; about it! One of the reasons business people at pubs must be tired of this discussion is it's their job to get MACRO payments for their employer, not teeny little micros. As I envision it, I would probably spend $100 a month on various pubs, and maybe more and more over time. When fluidity is added to the economics, how can you help but pay more. It's only because of the attitude about this at publishers that we can't have more news (and they get more money). Right now I only pay three pubs -- NYT, WP and Consumer Reports. My money should be spread around a lot better than that.</description>

			<description>My parents were children in Europe as the Holocaust was brewing. Their parents, my grandparents, got them out in time so that they could meet in Brooklyn, get married and have children, including me of course. My paternal &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/22/baruchWiner.gif&quot;&gt;grandfather&lt;/a&gt; told me, when I was a little kid, in his heavy Russian accent &quot;Daveeed, when the Nazis come (he was sure they would) you get a gun and go on the roof and you shoot them!&quot; My parents were horrified. I thought he was just a crazy old man. But he was a lot smarter and wiser than we gave him credit for.</description>

			<title>Feeds in the Fediverse</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;These are the goals for the software I am about to release.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The network of RSS publishers and readers should be part of the Fediverse. This software enables the flow of RSS content into the Fediverse.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To provide good simple working code for the Mastodon API. I had to do too much work to figure out how to get what amounts to a &lt;i&gt;Hello World&lt;/i&gt; script up and running. Now you don't have to do all that work.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;You should be able to build feed-based utilities without giving any thought to reading feeds. Reading a feed should be as easy as reading a JSON file. This app illustrates how that works, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to get some code out there into the Mastoverse, to start building a rep in the community.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>They're not micro payments</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/metrocard.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;Micropayments is such an awful term. Let's say I buy a Metrocard to ride the NYC subway. Every time I slide the card through a turnstile, what is that called? Is it a micropayment? Or I have an EZ-Pass responder on my car, so I drive through where the toll booths used to be without even slowing down. I don't know how much that costs, but I assure you there's nothing micro about it!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons business people at pubs must be tired of this discussion is it's their job to get MACRO payments for their employer, not teeny little micropayments. As I envision it, I would probably spend $100 a month on various pubs, and maybe more and more over time. When fluidity is added to the economics, how can you help but pay more. It's only because of the attitude about this at publishers that we can't have more news (and they get more money).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Right now I only pay three pubs -- NYT, WP and Consumer Reports. My money should be spread around a lot better than that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The scope of the Fediverse, 2022</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://axbom.com/fediverse/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; is very informative.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@oblomov@sociale.network/109437619944925429&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; on my Mastodon account what apps other than Mastodon and micro.blog are on the ActivityPub network. I had heard of many of these, but in the newbie fog, I hadn't retained the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't see any feed readers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We need to fix that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
