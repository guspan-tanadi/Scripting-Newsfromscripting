			<title>The latest news from MuskLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of talk on Twitter today about what to do if Elon Musk ends up owning Twitter. Based on an article in the WSJ, it appears that might happen very soon, maybe even later today. The Twitter board is carefully studying the offer. Presumably after looking at their lack of success of getting Twitter to grow like other tech industry social networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1518559177093926912&quot;&gt;Benedict Evans&lt;/a&gt; described Twitter as the  &quot;Craigslist of Web 2.0, coasting on network effects, building nothing much, and getting unbundled piece by piece.&quot; I think that's a good synopsis of the last decade or so in TwitterLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Finally there's a lot of discussion about where we'll go, which is good. We could have been talking about this long ago, and be more independent of Twitter now. But this is when people get creative. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1518574700611264513&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; suggests we all go back to Tumblr, presumably where she started blogging. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518575186383101952&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; -- &quot;Let's all go back to what we like, and meet up in the middle.&quot; Honestly I think that's what Musk must be thinking of. Unbundling Twitter. Turning it into an identity system and an aggregator of lots of sources of bite-size ideas from all kinds of people. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1518559637553008644&quot;&gt;Evans suggests&lt;/a&gt;, as do many others. that the moderation problem on Twitter is insurmountable. I don't think it actually is. My Tesla car can drive it self, somewhat, with my assistance, guidance and supervision. Couldn't an algorithmic approach to moderation work just as well? If we're willing to trust our bodies to an algorithm, why not moderation? I think the problem is solvable. Musk's other companies solve bigger problems adequately. Amazon can deliver packages to millions of addresses in the US every day. I just don't think Twitter's are that much harder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Musk has shown himself to have a childish personality, I can't imagine people who are serious about doing hard jobs are willing to work for him, but apparently enough are to make SpaceX and Tesla very successful companies. A paradox I expect we'll learn a lot more about. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said to Jeff Jarvis yesterday that we need a Plan B. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I suspect if Musk buys Twitter, we'll all get used to grumbling about him, and Twitter will continue to work more or less, and will gradually improve over time, as basic software development principles, which have evolved over many decades, will get Twitter growing and actually doing new things, which will be appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I am a Twitter developer and shareholder. As a shareholder, I don't want to sell out. Just thought I should get all that on the record. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: I own a Tesla Model 3 and a StarLink dish. I'm very happy with both products, so far. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPS: In the early blogosphere I wrote about them watching them watch us watch them watch us, watch them watch us, watch them, etc. Same old same old. The more things change the more they stay the same. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPS: A lot of people are saying they will leave Twitter if Musk buys it. I've been through this before. Very few if any will leave. It's why I have this motto: &quot;Don't slam the door on the way out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPPPPS: Finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html&quot;&gt;at 3PM&lt;/a&gt;, the age of MuskTwitter has begun. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1518666782608867329&quot;&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

There weren't many people rooting for the Nets in the arena. There was a lot more enthusiasm for the Celtics, because they're an exciting team and they're going somewhere. Boston is close and NYC is so huge there are already a fair number of Celtics fans here. Today's Nets don't have a home court. They haven't sold the idea of the Nets to the NBA fans here. NYC is huge, even a team without much of a following should be able to fill the arena with enthusiasm. But Kevin Durant, the leader of the team, the reason the Nets are supposedly contenders, never approached the city as something he had to win over. They must've thought fans are simple. They loved me in Oklahoma and Oakland, of course they'll love me here. I don't think anyone in particular loved KD in Oakland, they do love Curry, Thompson and Green. KD was a carpetbagger in Oakland as he is in NYC. He came to the city with disrespect for NBA fans here. He could have said hey it's great to be in NY, love the energy of Knicks fans, I hope some of you will come out to see the Nets. That would've been appropriate. Instead he disses the Knicks, the Garden and by implication those of us who have suffered with the Knicks all these years. Yeah we know they suck, but we &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; them. They're family. You don't get to dis them. So this is the price. No one here cares if this year's Nets win. And some of us want them to lose. At this point it seems unless there's a miracle, the Nets are eliminated. If he's going to stick around KD should ask for a reboot with Knicks fans. Forget about a crosstown rivalry. For now the Knicks own the city, even if they suck. Ask for our support. You might get it next time you're in the playoffs. But you'll have to earn it by showing up in our city in the meantime.</description>

And &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Jack_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Gentleman Jack&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gentleman-jack&quot;&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; I absolutely &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=gentleman%20jack&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;adored&lt;/a&gt;. I'm rewatching season one so I'll be ready when the new season starts on HBO on April 25. It's already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gentleman-jack/season-2&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; on BBC. And in just six days the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nintendoswitchsports.nintendo.com/en/&quot;&gt;Wii Sports&lt;/a&gt; arrives for the Switch, so you know what I'll be doing in May, June, July and so on.</description>

			<title>Ugh Musk</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was kind of in favor of Musk running Twitter, but this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/23/disturbingImage.png&quot;&gt;disturbing image&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/23/disturbingImage.png&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Body shaming sucks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Gates is smart, a powerful person. I don't see why he'd want to blow him off like this.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't want Musk having power over me, even though I guess he does already.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>What I want to hear: Audio of Trump talking with Congress people from the White House, in the Capitol, while the riot was taking place. I want to hear the fear in their voices, and the pathology in Trump's. If the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/04/21.html#a021116&quot;&gt;reporters&lt;/a&gt; have that audio, release it now.</description>

			<description>I'm working my way through Paul McCartney's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)&quot;&gt;first solo album&lt;/a&gt;. It was as big an event in 1970 as Elon Musk tweeting that he wanted to acquire Twitter in 2022. The album amounted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Press_release_and_the_Beatles'_break-up&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that the Beatles were broken up. In fact, Lennon had already quit the group, but hadn't announced it publicly. But it's a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; album. I listened the hell out of it when I was a teen and in my 20s, but never really &lt;i&gt;listened&lt;/i&gt; to it if you know what I mean. Like try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCppWWmIGQ&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; out. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. So much to listen to. And he did the album, in secret, and on really low tech hardware with no mixing board. Just four tracks straight to tape. Much more lightly produced than Beatles songs, no grand George Martin productions, just McCartney and that's worth something.</description>

It's like &lt;a href=&quot;https://secondlife.com/&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;. And Second Life was boring.

Maybe Zuck should check that out.

That's where the &lt;i&gt;virtual&lt;/i&gt; in virtual reality is fun, when you get to be Elon Musk and own your own Twitter for example. Isn't that the dream we all had as kids, that we'd grow up and then we'd show them. I used to have images of my father, locked in a tiny bathroom, with a bowl of spaghetti poured on his head. I would say to him &quot;You're staying in there until you learn some manners, young man!&quot; It was a nice dream then, truthfully it still is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'd love to see some publication do a comparison of legal cannabis in various different states. How does the quality compare, prices? What states have public places like bars and coffee shops where it's legal to hang out and consume as in Amsterdam (where it's not legal, I know, but tolerated). New Jersey just opened yesterday, and I was interested in seeing how prices compare to those in Massachusetts. Too early to draw any conclusions. But I can tell you that it's way more expensive than in Washington or Oregon.</description>

			<description>We should just discount the president's approval rating down to zero and then we could view 39% as a historic high. But seriously folks, the president's approval rating is just how the news, as it's reported, bounces off the minds of the people the pollsters talk to. You could model it like they model weather reports, and tune up the news coverage to create any approval rating you want.</description>

			<description>We're curing ourselves from Covid the way people who smoke while they quit smoking aren't actually quitting. To quit, you stop. If you take your masks off, that's like buying a pack of cigarettes, and having one or two and then finishing the pack and then getting another. I speak as an ex-smoker for over 30 years. I had all kinds of plans for quitting, but the only way to do it is to quit. We'll never get out of the Covid hole until &lt;i&gt;all of us&lt;/i&gt; commit to it and then follow through. Otherwise it's going to continue to be a lingering tragedy.</description>

My face feels naked without it. The other day I went into the supermarket without a mask and had to go back out to the car to get one. In that moment I got to think about why I wear a mask even when others aren't. It's because I want to send a message to my fellow shoppers that I care about their health. I was raised to be a considerate person. So many people were raised to be self-centered and pissy. I never want to see myself that way. Anyway it was really annoying how quickly the airlines took down their mask requirements. I suggest if you want to make your feelings known to them, stop flying until they bring the mandates back.</description>

I suggest if you want to make your feelings known to them, stop flying until they bring the mandates back." created="Wed, 20 Apr 2022 13:03:19 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/20/elves.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/04/20.html#a130319"/>

			<title>Site licenses</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1986, my little software company was in a weird place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We had a great product almost ready to ship for the Mac. Everyone was psyched, MacUser and MacWorld, the people inside Apple, the people we leaked it to in the industry. But we were broke, couldn't make payroll. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My board was tired of the roller coaster, they told me to shut the company down. I told them they were crazy, we're sitting on the best product anyone has ever made, and the market is totally ready for it. The Mac was finally selling in huge numbers, after they fixed all the problems, and most other software devs were shutting down their mac development in the year before, we were going to have the booming mac software market virtually to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No deal. The board wouldn't put up the $400K we needed to get to shipping the product. So I went to my best friend at Apple, and told him what was going on. We were going to have to shut down before shipping the product you want so badly. I begged for their help. Man did they help us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First they gave us the money we needed to stay open as a loan. We had to put the source code to the product in escrow. We also did a second deal. They bought a site license for the product, everyone at Apple would get a copy, and in return they'd give us 40 new Mac systems with lots of memory, printers, networking. And they gave us 10 more Macs to give to our board members, which was also really smart. None of them had Macs.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The reason I told this story is the power of the site license. I would have paid them all to use the product, because once the hardware company is standardizing on your product, you'll never go out of business as long as they're in business. And the inverse was true too. If we all had Macs maybe we'd stop thinking about making software for PCs. Back then Apple had guts and smarts. Quite a combo. Probably because they too had gone through tough times and were emerging from them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was the best year of my life in the software world, and I've had some good years. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
