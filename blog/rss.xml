I'm at least a generation older than most of the other techies who cohabit this space. What you're seeing now for the second or third time, I've seen five or six times. The more times you see it the more predictable it gets, and the more confidence you have in your understanding. That's why, when &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; tries to take control of the web I won't do it. All my freedom as a developer comes from the integrity of the web. Once it's gone you can't get it back. I feel the pull. I could convert completely to HTTPS, it would make my life a bit easier to do so. But I won't as long as Google is the one forcing it. If they back off and commit to not blocking the non-HTTPS web, then maybe I have more flexibility.</description>

			<description>If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; user, and you can still access your files, you should download them asap. Use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/03/downloadFilesCommand.png&quot;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; in the Tools menu. Then you should switch to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It's a significantly better version of LO2 and &lt;i&gt;does not depend on Twitter&lt;/i&gt; for identity. I think the reason it still works for some people is that we cache the login information on the server, and as long as the server doesn't restart, you can continue to use it. But the server will eventually restart, and that'll be the end of LO2. It's had a good run and Drummer has been out there for a couple of years now.</description>

			<description>Of course Harvard is using ChatGPT in their comp sci classes. I can't believe how snotty &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/harvard-is-using-chatgpt-to-teach-computer-science/&quot;&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; can be. If you were a doctor and a new treatment for cancer appeared, no matter how flawed, you'd want your students to be up on it. Maybe they'll figure out how to fix the flaws. Journalists act as if they're the only ones who know the outcome and everyone else is either corrupt or stupid. That's who covers news for us.</description>

			<title>Still diggin!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Where did &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22still+diggin%22&quot;&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;come from? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use this phrase to end posts about stuff I'm working on that's now ready to use. A new feature, fix or workaround. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea. As a developer, I started off a long time ago by digging a hole. Then I dug another, filling the first hole with the dirt from the second. Then a third and fourth and so on. The holes get a little better over time, deeper, new features, etc. But they're still holes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At the end, when I've dug my last hole, what will be left is a hole and a bunch of piles of dirt. Over time, the piles erode and maybe someone else fills in the last hole and another group of humans do it all again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So when I say I'm &lt;i&gt;still diggin&lt;/i&gt; that means I'm still alive, digging holes and filling them in. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, there's another theory about where Still Diggin! came from. Back in my youth, when the NYC power utility &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Edison&quot;&gt;Con Ed&lt;/a&gt; dug up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/62710514&quot;&gt;street&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JulianneBond/status/585938323799171072&quot;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; posted a sign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/weekinreview/once-again-for-con-ed-it-s-dig-we-must.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Dig we must for a greater New York!&quot; That stuck with me. And if you think about it, it's just another instance of the use in the first explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

A validator-validator. I'd submit my feed to it via a web service (not sure if they have an API), and if that feed doesn't validate with the W3C validator, and we believe it is valid per the RSS 2.0 spec, we would open an issue on their repo. Maybe if they want to be really cooperative, they could run the test feeds against their validator whenever they make an update as part of the validation process, and never release a version where those feeds didn't validate. This would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/allay&quot;&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; my concern about them breaking RSS because they don't respect or understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. I'd start with the Scripting News RSS feed, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;does validate&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validation.png&quot;&gt;this time&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, their warnings are bogus imho. They should recognize the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Source namespace&lt;/a&gt; not warn me about it. A copyright statement can and should be able to have a &amp;copy; character. Why not? The spec doesn't prohibit it, and it's part of the language we use for copyright. And this is not an Atom feed so that warning about Atom was a bad move. The authors of the original validator were promoting Atom at the expense of RSS. Why not put that to bed, it's not exactly an ethical thing for a validator to do imho.</description>

			<description>Over on Masto and Blueski you hear a lot of people rooting for Twitter's demise. I am not one of them.Twitter is deeply installed in our society. It would take a long time to rebuild something like Twitter, and I don't think it's even possible. I don't like Musk's politics, an understatement, but I see that problem as possible to overcome.</description>

I realized something, ever since &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; moved to email identity and therefore had to use HTTPS to protect the passwords, any time I include an image in the right margin of a blog post, it has to also be served by HTTPS or else the browser will refuse to load it when the item is viewed in FeedLand. It has probably also meant that the right-margin images weren't showing up in other RSS systems for much longer. So anyway, if you see the delicious &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2010/11/12/loveRss.gif&quot;&gt;Love RSS icon&lt;/a&gt; in the right margin of this post in FeedLand that means I've found a workaround that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/itWorked.png&quot;&gt;works&lt;/a&gt;. My writing life gets more complicated. I guess it's worth it?</description>

			<description>Our challenge is to make sure the really interesting stuff happens on the open web, outside the silos. If that happens we can go on. Otherwise we go right back to where we were when Twitter and Facebook dominated. Not a good place. 17 years of stagnation.</description>

Has to be that way. There are hundreds of thousands of us, maybe tens of them. They're having trouble keeping the system running. As I dig in more on Bluesky, not because I'm getting married to the platform, btw -- more friends reach out and ask for help getting an invite code. It isn't about Bluesky though, it's just that we got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html&quot;&gt;the feeds up&lt;/a&gt; there first, so there's a way I can build. Ultimately my goal is to build a layer on top of all the social nets I can, so it doesn't matter which service you use, the stuff I create can make it to you and will. I used to write about &quot;when a big tree falls it creates room for new growth.&quot; I wrote that about Jerry Garcia. And it's equally true about Twitter. As they vacate, and get smaller and more focused, I believe understandably, the places they vacate once again become interesting places to develop. I can't miss an opportunities like these.</description>

			<description>I found and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/207&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; a problem with inline images from &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; as displayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;.
