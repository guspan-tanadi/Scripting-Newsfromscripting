			<title>Kevin Durant</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When Kevin Durant said the Knicks aren't cool anymore, he actually dared the next generation of NBA stars, guys in their mid-20s now, to think the Knicks are cool. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Durant, at 33, with two *extremely* bad moves behind him, is no longer the authority on what's cool. He's untradeable, stuck in a shit deal that he openly hates, that all began with him dissing the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When he shit on the Knicks it was a blessing! Haha. üëè&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hate the fucking Nets, but if they were smart, they could counteract this hex by signing Melo for one or two seasons. That would spook NY fans. Make them possibly re-think the Nets (to be clear, not me).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

My two cents. OK with me. But tune up your pricing so it lets your product grow like a weed. The tragedy of Heroku, which I was building my software base on, is that they made the product diseconomic for its natural niche -- quick scripts that need to run on the net 24-by-7 but are very low bandwidth. I run dozens of those. It makes no sense to pay $7 a month to run each of them when they can all run together on a $5 a month server at Digital Ocean. It took me years to reimplement Heroku but I did. The shame of it is that lots of other people did it too. One of the responsibilities of a company that makes a product as useful as Heroku is to not get too much in the way of its destiny. Salesforce really fucked that up.</description>

Interesting idea. It'll work if you start to hear pundits use the term. Intuitively -- I think the truth is there are no Maga Repubs.

That's really who the term seems to be a gift to. Through the ongoing Trump crime spree, he's still campaigning for the Republican candidates. The other term I don't like is &quot;semi-fascist.&quot; Another dream -- somehow there are two kinds of fascists, ones who are on the way to being fascists and the real fascists. Again anyone who voted for Trump in 2020 qualifies as 100 percent American grown Nazi Party fascists, imho -- that is. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;üòÑ&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>People aren't toxic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Calling a person toxic is really bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the kind of thing people who run death camps say about the people they put in death camps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a trigger for me -- as a child of Holocaust survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There aren't many insults I'll complain about, but that's one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Sometimes in programming you have to set up a test that might take a minute or two to run. While I'm waiting today I ask my speaker to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ATTjg7tpE&quot;&gt;Oye C√≥mo Va&lt;/a&gt; by Santana as my waiting music. It gives me something lively to groove to while the gears in the cloud mesh and produce the test result. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lLYOGDsts&quot;&gt;song they play&lt;/a&gt; while the contestants write down their Final Jeopardy questions.</description>

I heard that the DoJ had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/barr-mueller-report/index.html&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the heavily redacted memo by former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;Attorney General Barr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22187584-barr-unredacted-memo&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/n5SRHdcPLAI&quot;&gt;basically said&lt;/a&gt; that the Mueller Report (that we hadn't at the time seen) was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nothingburger&quot;&gt;Nothingburger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/barr-mueller-report/index.html&quot;&gt;without the redactions&lt;/a&gt;. So I expected there would be something interesting on MSNBC. The show opens with an in-detail horse race story that said basically we fucked up and it wasn't a foregone conclusion that the Repubs would take Congress in the upcoming midterm election as we have been reporting since just after the 2020 election. Right. This is now horserace journalism of a higher order, the horserace we're judging is how well Hayes et al were doing at predicting the outcome of the election, which btw, is a theoretical thing because (pause here) THE FUCKING ELECTION STILL HASN'T HAPPENED. Sorry for screaming, but this is such a waste, and how could anyone possibly care about this. Every time they report &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom&quot;&gt;conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, they have driven far off course, they are no longer doing news, they are doing self-butthole examination. What a waste. And it's kind of obvious (imho) that Hayes has been going to the Tucker Carlson School School of Acting. He's trying to talk like him. It's really sad. Maybe MSNBC could just hire Carlson to work for them. After all if the Mets can buy players from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor&quot;&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer&quot;&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;, why can't MNBC buy an actor from Fox News to play for them. The amount of actual news reporting on both networks is pitifully small.</description>

			<title>Markdown is just enough HTML</title>

And I have a confession to make. Going back to the beginning, I've been taking all the HTML markup out of the text because feed producers totally abuse the privilege, inserting all kinds of garbage into my reading space. So I just take it all out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if other feed reader writers are as draconian as I. We should find out what they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there is a &lt;i&gt;safe way&lt;/i&gt; to put back just enough style -- Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We finally have it working in the new feed reader I've been working on, and it's fantastic. Markdown is just enough HTML and not too much. Exactly the right amount for what we need in the world of feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;source:markdown&gt;&lt;/a&gt; element. If you use it as &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://tweetfeed.org/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;we do&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweetfeed.org/&quot;&gt;tweetfeed&lt;/a&gt; app, your feeds will work with my reader, and we'll be on our way to a bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to have a class of students who want to participate in shipping a product, and thereby learn how to do it themselves at some time in the future. Accredited and graded, which gets the student's attention. First thing I'd teach is how to write a report on software, whether it be a bug, or an idea for improvement. You have to show that you've done something to try to narrow it down, and understand the consequences of what you're asking for. Do we have the resources on the team to contemplate this. Is this something I could do for myself. If I got the feature would I be able to use it or am I just thinking of something would be nice to have, perhaps for others. Everyone feels they would know how to design software, but if they could get close enough to it to see how it actually works, they would see that there's actually a lot to it.</description>

			<title>Ulster County bagels?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I made a trip &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html&quot;&gt;down to NYC&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago, and picked up a fresh bagel with cream cheese and lox at Utopia Bagels in Queens. It was heaven. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't imagine I'm going to get that good a bagel in Ulster County, but what about a fresh bagel? I went to Lox of Bagels in Saugerties last Tuesday, they had bins full of bagels that &lt;i&gt;looked&lt;/i&gt; fresh and there was a long line of people waiting to be served so it seemed promising. But the bagels were old and stale. Yck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay I'm going to go to every bagel place in the area until I find one that's decent. Or maybe you can save me the time??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>This doesn't work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay -- Trump doesn't play by the rules of journalism. He doesn't explain why he had the stolen documents. His only response is to flood the zone with bullshit as Bannon says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems on the other hand accept the rules of journalism, which over decades has come to mean avoid saying anything, so everything Dems say comes out more and more like mush. They work hard to say nothing for fear of provoking a new scandal in the press.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We view what Trump does negatively, but what about the other journalism as the sole judge approach? It doesn't work any better for us, in fact you'd have to say at this time that approach is losing. We're one election away from becoming an openly fascist country.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why, sorry to say -- I'm not sad to see the enforcers of journalism at CNN and other news orgs get fired. Because the system they are enforcing is flushing our system down the toilet. And the system, even though it's fucked up, is better than having no system at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the big journalism thinkers think this idea deserves to be part of the mix. You never see it on the op-ed pages, or part of the discussion on The Beat with Ari Melber. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're all dead now. Their opinions don't matter. So if the opinions mean nothing now, what did they mean when they were alive? I would say they meant nothing then too. And if it applied to them it must certainly apply to me. I find it relaxing to know I don't have to figure everything out, because it doesn't matter what I think. It just doesn't matter. Now innovation might matter, but most of it goes unrecognized. My uncle for example, invented a windmill that didn't need to be repositioned to catch the wind. If the wind was blowing it would capture the energy. Earlier this evening I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/1560757203870547970&quot;&gt;saw&lt;/a&gt; it had been invented again, because no one heard about my uncle's invention, except for people who loved him. Even so, I think that matters, because his ideas led to more ideas. That's very different from opinions. Ken thought all kinds of things that, to me, were bullshit. He could have saved the energy, because it didn't end up meaning anything. Also how well did they communicate their ideas? My maternal grandfather, Rudy Kiesler, Ken's father, actually got a mention in the Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for my great uncle, his brother-in-law. They said he was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/21/rudyKieslerCommunistQuote.png&quot;&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;! I spent a lot of time with him growing up and in million years I'd never have thought he was a communist. He was a voracious capitalist, but then -- he always seemed to support liberal causes. And he was a Mets fan. So maybe there was some truth to it? He definitely had strong opinions, that man, but he must not have communicated them effectively, or maybe he was hiding this from his grandhildren? Hmm.</description>

She had a lot of opinions. But she also acted on them. That's the difference. The opinions aren't worth anything. But the actions matter.</description>

But this is really me, Dave -- coming to you late at night.</description>

			<description>Turns out I did have something to say. I'm watching a great HBO series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Friend_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/a&gt;. It got the highest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/my-brilliant-friend&quot;&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; on Metacritic, and it is deserved. Almost like watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; (who I love) in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone&quot;&gt;first movie&lt;/a&gt;, and realizing there's going to be a lot more of this and being happy to be around to see all of it. There are three seasons, I'm only on episode 4 of season 1. I'm sure there will be a lot more to say about this.  In the meantime I'm just enjoying a beautiful film as a TV series about two children growing up in Naples in the 1950s.</description>

He posted a horribly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/19/frankenJoke.png&quot;&gt;anti-Semitic quote&lt;/a&gt; from Trump on Twitter. Now he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alfranken/status/1560430185375305728&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it was a joke. I almost forwarded it as evidence of how depraved Trump is, but it really was proof of what an idiot Franken is. A self-destructive idiot, who was it seems on his way back, but he should just go away quietly and never be heard from again. A punchline to a joke -- remember what it was like to elect a &quot;comedian&quot; to Congress.</description>

			<description>I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;xmlviewer.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; to link to feeds because browsers make a mess of displaying feeds. Suggestion to browser devs: treat viewing a feed as lifting the hood on a car or viewing the source of an HTML page. When you do that, you don't see another car interior, or another rendering of the HTML. You see a lot of technical stuff. Trust people who don't want to know how the web works will quickly hit the Back button to get back to the comfort of the user interface.</description>

			<description>Why now? RSS 2.0 will be &lt;i&gt;twenty years old&lt;/i&gt; on September 18. One month from today. I'm working on something pretty big for that day, maybe it'll be out a bit earlier, who knows. But in the meantime, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweetfeed.org/&quot;&gt;something new&lt;/a&gt; to spark a new use for RSS and Twitter -- hooking people's tweets up to feed reader apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsblur.com/&quot;&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoldreader.com/&quot;&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
