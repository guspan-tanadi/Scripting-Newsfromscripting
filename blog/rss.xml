			<title>Selfless?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/24/dontLookUp.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;We always assume &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/df64b507-966b-459f-b76a-ddd5845394b8&quot;&gt;selflessness&lt;/a&gt; is a good thing, but I'm not sure. In certain situations, telling a lie to save someone's life, that's probably the right thing to do, but lying to spare someone's feelings? They'll be upset if you tell the truth so you don't. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a house where you had to manage other people's feelings. It was so dirty and I hated it so much. I had serious stomach issues as a kid, that suddenly went away when I was no longer living in that house. But being selfless meant I had to spare everyone else's feelings, and as result, betray myself, hurt myself, act selfless, as in my &quot;self&quot; doesn't exist. But outside the family, I was surprised to find that I actually did have a self.  And that is when I &lt;i&gt;started&lt;/i&gt; feeling like a person. Started, I still had a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until many years later that I discovered these patterns everywhere in my life, just not so suffocating as the ones in my childhood home. I was always clashing against this, because I wanted to do important creative things with my life, and as they say -- you can't lie to a compiler, garbage in, garbage out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is a hot topic here because I've listened through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-165-dark-star-by-the-grateful-dead/&quot;&gt;500 Songs episode&lt;/a&gt; about the Grateful Dead, all four hours 40 minutes of it, and learned how the selflessness  destroyed their gift. The fans and their employees made demands, and the band gave them what they wanted. I had never heard the story of the Dead told this way, but it matches up with the facts I have from living through that period myself, and going to quite a few Dead shows, and being one step removed from people who worked in the Dead company, and almost dying myself from similar kinds of pressure. Ultimately if you want to live, you have to not be selfless. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>It might not be possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification&quot;&gt;de-Nazify&lt;/a&gt; social nets like Twitter, Mastodon or Bluesky -- yet that seems to be what users want.

			<description>What if for the sake of argument there were lots of Mastodon or Bluesky instances that didn't connect to any other instances, that just served little communities, maybe gathered around a blog, for example. Each one being its own Reddit type thing, or a micro-Twitter. Not part of anything bigger than themselves. And what if it were reallllly easy to start one of these things. And, what if it were carefully designed to do at least what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec calls for. What if.</description>

			<description>When I was in my late teens going to school in New Orleans, there were still a lot of childhood foods I didn't like -- asparagus, fish, cheese -- but I decided to be brave and try each of them, and I found that I now liked most. This was important because there's a wide variety of great affordable food in New Orleans, it would have been a shame to miss out on it.</description>

			<description>The trick to making a system easy to work on when one part is on a server and the other part runs on the user's machine, is to make the machine the same in both locations, so code that runs in one place &quot;just works&quot; in the other. The further the two are from each other, the more difficult it is to work on. Ideally you should stay in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language&quot;&gt;HLL&lt;/a&gt; even in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/98/04/stories/simpleCrossNetworkScript.html&quot;&gt;remote procedure calls&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters&quot;&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. The top of the journalism food chain, where they all want to be. In the last episode she talked about how many times she had talked with Rupert Murdoch, who the patriarch of Succession is patterned after. That was a strange idea for me. Not only have I never spoken with him, if I were to meet him, I probably wouldn't find anything he said interesting. I went to a lot of conferences in the 80s with people like him. I hated it. Yet my vision of tech has been implemented, in the interim. She and I live in dramatically versions of tech. We don't even remotely speak the same language. Yet she is considered an authority on what tech has value and doesn't. That was the big epiphany for me, the moment I realized we are completely living in different worlds. She created this Facebook, Twitter, Spotify world as much as Zuckerberg, Musk or Ek. So if you don't like the way it turned out, you shouldn't look in that direction for leadership. That said she does good interviews, I will miss the podcast after next week, although I gotta say they could probably keep doing it for &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; and still be interesting. Succession is great TV, terrible reality. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW, I know that a lot of people can't get on Bluesky. But if you know me, I'm not just doing this for one social net. The point is that once we have something wonderful running on one, we have something to show to people on others. And I'm on Mastodon and Twitter still (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/24.html#a133305&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). Both have APIs and could conceivably get the same features we've added to Bluesky. That's what &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; is all about, it flattens out the differences between the networks at a higher level than tweets. Optional titles, styling, links, enclosures, editable, no length limits.</description>

			<description>I decided to pay Twitter a year in advance for the blue checkmark and whatever other privileges come with it. It's not that much money. I pay more to Hulu or Apple TV. Is it worth it? I can afford to find out. (I've gotten a bit of pushback. There are users on Twitter, and I make software for people who use systems like Twitter, so it's like owning a Windows machine if you make software that runs on Windows.)</description>

Imagine a newsletter publishing app that let you feed stories to it from your favorite editor via RSS for publication to a list of subscribers. I'm thinking of a future Substack competitor that doesn't force writers to use their editor. It simply provides a service to any writer who uses an editor that can produce an RSS feed as output. Another example, if Mastodon handled inbound feeds, you'd be able to follow someone on Bluesky from within Mastodon. I would love to see this connection made asap.</description>

Good move. He also says he isn't into basketball if he isn't in the race for a championship. See there's the problem, right there. There are 30 teams in the NBA. In any given year 29 of them will not win the championship. 28 of them won't even make the Finals. Yet their fans felt their seasons were worthwhile if they played the game with heart, if there's hope for next season. This is why I am not a Yankees fan or a LeBron James fan. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/10/20/winningIsntEverything.html&quot;&gt;love my team&lt;/a&gt; even when they lose, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; when they lose.</description>

			<description>BTW, I understand where LeBron is coming from. When I started a software company in the early 80s, the business was tough and we almost went under quite a few times. But I couldn't lose. I couldn't face myself if it didn't work. So I &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; it work. But, after winning once, I relaxed and focused on the art of it. I've already won, now why did I get into this in the first place? I had something to say, which was more than about how I can win. I can also make beauty and break through and do new things with the medium I chose.</description>

			<title>Default will spark a virus</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Default will not be a moment as defined by the Treasury, it will be when the world decides the US as a bank isn't trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That will be a virus like Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A virus of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The virus has a name -- it's called a &quot;bank run.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not one bank, but all banks at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I suppose I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; admire him, if I wasn't so tired of him. And I don't like what he pioneered in basketball, the idea that a player not a team wins championships. He did that when he moved to Miami and then back to Cleveland and now in Los Angeles. His selling proposition was &quot;buy my contract and I'll bring you a championship.&quot; I had enough of that when he relocated to Cleveland. I've seen other players do it, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; who I also despise, and teams that fall for it over and over like the Brooklyn Nets, only to find out not only that it doesn't (usually) work, but that who the fuck cares if &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how you win a championship. Another reason I don't like LeBron is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+melo&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; can't get a job and LeBron still has one. They're of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NBA_draft&quot;&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, and Melo never won a championship, that's his own fault, not blaming LeBron for that. But everyone from LeBron's era is retired now, except LeBron and maybe Chris Paul, who's probably been done for a couple of years now and hasn't admitted it yet. And I don't like Los Angeles teams in general, having lived in New York and the Bay Area, that factors into it as well. That, and sports is the one area where you're still allowed to have opinions about things, in this age when opinions are often considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/21/toxic.png?nodialog=true&quot;&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

That's not your fault. The best thing is to breathe a bit, and love your friend who is living in memory and not the moment and -- you are not responsible for what their parent did.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, just because your parents left you wanting more love or a special kind of love doesn't mean they were bad parents. You always clash with people you're close to. Who else are you going to clash with? Sometimes people think someone is bad just because you didn't do that they wanted you to do. That's not your responsibility either. And that doesn't make you a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In my family, growing up, we never lived up to our mother's idea of a perfect family, the family she felt she deserved. When I finally figured out this was what was going on I tried to show her that she wasn't doing her part to create a perfect family, that became just another one of her many grievances! So now I see this behavior everywhere I look. Sometimes I think everyone I know feels they deserve a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave It To Beaver&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Eddie%27s_Father&quot;&gt;Courtship of Eddie's Father&lt;/a&gt;. That's the problem with culture, they give us a totally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Cards&quot;&gt;Hallmark&lt;/a&gt; view of what life should be like. It's entertainment, and it's compelling but it's also complete bullshit. Yet many of us think that's the ideal for life and if they aren't getting it they're deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've seen great teachers of meditation get caught up in their movies, everyone does it. The trick is to be conscious sometimes and see yourself as part of a very hard to describe humanity, and to take what comes to you as what was meant to be. My mother in her later years said things like that but I don't think she really believed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: My mom was a badass. She fought for school desegregation in Queens. Got a PhD after she finished raising her kids. Born in Prague in 1932, ran from the Nazis a few years later, in a baby carriage. Moved from her parents house to her married house. She had a tough life. Cared a lot, probably more than was good for her.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
