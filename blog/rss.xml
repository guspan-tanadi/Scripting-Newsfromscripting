			<description>Life is really cheap in the US these days. We lost over a million Americans to Covid. A few deaths from gun violence or assassination doesn't move the needle like it used to.</description>

And of course the same code could be used anywhere in any project because reallySimple is open source. Why wait for Blue Sky. This approach is simple, and ready to go, today. Build a platform one brick at a time not in a big explosion of specs, imho.</description>

			<description>For decades I've used BofA to pay bills, but I was never satisfied with the service. They don’t keep records, so I can’t see all the checks I’ve sent to an account. And lately their website is broken. I contacted them to get them to fix the site, but as I expected, they made me jump through hoops to prove I had tried everything. I tolerated that once, but then they passed me over to another department, and I could see all the hoop-jumping was going to happen again. I give up. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1587046918085132289&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; I asked for recommendations of banks that do a decent job of bill-pay. And I'm getting some good tips. Have a look, and if you have good or bad experience, please chime in.</description>

			<description>Someone actually told me yesterday they would stop reading my blog if I didn’t stop using Twitter. I blocked them of course. I have many mottos, one that has served me well in circumstances like this -- Don't slam the door on the way out. It's powerless and manipulative. If you have to go, just go. Quietly. Anyway, it's bullshit to leave Twitter just because the current owner is a prick. We use the platform for lots of stuff, and it's still useful. Until there's a place to reassemble (yes, I've heard of Mastodon), Twitter is what we got.</description>

Warning what would happen if a Republican bought Twitter. Has anyone heard Musk say he's trying to protect American democracy? A realist would have to say at this point that American democracy is not a good bet. I think it's pretty much already gone folks. Musk has opened his channel with Putin, and the two are going to exchange favors. Musk is in a stronger position than Trump was, probably even when Trump was president. He has all this money Trump never had. And now he has a platform more powerful than all the newspapers in the world.</description>

			<description>Musk said what Trump would've said if he were on Twitter. This made a connection for me. Musk wants to be Trump. At some point he will welcome Trump, but only when Trump is just the old version of Musk. Like the Beatles inviting Elvis to do a concert with them. He could do it but it wouldn't matter.</description>

			<description>Elon Musk said something horrible and this is causing some people to get serious about qutting Twitter. I see why they might be doing it, but I didn't quit Twitter when Trump took it over, and his tweets were impossible to avoid. But people are doing it, and that gets me interested in the idea of a brain-dead simple to use and simple to host way of pushing messages into the ether so friends can easily and quickly catch them. Nothing more than that and of course an API, also minimal, for peering.</description>

			<description>BTW, Trump wasn't banned from Twitter for being right-wing. He was banned for organizing an attack on the US govt, openly, using Twitter. No one on the left has done that, despite what some idiotic Murdoch-employed pundit said on the BBC this morning. Someone in journalism ought to ask Musk about this, btw. Or at least raise the issue. Is it okay to use Twitter to organize acts of violence?</description>

It's like living in NY and not taking the subway. Sure it's dirty and smells bad, but it's how you get places.&quot; From this certain people concluded that I was in favor of Musk buying Twitter.

I'm with Smith and Kendzior. Also, having started on Twitter in 2006, and having contributed its foundational ideas, and as one of the shareholders Musk bought out, I'm anxious to see how this goes. I didn't quit when &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar&quot;&gt;Dick Costolo&lt;/a&gt; was CEO, it's hard to imagine that Musk could be any worse.</description>

			<description>Today is the first day that Elon Musk owns Twitter. It's also the first day that I'm not allowed to wear a contact lens in my right eye because I have to get my lens replaced at the end of November, and to get the measurement for the new lens you have to not wear the contact for two weeks. My appointment for the measurement is in two weeks, hence no contact lens starting today. For most people this would not be a problem, just wear glasses, but I already have the lens replacement in my left eye, so the glasses I'm wearing have nothing for the left eye and a strong correction for the right. I existed this way for a number of years, and kind of got used to it, but hated it. And today, having worn the contact lens for years, this arrangement not only makes my vision deceptive it also makes me nauseous. But I will, somehow, get through this. I'm worried about driving though. I guess at this time I'm kind of glad to have a Tesla Model Y with FSD. I'm sure I'll have more to say about this. :glasses:</description>

			<description>BTW, owning a Tesla does not make me a Musk fan-boy. I bought it before I knew much about Musk, a year ago. It's amazing how in-your-face he's become in the last year.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1585930606885494786&quot;&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt; said today, on Twitter, something very wise and imho true. &quot;Platform censorship had clearly gone too far. Content moderation should be an individual decision, not a corporate prison. Let people make their own choices — and not just on Twitter.&quot; Indeed. Twitter already has good tools for individuals to systematically ignore posts from Trump, for example. Just block him, something I did in 2016. But I can't stop people from RTing him, even when he is banned from Twitter. They post screen shots. I need a way to block that bullshit too. I do not want to hear &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; from Trump. I don't give a shit if he's a former president. That used to be a title of respect, but Trump cashed that out, and a lot of other good stuff about the US, a long time ago.</description>

One time a drunk asshole from Utah or Wyoming walked into me and tried to pick a fight. I did what NYers do, no eye contact, keep walking, just mind my own business. I thought it was funny he was trying to explain how to walk in Manhattan. Fucking idiots walk six across, take up all the space, drunk, what do they think is going to happen. Of course next time they're going to be carrying a gun thanks to the Supreme Court.</description>

			<description>I like the name &lt;i&gt;FeedLand&lt;/i&gt; because even though it's a new name, it feels familiar. I also like that it's not any brand of feed, let's move beyond that. Feeds are feeds. I don't care what language you use. Let's have fun. And &quot;land&quot; well -- that was half the name of a company I started many years ago, that did some great stuff that I'm proud of.</description>

			<description>FeedLand can also generate feeds, not just read them. For example, when I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; an item in a feed I'm reading in FeedLand, it's automatically added to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://data.feedland.org/likes/davewiner.xml&quot;&gt;public feed&lt;/a&gt; of the items I've liked. Every user gets one of these feeds. I've subscribed to the feed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedly.com&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;, since it's RSS, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/feedlyScreen.png&quot;&gt;works&lt;/a&gt;. Of course you can also subscribe to it &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdata.feedland.org%2Flikes%2Fdavewiner.xml&quot;&gt;in FeedLand&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>FeedLand's feed-reading tech</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A general note about feed technology. The reason FeedLand is syntax-agnostic is because of an open source package for Node.js called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; that I built on. It understands and flattens out the names in RSS, Atom and RDF feeds. I am thankful for not having to deal with feeds at that level.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedRead&quot;&gt;layer&lt;/a&gt; I built on top of the package hid some complexity in its API that imho is only necessary if you're like Google with an array of 100K systems reading a million feeds every minute. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, as part of the FeedLand project, I added another layer, because I don't want a stream of items with data about the feed packed into each item, I want to read the feed and get a JavaScript object with everything neatly organized, with all the info from the feed in the object. As simple as possible. Factored and factored again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's all in a package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt;. It's the code that FeedLand uses to read feeds, and it works pretty flawlessly as far as I can tell, and it's hell on wheels performance-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is what the JavaScript object &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.nytimes.com%2Fservices%2Fxml%2Frss%2Fnyt%2FTheater.xml&quot;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt;, for the NYT's theater feed. Tell me if you think it's fast. I certainly do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- I hope people use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple&quot;&gt;reallySimple&lt;/a&gt;. It really does make feed reading in Node as easy as reading a JSON file.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Rivers and mailboxes in FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; there are three ways to view a feed and a menu to switch between them. To try this out, go to your Feed List (choose &lt;i&gt;My feed list&lt;/i&gt; in the first menu) and click on the title of one of the feeds. This takes you to its &lt;i&gt;Feed Info&lt;/i&gt; page, one of the three views. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feed Info page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;1. Here's a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.arstechnica.com%2Farstechnica%2Findex&quot;&gt;Feed Info page&lt;/a&gt; for Ars Technica. This page has basic info about the feed, when it was added and who added it. It says when it was last checked, last updated (a new item appeared in the feed), how many items we've retrieved from the feed, how long it took to read the feed (an indication of how healthy its server is) and most important, who is subscribed to the feed.  When you click on a user's name, you're taken to their feed list (&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=gwthompson&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), where you may find other feeds to subscribe to. This is what we mean about FeedLand being made of people (and feeds and news too, of course). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you look in the menu bar, you'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/viewMenuScreen.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; there's a &lt;i&gt;View&lt;/i&gt; menu. It gives you a way to switch between the three views. For the next step choose &lt;i&gt;View as mailbox.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mailbox view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?mailbox=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.arstechnica.com%2Farstechnica%2Findex&quot;&gt;Mailbox view&lt;/a&gt; presents a feed as if it were a collection of email, with the titles and descriptions in the left column and the full text of each item in the right column. You'll find this familiar if you use most other feed readers, it's the most common way of presenting feed content. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;patterned&lt;/a&gt; my mailbox reader after the one in &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;, designed by a former colleague, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Brent+Simmons&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;River view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;3. To see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?river=https%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.arstechnica.com%2Farstechnica%2Findex&quot;&gt;River view&lt;/a&gt;, choose &lt;i&gt;View as river&lt;/i&gt; from the View menu. In this view you see the feed contents presented as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; -- a format I've used in all my feed products going back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.userland.com/&quot;&gt;My.UserLand&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. The River view is different because it presents just the items from one feed, not a set of feeds. The full text of the item is not displayed by default, but you can see it by clicking on the down arrow in the lower right corner of each item, if it has text that is hidden. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/arrowscreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Screen shots: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/riverviewscreen.png&quot;&gt;River view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/mailboxviewscreen.png&quot;&gt;Mailbox view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/27/feedinfoviewscreen.png&quot;&gt;Feed Info page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For more info, see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/about.opml&quot;&gt;Deeper docs page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/110&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt; to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>News Products from FeedLand</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/JohnPhilpin/13551299&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; John Philpin was blazing his way through News Products. I said I would help him get through it today. That's the purpose of this blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Background: There are many new ideas in FeedLand. I've spent all of 2022 working on it, and I've been self-sidelined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rss.land/&quot;&gt;rss.land&lt;/a&gt; for many of the 20 years since the RSS 2.0 spec was finalized, so I had a lot of ideas waiting to be tried out. One of those is News Products, it's one of the ways FeedLand is a developer platform. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/newsProducts.opml&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; on News Products. They begin: &quot;A news product is a one-page website you create with FeedLand for people outside of FeedLand to read.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is an easy path into News Products, and it's explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/newsProducts.opml#1663600074000&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; in the docs. John took that approach first, with excellent results. But he wants to do more than that, so let's scoot ahead to the most advanced form of News Product, which require you to specify them in an outline.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The most advanced News Product I have at this time is &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;news.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;. It uses all the features of News Products. And in the spirit of sharing, here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/products/newsScriptingCom.opml&quot;&gt;OPML source&lt;/a&gt; for the product. You can start with that, and make changes to customize it for whatever product you have in mind. The docs go into &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/newsProducts.opml#1663602349000&quot;&gt;great detail&lt;/a&gt; on this outline-based products. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If John or anyone else has questions, I've started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/108&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the FeedLand support repo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am subscribed to 470 feeds. You can view &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt; as a feed reader, because of a feature I added late in the development process. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU9yE_axytQ&quot;&gt;wedge next to each feed&lt;/a&gt; expands the feed to show the most recent five items from the feed. With the &lt;i&gt;When&lt;/i&gt; column selected, the feed list is in reverse chronologic order. This was not planned, I just put the sorting titles in because it made sense (it's a feature in most file systems). But when it started updating I realized this was something unique and powerful. A feed list that is also great for reading feeds. They update pretty frequently, so there probably should be a feature that disables automatic updating temporarily. There is such a feature in the Settings dialog, but it's hard to remember that you've set it.</description>

			<source:outline text="I am subscribed to 470 feeds. You can view &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner&quot;&gt;my feed list&lt;/a&gt; as a feed reader, because of a feature I added late in the development process. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU9yE_axytQ&quot;&gt;wedge next to each feed&lt;/a&gt; expands the feed to show the most recent five items from the feed. With the &lt;i&gt;When&lt;/i&gt; column selected, the feed list is in reverse chronologic order. This was not planned, I just put the sorting titles in because it made sense (it's a feature in most file systems). But when it started updating I realized this was something unique and powerful. A feed list that is also great for reading feeds. They update pretty frequently, so there probably should be a feature that disables automatic updating temporarily. There is such a feature in the Settings dialog, but it's hard to remember that you've set it." created="Tue, 25 Oct 2022 12:09:20 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/10/25.html#a120920"/>

			<description>I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/randomStarterList&quot;&gt;simple utility&lt;/a&gt; today that generates the starter list from a set of feeds I've put into the &lt;i&gt;starters&lt;/i&gt; category on FeedLand. It's proof that this works nicely as a platform for moving around lists of feeds. The code is almost as simple as it would have been in Frontier, twenty or so years ago. We're getting back into the zone. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I highly recommend reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml&quot;&gt;Starting Up&lt;/a&gt; doc. It shows how to find feeds to subscribe to, read the news, and find other users. FeedLand is all about people, feeds and news. It's not like any other feed reader that you've seen -- in fact it's very useful in conjunction &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; feed readers, thanks to the OPML subscription list standard.</description>

It's for support only. If you're stuck, can't figure out how to do something, or something appears to be not working. But please read the home page first, before posting. It's a small community, all volunteers, so use the resource carefully. And absolutely no speeches, or even feature suggestions. You can use the open web for all that. After all this time, we're not naive about how to keep peace in these groups, it's by having absolutely no tolerance for abuse.</description>

			<description>A nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1583546691549921280&quot;&gt;testimonial&lt;/a&gt; from Matt Mullenweg, about my role in getting podcasting started. Matt has made his own huge contribution to the open web with his WordPress content management system, and many other projects. I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; will fit in well with their new open source podcast client. Scroll to the end of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2022/10/open-source-podcasting-client/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/22/pocketAnnounceClip.png&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; how enthusiastic they are about sharing subscription lists. They don't know it yet, but they're going to get some incredible support from FeedLand. It's designed to plug into that interface. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1583551708621217792&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; to Matt that they go the next step and let the user enter the URL of an OPML list, and read it periodically so they can manage their subscriptions elsewhere. I like it because it'll mean all my favorite podcasts will be available there and on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://dave.podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;web podcast site&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

The announcers describe the scene. Someone from the crowd had run out on the field and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AriA1exander/status/1583287947469918208&quot;&gt;tried to hug&lt;/a&gt; the Houston infielder &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Altuve&quot;&gt;José Altuve&lt;/a&gt;. They described how the police were trying to catch the guy. How much would his lawyers cost for this? $10K another announcer thought. And he'll spend the night in jail, another collegue guessed. But we didn't see any of this. The camera never pointed at the action because to do so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/&quot;&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; felt, would encourage people to do more of this. It's a rule for a kind of journalism, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator#Main/play-by-play_commentator&quot;&gt;sports play-by-play&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think there's much actual journalism in the coverage of professional sports (I can go into that another time). Okay so what if there were a similar rule to political journalism, if they were not allowed to run stories based only on polling. For a different reason, because polling has proven to be wildly wrong in the last few elections. Polls were almost certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; would win. They got whole sections of the country wildly wrong. Many other examples. There are theories about why this is, but no one knows. So it seems hugely damaging, even unprofessional to report poll results as news, esp when it isn't disclaimed in the headline, so it's clear they're writing about fiction and the story is almost certainly 100% &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/span&gt;.</description>

			<source:outline text="Watching last night's playoff game between the Yankees and Astros, there was a moment when the camera zero'd in on the Houston pitcher, doing nothing. The announcers describe the scene. Someone from the crowd had run out on the field and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AriA1exander/status/1583287947469918208&quot;&gt;tried to hug&lt;/a&gt; the Houston infielder &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Altuve&quot;&gt;José Altuve&lt;/a&gt;. They described how the police were trying to catch the guy. How much would his lawyers cost for this? $10K another announcer thought. And he'll spend the night in jail, another collegue guessed. But we didn't see any of this. The camera never pointed at the action because to do so, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/&quot;&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; felt, would encourage people to do more of this. It's a rule for a kind of journalism, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator#Main/play-by-play_commentator&quot;&gt;sports play-by-play&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think there's much actual journalism in the coverage of professional sports (I can go into that another time). Okay so what if there were a similar rule to political journalism, if they were not allowed to run stories based only on polling. For a different reason, because polling has proven to be wildly wrong in the last few elections. Polls were almost certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;HRC&lt;/a&gt; would win. They got whole sections of the country wildly wrong. Many other examples. There are theories about why this is, but no one knows. So it seems hugely damaging, even unprofessional to report poll results as news, esp when it isn't disclaimed in the headline, so it's clear they're writing about fiction and the story is almost certainly 100% &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;bullshit&lt;/span&gt;." created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:51:50 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/21/altuve.png" urltweet="https://twitter.com/AriA1exander/status/1583287947469918208" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/10/21.html#a155150"/>

			<description>One of the big lessons I learned from selling what people now call &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Tools For Thought&lt;/span&gt; a long time ago, that there's a very limited market of people who see their job as thinking, even if there's a lot of thought to what they do. If you go to a Monday staff meeting and when it's your turn to speak you say &quot;I spent the week thinking about stuff&quot; you might be the first one they cut when it's time for layoffs or promotions. Bosses want to hear what you did, not what you thought about. The secret is this -- production applications. Things they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; with your product as opposed to thinking about things. If you find one of those that resonates, sell the shit out of it. For us it was presentations. It kept showing up near the top of lists of what people used &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/span&gt; for. When we made features specifically for presenting, the product took off. We went from selling &quot;idea processing&quot; to presenting. Sure there's a lot of thinking in preparing presentations, that's why the product worked so well for that. It's like saying there's a lot of steering in driving the car. What you're doing is driving. Steering is just part of it.</description>
