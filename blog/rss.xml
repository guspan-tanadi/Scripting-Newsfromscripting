			<description>Today is the first day of real autumn weather in the Catskills. I just got back from my daily bike ride. I was fairly cold as I started, by the end I was all toasty, zesty and feisty. Feeling my Wheaties.</description>

			<description>Journalism is highly conflicted re Facebook, and they never look at their own culpability in weakening democracy. If it weren't so damned profitable for journalism, I doubt if we'd have had Trump. but you never read that in the NYT or WSJ, or even MSNBC.</description>

			<title>The dateformat module</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A story about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I noticed that one of my server apps had restarted 21 hours ago, so I looked at the log, saw where it should have checked if something was &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/a&gt;, added the check, published a new release, then went to the app, updated it, tried to restart it, and it failed. The source of the failure was a very small module known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat&quot;&gt;dateformat&lt;/a&gt; that had updated, which is fine, maybe they have bugs. So I went to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/releases&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, and saw a reference to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/29/breakingChange.png&quot;&gt;breaking change&lt;/a&gt;, which sounded like it might be the thing that broke my app (not well documented imho), and I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/releases/tag/v4.5.1&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; before the breaking change, released on Jan 30, and updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/blob/master/package.json&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of this tale to require the earlier version, rebuilt it, and it worked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sounds painless enough, but each step involved me figuring out how this or that worked. A tiny area of one app that I had long ago forgot about because you figure once date formatting is done, it's done. Right. It's not like there's any great technological breakthroughs in date formatting, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the maintainers of the dateformat module wanted to use a feature that wasn't in the version of Node my server was running. As far as I can tell the feature had nothing to do with its mission, formatting dates. What they were saying is I should accept their change and upgrade to the version of Node they require.  if I were to do that, I'd have to shut down the server, upgrade Node, and then test all of the apps running on the server to see whether the new version of Node broke them, which imho is much more likely than dateformat breaking them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is the culture of development these days. Breaking changes for stylistic reasons are fine. It's the reward for maintaining a useful &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; module -- you can force the attention of developers all over the place. This is just one module, add it up and the half-life of a Node app is very short indeed. Not a good situation imho. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was thinking of adding a landline feature to my cable service. $12.99 a month sounds okay. But then I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/28/voicePlan.png&quot;&gt;fine print&lt;/a&gt;. Oy. I remember how hard it was to get rid of a feature last time around. I swear if only they'd stop scamming. I'm paying $8.99 a month to rent an Apple TV, even though I already had an Apple TV. Them's the rules they said. Can't get TV without paying the set top box tax. Oy oy.

			<description>What made me think of getting a landline? All of a sudden the phone app on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a&quot;&gt;Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt; refuses to connect over wifi, a requirement since there's no cell service here. Not having a reliable way to make a phone call, that's not okay. And the way I used to make calls on my computer with Google Hangouts, that doesn't work anymore either. They said use Google Chat now. OK, but where in Google Chat, on my desktop (which they have) can I make a phone call? Every one of these companies is missing part of the plan for how to build reliable service around the still relatively new (I guess) open network. They all still want to completely control you and soak you for services you don't want, and change things around so you never get to feel confident in using their software. How that helps them, I have no idea.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1442601620869554180&quot;&gt;Netflix CEO takes a shot&lt;/a&gt; at HBO Max, which makes me think, I can't remember the last time I watched something on Netflix, and I watch HBO Max content all the time. I think they have a deeper and more intelligent base of stories than Netflix, which seems to be skewing toward mindless garbage, although HBO is trying to catch up in that area.</description>

			<description>The basic problem (imho) is that we all have been raised to believe that &lt;i&gt;getting ahead&lt;/i&gt; is the thing to do with our lives. It's deeply ingrained over many generations. We're still doing that, even though the three big crises we're going to be dealing with for the rest of our lives. demand a different impulse -- &lt;i&gt;working together.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Captures all the complex code behind the interface, so an OPML-consuming app can have instant updates with no effort.

			<description>To developers wishing to work in the &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; world, we can work together as equals, instead of platform vendor and third-party developer. There's a huge difference between the two models. In the first model we are free to compete, but never on the basis of user lock-in. In the latter, the platform vendor has all the power, you can only coexist with them on their terms, and they can change the terms at any time. This has always been true in my experience. The way we work as equals is we agree on an interchange format. I have committed to supporting &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/span&gt; in all my products. So they can all be replaced. And so can yours, if you make it easy for users to migrate, and when you do that you also open the door for people to create products that plug into yours without having to replace yours. We compete as equals. We compete to please users. We are free to build on each others' work. That's the kind of discipline I like as a developer.</description>

			<title>Journalism in the aggregate</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I judge journalism in the aggregate. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In other words, I say &quot;journalism&quot; did this or that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I do it that way for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They do act as a unit. You'll see basically the same stories on all websites and cable news stations. They often interview each other, which is pretty amazing if you think about it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To balance the way they treat online writers. They talk about us in the aggregate too. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And to balance the way they view Facebook, with 2.7 billion users, they only consider one user when they talk about Facebook, as if we all are just Zuck-clones. I made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of all the things Facebook is, and journalism rarely considers anything but the personality of one person when talking about &quot;Facebook.&quot; Not that they really have any insight into his personality, btw. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;To tell journalism, to the extent that I can, how unthinking and automaton-like they are. There will come a day when computers do what they do, because they use so little of the intellect they certainly have. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

They're filling the air, meantime I know there are things going on they should be informing me of, and add to things my mind can think about. Okay so N&amp;T had a bad episode, not the end of the world, the other most recent episodes are totally worth listening to, I highly recommend them, and I will keep listening in the hope that the NYC episode was just a bad idea they followed through on instead of canning.</description>

			<title>A thread from my tweet stream, as captured by Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If only we had journalism covering itself we'd probably learn they've been doing the exact same thing since the dawn of journalism.  This is a big defect in our system, no one is watching journalism.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/w8nGgjZTfb&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For example, what do you think the Pulitzer Prize is, other than a bunch of ads they do about journalism every year. No doubt the awards are highly politicized, and stories looking too deeply into corrupt journalism probably don't stand much chance of getting an award.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until there's some way for journalism's corruption to be exposed, why would any intelligent person think there's anything but corruption in journalism? In an Occam's Razor sort of way.  I'm watching The Wire, about to start Season 5, btw, if you know what that's about. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's this great scene at the end of Season 4, with Bodie and McNulty on a park bench. Bodie is talking about how fucked up the bosses are in the drug mob in Baltimore. It sounds just like what McNulty would say about the police department. That's the point.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's the scene with Bodie and McNulty.    (&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EtwlxhFKEz&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;i&gt;Twitter Pro&lt;/i&gt; probably seems like a weird idea. Could there be &lt;i&gt;professional&lt;/i&gt; Twitter users? There are. It's a writer's platform. The name they chose makes such an idea uncomfortable, perhaps. But it's a for real idea.</description>

			<description>The next round of changes in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; will be about organizing tweets, using Twitter as a source for your writing work. Here's the use-case. You're out and about, and get an idea that belongs on the to-do list for your latest project. Open up Twitter, and post a note about it. When you get back to your desktop the note will already be in a Drummer outline, ready for you to act on it. It doesn't matter what kind of writer you are, whether you write for yourself, as a note-taker, if you write docs, research, news reporting, a blog, or a great novel. If you're a writer and and a steady user of Twitter, and interested in &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tools for thought&lt;/span&gt; and outliners, I'd like to add you to the Drummer test group in a few days because I want to groom the product to your use of it. Send me an email, let me know if this interests you and we'll get you on board soon.</description>

			<description>All kinds of &quot;twitterpro&quot; names are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hover.com/domains/results?q=twitterpro&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;, somewhat amazingly. I've learned to control my domain name buying fetish, somewhat. I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.land/&quot;&gt;drummer.land&lt;/a&gt; recently. I found myself using that term when writing docs. I had to have it. Anyway. My name is Dave and I'm a domain name buying addict.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Little&quot;&gt;Omar Little&lt;/a&gt; is the most likeable character on &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlo_Stanfield&quot;&gt;Marlo Stanfield&lt;/a&gt; is the coldest. For some reason I think of Marlo as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;. I know that's weird. Matt is a very nice fellow. But I guess the parallel is that I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_Barksdale&quot;&gt;Avon Barksdale&lt;/a&gt; to his Marlo Stanfield? The Wire is good, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(season_1)&quot;&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt; that's great. The remaining four seasons kind of coast a little after the spectacular creative success of the first.</description>

			<description>One thing that makes The Wire so watchable is the huge number of fully developed characters interacting with each other.</description>

			<description>As summer winds down (tomorrow is the last day), I chose to listen to music instead of a podcasts on today's bike ride. I am loaded up with new ways of thinking from having gone through the archive of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then&quot;&gt;Now &amp; Then podcast&lt;/a&gt;. If you find your podcast fare is repetitive or shallow, dive into that podcast. It's a great college course in the history behind current affairs. Anyway, I've loaded up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)&quot;&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;, a very middle-class iPhone thank you, with lots of music history, and set it to shuffle the songs. The songs of my childhood. As this summer winds down, it feels like a metaphor for the summer of my own life winding down. The feelings from childhood that I re-experience with the music were the &quot;other side&quot; of the experiences  of adulthood which is now passing just like summer. The dreams of a child were of the future, full of possibilities, are now balanced by the regrets of an old man. I'm doing my best to stay fit, but it gets harder every year. This fall, esp because the pandemic is now going into its &lt;i&gt;third&lt;/i&gt; winter, has a grim feel to it. I know winter can be beautiful in the Hudson Valley. But this winter, unlike recent past winters, there's a sense of dread that hasn't been there before.</description>

			<description>Another programming lesson I haven't forgotten. It's amazing how many bugs that you spend hours not finding at the end of the day are found first thing the next day.</description>

			<description>I love house-shopping on Zillow, like a lot of people do. It's fun to dream about living in one place or another.
