			<description>I found the archive of all the DaveNet stories going back from 1994 to 2004 in OPML, the format that the Daytona database uses, including the titles and publication dates. I'm going to spend a little time gettomg it in shape, and then upload the database and all the OPML text to the GitHub repo. A bit of restoration work. I love this, there's a lot of good stuff here. I started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/davenetInOpml/&quot;&gt;this.how page&lt;/a&gt; for this project.</description>

			<description>I had a small package delivered today via Fedex containing a SIM that I was going to use in my phone. But the package was opened, and there was nothing inside. This seems to be happening a lot these days. Hackers get jobs at Fedex or UPS and grab stuff as it's in transit. PS: Fedex &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/09/fedexApologizesForAnyInconvenience.png&quot;&gt;apologizes&lt;/a&gt; for any inconvenience when they should be apologizing for completely failing at the job they were hired to do.</description>

			<description>I've been working my way through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;, in Season 3 now. It's funny the first season was given so-so reviews, but the critics were agog with Season 3. I think it's the other way around. The last season is a real drag. Repetitive, silly, not sexy at all. Where the first season had me laughing out loud with my chin permanently dropped at all the innovation that worked.</description>

It's a blogging system I wrote in 2015 and 2016, after learning Facebook, and liking a lot of the features in it, and thought they should make their way back into the blogging world. That was the idea. It's a full-featured blogging system, written in JavaScript with a Node.js backend, intending to be a revisit to the ideas in Manila, which came out in 1999, hence the name of 1999.io. But -- I decided to stop building on it in 2017, because I wanted to use something else. The thing about 1999.io, is it made a compromise with Google Reader and the RSS readers that followed it. All posts had titles. And they were meant to be multi-paragraph things, and it had no provision for short titleless posts. I was trying to surrender to the mass decision that blogs had a certain form, but it wasn't my form. That led me to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, which was a return to the blogging system I used before Manila, based on the editor being an outliner. That meant leaving 1999.io behind. But it's still there. And someone out there is using it for something. I don't have any plans to work on it or use it, but does still appear to work. Here's a Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for 1999.io on this site, in case you're interested in exploring.</description>

			<title>Dreamweaver is on an evolutionary path we left behind</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; and lead developer of WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1511382286641508352&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; something interesting on Twitter on April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's amazing how much development, how many startups, and how much funding is going into rebuilding Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver as a web app. (Gutenberg included.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; about evolution and how we never go back, only forward. The great example is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Mentallicaa/videos/191445391404751/&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the evolution of the human eye. The eye originated when our ancestors lived underwater. They don't work well in the air, but it's done. We can't get a better eye. Evolution has finished the eye. Look at all our eyes, every animal on earth has watery eyes. You don't notice it until you look for it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this same idea applies to the evolution of software. The theory says FrontPage and Dreamweaver will never fit well into the writing and publishing environment of 2022 and beyond. The evolutionary fork that took us off that course was when Apple made the decision in the late 80s to make networking virtually impossible to write software for. It was such a tease, because Macs all had builtin networking hardware, and the wires were easy to set up and inexpensive. They wanted all Macs to be connected. But for some reason the APIs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inscrutable&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I banged my head against those APIs for years. I gave up when I saw how easy HTTP was to develop for. If Apple had the same insight for software that they had for hardware, if they factored their APIs so that networking could easily be added to any application, as it is on the web, we'd be evolving off a base with a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/ImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf&quot;&gt;well-documented GDI&lt;/a&gt; and a well-defined graphic user interface, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that made sure all software worked the same, as opposed to the user interface chaos of the web. The two worlds are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antithetical&quot;&gt;antithetical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, simple networking was more important than a simple and consistent graphic interface. It's why &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; took off, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; did not (in the UserLand universe). And why Dreamweaver and Frontpage have faded out, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;plain text&lt;/a&gt; rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the challenge imho is to swing back to writers, not people who need a lot of stylistic control of text. The people who valued WYSIWYG were the first owners of laser printers. In a world where most people are using smart phones, there isn't that much you can do with wizzy tools that shows up for the reader. Today's writers need the UI to get out of their way, and make it easy to create more complex and useful structures for notes. I think this is the way forward. And we should of course keep improving and simplifying the underlying network protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

But for some reason the APIs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inscrutable&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I banged my head against those APIs for years. I gave up when I saw how easy HTTP was to develop for. If Apple had the same insight for software that they had for hardware, if they factored their APIs so that networking could easily be added to any application, as it is on the web, we'd be evolving off a base with a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/ImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf&quot;&gt;well-documented GDI&lt;/a&gt; and a well-defined graphic user interface, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that made sure all software worked the same, as opposed to the user interface chaos of the web. The two worlds are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antithetical&quot;&gt;antithetical&lt;/a&gt;." created="Fri, 08 Apr 2022 15:14:59 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/04/08/151035.html?title=dreamweaverIsOnAnEvolutionaryPathWeLeftBehind#a151459"/>
				<source:outline text="In hindsight, simple networking was more important than a simple and consistent graphic interface. It's why &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; took off, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;Clay Basket&lt;/a&gt; did not (in the UserLand universe).

				<source:outline text="Now the challenge imho is to swing back to writers, not people who need a lot of stylistic control of text. The people who valued WYSIWYG were the first owners of laser printers. In a world where most people are using smart phones, there isn't that much you can do with wizzy tools that shows up for the reader. Today's writers need the UI to get out of their way, and make it easy to create more complex and useful structures for notes. I think this is the way forward. And we should of course keep improving and simplifying the underlying network protocols." created="Fri, 08 Apr 2022 15:19:35 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/04/08/151035.html?title=dreamweaverIsOnAnEvolutionaryPathWeLeftBehind#a151935"/>

			<title>Boca or Bucha</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's so funny -- not really -- that Scott Love is gone, and one of our many slogans was this: Boca or Bucha, which meant that we'd either succeed in overthrowing IBM in the personal computer industry, headquartered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Raton,_Florida&quot;&gt;Boca Raton&lt;/a&gt;, or we'd be on the red-eye to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest&quot;&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; to begin our exile. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest&quot;&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;? It was where my &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=leon%20winer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; was born, and at the time, in the mid-80s, was known to be a hellish place, run by a totalitarian dictator, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu&quot;&gt;Nicolae Ceaușescu&lt;/a&gt;, a monster.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And why would we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kayak.com/flights/SJC-BUH/2022-05-07/2022-05-14?sort=bestflight_a&quot;&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eye_flight&quot;&gt;red-eye&lt;/a&gt;? We were taking a lot of them to go to pointless meetings with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#1975%E2%80%931992:_Information_revolution,_rise_of_software_and_PC_industries&quot;&gt;IBMers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/IBM+Boca+Raton/@26.4024866,-80.1167947,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7cb5808417a4b1a8?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2m9ekkoL3AhWDjIkEHTbDDD8Q_BJ6BAhPEAU&quot;&gt;Boca Raton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=scott%20love&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; died in an accident late &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/08.html#a205642&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Ceaușescu was overthrown and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_execution_of_Nicolae_and_Elena_Ceau%C8%99escu&quot;&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, a couple of years after Scott and I parted ways. IBM sold their PC business a few years later, they didn't need our help to be driven out. And now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/61025328&quot;&gt;Bucha&lt;/a&gt; has become famous as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bucha,+Kyiv+Oblast,+Ukraine,+08292/@50.54608,30.1845498,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x472b31bdf94125bb:0x51c08a27332520fa!8m2!3d50.553333!4d30.213517&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; of a great atrocity in the Russian-Ukrainian war. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now we can write the epitaph of something that started as a joke between two young friends fighting for the cause of software that helps you think and now has become anything but funny. I have no idea what this means, or if it means anything at all. But I wish Scott were here to share this story with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, you know how it is when you start to come to terms with the death of a friend, and you think, right now Scott is going to send me an email saying it was all a big joke. He architected quite a few of those at Living Videotext back in the day. But it's not going to happen, is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>People get really pissy about Elon Musk. Why do they care so much? Such angst. His rockets work. I love the cars they make. Just ordered Skylink. There hasn't been a person since Steve Jobs who could get me to buy all their ideas. I respect that, even if you don't like him. ;-)</description>

He isn't very clear on what he's talking about when he says they're working on something related to the open web. If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueskyweb.org/&quot;&gt;BlueSky website&lt;/a&gt;, it's also pretty vague except that it'll be using XMPP and ActiveSomethingOrOther which is yet another (sigh) &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; not-invented-here project inspired by Google as far as I can tell. I was not invited to their meetings. People have to stop doing that btw, defining projects about who and what they will not work with. I don't care if you're Jesus Christ, you still have to deal with the momentum of the installed base. People who thought they could make a feed reader and ignore RSS soon found out that people basically ignored &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; until they got on board. You don't get to fight over petty bullshit like the wire format. If you do, that says you're doing something other than building products for the open web. I think Jack is creative, and has courage, but that's a mistake he shouldn't be making at this stage of his career. I honestly and humbly think Jack could benefit from reading my &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/standards/&quot;&gt;rules for standards-makers&lt;/a&gt;.

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-discloses-92-stake-twitter-2022-04-04/&quot;&gt;Elon Musk bought 9.2% of Twitter's stock&lt;/a&gt;. Very interesting move. It appears he's now the largest shareholder. I like the idea of Twitter being managed like SpaceX or Tesla, speaking as a user of their products. I bought some Twitter stock a few years ago, and have held it. I think the smart move for Twitter is to remove limits, allow editing of tweets, support basic HTML features link linking, titles, style and some features from &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; such as enclosures (ie podcasting). And then federate, so they can peer with other instances, much as WordPress offers their product as open source. I already have built a lot of functionality for peering with Twitter in &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;. It could be moved into any product. Then we could have a twitterverse with lots of experimentation. Hopefully a Musk-led Twitter wouldn't be closed off to competition.</description>

			<description>If Twitter and Facebook had been federated from the start, like the web or email, or the internet itself, the companies wouldn't be in any way responsible for what's posted on the network. They would just be one node and would be unable to cut anyone off.</description>

			<title>WordPress is huge</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if another blogging system could develop in competition with WordPress, using the same model they use. An open source base, with a commercial service.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or will &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/03/04/134033.html?title=evolutionInSoftware&quot;&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; allow only one huge open source blogging system.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another related thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Did you know Twitter is a feed reader?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It is except it's private, doesn't use RSS.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You could build a feed reader, based on RSS that had Twitter's user experience. It can be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But why haven't RSS-based feed readers evolved to work like Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm working on a piece of software built around a single closure. The data type that's at the center of the user experience. When you create it as a closure, it is very easy to tweak it up. Every instance of a closure is a little world unto itself. You have to set up protocols for the outside world to speak to the object. That's good because there can't be any other interactions. When debugging you just have to look there. And when there are no deeply hidden bugs, its deliciously easy to work on. But when you type &lt;code&gt;[feedItem, theFeed]&lt;/code&gt; when you really meant &lt;code&gt;{feedItem, theFeed}&lt;/code&gt;, and your eyes are imperfect as mine are, and you tend to see what you expect to see in debugging, and miss the little subtle mistakes. Whether you use square or curly brackets makes all the difference in the world. It can turn rich structures into &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. And all the debugging code in the world doesn't help until you see the square brackets are where there should be curly ones. I think this is a lot like Wordle. The pattern has to be seen by the subconscious. You don't move on until you've solved the problem. But unlike Wordle you get as many tries as it takes.</description>

			<description>BTW, written explanations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;closures&lt;/a&gt; always read like gobbledygook. Here's what I would say. A closure is an &lt;i&gt;instance&lt;/i&gt; of a function, as opposed to a &lt;i&gt;call&lt;/i&gt; to a function, but they start life as a call. If when you call the function, it still has work to do, in the form of local functions that run every second or minute, for example, or to respond to messages from the outside, such as a click on an object it created (and is linked into the DOM), or an HTTP request, then all its data sticks around. And it's private to the function, no one else can get at it. That helps you keep the overall program simpler, there are fewer things that can go wrong.  Now as I read this I'm not sure I got it, but it's close. I guess the thing is I've never written an interpreter for a language that has closures. In my experience that's when you really understand a piece of machinery, when it stops being magic -- when you've implemented it.</description>

			<title>The problem with Worldle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Wordle-clone for geography is &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;. At first it looked promising, but in the end, it's usually either impossible, there are huge numbers of tiny island nations in every ocean and sea on the planet, or totally obvious like today's &quot;puzzle,&quot; an instantly-recognizable landmass for probably everyone with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today's &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/&quot;&gt;Worldle&lt;/a&gt;, no spoilers so I didn't solve it for you. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>A user said he’d be more inclined to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; if i planned for it to continue to work after I stop working. First, yes I did plan the best I could. All your files are in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;open format&lt;/a&gt; which can be read by most outliners. You can easily and quickly download all your files with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/general.opml#1634478289000&quot;&gt;single command&lt;/a&gt;. You should do it frequently. If you want Drummer to keep going, help out next time there are new features, get involved in testing. Anyone can do it. It should be possible for me to introduce a new fix or feature and find out if there are any problems within a few hours. That's what the process needs from users, at least to be somewhat viable going forward.</description>

			<title>Today's Wordle</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I sat down at the breakfast table to solve the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=wordle&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; puzzle for the day. I was sad to solve it in less than a minute. Now what to do? Guess I have to get to work! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW -- I find that only my subconscious mind can solve the puzzle, to actually see the solution. I can analytically arrange for the clues to be available to my subconsciousl but the word pops into my conscious mind in an instant. I have no awareness of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Usually I'm sure when I have the answer. Today I wasn't even sure the correct word was actually a word! What a nice surprise when all five letters came up green and then did their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdSa5kJb-yw&quot;&gt;little dance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/02/wordle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I tend to take things literally as I read them, and puzzle my way through strange news, until it hits that I've been burned. I waste a fair amount of time on April 1 wading through this nonsense. The only thing you can do is let people know in advance that if they troll you with one of these things, if it's on a system where I can block you, that's what I do. If it's a news org, I try to remember never to trust anything they write, because they clearly have no respect for their own mission. So I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1729710617236336?comment_id=1729845797222818&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/fbwarningaboutapril1garbage.png&quot;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1509848417098518534&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; establishing this rule, and wouldn't you know it, some people actually post &quot;jokes&quot; there. Mostly it's harrassment. Bitterness I guess. They don't like life, so they drop little turds on message threads to get attention. Yes I block them. Yes, it's tiresome. There is a certain amount of overhead to maintaining one's integrity. If you say you're going to block someone, you have to actually do it. Kind of like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGfvV3Syud8&quot;&gt;second to last scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men_(film)&quot;&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/a&gt;, if you remember it.  I got here the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/gotHereTheSameWayTheCoinDid.png&quot;&gt;same way&lt;/a&gt; the coin did. Gotta do what I gotta do.</description>

Niches are defended by lack of interop. You can see categories being born with limited interop, features vendors can say deliver interop, it would be hard to argue, but they don't deliver much practical interop for users. That's why the tech industry was so ho-hum about RSS. Where's the fun for them if they can't lock users into a niche product and then another and another? As a technologist, what gets me excited about computer networks are all the combinations users can make, but that works only if there's &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of interop.</description>
