The author says it's about Russia and the US and that the US doesn't want the new pipeline to be used to pump natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. The one weird thing about this is why would Putin pick this time to invade Ukraine when it gives the US pretext to shut down the new pipeline before it could get started? Seems like he has a lot to lose right now. Why not cement the bond with Germany before having an adventure in Ukraine. In any case, he says the US public is being conned, much as our journalism says the Russian people are being conned by their media. I don't doubt for a moment that the news we're getting is at least misleading if not total fiction.</description>

			<description>Larry Lessig was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application)&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; user in the 80s, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues/5#issuecomment-1046791864&quot;&gt;trying to rescue&lt;/a&gt; the data from his files. Luckily there was a successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues/5&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to get access to MORE files earlier this month, so he's getting help there.</description>

			<title>Twitter Articles?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There have been rumors for a while about Twitter Articles, not sure exactly what they are, but they have titles, styling and links. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/21/articlesScreenShot.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1494989510744199169&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Big questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Available through the API for reading, publishing?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Character limit on articles?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;RSS feed for articles?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you have more info, please let me know.

			<description>I've started bingeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/raised-by-wolves/season-1&quot;&gt;Raised By Wolves&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I like it so far into 3 episodes, and I hear it gets better. I have no idea why it's called Raised By Wolves, there are no wolves in the show (so far). The human kids are raised by androids. Here's something good/.interesting. It was liked by one person on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fraised-by-wolves&quot;&gt;Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;, Jake Savin, who is also considered the best match with me on BW. Jake said it was the Best. Aha I know I'm in the right place. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It could be that Putin gets to pick the day WW III starts. If so why wouldn't he wait till Tuesday so it can be a famous day -- 2/22/22. Just wondering about that while working on some tricky code. Yes, this is the kind of thing programmers think about.</description>

			<title>The Twitter-to-RSS project</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The project is coming along. Implemented so far... &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Tweets can have titles. Make the first character in a tweet a #. The rest of the first line is the title. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Full Markdown support. Anything you can type in a tweet can be Markdown and will be rendered as it's converted to an RSS item. Markdown is ideal for where Twitter is at now. It a plain text environment, and that's what MD is designed for. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Threads are rolled up into the first message, forming one RSS item. In RSS there is no character limit. And Twitter has a good thread composition tool built in. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160316075154/http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/&quot;&gt;Emoji short codes&lt;/a&gt;. This was an easy one so I thought why not. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Not sure how I'll package it for release. I want to wait until the major coding is done before deciding that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still diggin! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: This post as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1495442593630638086&quot;&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, and then as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/20/thePostInMyReader.png&quot;&gt;RSS feed item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't watch All-Star games ever since I realized that players never play defense, esp in the NBA. I also understand that sports are pretty meaningless even for &quot;real&quot; games. All-Star games are two levels of meaningless. That's as they say a bridge too far for me.</description>

			<title>Why didn't Zuck fight back?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a comment that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/19/facebookstockoversixmonths.png&quot;&gt;Facebook lost&lt;/a&gt; half its market cap because they changed the company's name to Meta. It rings true. It was a really stupid move. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They changed their name because journalism has the power to shape public opinion and markets and they've been trashing the company name, confusing the company with the platform and the user community. It's amazing to me how much power they still have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago they decided as if by osmosis to conflate the company with the things users do with their service. When the users do something evil, they say Facebook did it. It's beyone inaccurate. Underneath the error it seems to me there must be malice. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say it often enough and it sticks in the mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook == evil. Over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So rather than try to clean up Facebook as a brand name, they just changed the name of the company and tried to disown the biggest cash cow ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is that Facebook the company has the best propaganda machine ever invented, but they don't use it for that purpose. If Zuck et al had chosen to usurp journalism's name shaping ability he could probably have destroyed them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't have made a difference to me or other people who don't have the power, but you wonder why they didn't use it? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Sure journalism would have screamed bloody murder. So what. Let them scream. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: Recall that the word &quot;Facebook&quot; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;at least 8 meanings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Everett Dirksen could tell a story</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I thought of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen&quot;&gt;Everett Dirksen&lt;/a&gt;, former Republican senator from Illinois. Probably hadn't thought of him in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I found him endlessly entertaining. He was a funny looking guy and had a froggy kind of voice, but he told great stories, the kind of stories a pre-teen kid could get into.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Au2-J-3on0&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Dirksen telling a story about lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I wondered what happened to the American politicians who could tell a story? There aren't many. Certainly not in Congress or the executive branch, or even the court. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a bigger problem than it first appears. Because to be good at telling a story is being good at relating to other humans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Trump is a good storyteller. People think that Trump resonated with his supporters because they're racists and narcissists, like Trump, but it could just be that he can tell a story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His stories always have him as the hero, and tend to blame immigrants, people of color for all the problems, but a Woodie Guthrie or Will Rogers for example might get the same people to vote Democratic. That is if you still believe in the basic goodness of most people, which I desperately try to cling to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>First major difference between the new iPhone and the old one -- the new one has 512GB of memory, the previous one had 64GB. That means that I can have all my apps loaded at the same time, where the system would always be swapping them out. That makes a big difference around where I live where cell coverage is very spotty.</description>

			<description>I was having breakfast with a local friend the other day and we were talking about the Beatles. He is not a fan. He cited as an example that Hey Jude is too long, at over 7 minutes. I had never thought about that. I expected that it was meant to crowd out other music on FM radio, where the standard song length was more like 3 minutes. He said he didn't know about that. I said if it were tech instead of music that would definitely have been the motivation. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+hey+jude+so+long&quot;&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; it up.</description>

			<title>The iPhone 13 epilog</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;anchorRightMargin&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/gaslight.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As I reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/15.html#a193031&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; Pro arrived yesterday. So the embarrassing saga is over. Now I want to clean up, by finishing the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Apple sent a total of three iPhones to me. After the first one was lost, the second one got jammed up in the system too, when Apple charged the wrong credit card $1 for an unspecified reason and they had changed my credit card number, so the charge was rejected. The email I got saying this happened had none of this information so I waited, hoping the problem would clear without me having to call them, but no such luck. Turns out that delay doomed the second iPhone because while it was in transit we had a huge ice storm that knocked out power in Ulster County for two days. The iPhone was left in the UPS warehouse, probably in Kingston, and probably was stolen while it was waiting for everything to come back online.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;After trying to get help from Apple Support on Twitter, I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/142419.html?title=myEmailToTimCook&quot;&gt;email to Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of Apple. Within an hour of sending the email, I got a phone call from someone in &quot;Apple Retail Executive Relations&quot; who was empowered to blow through the problem. A third iPhone was sent, this time via Fedex, which is, in my experience, much more reliable in this area than UPS. But something funny happened before the third phone was delivered at 2PM Eastern yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At 12:45PM or so, I heard a UPS truck park outside my house. It stayed there for about ten minutes. I went out to see what was going on, and could hear the driver in the back sorting through packages. It usually doesn't take that long. I shouted out to him through the open door, but he didn't answer. So I went back in the house to take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; with my Pixel 4a, in time to see him drive off without making a delivery. My guess is that the UPS computer had told him to come here to make a delivery, and when he got here, the package wasn't on the truck? I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; to prove this actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;UPS truck before it left without making a delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There's not much more to say that isn't spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/142419.html?title=myEmailToTimCook&quot;&gt;email to Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, so I'll just leave it there, except to say at all levels Apple people knew what the right thing to do was, but their system wouldn't let them do it. That is, until we got to someone who was at most a couple of hops from the CEO, who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; empowered to solve the problem. As a long time Apple user, I got my first Apple II in 1979, I'd hate to see Apple be in the toilet bowl of uncaring bigco American rust belt e-commerce, where people are peripheral devices to poorly designed computer systems created by lawyers and accountants and in some cases psychopaths. For evidence of that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/dmExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;see the DMs&lt;/a&gt; that the Apple Support people sent. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor&quot;&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock&quot;&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt; were still alive and making movies, they could be characters in one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)&quot;&gt;psycho dramas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

The email I got saying this happened had none of this information so I waited, hoping the problem would clear without me having to call them, but no such luck. Turns out that delay doomed the second iPhone because while it was in transit we had a huge ice storm that knocked out power in Ulster County for two days. The iPhone was left in the UPS warehouse, probably in Kingston, and probably was stolen while it was waiting for everything to come back online." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:53:03 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog#a135303"/>

Within an hour of sending the email, I got a phone call from someone in &quot;Apple Retail Executive Relations&quot; who was empowered to blow through the problem. A third iPhone was sent, this time via Fedex, which is, in my experience, much more reliable in this area than UPS. But something funny happened before the third phone was delivered at 2PM Eastern yesterday." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:55:15 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog#a135515"/>
				<source:outline text="At 12:45PM or so, I heard a UPS truck park outside my house. It stayed there for about ten minutes. I went out to see what was going on, and could hear the driver in the back sorting through packages. It usually doesn't take that long. I shouted out to him through the open door, but he didn't answer. So I went back in the house to take a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; with my Pixel 4a, in time to see him drive off without making a delivery. My guess is that the UPS computer had told him to come here to make a delivery, and when he got here, the package wasn't on the truck? I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/upstruck.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; to prove this actually happened." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2022 13:57:07 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog#a135707"/>

That is, until we got to someone who was at most a couple of hops from the CEO, who &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; empowered to solve the problem. As a long time Apple user, I got my first Apple II in 1979, I'd hate to see Apple be in the toilet bowl of uncaring bigco American rust belt e-commerce, where people are peripheral devices to poorly designed computer systems created by lawyers and accountants and in some cases psychopaths.

			<title>My email to Tim Cook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Monday February 14, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt; 18 days for a new iPhone to be delivered, I sent an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifewire.com/how-can-i-email-apple-ceo-tim-cook-1171298&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook and as a result &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/16/135206.html?title=theIphone13Epilog&quot;&gt;two days later&lt;/a&gt; I had the phone. Here's a copy of the email. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Cook: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I ordered an &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; Pro from the Apple online store on January 27. I paid $1300 plus tax. I also bought a leather case, which was delivered. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've spent hours on the phone with Apple people, tried using the support address on Twitter, and have gotten conflicting advice from Apple people, and they've lost the case a couple of times. Also at one point I got an email from Apple saying I had to change something about my account, without saying what it was. It turned out Apple wanted to charge my account $1, and my credit card number had been changed on your system to something other than my credit card number. This may be the most alarming thing about this experience. How could that have happened?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I bought my first Apple product, an Apple II, in 1979. I was an early Apple II developer, was one of the first Mac developers. I've created a lot of software for your platform and done a lot of business with Apple, and I'm also a longtime shareholder. I have never seen this company so incompetent, uncaring and unprofessional, apparently as a matter of corporate policy. The employees I've had to deal with are not proud of your company. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paid Apple $1300, not UPS. If they screwed up, and it's likely they did, telling me to go to UPS is no answer. I didn't choose to use UPS, you did. And if they screwed up, fine, either give me my money back or get me the phone, now. I really want the product, but more than that I want to be treated as a customer, with the basic respect that requires.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been writing about this on my blog since I made the purchase. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iPhone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;search query&lt;/a&gt; that will get you the full account. If you study this case, you'll see you need to do a lot of work on the customer experience, and empower your employees to solve problems, instead of pointing the finger at other companies and giving assignments to customers about dealing with your vendors. I've heard the story about how Apple people can't solve an obvious repeated failure on the part of your company. That's a system that is going to lose you your reputation for being tops in customer service. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I hope you can help. I either want an immediate refund or to have the product delivered soon. And in all this mess, no one has ever apologized. I think that would be the place to start. And not an indirect apology like the one I got from the Twitter support team, which began: &quot;We’re sorry to hear your delivery is stalled...&quot; I've enclosed the full message as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/16/dmExcerpt.png&quot;&gt;attachment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Twitter and RSS in 2022</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When Twitter went from 140 to 280 chars, there was an opportunity to re-think the connection between Twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;280 chars is enough to communicate a few thoughts, with optional room for a title. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Also, the integration of a thread-writing tool in Twitter made it easier to chain tweets together, to form a full document. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is, imho, enough to make RSS a viable connector between Twitter and the rest of the world. This is significant because RSS is a simpler API than Twitter's API. It will open Twitter up to more applications&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As an experiment I wrote a Node.js service that periodically reads my tweet stream and publishes an RSS feed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Titles. I can put a title on a tweet with Markdown-ish syntax.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited length posts. RSS has no limit on document length. With threads, neither does Twitter. So I'll just roll up threads into a single RSS item. I haven't implemented this yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Links. My plan is to use Markdown syntax for &lt;a href=&quot;https://anvilproject.org/guides/content/creating-links&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. It's right there. Why not use it. Again, not implemented yet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Other RSS concepts such as pubDate and guid are all easily synthesized from the metadata Twitter provides through its API.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Styling. Why not allow *any* Markdown in tweets, properly interpreted for the RSS item representing the tweet. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create a feed viewer for RSS feeds that emanate from Twitter, so we can easily view and debug the code that does the translation, and then start adding more features. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These feeds will work with all RSS-compatible feed readers that can handle items without titles (which is redundant btw, RSS titles have always been optional).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, RSS gets a fresh start, a new way of generating feeds from an editing environment miliions of people use. Twitter wins because its API is more broadly applicable, and it can immediately start fostering a decentralized community. It should happen quickly. We've been down this road before. And we can do all this with the existing Twitter API. Important point. No waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The last time the combination of Twitter and RSS was seriously considered was when Twitter itself supplied an RSS feed. But that was in the time of 140 chars, with no thread tool, and further, Twitter duplicated the text of the tweet in the title and description elements of each RSS item. The dominant RSS reader of the day, Google Reader, made no special allowance, so it repeated the text in their user interface, and it was ugly and distracting, didn't fit in with the other feeds people were reading.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also did a tweet-to-RSS service. Instead of duplicating the tweet in the title and description elements, I omitted the title, which is optional in RSS 2.0, but Google Reader didn't handle RSS items without titles. So that was a dead-end too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google Reader is long gone and Twitter no longer has RSS feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1492891287095320578&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; with the new style of tweet developing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>iPhone 13 Pro, day 17</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=iphone%2013&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;saga&lt;/a&gt; continues...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling pretty good lately, but when I have an interaction with Apple, I think seriously I should just write off the $1300 I paid for the iPhone 13 Pro and get a high-end Android phone. I probably won't because I'm locked in to so many Apple services. Sigh. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, 17 days after buying the phone from Apple, $1300 plus tax, it is still not here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/13/upsAdvisory.png&quot;&gt;UPS says&lt;/a&gt; it will be delivered tomorrow, but they've said that every day in the last week. The weather has been great, spring-like, sunny. They say it's an emergency. I think the emergency is they don't have the phone and their system is lying when it says it's on the truck and out for delivery. It's fair to assume it will not be here tomorrow, or ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday in a call to Apple at 1-800-MYAPPLE, they said they were making an escalation request, but when I called the same number just now they said the same thing. I guess the earlier request must've gotten lost too. I tried working with Apple Support on Twitter, but they were even more obnoxious. They seriously told me it was my job to find the person to talk to at UPS who is holding up the delivery and work with them. If they had told me that when I bought the phone I would have found another way to buy it because I refuse to get involved with UPS which is an ancient rust belt company that has no ability to work with ordinary people (and they're really rude about it). Apple chose UPS, not me. I paid &lt;i&gt;Apple&lt;/i&gt; for a phone, not UPS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway the response I got from Apple Support on Twitter is utterly unbelievable. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/13/appleCustomerService.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're doing something a lot of companies do on Twitter, saying they acknowledge your feeling of frustration or whatever. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; and maybe someone in sales thinks the customer likes to be gaslighted. Maybe they weren't angry before you gaslighted them, but you can be sure they are after you do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I called Apple this morning and got a more professional response. I'm waiting another three days to find out if they're going to return the money. The person recited some boilerplate saying that Apple will issue the refund when they receive the phone. I stopped her and repeated &lt;i&gt;I don't have the phone&lt;/i&gt; so I can't return it.  If I were them, I'd have someone drive the freaking phone to me from an Apple store in the area. That is, if this is an uncommon occurrence. If they depend on their customers doing work for them to get their product, I expect for most people that will be a bridge too far. For me it is. When I buy a luxury item, and that's what this is, I want to be treated with basic respect. And I want to use the freaking product, not argue with Apple about who has to do what. They have to do it, I'm the customer. I paid for this experience. Geez Louise. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs used to lecture on this. He told a story that I can't find a reference to right now, about how he wanted the person buying the Apple product to take it home, open it up, and have everything just work. He wanted all the glitches gotten rid of. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs+on+customer+experience+taking+an+apple+product+home+from+store&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;sxsrf=APq-WBvnj_IQeqJI5c3sHrI_AhRy2eDX5g%3A1644761941984&amp;ei=VRMJYu7fO7ajptQP-M2FiAU&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu3qra7_z1AhW2kYkEHfhmAVEQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=steve+jobs+on+customer+experience+taking+an+apple+product+home+from+store&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6BAgjECc6BAghEApKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQtRBY2yZg2ydoA3ABeACAAdABiAGFDJIBBjE5LjAuMZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&quot;&gt;quick search&lt;/a&gt; and found lots of praise for Apple as a customer service company. Well these people who write so gushingly about their customer service prowess should check it out again. I don't think this is remotely the same company it was just a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I fixed a bug. There's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/issues/6&quot;&gt;encoding mismatch&lt;/a&gt; between text coming from Twitter through its API, which is encoded in UTF-8, and text in OPML files which is encoded in ISO-8859-1. In outlines that only contain tweets the fix is simple.</description>

Maybe at a conscious level we don't get that indifference to human life also applies to those of us who are still alive.</description>
