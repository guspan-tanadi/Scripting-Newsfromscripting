			<description>Having listened to and loved the most recent episode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;500 Songs&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtles&quot;&gt;the Turtles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQDsM3Wvh8&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeAtre3Bxg8&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZEURntrQOg&quot;&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt;, my friend said now you have to start with the first. I looked all over the web and I couldn't find a list. So I looked into their &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/feed/podcast/&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. It's huge but they're all there, all the episdes. How am I going to parse this? Then I remembered I have it in my database. So I wrote a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/02/query.png&quot;&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; to get me the &lt;i&gt;enclosureUrl&lt;/i&gt; of all items from that feed, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/500SongsEnclosureUrls.html&quot;&gt;it worked&lt;/a&gt;. I love it when this happens.</description>

			<title>New glue for GitHub</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2019/12/24/santa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code&quot;&gt;glue code&lt;/a&gt; for ages. Basically, someone provides an API for a service. Could be the IBM PC with calls to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/dev/rom/ibm/5150/&quot;&gt;ROM BIOS&lt;/a&gt; to read files, or the Apple II hardware screen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.applelogic.org/files/AIIETECHREF2.pdf&quot;&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; (invented by the clever genius Steve Wozniak), or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_event&quot;&gt;Apple Events&lt;/a&gt; supported by various Mac apps in the 90s, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/&quot;&gt;XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt; interfaces for web apps, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+interfaces+of+GitHub+and+Slack&quot;&gt;REST interfaces&lt;/a&gt; of GitHub and Slack or thousands of other services. They give you an API, and then after you see what it can do, and if you want to use it in your app, you write some glue, so all your calls flow through code you control, so if you learn something about their API, you only have to support it in one place. It's especially important for the few services that reserve the right to break their developers. Apple used to do this all the time, I haven't programmed to an Apple API in a very long time. Maybe they stopped? It's a way of forcing your developers to redeclare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJbsXeRc_Fw&quot;&gt;fealty&lt;/a&gt; to the Great Platform every so often. I like the web where no one has the power to break me (although &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; might argue with that). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway -- today I have a new release of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;glue code for GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, the code I use to read and write files from and to GitHub. I use this to keep archives of stuff, because I think GitHub has a good chance of sticking around for a few decades, longer than the S3 storage I use for everything. That'll disappear the day someone stops paying the bills. But the GitHub stuff should stay, no bills to pay (though I do pay for a developer account, only seems fair because I use it a lot). &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;archiving my blog&lt;/a&gt;. Starting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2017/05/16&quot;&gt;May 16, 2017&lt;/a&gt;. And since then every post, every day and every month has been stored there in JSON and OPML. I've also managed to find and store OPML files for most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources&quot;&gt;stuff on my blog&lt;/a&gt; going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/DaveNet&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's not much of a secret that I'm working on a product that reads feeds in RSS, Atom and RDF formats. It contains a feed reader, but it is more of a development tool for &lt;i&gt;news products.&lt;/i&gt; It stores info about feeds, items, subscriptions, users and likes and other stuff. I want that stuff to flow to GitHub right from the start. It'll be a slice of what we're doing online in 2022 and beyond. Maybe that'll be useful to some researcher in the future? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The new thing in my GitHub glue is that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github/blob/master/davegithub.js&quot;&gt;manages&lt;/a&gt; a queue of writes, so you can just tell it to write something and then go on to the next thing. GitHub has a rule that you can only have one call extant at a time. This is a terrible for for an environment like JavaScript that doesn't let you do that easily. I got tired of managing that stuff in my application code so I added the queue to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/github&quot;&gt;davegithub&lt;/a&gt; and that simplifies all future applications that have to write to GitHub. Absolutely nothing revolutionary in that -- it's just nice to be able to forget about that particular feature of GitHub, let the software manage it for me. And it's MIT licensed stuff so you can use it too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also released an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/uploadFolderToGitHub/blob/main/uploadfolder.js&quot;&gt;example app&lt;/a&gt; that uploads a folder full of JSON files to a location on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So If you are a programmer and want to use GitHub to archive your stuff, or to create a connection to GitHub for other apps, I've made it simple for you. Enjoy! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand&quot;&gt;Stewart Brand&lt;/a&gt; would find this interesting, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Once when I was a little kid, my mom driving, her mother, my grandmother, in the front passenger seat, my brother and I in the back seat when all of a sudden we noticed that Nana was wiggling her ears. Whoa. She's doing that for us! Incited, we carried on as kids do. Laughing and rolling around. Yes that's what to do. Nothing is all that serious, say the kiddies.</description>

This is my &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://tweetfeed.org/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt;. I've added this service to my monitor so hopefully next time it goes down I will be notified and fix it sooner. &lt;i&gt;Still diggin!&lt;/i&gt; as they say.</description>

			<title>Doc Quixote</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a longish phone talk with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls&quot;&gt;Doc Searls&lt;/a&gt; a couple of days ago. Then he &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/09/30/from-hollywood-park-racetrack-to-sofi-stadium/&quot;&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt;  about a series of photos he took over 17 years, on airplanes approaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport&quot;&gt;LAX&lt;/a&gt;, of a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Park_Racetrack&quot;&gt;horse track&lt;/a&gt; as it changed over the years, and eventually was torn down and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium&quot;&gt;football stadium&lt;/a&gt; was built in its place. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've known Doc for a long time, and I've seen at least two sides of the man. On one side is &lt;b&gt;Doc Quixote&lt;/b&gt; who is ranting about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dsearls&quot;&gt;windmills&lt;/a&gt;. He's great with words so he comes up with memorable ways of expressing the ideas. And Doc is the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affable&quot;&gt;affable&lt;/a&gt; person I've ever known, so they love him as he rants at them. And the things Doc rants about &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; what we need to do &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; to start to be free. In other words he's right. But as we've grown old as friends I'm pretty certain that Doc will not live to see his ideas become reality. And nor will I, for my dream. I spent great time, energy and money, over many years to create the writing and programming environment I wanted to use and I wanted my peers to use, so we could &lt;b&gt;work together&lt;/b&gt; to create species-saving communication tools, and just beauty -- nothing wrong with that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An aside, when I read the story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie&quot;&gt;David Bowie's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_David_Bowie&quot;&gt;last days&lt;/a&gt;, he did something amazing when he knew he had a short time to live. He stepped back and got out of the way. He understood this is no longer his world. I think we could all benefit from learning that earlier in life. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When you're young, you think expansively, and as you get old reality sinks in and your imagination contracts. The horizon gets closer and closer. We don't get to mold the world, we are not gods, no matter how good or generous, smart of ruthless you may be, we all start out young and if we're lucky we get old and then we're gone. Nothing you did in your life will exist after you're gone. I own this, as a 67-year-old man, as I decide what to do each day. I don't want to shake the world. &lt;i&gt;I want to have fun with my friends.&lt;/i&gt; That's it. And that's just right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then I think about my friend Doc, and the things he accomplished by &lt;b&gt;Just Being Doc&lt;/b&gt;, doing the things he'd do anyway no matter the dragons he's slaying. He would take pictures of construction projects from airplanes over 17 years. He would know literally everything about broadcast radio. And he'd be very affable while doing all that. Those I think are the things that matter. It makes no sense to be a billionaire or an autocrat. Ideas will happen when it's their time, totally independent of what you do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of ideas along this line in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1576118495380529152&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I wrote this morning all around DQ and JBD, and how the pattern is in my life-work too. I'll probably write more about that later.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you want, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtdhWltSIg&quot;&gt;play this song&lt;/a&gt;, and go back to the top and read the story again. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
