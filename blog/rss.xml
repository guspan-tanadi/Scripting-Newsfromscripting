			<description>When you write an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline&quot;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt; on paper, if you feel the need to reorganize, you have to write the whole thing over. This makes the initial structure something you resist deciding on, so you never get started. Doing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/&quot;&gt;outline on a computer&lt;/a&gt; is different. Since you have commands to reorganize the outline, you can use any structure that supports your list-making. Because you can always regroup things, or ungroup them., Whatever works for you, over time.</description>

			<description>I saw Soul. I say meh. What a mess. I paid close attention because Pixar produces good movies. But this one was not good. I know lots of other people say they love it, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/movies/soul-review-pixar.html&quot;&gt;AO Scott&lt;/a&gt; at the NYT. It got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/soul&quot;&gt;85 on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, very high must-see.  One thing I did like is how they portrayed NYC. That was a technical achievement. Maybe they should do movies like that. Star a real-life place. Have normal people just doing stuff there. More mundane. Boy meets girl, perhaps. Pixar movies these days seem to have to bite off so much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story&quot;&gt;Toy Story&lt;/a&gt; was nice. I liked the story of the old man, a kid, a dog and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)&quot;&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;, and the one about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E&quot;&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; who has to deal with post-apocalyptic Earth. Those are simpler themes. Trying to make a story about the before-life and after-life? Hmm. That requires a bit less Hallmark and more math, imho.</description>

			<description>One thing worth mentioning is we may have entered a new era of movie-watching. A major Pixar movie, a Christmas movie, opened without theaters being an important consideration. If you had predicted that just a year ago, people would have thought you're crazy. Things are changing quickly now.</description>

			<description>I turned on &lt;a href=&quot;https://watch.nba.com/streaming-subscriptions?cid=nba:leaguepass:institutional:nbacom:domsites:nbatv:rd&quot;&gt;NBA TV&lt;/a&gt; last night and watched a bit of the Knicks v 76ers. A message appeared after a while saying that the game was blacked out where I live. Presumably because they want me to pay for something that provides a way to watch the game on local TV. Except since i cut the cord with Spectrum earlier this year, and went with YouTube TV for local stations, I can't get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msg.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt; which broadcasts the Knicks locally. I can swith to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fubo.tv/lp/preview/?page_slug=msg&amp;title=Is%20this%20service%20worth%20$65%20a%20month%20just%20to%20watch%20the%20Knicks%20lose?&quot;&gt;Fubo&lt;/a&gt;, which has MSG, but it's the same price as YouTube TV, and I have no idea what it is. So where I'm at now is paying $65 a month for YTTV and only watching MSNBC and CNN there. Seems pretty steep. Also if I get NBA League Pass, which I'm considering, I'm pretty sure they'd black out access for me for Knicks games too, even though I'd be paying $200 for the season. I remember when watching local sports was free, Not that long ago. What might be the smartest move, pay Spectrum, become a wire-splicer. What a mess.</description>

			<description>Two online acquaintances who share many of my values who I consider friends say something horribly negative about the US, a feature of Republican depravity, which I vote against every chance I get. I feel we’re on the same side, but I don’t like them making such sweeping statements about my country, which due to poor Constitutional design, has these awful features such as inadequate health care, or unregulated gun violence. One of these fellows is British and the other is an American expat living in Germany. I could respond by blaming the British fellow for Rupert Murdoch, who is enforcing Republican lunacy in the US and elsewhere. I suppose technically he’s Australian, but who cares. Or remind my German friend that Germany is where the Nazis came from, the same ones who menace my country now. He might say he’s really American so it’s not his fault. i won’t do it. But i liked saying it out loud just for a moment. 🤪🇺🇸❤️</description>

			<description>I got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/sports/basketball/amare-stoudemire-brooklyn-nets.html&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; from Lew Perin to a NYT article about how the Nets have Mike D'Antoni and Amar'e Stoudemeyer on their coaching staff this year, supporting Steve Nash. I do have respect for Mike D, and of course Amar'e. But I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a175501&quot;&gt;feeling&lt;/a&gt; about the NBA this year that isn't too good. It isn't just the Nets, it's also the Lakers, who went from nowhere to champions. The Clippers. Harden. Etc. And Kyrie Irving who was too good to play for the Celtics, I guess. Basketball is a team sport, that's what's beautiful about it to me, but we aren't rooting for teams anymore, the franchises are the players. That's fine, I guess -- good for them, but the only player I've felt loyalty to in the NBA recently is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/jeremy-lin-signing-with-warriors-g-league-team/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt;, and he's playing in the G league for Golden State this year. And at this point there isn't much left there, anyway -- other than the bitterness at how the Knicks screwed it up. Maybe something will happen, no one saw Linsanity coming, so there's always hope. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Also I feel loyalty to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt;. I thought he was a bad choice for the Knicks, all through his career in NY, but how can you not feel affection for a man who keeps coming back, presumably because he loves playing. I hope that's it. I wish he had the humility back then that he has now. He might not have objected to Lin, who anyone would have to admit was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/11/13/jeremyLinWasACoralReef.html&quot;&gt;good for a team&lt;/a&gt; that was going nowhere, both before and after.</description>

			<description>We're having a huge rainstorm in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains&quot;&gt;Catskills&lt;/a&gt;. Over five inches of rain so far. All the snow from last week's storm has melted and all that water is flowing downhill. And then it's going to get cold and snow tonight. Trees are down. Power and internet went out overnight. It's a wet, soggy, grey Christmas. Of course it is. This is 2020.</description>

			<description>I've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1342115217694728192&quot;&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; of how we could reconstitute tech so it's not all driven by bankers and techies with the principles and motivations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller&quot;&gt;oil barons&lt;/a&gt;. I remember during the 90s, being at odds, publicly, with Microsoft. Bill Gates was still CEO. The company had risen to dominance in tech with Windows. Apple was on the edge of going under, or getting acquired and devoured for parts. The web was a source of great potential and optimism, but Microsoft was acting as predator. The web had no defenses. He had billions, and his software was the OS on all the world's computers, except for a few on the web (Mac and Unix machines were more common there early-on). He was going to encircle the web and cut off its air supply. You can read all about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/index.html#y1996&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. All the while Gates says he's going to retire soon and spend the rest of his life giving away his money. Something seemed terribly out of balance. Why not start caring for the world now, why wait until the damage is done? So much more leverage now. Why not think bigger than creating a company, how about building a technical foundation that encapsulates all the good stuff we've figured out in the 80s (there was a lot of that) and not charge rent for it. Or at least don't interfere with the rest of us trying to do that. Nope, he persisted, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.&quot;&gt;case and a consent decree&lt;/a&gt;, and a new generation of tech monsters grew up in Microsoft's aftermath, and we're still living in a poisoned ghetto, only it's a lot bigger now. My plea is that once you're worth a billion, there's no value to making more money. Think bigger. There's so much potential, because so many of these avenues haven't been explored, yet.</description>

He wonders why the US government is doing nothing to restrict air traffic from the UK. Made me think what Cuomo will do, as a Democrat, when the president is a Democrat on the 20th of next month. Also, I wonder if Biden offered him a position in the government. He's been an incredible crisis leader for New York State.</description>

			<description>If we’re disbanding Silicon Valley that’s a good thing imho. Where ever it reassembles, if it does, hopefully tech will be motivated by more than money. In California, money has dominated everything. I found that intolerable.</description>

			<description>My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a012405&quot;&gt;gamifying post&lt;/a&gt; is getting a bunch of comment. I was thinking of an app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity&quot;&gt;SimCity&lt;/a&gt;. I was already a programmer when it came out, but it taught me so much about the interconnection of systems. Something like that with the virus and people interacting, and people dying or the virus dying (better outcome of course) would probably save lives. And even more important it would teach us the value of working together. Since gaming is something people do in all states, red and blue, it might also help us find common ground.</description>

			<description>I wish someone would gamify the virus so people understand how it works, and how it's actually something like a game, and how we're completely blowing it. One of the skills the virus has is it can mutate. So it's in our collective interest to reduce the virus to almost nothing before it can mutate to something our vaccines can't deal with. The more virus is out there btw, the more mutations there will be. The way we're doing it now, it's like we have all the time in the world. So a million people travel by air to go to family gatherings and then a month later do it again, and fly home, spreading all mutations of the virus everywhere. We don't have a lot of time. We don't have time to worry about who Trump pardons. We need to worry about what the virus mutates to and how it might not be very human friendly, even compared to the virus as we now know it.</description>

			<description>I turned on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-justify-nets-championship-hopes-but-focus-must-remain-on-present/live/&quot;&gt;first NBA game&lt;/a&gt; of the year last night, Golden State v Brooklyn. I had less than no interest. I couldn't even leave it on while I nerded around on my iPad. It was stealing energy from me. I don't like what happened there, in Brooklyn, nor in the NBA at large. It isn't a league of teams, it's a league of superstars and a weird form of narcissism. I lost the tune of the NBA. Maybe I'll get it back. It does come and go.</description>

			<description>A lot of people vote based on how comfortable the candidate is in his or her own skin. Trump, whatever else you can say about him is quite comfortable that way. Hillary and Joe are not. Trump lost because enough people woke up and realized that wasn't a good enough reason to vote for someone. Whether or not the candidate is a sociopath and would-be tyrant should have some weight. Imagine a candidate with the confidence of Trump and the depth of knowledge of HRC.</description>

			<description>I wish my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;hippie uncle&lt;/a&gt; had lived to see legalized cannabis in the US. He also would have loved smart phones. He was always looking stuff up in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Almanac_with_Information_Please&quot;&gt;Information Please almanac&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of having all the information in the world in his pocket is something he could have imagined, as a voracious science fiction reader, but I don't think he would have seen it as coming so soon. He was born in 1945, would have been 75 now if he lived, but he died in 2003 at the age of 57.</description>

			<title>Trump kills Americans because he likes it.</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We know the Trumps were trying to kill more Americans with Covid. We don’t know why, even though the news is reporting the reason as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity&quot;&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;.  What if it had nothing to do with herd immunity what if they just wanted to kill more Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend asks what would be the point? A few answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the point is sadism or being a sociopath. I remember that kids like to kill ants in creative ways. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0&quot;&gt;The Joker said&lt;/a&gt; in The Dark Knight, sometimes people just &quot;do things.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Working with and inside organizations of all sizes I was often impressed with how often people do things for personally selfish reasons. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I remember reading about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto&quot;&gt;Warsaw Ghetto&lt;/a&gt; during WW II. A quote stayed with me, from one of the Jews imprisoned there (paraphrasing). &quot;We make money for the Nazis, so why should they kill us?&quot; They figured as long as they were useful they'd be kept alive, as if there was reason to the way things are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc&quot;&gt;Some men&lt;/a&gt; just want to watch the world burn.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes the answer is obvious. Once, when I lived in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/425-Manzanita-Way-Woodside-CA-94062/181464824_zpid/&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, a neighbor called and said she was getting baby goats, and they would be making a bunch of noise for a while. I asked why are you getting goats. She said she always wanted goats. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And sometimes there just is no reason. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, perhaps it's too much for people to consider Trump wanted to kill Americans because he liked it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: No spoilers, but Kurt Vonnegut's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan&quot;&gt;Sirens of Titan&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful book, is about the purpose of life on earth, one that would be consistent with the theme of this blog post. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to see a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze&quot;&gt;Waze&lt;/a&gt; for supermarkets. How it would work. I'd register with (for example) Google, and ask it to notify me when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adams+Fairacre+Farms/@41.9766612,-73.9882775,246m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x59f95f28dad1a9b2!8m2!3d41.9767848!4d-73.9881112&quot;&gt;parking lot&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://adamsfarms.com/&quot;&gt;favorite market&lt;/a&gt; is mostly empty. I'd also like to know how long ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/about-us&quot;&gt;Bread Alone&lt;/a&gt; delivered. I'd rather go when the store isn't packed full, and when my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breadalone.com/peasant-bread&quot;&gt;favorite bread&lt;/a&gt; is likely to be on the shelf. This would have saved me a trip earlier today, when literally every spot was taken. Not a good time to go shopping, esp during a pandemic. I did not even go in.</description>

			<description>I read a lot of audiobooks. Sometimes the narrator is so excellent, it's worth calling out. I just got through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/pd/One-Flew-Over-the-Cuckoos-Nest-Audiobook/B008N1TVDU&quot;&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&lt;/a&gt;, narrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly&quot;&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt;. The book is wonderful, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Kesey&quot;&gt;Kesey&lt;/a&gt; is a great writer, it's funny, warm, a great story beautifully told. Reilly does all the voices. Usually male narrators have trouble pulling off the female characters and vice versa. Somehow Reilly does it. Highly recommended. If you know of audiobooks that are great because of narration, let me know. I'm always looking for a good read. My next book is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Joe-Biden/dp/B08KFFWHR4/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Biden biography&lt;/a&gt; by Evan Osnos. Also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Rudy-Rucker-audiobook/dp/B00RBZFYF8/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&quot;&gt;first book&lt;/a&gt; by Rudy Rucker.</description>

			<description>The way Trump relates to his base reminds me a lot of the way big tech companies talk to their users.

			<description>As you may have heard, I got a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;OLED tv last week&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm starting to come to terms with it. I've added an old Roku stick to the device, and 99 percent of my interaction with the TV is through Roku. I'm not sure I'm getting the best video this way. Also the annoying LG user interface keeps popping up. And to adjust the hardware of the TV, I still need to use the LG remote. Which makes me wonder if there are any external devices, Apple TV, or some kind of Chromecast or something from Amazon that can also manage the hardware? I'd love to get it down to one remote. I still think &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Roku%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html&quot;&gt;best remote&lt;/a&gt;. Almost as simple as possible. I loved the way my old TCL did everything from Roku. Perfectly integrated, and one less OS is better than two.</description>

			<description>We should be supporting Americans during the pandemic. A country that won't come together in a crisis like this isn't imho a country. We support rich people who don't need help -- and let people wait out the pandemic with no money for food or rent and no hope of getting out of debt, people who may have been middle class before Covid, who are now broke. The importance of health care is something everyone can understand now, even young people. We are a stupid country. We waste so much, yet we don't take care of our basic needs. A small number live so extravagantly, when there is only so much a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html&quot;&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; can use. This is about to come home in a huge way. This isn't working, hasn't for a long time, but it's getting worse, and about to get much worse. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>It’s still true — we aren’t getting out of this pandemic until we work together and care about each other. Until we do, it’ll keep getting worse. I thought for a while the vaccine could eliminate the need to work together, but it’s just another me-first thing.

			<description>Five &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_neighborhoods&quot;&gt;neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; in Queens have more people than Wyoming. Here's the math. The five largest neighborhoods in &lt;a href=&quot;https://statisticalatlas.com/county-subdivision/New-York/Queens-County/Queens/Population#figure/neighborhood&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt;, by population, are: Astoria, Jamaica. Corona, Elmhurst and Flushing -- for a total of 581K. Wyoming's population is 578K. The point being this is just part of one county in New York State. It gets zero senators, probably a total of one member of the House (hard to figure). This came up as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KMCRadio/status/1340816003203252224&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on how the counties, if votes were allocated to them, one per county, would have given Trump a landslide win over Biden. Yes, and if every one of my toes were worth $1 billion, I would be a billionaire. I'm sure you can tell a story that makes you sleep easier at night. But that's not how elections are won and lost. And of course everyone knows that. Oh can we stop being idiots some day, perhaps? That would be nice. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/20.html#a155757&quot;&gt;ranted about journalism&lt;/a&gt; and the way they report on Facebook, from their own conflicted point of view. Toxic stuff, completely unrestrained by any effort at balance. I just came across a thread in a private FB group where a parent, considering buying a house in a small nearby town, asks what people think of local schooling. What came back is an incredible thread with real-life experiences. So far 70 comments. Not the kind of stuff you can get from journalism or books. Since it's private, I can't quote it, sorry.</description>

			<description>Listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-facebook-owns-future&quot;&gt;On The Media&lt;/a&gt; about Google and Facebook. Such hype and propaganda. When you hear &quot;news&quot; talk about something you understand better than they do, you can hear how evil they are. And they are very evil at NPR. For example, they talk about how Facebook is used by white supremacists to organize so they can kill protestors. They interview the girlfriend of one of the dead protestors. What they leave out is that it's also used to plan charity events in my hometown, and every hometown in the world. It's like saying the telephone is used to plan terrorism. Yes, it is, but most people would know that's bullshit. Unfortunately they are so good at sliming Facebook in journalism, and it is still relatively new, that they mislead a lot of people who could benefit from using it. I know because I hear the bullshit coming back through them. They're scared of it, that's for sure. They should let some people use their air to explain how NPR exploits &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; users. Yeah I don't see that happening anytime soon. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>BTW this is why blogging and podcasting are so important. They represent checks on the power of journalism. I was naive in the beginning to think this would negate the power of journalism to mislead, it hasn't had that effect. They are as oblivious to criticism as the Republicans in Congress are. But there's still hope.</description>
