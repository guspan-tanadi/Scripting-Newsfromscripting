			<description>A problem happens when an app running in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pagepark.io/&quot;&gt;PagePark&lt;/a&gt; makes a request of another app that's running on the same machine. It reared its ugly head again today, and I had a heck of a time finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/17&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; by searching. In this post I used all the terms I used in my search, so hopefully if I ever hit it again, I'll find my way back here, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/17&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to the answer.</description>

			<description>America’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalwire.com/2021/07/05/americas-politics-are-stubbornly-fixed/&quot;&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt; appear to be stubbornly fixed. That's just a symptom. The bigger problem is the US has a genetic defect that makes it impossible for it to be united. Slavery. Everyone has a position on that. Either for or against. Not too many people in the middle. And the division in the country, to me, appears to be right along that line. People may be pro-slavery without putting it that way.</description>

			<description>I am happy to report that archive.org has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170705073731/http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;good copy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html&quot;&gt;OPML 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;. It's the easiest kind of page to archive, static HTML, stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. They started sampling it in 2016, even though the page has been there since the mid-00s.</description>

			<description>It's really weird &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190815000000*/https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;how they do&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt;. They're sampling it every day, as many as 17 times a day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/05/rss2archiveorgsampling.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. It's a static page for a format that's been frozen since 2002. A few samplings a year would be sufficient. As with the OPML spec, their archive starts in 2016, but the doc has been there at since 2003.</description>

			<description>Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/07/05/opmlarchivescreen.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; that shows how frequently the OPML 2.0 spec is sampled. I can think of three differences. 1. RSS is more famous than OPML. 2. RSS spec is on a Harvard website, the OPML spec is on opml.org. 3. The RSS spec is served via HTTPS, the OPML spec via HTTP.</description>

			<title>Do the Bucks need Giannis?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;NBA fans, what's the best NBA podcast? Not too many ads, esp up front. Not too much bullshit about the people talking. Truly interesting ideas about what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Bucks did so well with Lopez playing a role similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo&quot;&gt;Giannis&lt;/a&gt; in game 5, but in game 6 he's back to (mostly) shooting corner 3's? Why? I have a hunch. Giannis is kind of like Melo was when things worked without him at the Knicks in 2012. Nothing cool could happen on the Knicks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clutchpoints.com/carmelo-anthony-jeremy-lin-story-did-melo-force-linsanity-out-of-new-york/&quot;&gt;said Melo&lt;/a&gt; (in my imagination) without it going through me, said Melo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think Giannis is a liability, in that the Bucks play better without him because his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yH5w7INbDA&quot;&gt;foul shots&lt;/a&gt; break up any energy the Bucks build. It's a free timeout for their opponent. If Lopez can do what Giannis does, without the foul shot liability, who needs Giannis?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>America is not great</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was taught as a youngster that the US was the greatest country ever, both at home and in school. I imagine this is the same education kids in every terrible country ever got. And my parents were biased, they were immigrants who would have died for sure in Europe during WW II if the US hadn't taken them in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Over time they came to see the reality that the US is a seriously flawed country. But nothing would have prepared them for what we've seen in the last five years. My mom died in February 2018, so she did live to see Trump elected, but did not see the January 6 insurrection, and all the looney tunes that followed. She also missed out on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html&quot;&gt;1619 Project&lt;/a&gt; which was, for me a real head-turner. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I knew slavery was part of our legacy, but I didn't know that it was pretty much our &lt;i&gt;whole&lt;/i&gt; legacy. We fought and won a Civil War to purge ourselves of slavery, but that wasn't enough, Jim Crow undid a lot of the good that was done in post-Civil War America. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965&quot;&gt;Voting Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;, passed in 1965 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060727-1.html&quot;&gt;re-authorized&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, has now been gutted by the Supreme Court. And the Republican-run states are rapidly moving to deprive citizens of color their voting rights. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The fact is the US is an awful fucked up country. It doesn't live up to the promise of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution for a huge portion of the population, and that means it doesn't mean shit for the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am an American, nothing is going to change that, but if you asked me do I feel this is the greatest country ever, I'd say that's an idea we have to purge from our minds, the US is the opposite, it's a fat, lazy, spoiled, ridiculous excuse for a country. If we want to amount to anything we need to take a 180 degree turn now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;White trash riot on behalf of rich slave owners.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Andrew Shell has put together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/issues/20&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; for installing PagePark on Glitch. It's pretty straightforward. Getting PagePark to run on your own server is something that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; will be able to connect to for storage. It's really important that people who want complete independence can have it. No silos here. We want to do the same for Digital Ocean and AWS. If you're the kind of person who likes to run their own server, please pitch in, and provide feedback. I did it myself, it takes about ten minutes. And we may be able to make it even simpler, depending on how this experiment goes. Thanks! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>When I was planning the third &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt;, I realized at one point that I could, if I wanted, have every &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;discussion leader&lt;/a&gt; of every session be a woman. I didn't go for it, felt like a stunt. Discussion leaders are like editors or teachers. They choose people to speak. We tried to discourage people from raising their hands (hard to enforce). The discussion leader is also empowered to move the mike to another person via a monitor (a human being, usually a student), who &quot;owned&quot; the mike. That's why things kept moving. I didn't choose DLs based on their fame, though I admit sometimes I gave into that, I chose people who could think on their feet in a classroom setting. So I often went with teachers, if one was available. There was a rule that vendors couldn't talk about their product. That became an issue at BloggerCon III at Stanford because Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurs will whore their product no matter what you say. BloggerCon was a users conference. We need to get back to that. Not just marketing events, but where users get together to talk about what they're doing and what they want.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment#Season_4&quot;&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt; of In Treatment became unwatchable. I skipped the last two episodes with Colin. I came close to skipping the other patients, and the two episodes about the therapist and her boyfriend and drinking were most unwatchable, but since one of them was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvline.com/2021/06/28/in-treatment-recap-season-4-finale-brooke-eladio-colin-laila/&quot;&gt;finale&lt;/a&gt;, I watched it, and hated it. The season started off so good and the actors, esp &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzo_Aduba&quot;&gt;Uzo Aduba&lt;/a&gt; are fantastic. I don't know who the writers are, but the characters they created are just foils for speeches on social issues. I don't mind, if there's some art to it. Something to think about. But they're at the level of decade-old Twitter rants, I've heard it all so many times before. At least with Twitter I have a mute button. The concept of the show is very good when there's suspension of disbelief. While this season started out great, in the end the story was bleh, and the telling of it cringe-worthy.</description>

			<description>I haven't been to NYC in two years, even though I live just two hours north of the city by car. The last couple of days my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sanforddickert.com/&quot;&gt;Sanford Dickert&lt;/a&gt;, who now lives in London, has been walking around the city with his iPhone on a stick, broadcasting his travels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sanford/videos/975431809884849&quot;&gt;over Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, conversing with people who speak to him in the comments. I tune in when I can when he does it in London, but this week I've been feeling homesick for NYC. It's still there, but also quite empty. I hadn't counted on that. Those streets are just begging for me to ride on them by bike. Hotel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kayak.com/hotels/New-York,NY-c15830/2021-07-07/2021-07-10/1adults?sort=rank_a;map&quot;&gt;rooms&lt;/a&gt; are still pretty cheap, a nice hotel goes for about $150 a night. I probably should go down for a few days before the summer is over. I do miss the city, which is surprising to me. I no longer have family there, maybe that's why I'm staying away?</description>

			<title>A sustainable web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see my former colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain&quot;&gt;Jonathan Zittrain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/&quot;&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; about making the web future-safe. I'd love to work on this with him and others. I don't think the way we're going about it has much of a chance of working.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think we'll get better results sooner if we go for a sustainable web. That will require new financial structures and organizations that have longevity built into their models, for example, universities like Harvard. Insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Say I want to give someone $10K to keep some of the domains I've registered going for say 100 years. And I give them say 10GB of static content. Add another $10K.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Set up systems to keep the archive of the static content up to date. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let it be cloneable so many vendors can provide this service for a fee, and let app devs create automatic flows on behalf of users. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems it should be possible from there, if enough people and organizations pay money for longevity, at least it's a start.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>One day on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Street&quot;&gt;Houston St&lt;/a&gt; in NYC, while I was visiting at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/footer/map.html&quot;&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of years, I was standing around, waiting for a student, not doing anything, daydreaming a bit, and all of a sudden there's a gorgeous, dark-haired young woman wearing a black dress, standing immediately in front of me. This is the kind of woman you see in Manhattan, perfectly made up, wearing a black dress that perfectly fits her body. They congregate here, somehow knowing this is where they should be. She is a Master of the Universe, can instantly command the attention of anyone she wants. And this godess wants to speak to me.&lt;i&gt;Me?&lt;/i&gt; What. It couldn't be. Must be a mistake. But in an instant, I realized this was the student I was waiting for. Of course she was talking to me. But in that split second my reaction was instinctual, not intellectual, a whole story had played out. I thought of this story the other day, while looking out of my house at a green mountain far in the distance, a field in the foreground, a stand of trees, a huge bird of prey flying overhead. Everything verdant, alive, ideal, perfect as a young confident aloof woman in a black dress in Manhattan. As impossible to describe as a whole. That I could be in such a place, that this scene had assembled itself with me in it, me. Me. How did this happen? At my advanced age, I'm just beginning to understand that I am part of this world.</description>

Then they say what they're doing. The point of using asynchronous tools is  you don't have to care what I'm doing now, and I don't have to stop everything to do something for you.</description>

Using a regular expression, I find a t.co link in a tweet, and replace it with something smaller and less distracting. Remember this is a writing environment, so the result must be as simple as possible for readers. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'm really confused about what's up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/29.html#a131345&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, they clearly aren't archiving this blog in any meaningful way. I write this blog with history in mind. I put things here and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog&lt;/a&gt; because I want to be sure historians in the future will find at least one link to this stuff. If archive.org isn't backing it up, that's a big problem. And it raises an even bigger question -- what else aren't they archiving? And how do they decide what to archive and not to archive? Do they run the JavaScript on a page to get a rendering? If not, there's a huge amount of our knowledge that isn't being recorded. Are they trying to be neutral or do their friends and people who donate get preferential treatment?</description>

			<description>I just did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22monthly+ritual%22&quot;&gt;monthly ritual&lt;/a&gt;, backing up June's blog, in OPML, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/06.opml&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, archive.org has &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/2020*/https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;one snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of the repo, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20201122120542/https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News&quot;&gt;11/22/2020&lt;/a&gt;. Anything after that is not in their database. (On further examination it seems the only took a snapshot of the top level of the repo, so it doesn't serve as a backup of the content of the blog.)</description>

			<description>The conclusion: archive.org, no matter how good it is and how ethical the people there are, is a last-resort way to backup the web. It can and should get better, but if we want to create a historic record of any kind about this era, we're going to have to be much more deliberate about it, even competitive. There are nothing but holes in our approach, all the way down to the architecture of the net itself, and at every level above it. We've created a very temporary way to record history. And like everything else, we aren't doing anything about it.</description>
