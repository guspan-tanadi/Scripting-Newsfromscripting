Really smart, and fun -- and it turns out there's a lot more that can be done with the ChatGPT api. I asked how much they were spending to keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/&quot;&gt;my personal chatbot&lt;/a&gt; up, and they said it would fit in their $99 a month plan. Not wanting to depend on their generosity in this way, they're young and just starting up, I signed up. I think it's worth that much to have a personal playground and have them do the hosting and also collaborate on new features. I'm going to help them recruit really special people to use their service, because that's where I think the juice is right now. People who already have interesting content flows (ie blogs) that could be pushed through this new kind of software machine. At the same time I've been trying to encourage my friends at Automattic to get involved in helping people with ideas flow them into chatbots via their chatblogs. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>About Radio3</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a164206&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.feedland.org/yourFeed.opml#1680702347000&quot;&gt;linkblogging&lt;/a&gt; capability in FeedLand. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was always the plan to add this to FeedLand, but I moved it up because someday soon I expect &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; to stop working because it depends on the Twitter API for identity, and they seem to be breaking devs all the time these days, but so far not Radio3. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Rather than converting Radio3 to email identity, I decided to move its core features into FeedLand which already has email identity. It took a few days, and they were mostly enjoyable, because I do dialog stuff much better today than I did when I wrote Radio3, which was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/08/29/#a1409347551&quot;&gt;long time ago&lt;/a&gt;! It totally needed a rewrite. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But -- for now I'm continuing to use Radio3, because it can post to Twitter and Mastodon, and anyone who's subscribed to that feed should keep subscribing. I never like to rock the boat, too many other things worth doing, and maybe Twitter will never break Radio3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE&quot;&gt;It could happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime as far as I can tell &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio3.io/&quot;&gt;Radio3&lt;/a&gt; still works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now the day that Radio3 stops working, at least this is some work I won't have to do. I will have a linkblogging tool ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And no one will be bothered by my Radio3 feed going quiet because nothing was going out that way anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And FeedLand's linkblogger will be infinitely better than Radio3 because it works. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So my advice is, don't depend on FeedLand for linkblogging if you already have your Radio3 act together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

One of the reasons I rarely see links from them is that they still apparently don't have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=semafor+rss+feed&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; for their stories. If they had a feed, I'd be subscribed and I'd be much more likely to notice, and would probably occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/110146691152214416&quot;&gt;pass a link&lt;/a&gt; on to my followers. There is a distribution system that helps new pubs like Semafor boot up. My advice, do two things: 1. Put a linefeed at the end of each line in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/05/viewsource.png&quot;&gt;HTML source&lt;/a&gt; so I can get some ideas where you might have put your RSS feed. 2. If you don't have a feed for your top stories at least, stop everything and do it. Every day you delay is more exposure you don't get. I asked them to do this when they started, so this is the second request.</description>

			<description>The journalism industry ought to form a news Twitter. It could be part of the fediverse, but it should also have its own easy UI. There are ease-of-use advantages to centralized systems. A lot of the people who use Twitter need the simplicity. A service can be both centralized and open at the same time. A lot of people got their first exposure to the web on AOL, for example. But news needs to have a single point of congregation. Twitter was providing a useful service there.</description>

There are ease-of-use advantages to centralized systems. A lot of the people who use Twitter need the simplicity. A service can be both centralized and open at the same time. A lot of people got their first exposure to the web on AOL, for example. But news needs to have a single point of congregation. Twitter was providing a useful service there." created="Wed, 05 Apr 2023 13:42:18 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/04/05.html#a134218"/>

			<description>What would it take for Google to do stuff like this? Invent a new department, the department of User Lovers, or Product Lovers (same thing of course). No tech company has ever had such a department. They mindlessly assume that love of the product is ingrained in all their people when the truth is the opposite, they have contempt for users. I've seen it grow in my own company, and in the blogging community. A sense that because I work for the company that made the product, I know everything all the users know and more. It's the same fallacy that applies to Silicon Valley billionaires. You have to step into a new perspective to love the product, one that has nothing to do with who you work for or how validated you are by reporters and the public.</description>

			<description>I find this interesting, maybe you do too. But with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatthing.ai/bots/b5c0ad69-55d4-4008-a97c-0b2884cca3f2/&quot;&gt;personal chatbot&lt;/a&gt;, the next step is to have a Dave-emulator, right? Wouldn't be that big a stretch. I basically write like I talk. It's almost dialog. I do go back and edit and take out the parts where I'm thinking while talking, and in the end those parts aren't needed to make the point. I'm sure you could write an AI thing that did that. It probably already does it. I knew there would be a reason to put an effort into having a good archive. (I deliberately left this bit unedited.)</description>

There's always been confusion about the power of individuals, even the richest ones -- imho they don't have the power to change the world, even though they're in the middle of the big change. If they weren't there someone else would be. The changes happening now can only happen because the systems they depend on are already in place. As individuals we get to make art from the change, give it style, a message, make it usable (or not), make it come into existence a bit faster perhaps. But the change itself is coming from evolution, not from individual people.</description>

			<description>In a voicemail to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_Malik&quot;&gt;Om Malik&lt;/a&gt; yesterday I observed that these things are not chatbots. I don't like the word chat. They have a chat-derived UI, true, but I find I go there when I have a question, much like I go to a search engine. It's a way to search a database that's also capable of writing. I'm looking for docs that might not exist, if so the software will try to create it for us. Much more useful than Google. As much of an advance over Google as Google was over Yahoo's directory.</description>

It also appears he was able to correct mistakes? I wonder how that works. But it's no longer purely my chatbot, now it's Jakes too? Hmm. (I trust Jake, that's not a problem. But I might not trust other people who explore my pod.)</description>

			<description>Learned yesterday that Twitter is turning off version 1 of their API. So even if I wanted to pay, I'd have to do a bunch of dev work to stay on their system. Makes the decision to walk away that much easier. No way I would choose to spend my very limited time on such make-work.</description>
