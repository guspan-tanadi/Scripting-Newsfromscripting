			<description>If you were part of the Frontier, Radio UserLand or Drummer communities and are interested in helping test my new feed reading product, let me know. You can send an email to the address on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.com/&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt;. You have to have done a fair amount of work with RSS, and can write a decent bug report. This is an ambitious product. Want to solve big problems?

			<title>People aren't toxic</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Calling a person toxic is really bad. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's the kind of thing people who run death camps say about the people they put in death camps.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's a trigger for me -- as a child of Holocaust survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There aren't many insults I'll complain about, but that's one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Sometimes in programming you have to set up a test that might take a minute or two to run. While I'm waiting today I ask my speaker to play &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ATTjg7tpE&quot;&gt;Oye Cómo Va&lt;/a&gt; by Santana as my waiting music. It gives me something lively to groove to while the gears in the cloud mesh and produce the test result. It's like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lLYOGDsts&quot;&gt;song they play&lt;/a&gt; while the contestants write down their Final Jeopardy questions.</description>

I heard that the DoJ had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/barr-mueller-report/index.html&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the heavily redacted memo by former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;Attorney General Barr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22187584-barr-unredacted-memo&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/n5SRHdcPLAI&quot;&gt;basically said&lt;/a&gt; that the Mueller Report (that we hadn't at the time seen) was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nothingburger&quot;&gt;Nothingburger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/barr-mueller-report/index.html&quot;&gt;without the redactions&lt;/a&gt;. So I expected there would be something interesting on MSNBC. The show opens with an in-detail horse race story that said basically we fucked up and it wasn't a foregone conclusion that the Repubs would take Congress in the upcoming midterm election as we have been reporting since just after the 2020 election. Right. This is now horserace journalism of a higher order, the horserace we're judging is how well Hayes et al were doing at predicting the outcome of the election, which btw, is a theoretical thing because (pause here) THE FUCKING ELECTION STILL HASN'T HAPPENED. Sorry for screaming, but this is such a waste, and how could anyone possibly care about this. Every time they report &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom&quot;&gt;conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, they have driven far off course, they are no longer doing news, they are doing self-butthole examination. What a waste. And it's kind of obvious (imho) that Hayes has been going to the Tucker Carlson School School of Acting. He's trying to talk like him. It's really sad. Maybe MSNBC could just hire Carlson to work for them. After all if the Mets can buy players from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor&quot;&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer&quot;&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;, why can't MNBC buy an actor from Fox News to play for them. The amount of actual news reporting on both networks is pitifully small.</description>

			<title>Markdown is just enough HTML</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imgRightMargin&quot; src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/12/pitcher.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&quot;&gt;I've been writing feed readers for many years. And I have a confession to make. Going back to the beginning, I've been taking all the HTML markup out of the text because feed producers totally abuse the privilege, inserting all kinds of garbage into my reading space. So I just take it all out. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if other feed reader writers are as draconian as I. We should find out what they do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But there is a &lt;i&gt;safe way&lt;/i&gt; to put back just enough style -- Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We finally have it working in the new feed reader I've been working on, and it's fantastic. Markdown is just enough HTML and not too much. Exactly the right amount for what we need in the world of feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;source:markdown&gt;&lt;/a&gt; element. If you use it as &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://tweetfeed.org/davewiner/rss.xml&quot;&gt;we do&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweetfeed.org/&quot;&gt;tweetfeed&lt;/a&gt; app, your feeds will work with my reader, and we'll be on our way to a bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to have a class of students who want to participate in shipping a product, and thereby learn how to do it themselves at some time in the future. Accredited and graded, which gets the student's attention. First thing I'd teach is how to write a report on software, whether it be a bug, or an idea for improvement. You have to show that you've done something to try to narrow it down, and understand the consequences of what you're asking for. Do we have the resources on the team to contemplate this. Is this something I could do for myself. If I got the feature would I be able to use it or am I just thinking of something would be nice to have, perhaps for others. Everyone feels they would know how to design software, but if they could get close enough to it to see how it actually works, they would see that there's actually a lot to it.</description>

			<source:outline text="I'd love to have a class of students who want to participate in shipping a product, and thereby learn how to do it themselves at some time in the future. Accredited and graded, which gets the student's attention. First thing I'd teach is how to write a report on software, whether it be a bug, or an idea for improvement. You have to show that you've done something to try to narrow it down, and understand the consequences of what you're asking for. Do we have the resources on the team to contemplate this. Is this something I could do for myself. If I got the feature would I be able to use it or am I just thinking of something would be nice to have, perhaps for others.

			<title>Ulster County bagels?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I made a trip &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/08/05.html&quot;&gt;down to NYC&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago, and picked up a fresh bagel with cream cheese and lox at Utopia Bagels in Queens. It was heaven. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don't imagine I'm going to get that good a bagel in Ulster County, but what about a fresh bagel? I went to Lox of Bagels in Saugerties last Tuesday, they had bins full of bagels that &lt;i&gt;looked&lt;/i&gt; fresh and there was a long line of people waiting to be served so it seemed promising. But the bagels were old and stale. Yck.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay I'm going to go to every bagel place in the area until I find one that's decent. Or maybe you can save me the time??&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>This doesn't work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay -- Trump doesn't play by the rules of journalism. He doesn't explain why he had the stolen documents. His only response is to flood the zone with bullshit as Bannon says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems on the other hand accept the rules of journalism, which over decades has come to mean avoid saying anything, so everything Dems say comes out more and more like mush. They work hard to say nothing for fear of provoking a new scandal in the press.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We view what Trump does negatively, but what about the other journalism as the sole judge approach? It doesn't work any better for us, in fact you'd have to say at this time that approach is losing. We're one election away from becoming an openly fascist country.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's why, sorry to say -- I'm not sad to see the enforcers of journalism at CNN and other news orgs get fired. Because the system they are enforcing is flushing our system down the toilet. And the system, even though it's fucked up, is better than having no system at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the big journalism thinkers think this idea deserves to be part of the mix. You never see it on the op-ed pages, or part of the discussion on The Beat with Ari Melber. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

They're all dead now. Their opinions don't matter. So if the opinions mean nothing now, what did they mean when they were alive? I would say they meant nothing then too. And if it applied to them it must certainly apply to me. I find it relaxing to know I don't have to figure everything out, because it doesn't matter what I think. It just doesn't matter. Now innovation might matter, but most of it goes unrecognized. My uncle for example, invented a windmill that didn't need to be repositioned to catch the wind. If the wind was blowing it would capture the energy. Earlier this evening I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/1560757203870547970&quot;&gt;saw&lt;/a&gt; it had been invented again, because no one heard about my uncle's invention, except for people who loved him. Even so, I think that matters, because his ideas led to more ideas. That's very different from opinions. Ken thought all kinds of things that, to me, were bullshit. He could have saved the energy, because it didn't end up meaning anything. Also how well did they communicate their ideas? My maternal grandfather, Rudy Kiesler, Ken's father, actually got a mention in the Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for my great uncle, his brother-in-law. They said he was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/21/rudyKieslerCommunistQuote.png&quot;&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;! I spent a lot of time with him growing up and in million years I'd never have thought he was a communist. He was a voracious capitalist, but then -- he always seemed to support liberal causes. And he was a Mets fan. So maybe there was some truth to it? He definitely had strong opinions, that man, but he must not have communicated them effectively, or maybe he was hiding this from his grandhildren? Hmm.</description>

			<description>Turns out I did have something to say. I'm watching a great HBO series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Friend_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;My Brilliant Friend&lt;/a&gt;. It got the highest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/my-brilliant-friend&quot;&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; on Metacritic, and it is deserved. Almost like watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; (who I love) in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone&quot;&gt;first movie&lt;/a&gt;, and realizing there's going to be a lot more of this and being happy to be around to see all of it. There are three seasons, I'm only on episode 4 of season 1. I'm sure there will be a lot more to say about this.  In the meantime I'm just enjoying a beautiful film as a TV series about two children growing up in Naples in the 1950s.</description>

It got the highest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/my-brilliant-friend&quot;&gt;rating&lt;/a&gt; on Metacritic, and it is deserved. Almost like watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; (who I love) in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter%27s_Bone&quot;&gt;first movie&lt;/a&gt;, and realizing there's going to be a lot more of this and being happy to be around to see all of it. There are three seasons, I'm only on episode 4 of season 1. I'm sure there will be a lot more to say about this.  In the meantime I'm just enjoying a beautiful film as a TV series about two children growing up in Naples in the 1950s." created="Sun, 21 Aug 2022 03:14:00 GMT" type="outline" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/20.html#a031400"/>

Now he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alfranken/status/1560430185375305728&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it was a joke. I almost forwarded it as evidence of how depraved Trump is, but it really was proof of what an idiot Franken is. A self-destructive idiot, who was it seems on his way back, but he should just go away quietly and never be heard from again. A punchline to a joke -- remember what it was like to elect a &quot;comedian&quot; to Congress.</description>

			<description>I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;xmlviewer.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; to link to feeds because browsers make a mess of displaying feeds. Suggestion to browser devs: treat viewing a feed as lifting the hood on a car or viewing the source of an HTML page. When you do that, you don't see another car interior, or another rendering of the HTML. You see a lot of technical stuff. Trust people who don't want to know how the web works will quickly hit the Back button to get back to the comfort of the user interface.</description>

			<description>Why now? RSS 2.0 will be &lt;i&gt;twenty years old&lt;/i&gt; on September 18. One month from today.

But in the meantime, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweetfeed.org/&quot;&gt;something new&lt;/a&gt; to spark a new use for RSS and Twitter -- hooking people's tweets up to feed reader apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsblur.com/&quot;&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoldreader.com/&quot;&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>The reason I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1559879683776331776&quot;&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt; is that soon you will be able to publish to all RSS readers from Twitter. It really works, there's some serious innovation here, and fills in a missing piece that's been there since the mid-00s. This is RSS and Twitter waking up after a long sleep.</description>

			<title>Slippin Jimmy is back for the love</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Better Call Saul spoilers follow. You have been warned! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The previous episode ended with the hero threatening to kill an old crippled woman whose mistake was trusting him. People thought this meant that his slide would continue in the finale, and it certainly did, but then it turned around -- and it became what I had hoped it would be -- a love story! &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We didn't spend 14 years with this character, all the while knowing he had a good heart, he loved his brother and Kim, and all the old folks at Sandpiper, he really did love them, only to find out at the end his heart was cold and there was no redemption for our hero. I thought that would not be consistent with the writers of the show. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the final scenes, we see the hero, sentenced to 86 years, doing the same thing he was doing at Cinnebon in Omaha, and as usual his fellow prisoners and guards had fallen in love with him, as we all did. In the final scene, he's back together with Kim, sharing a cigarette. He's still Slippin Jimmy with a heart of gold. And she's slippin around too, her ID as a lawyer hadn't expired. And the door is wide open for a sequel, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The final touch, where the actors come out one by one and thank us -- what a concept -- for our love of them. In all the finales of all the shows, great ones and not so great, I've never seen this done, and it ended this show with a heart on just the right note. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

				<source:outline text="The previous episode ended with the hero threatening to kill an old crippled woman whose mistake was trusting him. People thought this meant that his slide would continue in the finale, and it certainly did, but then it turned around -- and it became what I had hoped it would be -- a love story!" created="Tue, 16 Aug 2022 11:46:50 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/16/114626.html?title=slippinJimmyIsBackForTheLove#a114650"/>
				<source:outline text="We didn't spend 14 years with this character, all the while knowing he had a good heart, he loved his brother and Kim, and all the old folks at Sandpiper, he really did love them, only to find out at the end his heart was cold and there was no redemption for our hero. I thought that would not be consistent with the writers of the show." created="Tue, 16 Aug 2022 12:09:30 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/16/114626.html?title=slippinJimmyIsBackForTheLove#a120930"/>
				<source:outline text="In the final scenes, we see the hero, sentenced to 86 years, doing the same thing he was doing at Cinnebon in Omaha, and as usual his fellow prisoners and guards had fallen in love with him, as we all did. In the final scene, he's back together with Kim, sharing a cigarette. He's still Slippin Jimmy with a heart of gold. And she's slippin around too, her ID as a lawyer hadn't expired. And the door is wide open for a sequel, btw." created="Tue, 16 Aug 2022 11:49:57 GMT" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2022/08/16/114626.html?title=slippinJimmyIsBackForTheLove#a114957"/>

			<description>Some asshole steals all your photo albums, some of which contain launch codes for your nuclear missiles, and then has the gall to ask where his passports went. All while he's running around free to do more of this bullshit. We are a wimp country to put up with this miscreant.</description>

			<description>I was always taught the basics of a good story are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws&quot;&gt;who, what, when, where and why&lt;/a&gt;. With Trump and his stolen top secret US government documents, we don't know who he was selling the secrets to. The what part -- we don't know either. They say nuclear secrets, but what if they got you access to world's banking system. That could be considerably more valuable. Why? With Trump there's only ever one reason -- if it makes him richer he's in. If not why bother. Our journalism repeats the same old bullshit over and over.</description>

			<description>Gotta wonder why none of the news orgs are looking at this. I remember years ago when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/transcript-rachel-maddow-show-10-19-21-n1281957&quot;&gt;Maddow&lt;/a&gt; was telling about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska&quot;&gt;Oleg Derapaska&lt;/a&gt; and Trump. What ever became of him, and why did all the news orgs stop looking at how Trump was selling us out.</description>

			<description>Anything that gets us to hate each other based on race, age, gender is a wedge, and it's designed to keep us from unifying, which allows the assholes to keep control.</description>

After you log in, our server will periodically read your new tweets and update a public RSS feed, on our server, that mirrors your tweets, so you and others can follow them in any feed reader. One thing that's different from earlier approaches is that tweets can have titles, something that most feed readers like/insist on. And the feeds will be 2022-compliant, using modern techniques for the world we live in today, not the world of twenty years ago. People keep looking for software to replace Twitter. I don't like that approach because systems with tens of millions of happy users don't get replaced, but they can foster new developments built on their strength and ubiquity. I respect and love Twitter. My software does too.</description>

			<description>Come to think of it, Twitter and RSS have a lot in common. Both are roughly contemporary pioneering efforts on which today's social media and news worlds are built. Both are a bit worse for wear and tear, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/14/wearAndTear.png&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJBkL9_Lfm4&quot;&gt;Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;. But they're still here! We'll make love. Twitter and RSS all the way.</description>
