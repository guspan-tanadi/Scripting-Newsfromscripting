			<description>This is our country. In order to get out of the mess, we have to start thinking and acting like we're the owners of the United States. And by &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; I mean the weirdos, immigrants, people of color, people who read books, listen to other people. Have hope, give a shit.</description>

			<description>When people said it was virtually certain that the new Supreme Court justice would be confirmed, you have to question it, because now it's anything but certain. All it took was for the White House to get infected. It's a central node in the US government. Seems likely its infection spreads to Congress and even the Court. Hard to imagine orderly business taking place in DC for a while, but who knows. Can't wait to hear what Mitch McConnell has to say, and if he was exposed.</description>

			<title>Judging Trump</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some of us, privately, will tell our friends that we're glad that Trump got the virus. He was living far more dangerously than he should have. It was amazing that he stayed uninfected this long. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm ten years younger than him, I exercise every day, and I limit my interactions with other people drastically. Last week I went out to lunch with a small group of friends, outside. I've done that a few times since March, mostly in the last month. I also have serious pre-existing conditions that make me more vulnerable. My life is dramatically altered since we all went into hiding earlier this year. If I consider myself lucky to be virus-free so far, then Trump is blessed beyond belief that he got away with what he was doing for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the virus rages through the United States, and &lt;i&gt;he's responsible&lt;/i&gt; for that, and all the misery that comes from it. So yeah, it's good that he got it. If he survives, perhaps he'll do something to help, at least he won't be able to do more harm. If he doesn't survive, may he rest in peace -- and at the same time, good riddance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Get over the impulse to cut him slack here. This is not a time for that, especially with the election so close. &lt;i&gt;This is our last chance to get rid of Trump&lt;/i&gt;. Stay focused on that. Is this event a positive for that? I'm not certain about many things but I am certain about this. Yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's totally okay to judge Trump. That's what elections are all about. We're trained not to do it, esp when someone is sick. This is not the time for that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-alert-ny/&quot;&gt;Covid Alert NY&lt;/a&gt; on my Pixel 4a. It uses Bluetooth to collect IDs of phones I spend ten minutes within six feed of and remembers them for some period of time. If one of them reports positive with Covid, I get notified. It's contact tracing with phones that we've talked about for a while. Does it work? I guess I hope not to ever find out. Yes I know it probably is a huge drain on the battery and privacy.</description>

			<title>Happy birthday Uncle Vava</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today would have been my uncle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Ken Kiesler%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Ken Kiesler&lt;/a&gt;'s, 75th birthday. He didn't even make it &lt;a href=&quot;http://crimson1.scripting.com/kenKiesler&quot;&gt;to 60&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure he's happy on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie&quot;&gt;hippie&lt;/a&gt; beach in the sky. See you soon &lt;a href=&quot;http://greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;Uncle Vava&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, people may not know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/04/28/212326.html?title=uncleKenAndAuntDorothy&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; was an early blogger. He, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;, were the first two users of &lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, outside of UserLand. In 1998 or 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He was my mother's brother, and nephew of German novelist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;Arno Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first member of my family born in the US. I was the second. He was only 10 years older than me, and was as much a brother as an uncle. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It seems so weird that he could ever be as old as 75, but it's even more weird that he's been gone so long already. He died in Jamaica, in 2003, a few weeks before the first BloggerCon. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ken and Dot, with a few of Ken's cars, on their land in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crescent+Beach,+FL+32080/@29.7387049,-81.2768389,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e69977c882aea5:0xe61a1afbdfe01fae!8m2!3d29.76886!4d-81.2536786&quot;&gt;Crescent Beach, FL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
