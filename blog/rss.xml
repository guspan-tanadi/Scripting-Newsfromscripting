People who care should stop ignoring the people who use facebook. We matter.</description>

			<description>Did Dropbox change the period of time they keep changes? I thought they kept them forever. Was I dreaming? Now they say it's just 30 days. It's not a feature I use often, but when I do it's because I &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; it. It seems I can pay extra and get 180 days. I pay for Dropbox $119 per year btw. 180 days might as well be 30. How do I know in advance how far I need to go back to get the version I'm looking for.</description>

			<description>I bought a Tesla and a Peloton. Neither have arrived yet. When I ride my bike I like to listen to music, or a podcast or an audiobook. I don't need a coach. I bought the Pelo because it's the best indoor exercise bike. Let's see if I can use it that way. Same with the Tesla. It feels like they both want me to join the cult.</description>

			<title>We are the government</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Living in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-state_area&quot;&gt;tri-state area&lt;/a&gt; we get New Jersey political ads on TV. I saw one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy&quot;&gt;NJ governor Murphy&lt;/a&gt; running for re-election, but the speakers in the commercial are voters, saying what they want and at the end &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GovMurphy&quot;&gt;Murphy&lt;/a&gt; says he agrees with all of it. That's a great commercial. It's great because it says something about our political system that we often forget. We are the government in the US, the people are. Show that you get it not with words but with actions. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Tech marketing should work that way also. And journalism about tech. When you write about FB, don't forget the 2.9 billion people who use it. If the company were to disappear, we'd still want an online service where we could all gather. Better if there weren't a company running it, but that's the way it is nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And let's see an apology from the NY Times  for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/30/boomersSuckSaysTheNYTimes.png&quot;&gt;this horror&lt;/a&gt; in yesterday's paper about the people who use Facebook. Of course they ignore everything I write here, but even so, they should apologize, even if they don't care what one blogger thinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Want to break up Facebook? Easy. Let people on Facebook (the online service) connect via Facebook to other services that are not Facebook, just as email, RSS, the web, instant messaging work. It’s the internet way of doing things.

			<title>Facebook is a cowardly company that has never had to fight</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;They changed their name to &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;. A two-syllable name that shortens to the first. &lt;i&gt;Meh.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember the name &quot;Facebook&quot; means many things, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/09/17/153104.html?title=facebookIsAtLeastEightThings&quot;&gt;at least eight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Mark Zuckerberg. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A public corporation.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;60K employees. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Servers, software, other tech.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;An advertising platform.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A user community.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Connections to the rest of the web.#&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;All the content -- video, images, posts, comments, live events, current and past.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The thing that got renamed was #2. All the rest are still there. Yet no one will speak for Facebook #6. Can you imagine 2.9 billion people and it's defined by a handful of columnists and reporters in mostly American news orgs. And there's a company that can communicate with all of them, any time they want for $0. And they have nothing to say other than we're going to change our name now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;According to Pew, a credible source, all the American news orgs combined have about 15 million readers. Facebook #6, the user community, is 2.9 billion. Could Facebook mount a defense? It wouldn't be a fair fight. They would destroy the news orgs' message about Facebook being an evil swamp of petty Boomer sludge and garbage. Instead they run away, give up, let the journalists define &quot;Facebook.&quot; And this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/technology/meta-facebook-zuckerberg.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbfqohlSFUZCibJUNMnqBqCgvfeh7kxmna7IiGeRDxFyOdQEZWL-ErXb6d5aJ0zwzGfDpdnAYMYecZTnKVZLlA_DE6huIeFk5AIZHVkotroUDo_mszEULl9rDbkZyywcu4jgbfu70zWYDLrWqTfgmYzZ1ow-esTflup3HANxavXQKUiipQlg6BXVt0tTiwAZSKJo_HqFx51Xd2FZR3d4QE2MPpLDXCRxZXPruJdL3gBTA7OX3h94m4j6NtDONhxPK73KxQoeMCWkqwLWZgryyAq5xP_MFvzbIrk&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;what they say&lt;/a&gt; about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The bleakest version of what Facebook might become in the next few years, if current trends hold — a &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: yellow&quot;&gt;Boomer-dominated sludge pit filled with cute animal videos and hyperpartisan garbage&lt;/span&gt; — is clearly not the kind of thing the company wants as its flagship product.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As one of FB's 2.9 billion users I am offended by this description of who we are and what we do by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/technology/meta-facebook-zuckerberg.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuonUktbfqohlSFUZCibJUNMnqBqCgvfeh7kxmna7IiGeRDxFyOdQEZWL-ErXb6d5aJ0zwzGfDpdnAYMYecZTnKVZLlA_DE6huIeFk5AIZHVkotroUDo_mszEULl9rDbkZyywcu4jgbfu70zWYDLrWqTfgmYzZ1ow-esTflup3HANxavXQKUiipQlg6BXVt0tTiwAZSKJo_HqFx51Xd2FZR3d4QE2MPpLDXCRxZXPruJdL3gBTA7OX3h94m4j6NtDONhxPK73KxQoeMCWkqwLWZgryyAq5xP_MFvzbIrk&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;Kevin Roose&lt;/a&gt; in today's NYT. It's totally consistent with the campaign journalism is running against the FB #6, the online community. What do they throw at us? Sludge, garbage etc. Geez Louise. What has become of the NY Times?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Facebook (the company, #2) markets like a company that's never had a fight. Just glided into dominance. Well now they have to fight. What do they do? Run away. Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If they don't want to stand up for the 2.9 billion users, who are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; mostly Boomers (there aren't that many of us) and mostly use Facebook #4 as a reasonably reliable online connector for an always-expanding set of uses, a very small portion committed to overthrowing the US government, at least help us stand up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I use Facebook only because the people are there. It's the closest thing to a universal online service. Based on what I know about cycles in tech, Facebook #2 (the company) has a small chance of prevailing in their goal to reinvent themselves to be important in the next wave. It has never happened, even with leaders who were more prepared for it than Zuckerberg is. Companies have to stand for something beyond money and dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The journos belong in a special place in hell. Someday it's going to be just as intolerable to shame people based on age, as it is to shame people based on race, gender, religion, sexual preference, identity etc. Kevin Roose will try apologize someday for what he said in today's NY Times. I hope I live to see his disgrace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think we have a new version of the Drummer CMS that correctly &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/28/151936.html?title=experiment3AppearsToBeASuccess&quot;&gt;handles&lt;/a&gt; blogs in all time zones. I'm getting incredible support from the Drummer users. This is the kind thing you have nightmare dreams about, a deployed product where you missed a serious problem in development and have to scramble to deal with. We still have some serious problems to deal with, but I think it's mostly possible to avoid them, and I'm confident we will get them fixed. I want to get to work on some new features, I really miss that.</description>

			<description>Update: the new CMS is deployed and seems to work. Most important the problems with international blogs appear to be solved. Drummer blogs are unique in that there are archive pages for each day, and month. Which is a date problem other blogging tools don't have. I was trying to think how we solved the problem in Manila and Radio, and then realized we didn't have the problem. Drummer is different. Which is kind of what you'd expect from a product with that name. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Re Facebook and hate speech, every online system is a haven for all kinds of speech. No one knows how to control it, and esp not at the scale that Facebook operates. You could see the revelations differently, at least now Facebook is trying to control the damaging speech. That's progress. But we do have bigger fish to fry. Journalism has decided that we should all aim our hate at Facebook, exclusively. That's a Fox-like tactic. If we're blaming Facebook, I guess we can't blame the NY Times or the WSJ or CNN, MSNBC, etc. As authoritarianism rises, we have to watch our journalism, for signs they are manipulating our focus, for signs they are controlled by or pandering to the fascists. Right now most of us, regardless of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/355526/americans-trust-media-dips-second-lowest-record.aspx&quot;&gt;what we say&lt;/a&gt; to pollsters, accept what the press says as truth.</description>

If we're blaming Facebook, I guess we can't blame the NY Times or the WSJ or CNN, MSNBC, etc. As authoritarianism rises, we have to watch our journalism, for signs they are manipulating our focus, for signs they are controlled by or pandering to the fascists. Right now most of us, regardless of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/355526/americans-trust-media-dips-second-lowest-record.aspx&quot;&gt;what we say&lt;/a&gt; to pollsters, accept what the press says as truth." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2021 12:11:00 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/26/comradeStalin.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/26.html#a121100"/>

			<description>Next time you hear yet another revelation that Facebook is a haven for hate speech, ask if you've gotten any info on what's going on inside the DoJ and why haven't there been any indictments of Republican insurrectionists. At least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/exclusive-jan-6-organizers-met-congress-white-house-1245289/&quot;&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt; has started to cover this. But where are the others? Surely there are patriotic insiders in Congress who would provide background info.</description>

			<description>Last night's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; was a playoff game of the characters of Succession, after two full seasons, we've gotten to know them, and now they're all ready to wrestle each other at the same time. I laughed all the way through the episode. The craftwork. Sat on the edge of my chair to absorb it all. It's a lot like post-season baseball, where you get as many as seven games to get to know all the players. I don't think this is the World Series yet, but we're getting close. Everyone's still in the game, and new people are showing up, more powerful than ever. And it seems the most powerful ones are the women. At one point Kendall says as much. I love this stuff. (And btw, the Dodgers and Red Sox lost the actual playoffs, so we're left with Atlanta and Houston, and I don't care for either team. Onto the NBA season.)</description>

			<description>I've been dealing with some complicated problems with JavaScript dates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/06/02/150411.html&quot;&gt;Old School&lt;/a&gt;, which is the blogging CMS that Drummer uses. It's the same software I use to build Scripting News. I had to take a step back on the project yesterday because I was having so much trouble wrapping my head around what exactly the problem was. It was showing up in India and the Far East mostly. We didn't hit this set of problems with &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, because the blog rendering happened on the user's machine, so there was no timezone difference. And oddly, there is no problem with the RSS feeds of sites in the Far East. But at some times during the day if you posted something new from India, Malaysia or Australia, it would not appear on your home page. Anyway, it's great to have a bunch of smart super-interested people. It's very early days in Drummer Land, and the people really want their blogs to work, and of course I want this even more than they do. But I've never dealt with these issues before and they are mindfucks. You can read about it in this thread on the Drummer support site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/88#issuecomment-950206243&quot;&gt;starting here&lt;/a&gt;. I am figuring it out, it seems, I hope, Murphy-willing.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enes_Kanter&quot;&gt;Enes Kanter&lt;/a&gt;, an NBA player for the Boston Celtics, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EnesKanter/status/1450869180283203589&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying the leader of China is a &quot;brutal dictator.&quot; And of course China is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/nba-china-boston-celtics-enes-kanter-slams-xi-over-tibet.html&quot;&gt;shitting its pants&lt;/a&gt;. This is a big problem. They don't understand that there's a line they're not allowed to cross. In the US, Kanter has a right to his opinion. And the leader of China &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a brutal dictator.  And even if there's some question about it, Kanter is allowed to say what he thinks. This is a similar problem to the one they're having at Netflix with Dave Chappelle's show which I have not watched. I find him incredibly offensive. I'd love to have a private conversation with him where I ask what he's trying to accomplish. I find his stories humiliating. Is there some lesson I'm supposed to learn? If so, could we skip to that part. Anyway, I won't watch him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/business/media/netflix-protest-dave-chappelle.html&quot;&gt;Employees at Netflix&lt;/a&gt; were offended too, and they want Netflix to remove him. That's just as wrong as what China is doing to pressure the NBA about Kanter. One more. The NYT fucked up when they fired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+donald+mcneil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. I think even the assholes who forced him out would agree, as their coverage of Covid is now bullshit, where before McNeil was canned, it was stellar. They had no place trying to control what appears in the NYT. They just work there. It's a platform for speech, I think even the most jaded and cynical reporter at the NYT would agree with that. And just because you get a paycheck from the NYT, that doesn't empower you to control other people's speech, same as China and Netflix. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/10/20/194852.html?title=whenPeopleLoveRss#a194954&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that when Zuck rolls out his new thing next week, we'll find out if the journalists properly understand their role. There will be no fake news yet on their new platform for them to complain about. But I guarantee you it will restrict speech in an effort to appease the journalists. Will they see this, and call bullshit? Or will their vanity and narcissism prevail. Obviously they don't care about our speech, but will they mind being so visible about not honoring it?</description>

I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/10/20/194852.html?title=whenPeopleLoveRss#a194954&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that when Zuck rolls out his new thing next week, we'll find out if the journalists properly understand their role. There will be no fake news yet on their new platform for them to complain about. But I guarantee you it will restrict speech in an effort to appease the journalists. Will they see this, and call bullshit? Or will their vanity and narcissism prevail. Obviously they don't care about our speech, but will they mind being so visible about not honoring it?" created="Thu, 21 Oct 2021 12:35:59 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/10/21/enesKanter.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2021/10/21.html#a123559"/>

			<description>I'm watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;Succession&lt;/a&gt; from the beginning, just to see how all the michegas got started. Seeing the first appearances of all the characters. The special relationship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/succession-roman-gerri-relationship-timeline.html&quot;&gt;Roman and Gerri&lt;/a&gt; is flirtatious from the first meeting. Cousin Greg plays a starring role in the first few episodes. And my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt; is in the show, via proxy, only this version of Denton gets revenge over the rich capitalists who were tormenting him (no spoilers beyond that). Season 3 of Succession started last Sunday, it's just getting better all the time. One of the best TV series ever.</description>

			<title>When people love RSS...</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A rambling &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1450818199805640709&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from this morning that somehow fits together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When people say they love &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, it's not specifically &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; that they love imho, it's the open format, no-lock-in philosophy of software development. If your data can move around the net effortlessly, that's what you love, and that's what you give up when you use a silo. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing you can be sure of, when Zuck announces his new &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Zuckerverse&lt;/span&gt; thing, it'll be locked up and owned by him and his stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He can't pay all those employees if you're free to move out of his universe any time you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There will be lots of eye candy, but he has the only keys to the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of a story. In 1980 i went on vacation to Jamaica. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In the cab from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Montego+Bay,+Jamaica/Negril,+Jamaica/@18.3492139,-78.2606069,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x8eda2a5dfd77e2b1:0xfcd69adb5acc5766!2m2!1d-77.8938895!2d18.4762228!1m5!1m1!1s0x8ed90d8512302c85:0x7bc0f136de355913!2m2!1d-78.3472424!2d18.2683058!3e0&quot;&gt;Montego Bay to Negril&lt;/a&gt;, the driver pointed out a town with lots of new modern-looking shacks. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;He said they were a gift from Cuba.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They had front doors, but no back doors. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Think about it. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been very critical of the way journalism covers Facebook, because they miss the human freedom part of the story, which is just as important as the fake news part. But of course journalism is only concerned with the freedom of journalists, not &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; freedom. In fact journalism would probably prefer if we had no means to speak publicly, if we just got our ideas from them. Only thing is they don't have any ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm absolutely 100 percent sure that when they get a chance to kill Zuck's new invention, they will ignore (or miss) the controls over our freedom in his new world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure it'll be designed to make the journos happy. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Whether they buy it or not, that's another question. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/16/politics/democrats-virginia-mcauliffe-governor/index.html&quot;&gt;Dems might lose&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia because of voter apathy. Right now the big issues are abortion, COVID, climate and fascism. That’s a pretty good set of issues. Run some freaking ads on social media. Never stop campaigning, every day of every year.</description>

			<description>I was pretty sure the Dodgers would crush the Braves, but wow, the Braves are up 2-0. Gotta love it. I'm sorry if you're a Dodgers fan, but I was born in Brooklyn and people such as myself don't forget. I also remember when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mlb-overturns-utley-supension-breaking-tejada-leg-article-1.2554514&quot;&gt;Chase Utley broke the leg&lt;/a&gt; of the Mets shortstop during the 2015 playoffs. I also remember when I sat in scalped seats during the World Series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_World_Series&quot;&gt;in 1988&lt;/a&gt;, in the Dodgers wives' section and they tried to get us thrown out for rooting for the A's who won, btw. I really feel justified in hating the Dodgers, but honestly even if I wasn't, I would still hate them. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>
