			<description>WordPress is in the way. I've avoided saying this because I like Matt, but at some point, it being in the way has to win out. And since when do I not say something because I like the person who made it. It's in the way. I would like to see it move out of the way. I will write a piece soon explaining how they could, and should, do that.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/11/fsdscreen.png&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; I got the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot&quot;&gt;FSD beta&lt;/a&gt; for my Model Y, and of course I tried it out, very carefully. And I can validate that it did try to do the worst thing at the worst possible moment. Luckily I have always been a nervous passenger and I wasn't about to trust a bot this much. I intervened at the first sign of trouble.</description>

			<description>Even though I have far fewer followers on Masto, I get much more engagement there than on Twitter. Has it been productive? Hmmm, not sure about that. But I have hope that it will result in collaboration.</description>

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin&quot;&gt;Banshees&lt;/a&gt; movie is supposed to be a comedy of sorts but it was so painful to watch, not much room for laughter. And I guess I didn't really watch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans&quot;&gt;Fableman&lt;/a&gt; movie, walked out after the opening scene. Spielberg's movies have declined into self-obsession. He thinks we're so freaking stupid and he's so freaking wonderful. Come on man do another &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)&quot;&gt;Jaws&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was a movie. One thing I got from Banshees is that the Irish say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feck&quot;&gt;fecking&lt;/a&gt; and I wonder if it means what I think it means. Anyway, I'm looking for something great to watch, and have fallen back to re-watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. It's been so long since I last watched it that it seems pretty fresh. I long for that kind of story-telling, but they don't seem to make shows like that these days.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesCorbett/status/1613216047598911488&quot;&gt;James Corbett&lt;/a&gt;: Fecking is used a bit like &lt;i&gt;frack&lt;/i&gt; in Battlestar Galactica, with a more limited range of application. And isn't really used in real life the way it is in movie versions of Ireland.</description>

			<title>I still love my Tesla</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I bought my Tesla before people got all crabby about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And no just because you don't like Elon Musk I'm not going to walk away from a $70K purchase of a product that I absolutely adore. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Every time I drive my car I feel like it's a huge privilege to drive it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know of no other product that makes me feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yes I think Musk is an asshole too and a danger to our civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But then I actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html&quot;&gt;warned you all&lt;/a&gt; that someone like Musk could buy Twitter, and you didn't listen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>How you know you're gaslighting</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;You're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; when you tell another person how they feel about something. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If I see myself doing that, I hit the brakes hard, and go for a walk and think about it. And over time I've trained myself not to believe I know how other people are feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Esp people who I only know from reading their emails or blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>A sad truth</title>

			<description>I'd like to have a personal social net that's coffee house size. Play a few tunes, have a couple of drinks, tell a few stories, and come back tomorrow and the night after that. There's a bouncer at the door so if you come in all nasty and shit, we kick your ass out.</description>

			<title>Likes considered harmful?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/&quot;&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://retrodivergent.com/2023/01/07/the-problem-with.html&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; about whether Likes are harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some of my observations from the thread, all in favor of Likes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The Like button on various systems is a way of acknowledging that you saw something and thought it was noteworthy. Since micro.blog doesn't have a Like button, what's the proper way of saying that? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;As a person who writes posts that get zero response here (and not on other systems) I wish people had a less-committed way of saying they saw something I wrote. That would be a little bit of feedback where currently I get none.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;If I see something on Micro.blog that I would Like on another system, I don't comment, I just do nothing, not because I'm bashful or overly quiet, rather because this is a language, and a comment has different meaning from a Like. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;In real life there's all kinds of non-verbal communication. you can nod your head, smile. We've come up with a similar language online, I don't think there's any more meaning in this. We're being human. Not a huge surprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Here's a parallel. My TV doesn't have a brightness control. It's an expensive screen, and I imagine that the designers of the system figured &quot;we have a computer in this that knows how to automatically adjust brightness based on room light.&quot; But it doesn't work properly, I don't know what the problem is, but there are times the TV is useless because you just can't see what's on the screen, because the lack of a brightness control. Maybe if TVs never had brightness controls I wouldn't miss it, but they do in my mind, require one. Same thing here. &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; is something that's part of the language of social media. To try to deny that at this stage is kind of pointless imho.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been in this position myself in the past, trying to buck a larger trend, and the pressure really does get you to support the common way, the sooner you do it, the sooner the pain goes away. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, &quot;considered harmful&quot; is borrowed from a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra&quot;&gt;Edsger Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;goto statement considered harmful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I need it because I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of my development process, all my build scripts run in Frontier, and while they could be converted to JavaScript, they'd be more complicated and it's a lot of work, and it's worth spending $600 to save all that work. Someday I want to do it because I'd like to use Drummer and its built-in scripting language for the same purpose. I learned a lot about why people choose older Macs. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(company)#Sale_to_CBS&quot;&gt;pre-CBS&lt;/a&gt; Fender guitars, which still sell at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Pre-cbs%20Fender%20Guitars&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-153677-346401-4&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=102&amp;keyword=&amp;crlp=632052376936_&amp;MT_ID=&amp;geo_id=&amp;rlsatarget=dsa-1456167871416&amp;adpos=&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=&amp;loc=1023511&amp;poi=&amp;abcId=&amp;cmpgn=18786426719&amp;sitelnk=&amp;adgroupid=144636292002&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr403s3aqhTbcuAgTH_yfHqEEFmps2tzdZFrHidJRllPpY8VuLIH0mcYRoCf2IQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt;, even though Fender sold to CBS in 1965. Maybe Macs peaked? Anyway -- I should get the &quot;new&quot; computer next week, and I'll let you know how it goes. BTW, my main desktop, the one I'm writing this post on, is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/08/macAboutScreen.png&quot;&gt;2017 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I love the machine. I hope it works forever.</description>

I need it because I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; as an integral part of my development process, all my build scripts run in Frontier, and while they could be converted to JavaScript, they'd be more complicated and it's a lot of work, and it's worth spending $600 to save all that work. Someday I want to do it because I'd like to use Drummer and its built-in scripting language for the same purpose. I learned a lot about why people choose older Macs. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_(company)#Sale_to_CBS&quot;&gt;pre-CBS&lt;/a&gt; Fender guitars, which still sell at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Pre-cbs%20Fender%20Guitars&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-153677-346401-4&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=102&amp;keyword=&amp;crlp=632052376936_&amp;MT_ID=&amp;geo_id=&amp;rlsatarget=dsa-1456167871416&amp;adpos=&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=&amp;loc=1023511&amp;poi=&amp;abcId=&amp;cmpgn=18786426719&amp;sitelnk=&amp;adgroupid=144636292002&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr403s3aqhTbcuAgTH_yfHqEEFmps2tzdZFrHidJRllPpY8VuLIH0mcYRoCf2IQAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;premium&lt;/a&gt;, even though Fender sold to CBS in 1965. Maybe Macs peaked? Anyway -- I should get the &quot;new&quot; computer next week, and I'll let you know how it goes. BTW, my main desktop, the one I'm writing this post on, is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/08/macAboutScreen.png&quot;&gt;2017 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I love the machine. I hope it works forever." created="Sun, 08 Jan 2023 15:08:07 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/08/fender.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/01/08.html#a150807"/>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/246&quot;&gt;Braintrust query&lt;/a&gt;: I've got a problem with an app that uses the MySql package in Node running on a Mac. I'm getting a &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17px&quot;&gt;ER_CON_COUNT_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; pretty close to startup. I'm taking the message at face value but it's hard for me to believe it's true that my app is making too many connections because I just doubled the max connections from 100 to 200 and still got the error on the very first query it tried to make. The problem goes away when I reboot the machine, but only for a little while, eventually it starts doing this again. This is in an app that has been running without these kinds of errors for months. I haven't tried running the app yet on another machine, but I'm beginning to think this is a not-resolvable issue. I thought I'd pass it by the SQL gurus that read this blog on how to debug this.</description>

			<title>Ads on Twitter</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The ads on Twitter are better.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Already today I've considered buying something an ad was selling.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I saw an HBO ad for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/01/05.html#a175850&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; I just watched and loved, it reminded me that I loved it.

			<title>Winning Time</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Time:_The_Rise_of_the_Lakers_Dynasty&quot;&gt;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Almost finished with the ten episodes of Season 1 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/winning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty&quot;&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I like it for a bunch of reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reilly&quot;&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt; who plays &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Buss&quot;&gt;Jerry Buss&lt;/a&gt; the new owner of the Lakers when the season starts. He also btw is really good at audiobooks. I'd listen to any book he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=John+C.+Reilly&quot;&gt;narrates&lt;/a&gt;. He's Mr Affability. And perfectly cast for the role of Buss.  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like the style, it's a little weird at first, but it's clever, and they break the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall&quot;&gt;fourth wall&lt;/a&gt; a few times, to good effect. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that the style reminds me of one of my favorite movies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rFx6OFooCs&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, also a sports movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like sports movies/shows. And I especially like basketball. It's my favorite sport.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like the story how &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley&quot;&gt;Pat Reilly&lt;/a&gt; became the coach of the Lakers and led them to dynasty. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like how Kareem became friends with Magic. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that the guy who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Haywood&quot;&gt;Spencer Haywood&lt;/a&gt; is the same actor who played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_Barksdale&quot;&gt;Avon Barksdale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire&quot;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Field&quot;&gt;Sally Field&lt;/a&gt; plays Jerry Buss's mother! She's awesome as always.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like all the actors and roles. That's unusual. With such a huge cast you'd think there would be one impossible to watch character, but no, they're all interesting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I like that they will have lots of potential seasons, next up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson&quot;&gt;Phil Jackson&lt;/a&gt; and how he became the next dynastic coach of the Lakers. And don't forget &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant&quot;&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal&quot;&gt;Shaq&lt;/a&gt; who probably won't show up until Season 3 or 4. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I gave it the highest rating &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fwinning-time-the-rise-of-the-lakers-dynasty&quot;&gt;on Bingeworthy&lt;/a&gt;. It didn't get great reviews. When I finish it, I'll read some of them to see what I missed. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wasn't very entertained with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-menu&quot;&gt;The Menu&lt;/a&gt; on HBO but now I find myself thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film)&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; a lot, not deliberately. Weird. So I watched it again, and on the second viewing it came together.
