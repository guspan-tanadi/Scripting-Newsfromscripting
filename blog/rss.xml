			<description>I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1587794609828159488&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter today documenting how Chrome was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/mangledrssscreen.jpeg?nodialog&quot;&gt;mangling&lt;/a&gt; RSS feeds, had been for many years. I didn't know this was Google's plug-in. As far as I knew this was the way Chrome shipped. It's possible I installed it myself, it would have had to be a long time ago. But I just right-clicked on the XML icon in the browser's chrome and chose to uninstall it, and I viewed an RSS feed and it came out &quot;literal&quot; -- here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/02/rssInChrome.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. All that wasted time. I didn't need to write the xmlviewer app. Oy. I wonder what else I am missing.</description>

			<title>Twitter Web Services</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter as a development platform is an incredible product, worth imho more than the user-facing platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No competition among cloud vendors (AWS, Google, MS, DO), strong well-burned-in API and the huge potential of a world-scale notification network that also has a great simple UI. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Add some services onto that like storage, and you really have something amazing. Huge potential.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/&quot;&gt;FeedLand&lt;/a&gt; has been great for me because I don't have to beg Google Reader (or its successors) to support a feature in RSS I want to try out. I just do it. And I can support it in my blog or any of my content-generating tools. This is how you bootstrap new standards.</description>

Previously I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;xmlviewer&lt;/a&gt; app. Mostly because browsers mangle XML text. For some reason they don't mind displaying &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.json&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; literally. (This may account for why some developers don't like XML.  Anyway, there's a lot more information about the feed on the FeedLand page, and it's also set up so that if you are logged in, you can subscribe with one click. And of course I don't mind if you do. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>
