			<description>I'm so Alexa-addicted that I talk to her in places she isn't. Makes me wonder three things. 1. Why is there no Alexa with a built-in battery? (Yes I know others make them, I bought one, but it sucked and I returned it). 2. How long before there's an Alexa implant? 3. When will Alexa start teaching Peloton classes?</description>

			<description>Why shouldn't we resume normal life while Covid is raging. It's the norm for our species. Ignore oncoming calamities. Fall back to religion. Put on blinders. In a way it makes sense. There's nothing any of us can do. Others seem to have made their choice. I'm just one person.</description>

			<title>The source namespace</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been almost 20 years since &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; was done. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I kept using RSS in my software. And when I wanted to add something to the format, I did what the spec asked of us -- I used a namespace. I just used one and put everything I added into it. It's called the source namespace. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most of the items in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt; can be grouped into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Nice things to have, conveniences. Connect a feed to a social network, view the build date in the local time of the feed. Provide the full URL of an item if the &amp;lt;link&gt; value is a shortened URL.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Experiments that didn't go anywhere (at least not yet). A way of linking an individual feed to its archive so you can create a history of your feeds. The idea of a &lt;i&gt;Likes&lt;/i&gt; server. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Providing the source code for an item, acknowledging that people sometimes use tools to generate HTML code in the &amp;lt;description&gt; element of an item. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The most important group is the last one, and it's what the namespace is named after. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you're editing a post in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; editor. You'd include the encoded HTML in the &amp;lt;description&gt; element of the item, and the Markdown source that generated the item in the &amp;lt;source:markdown&gt; element. That way if the feed reader understood Markdown it could use that to generate the text it displays. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There is also a &amp;lt;source:outline&gt; element that does the same thing if you used an outliner to write the post. In that case the structure maps directly onto OPML. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Caveat -- there may be other elements that I haven't documented. When discovered they will be documented. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Drummer is here now</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people tell me they wish they could try &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/more11c.html&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; because they hear such nice things about it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But MORE was made in the 1980s on machines that had limited memory, storage and networking. And it was a long long time ago and software has progressed a lot since then.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they can use the outliner I made in 2021. I know it doesn't have all the features MORE had, but it has a lot of stuff MORE didn't. It's like saying (with proper humility) that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Road&quot;&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt; doesn't include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfSQkZuIx84&quot;&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLRiGX3L-kw&quot;&gt;Lady Madonna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; is here now.

			<title>Cleaning up the feeds</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's not really a secret that I'm working on a new feed reader. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's part of a top-to-bottom review of the feed ecosystem, almost 20 years after &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So here's where we're at in 2022: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Feeds still work, that's the good news. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The bad news is that feeds have same junk in them as web pages. Spyware. Advertising. Stuff that's meant to call your attention to their stuff, and take it away from the other stuff. The problem is this -- as a reader I want these things to calm down and just let me skim, to decide what I want to read. That's the design, that's how feeds were meant to work, imho. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So the question is what to do about the noise? Here's the plan. As with all my previous aggregators, I'm stripping the markup to provide a quiet reading environment. But I'm putting back the features I want, linking, bold and italic, by allowing the feed to provide the Markdown source of the post.

I think an elegant solution. One of the nice things about Markdown is it lets through the stuff we want, and doesn't let through the stuff we don't. Right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Basically the feeds can keep doing what they want, no problem -- but we'll just take the text. And if they want to add a link that we'll see, they can use Markdown. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Live Like An American</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Some people have an idea that you should &quot;live like an American&quot; as if there is such a thing. But that seems to be what we're arguing about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are some basically dishonest people who act like living like an American means Be Like Me. And some of the things about them are impossible for other people to be like. If being like an American means white, that let's out a lot of people. Be Christian. I'm not that, and can't pretend I am, so that let's me out. The idea of how an American lives is actually very narrow, and there probably isn't a single person anywhere that fits in. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's deep confusion about the meaning of life. They pretend to know the answer, it means Live Like An American and you're doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's a picture of some of those people, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Yes I know I'm judging them, fine -- they judge everyone else, so imho it's fair. They either bristle with anger or badly fake feelings of regret. To them that's what it means to Live Like An American. All of it an imitation of living. I honestly have no idea what it's like to be one of those people, what their inner life must be like, what a hell it must be. That's how I imagine it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Outliners I have loved</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tfthacker started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1529930101470773272&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter where he lists all the outliners he's used starting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.scripting.com/more11c.html&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The first one was a program editor I did on Unix for C programmers in 1977. I started with the source for a Unix line-oriented editor called YALOE and added dive and surface commands (left and right square brackets) for navigating the hierarchy, and commands to restructure the outline. I'm not sure this app even had a name. It had a language parser built in, so it could take bits of code and turn it into an outline structure. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I showed the app to some of my friends who were not programmers, one of them asked if they could use it, which set me off in a different direction, an outliner that had nothing to do with programming. The result was High Files, which also had a simple tabular database. Outlines could be cells in a database table, and tables could be contained within outlines. When I had that running, I moved from Madison to Mountain View, and did a deal with Personal Software for the outliner. It was hard to fit that app into 64K on an Apple II, but eventually we did, by then they had a big hit in VisiCalc, and they gave me back the product, and a settlement, and I spent the next few years doing online bulletin-board software. I was totally fascinated with using computer as networking tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is pretty well told in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;Outliners &amp; Programming&lt;/a&gt; piece, up until I started work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, which is a scripting environment build around an object database, and where everything is an outline. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For more info see &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.com/&quot;&gt;outliners.com&lt;/a&gt;, where I've archived these apps. Hopefully some of the code is still runnable. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My latest outliner is &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, which is the outliner I use today for writing my blog and docs. For writing code I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a distribution of Frontier designed to boot up as an outliner. I can't recommend it unfortunately because it only runs on old versions of the Mac OS. It was also available on Windows, not sure if that version still works, probably like the Mac version, it does, only if you have an older version of Windows around.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I plan to bring the code-management features in the OPML Editor to Drummer, at which point I will be able to do everything on Linux, which I look forward to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/05/25.html#a161417&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that I am irony-deficient. It's kind of a joke, but it's also the truth, as all good jokes are. You could say something ridiculous, intending it to be humorous, but I won't get it. I take things at face value. That's why I find April Fools so disturbing. But if you do it a lot I'll be tuned in, and you'll never get me again. I think it's a good thing to be irony-deficient btw. The universe is amazing and amazing things actually happen all the time. Being ID just means you have an open mind.</description>

No one of our lives is important in the bigger context. Stopping this juggernaut of civilization is something even the richest megabillionaire sad to say can't influence very much. We all die.

Or maybe always have a couple of hours downloaded. So when I'm out and about, maybe on my bike or driving around, I can listen to music uninterrupted. My iPhone has huge amounts of available memory, can't think of a better use of that space than music that's just for me. I hope there's a setting for this. It could just be a checkbox. Or even better, a preference that says how much memory it can use to cache stuff.</description>

			<description>I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-South-Won-Civil-War/dp/0190900903&quot;&gt;How the South Won the Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and it was somewhat of a disappointment. Obviously it's a college textbook, because it recites facts, names and dates, ad nauseum, things that are probably required by curricula (just guessing), and there isn't much in the book that I didn't already know. I was expecting something that truly lived up to the title, that explained why were still living with slavery today, but that isn't what the book is about. I think it's a provocative title for a pretty ordinary American history book. My next book is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson-ebook/dp/B084FLWDQG&quot;&gt;Caste&lt;/a&gt; (*) and so far am getting a lot out of it. Will report.</description>

			<description>In the previous post the (*) is where I knocked over a large full glass of ice coffee on my desk, the one with all my hard disks. I did something like this a few weeks ago with a glass of ice water. When this happens I quickly mobilize, moving everything of value away from the puddle. There were no towels nearby so I ran to the bedroom and got an old t-shirt that I could sacrifice, ran back and quickly sopped up the puddle and all the random bits of coffee and ice I could find. Now there's dried coffee on my keyboard and my mouse. But everything still seems to work. I went downstairs and made another tall glass of ice coffee, and hopefully this one will end up not on computer hardware and my desk, but rather fueling a day of creativity. This is a blog, therefore I am obligated to tell you, dear reader, about these events.</description>

			<description>Ending Roe v Wade will end the United States. The world is built around reproductive freedom, led by the United States. A country that repeals such a fundamental right no longer is, imho, the United States. Where we go from there I don't know. But if we're going to have a civil war, reproductive freedom would be a good cause.</description>

			<description>I am a JavaScript programmer. I've learned to stack my code via indentation when it could all be done more simply the way you do it in most other languages. It's provable. I can never understand why developers who have worked on the language itself aren't as bothered by this as I am. I realized there might be one difference, something that's been a foundation for all my programming work -- before I was a programmer, I was a math major. In math, you're always looking for broader and simpler statements that you can derive from more narrower and more complicated truths. In a sense that's what math is. So perhaps the language designers of JavaScript didn't study math? This has been a vexing puzzle for me ever since I moved into JavaScript. Not how to simplify JS, that's clear -- rather why don't other people see it, or if they do why don't they fix it?</description>

Unless you understand how the human mind works, how can you market something to humans? It's like becoming a driver, you have to learn what all the controls do. And how products fit into people's minds is one of the biggest controls, and you'd be surprised how not-different people's minds are when it comes to positioning. An example. An ad I saw on Facebook recently for &lt;a href=&quot;https://freshcleantees.com/&quot;&gt;T-shirts&lt;/a&gt; of all things. How many brands of T-shirts can you think of? Probably not too many, but you know there are a lot of them. None have any particular meaning. But what about a T-shirt that Looks Good On You? That's a position. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgl-LFrlPw&amp;t=228s&quot;&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; that no one, so far, is positioned on. Maybe the ladder doesn't exist? Positioning has lots of examples of those. But sometimes it does, and it's huge. Think of all the brands that defined new ladders. Like Starbucks. Tesla. Nike. Coca Cola. There was coffee before Starbucks and cars, shoes and cold drinks before these brands carved out new segments of these markets and because they were first in the prospects' minds, they own them, until they throw away their positioning, which many products do, foolishly, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_line_extension&quot;&gt;line extension&lt;/a&gt;. Heinz is a company that does not understand positioning and is as a result destroying their #1 brand. Think about Heinz. What does the name mean to you? Ketchup, right? Then, recently they decided there are lots of &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; ketchups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heinz.com/products/0000000117&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; at all of them! And they named them all Heinz. Oy. I bet when you add the sales of all the different Heinz ketchups, it's less than standard good old Heinz ketchup. Go to the grocery store, look for ketchup and try to find the Heinz ketchup you grew up with. Good luck!  Line extension is a bad idea. If you own the top spot on a ladder, don't do line extension. You'll lose out to someone who specializes in what you used to own. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=positioning&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;So much to say&lt;/a&gt; about this.</description>

			<description>One my favorite things to tweet is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1527786609491464192&quot;&gt;there are No Nets fans&lt;/a&gt;, and wait for a Nets fan to show up and flame me. It never happens. I think even the Clippers must have some fans in NYC, or the Expos, but I can honestly say I've never met a Nets fan.</description>

Collins plays on our assumption that grandmothers who appear kindly are more likely to be fooled than shifty. She milks that for all it's worth. Obviously if someone rises to her level of the Republican Party, a multi-term senator from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states&quot;&gt;blue state&lt;/a&gt;, her reliable vote for Republican atrocities gets her a lot of deference, and we know it.</description>

			<description>One of the most important principles in programming is that you want to expose problems in code when you're working on it. The more time between when you did the work and when you find the problem, the more impossible it's going to be to implement a good fix. It's analogous to finding a flaw in the design of something buried under the foundation of a skyscraper, long after the whole building has been constructed.</description>
