			<description>Earlier this month I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/04/174604.html?title=theLostAppsOfThe80s&quot;&gt;The Lost Apps of the 80s&lt;/a&gt;, wondering where the depth of early PC writing tools went. Also spreadsheets, databases, graphics programs. There were huge numbers of them. The reason imho is Microsoft and not just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars&quot;&gt;Browser Wars&lt;/a&gt; which threw all of software into chaos for a number of years. There's another reason, and it might have happened even if the web hadn't come along. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office&quot;&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;. So quickly I forgot. It used to be that a word processor cost $495 as did a database, spreadsheet, and various other software. When you added up the retail prices it could easily come to $2000. Then one day, Microsoft bundled &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word&quot;&gt;Word&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel&quot;&gt;Excel&lt;/a&gt; and a few other apps, for the price of a single productivity app. And over the years, they added more software to the bundle. This alone might have reduced the productiving software business to one vendor. The competitors couldn't afford to do what Microsoft did, they didn't have the royalties from the OS to support their price-cutting in apps. So that's another theory on where the apps went. Today, that's no excuse. Writing tools would have a different purpose today, writing for the network, rather than for printing. Different requirements.</description>

			<description>I just found a 1991 piece by Steven Levy at MacWorld about Frontier, which was still in development at the time. Really interesting read because now, only 30 years later (heh), I'm doing a smaller version of the same idea, not on the Mac but on the open web, once again using standard protocols to connect apps. It starts on page 51 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://vintageapple.org/macworld/pdf/MacWorld_9108_August_1991.pdf&quot;&gt;this PDF&lt;/a&gt; of the August 1991 MacWorld. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/page51.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the first page.</description>

			<description>What neither Levy or I understood, at the same time in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee was working on the world wide web. Frontier's importance in bootstrapping the web as a content management platform, via blogging, RSS and podcasting, was where the real growth would come. It would require a pivot, of course. The Mac &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; entering middle age, as Levy postulated. But a new shiny thing that worked really well with the Mac was coming along and would soon change everything. The same vacuum that existed on the Mac at the time, now exists on the web. There is no simple-enough scripting language designed for power users to integrate the functionality of many and disparate apps. Why do I like this so much? I guess I'm just a pipes and wires kind of guy. And I think lots of new media will emerge from the ecosystem we'll create here.</description>

			<description>Embarrassing mistake. Yesterday, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/10/142746.html?title=shouldNetflixHaveASchedule&quot;&gt;longish piece&lt;/a&gt; about bingewatching, I gave Kazuo Ishiguro credit for writing the novel Howard’s End.  He actually wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day&quot;&gt;Remains of the Day&lt;/a&gt;. There is a connection. Both were made into movies starring &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson&quot;&gt;Emma Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins&quot;&gt;Anthony Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;. I corrected the piece, but here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/theError.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the error. BTW, interestingly, I received an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/11/netflixemail.png&quot;&gt;email from Netflix&lt;/a&gt; last night suggesting I watch Howard's End. Is it a coincidence, or does their algorithm read my blog? That would be amazing if it did. (I'm sure it doesn't but it's an incredible source about my interests.)</description>

			<description>BTW, for people who are trying outliners for the first time, may I suggest my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt;. It's browser-based, easy to use, has lots of features, isn't world-encompassing, just a way to make lists, plan stuff, think into your computer screen. It's free to use, no gotchas, and the outlines are in a standard format, and there's a command to download all your work to your local system, for backup or to use in another outliner. So there's absolutely no lock-in. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>A thread re NYT and the tech web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1380915375383138311&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from my Twitter account..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was having a discussion with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; about the difference between online media brought to us by the tech industry, and the world of the NYT and other journalism orgs. Here's a concise version.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The NYT et al present packaged stories and opinion. The presenters are vetted, conform to standards that are understood, but not well documented. (This is all my opinion btw.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The online tech media presents largely unpackaged stories, with little or no vetting, and the standards are hard to implement because the systems are so vast.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They're opposites. Night and day. And in conflict, but imho they need not be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've long felt we need hybrids. Probably unknown to most people at the NYT, there was a time, between 2002 and 2005, or so -- when I personally worked with them on this stuff. So I had a strong opinion about what they should do. They did half of what I asked, and that was pretty bold, and very successful. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The other half they didn't do. It would have brought a lot more voices into the NYT, but they would have been vetted, by the reporters of the NYT, simply by quoting them in a NYT piece. So they couldn't avoid the vetting if their stories had sources. And the thought was that anyone who is a source for the NYT is worth listening to and could use a platform. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What would have come out of it is something like what Substack is today. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know how that experiment would have turned out, but I believed in the idea. Unfortunately it was immediately turned down. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My main contact at the NYT at the time was Martin Nisenholtz, so you can confirm this with him if you like. The first half of the deal resulted in the RSS standard for distributing news. Another little-known fact, imho RSS would have failed without the support from the NYT. Their trust in my small company was amazing, and we took good care of their brand and rep in the wild world of the web. This was in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: There's also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2001/01.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of how we found the cache of NYT syndicated content. That's what led to the deal we made a year later for RSS. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Should Netflix have a schedule?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I decided to cut the cord and turn off the TV service from my cable provider, Spectrum. I returned my settop box, which I had never actually installed, because I used their Roku app instead. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I subscribed to YouTube TV so I could watch news and some sports. It concerned me that they didn't have MSG or SNY for the Knicks and Mets, but there wasn't much sports last year anyway, with the pandemic and lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I went without HBO because I was getting that from Spectrum, and I binged on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and a few other services from time to time, but those were the main ones. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then the Knicks season started. I could see from the highlights and news that this season they were actually an exciting team, very unusual, I wanted to watch, so I set out on a lengthy search, because the information out there is so poor, only to learn that there is literally no way to get MSG and SNY, the broadcasters of Knicks and Mets games, without Spectrum. The local sports teams are not available to cable-cutters, at least not where I live. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As I wrote about this on my blog, I got lots of emails saying that this service or that would give me what I wanted. I even tried using Spectrum's &quot;streaming&quot; service, which you can order online, but none of them had the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So I decided to undo the grand cable-cutting experiment, called Spectrum and got back on board with the cable TV service, got a new settop box, which will never be unpacked and will stay in a closet, and happily watched the Knicks during this very interesting, exciting and fun season. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But this piece is about HBO, not the Knicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now as a Spectrum user, I can use the HBO Max app. I've paid to access it. And at the same time, HBO appears in the Listings in the Spectrum app. So I added them to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/10/spectrumListing.png&quot;&gt;favorites&lt;/a&gt;. So now when I have to choose between something to watch, HBO is one of the choices. And the big difference here is that they pick what to offer me, just like the old days. They have a schedule. And guess what, I watch a lot more HBO this way than I did when I have full choice over what to watch through the streaming app. This is the point of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An example. Last night just before Ari Melber comes on at 6PM, I got bored with the usual stuff on CNN and MSNBC, so I looked around, and saw that The Godfather had just started. I switched to it, and there's Don Corleone sitting behind his desk with the cat in his lap, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6LKszIrDzo&quot;&gt;listening to Bonasera&lt;/a&gt;, the undertaker, completely blowing his pitch to the Don. It's a riveting scene. So much to watch. The performance of it. Comparing it to the boring plays they act out on CNN, for months, is ridiculous. One is a masterpiece, the other is completely lost, worthless, not even good for passing the time while playing games on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, I watched The Godfather all the way to the end. I didn't get up once. It was the best couple of hours I had spent on entertainment in years.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Browsing on HBO Max, I would never think to click on The Godfather as I'm bored looking for something to watch. I think other people have observed this too. Most of my time on these apps is spent looking for something to watch, as opposed to watching.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The idea of scheduled broadcasts is actually very appealing, to my surprise! I thought for sure the revolution was permanent, that we would always be programming our TV-watching experience for ourselves once we had the chance. But there are real problems with that approach. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;How do I know if something is good? I have no idea. And to find out, I have to search for the title on Metacritic, see the total score, and then skim the reviews. A lot of typing and waiting and reading, so I don't do it very often. Much faster just to go on to the next one. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I might have heard of a show or movie I want to watch, but I have no idea if it's playing somewhere I can access. For example, I was looking for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_(film)&quot;&gt;Remains of the Day&lt;/a&gt;, because the story was written by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Ishiguro&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/972841445/klara-and-the-sun-is-a-masterpiece-about-life-love-and-mortality&quot;&gt;book I had just read&lt;/a&gt; and loved. Amazon has a big advantage here, you can get almost everything, but mostly they are not included in the video bundle, so you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remains-Day-Anthony-Hopkins/dp/B00BZBDMWQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=remains+of+the+day&amp;qid=1618151573&amp;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;pay extra&lt;/a&gt;. I figure I'm already paying enough to all the streaming services, I should watch something that's included, and eventually Howard's End will show up.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I guess I'll pretty much always watch The Godfather, Babe or Kill Bill 2 when given a chance to. There are actually a lot of movies like that. And now, unlike the past, there are no commercials, and they leave the sex and violence in. And the Knicks, which I watched instead of Maddow, oy! What a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/rj-barrett-doesnt-blink-in-clutch-knicks-moment/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;. The ups and downs, tragedy and heroic play, the back-stories, the history -- all in just an hour. MSNBC, comparitively, is transparently nothing. The best they have is a powerless Congressperson who is ridiculously and obviously corrupt and popular (maybe) on Fox who has been caught. Nothing is at stake. They can't explain why anyone should care. They need a new purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

With the filibuster in place the only power he has is to keep the filibuster. If he sticks with that he might as well switch parties now. However, if Biden and the Dems sold the voting plan that the Repubs will certainly block, if 90 percent of West Virginians supported the reforms, I would imagine that Manchin &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; change his mind. It all comes back to the same thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/07/142155.html?title=theCampaignNeverStops&quot;&gt;The campaign never stops&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<title>A Drummer example</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/23.html#a133813&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; script that lists the earlierst Twitter users in an outline.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's the script:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var flfirst = true;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.insert (&quot;Early Twitter signups&quot;, down);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;for (var i = 12; i &lt; 25; i++) {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var name = twitter.getScreenname (i);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.insert (name, (flfirst) ? &quot;right&quot; : &quot;down&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;flfirst = false;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;op.go (left, 1);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The list it generates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/09/twitterUsersList.png&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the script works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It inserts a headline in the current outline, &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt; from the bar cursor headline, with the text &quot;Early Twitter signups.&quot;   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Then it loops of users whose ids are 12 to 24. I picked 12 because I had figured out from an earlier script that it was the first-listed user. And 24 is a random value I picked out of thin air. ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;For each user, it calls the Drummer verb twitter.getScreenname, which takes one parameter, the id of the user whose name you want. Then it inserts the name either to the right or down from the cursor depending on whether this is the first user we're inserting. That's how &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/op/insert&quot;&gt;op.insert&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend from Frontier, works. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When it's done looping, it moves the cursor to the left, onto the &quot;Early Twitter signups&quot; headline we created. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It leaves the list expanded. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The killer feature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's so humble you might actually miss it. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even though the script makes a dozen asynchronous calls to Twitter, it's written as if it were synchronous. No weird code structures, you just write it as you think of it, and the system translates it into the complicated stuff, for you. Do I have to explain why this is good? Any time you can let the computer do the complex stuff for you is time you save, and errors you don't make. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>After watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03.html#a131856&quot;&gt;The Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt;, I've listened to the album a few times, from beginning to end. They said it's a concept album, but it isn't really. There are four songs that are in keeping with the Sgt Pepper theme, but the rest are Beatles songs. A few that could have been from the pre-Pepper Beatles. But the album made another statement that did mark a turning point: We're going to try new ideas. We're really going to do it, not just talk about it. We're going to use the remarkable place we're in to innovate. Further, this isn't about fame or wealth, it's about creativity, human expression. For the rest of their careers, as a group and individuals, they continued to try new ideas. And they inspired a generation of us to believe in our own ingenuity as much as any tech hero did, more I think (though I wasn't inspired by them, I was of them). The beauty of Pepper is the lives of the people who created it and their ability to influence.</description>

			<title>The. Campaign. Never. Stops.</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dave's intro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We used to have systems in blogging that better-enabled discourse like what's going on between &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; and myself. Primitive stuff like permalinks, which nowadays would seem like a huge innovation.  Interestingly, we're talking about making the web a better communication system for writers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, when blogging was new, when we had an idea like this, I could just write the software and post an upgrade. Even if JN wasn't using my software, the people who made the software he used would hear about it, and fairly quickly would match the feature. Who knows why, but I'd bet it was mostly the competitive impulse. There's Dave adding a feature for a user, we'd better add it too. But the writers' web doesn't work like that any more. We have to try to get the attention of young companies with billion dollar valuations, running a rocket ship three  feet off the ground. Even a small bump could blow them up. Believe me I know what it's like, somewhat. Been there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, JN responded to my post with a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/tuesday-6-april-2021-2/33463/&quot;&gt;on his blog&lt;/a&gt;, and I wish I could point to it, but his software doesn't have permalinks, so I'll just reproduce it here. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Email from John Naughton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/06/150554.html?title=copypastetopublish&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;. Funny coincidence: I was about to write to you about the email exchange you’ve embarked on with Ray Ozzie, but that can wait for another day. For now, I just wanted to say that I’m with you all the way in your view that the formulaic editing tools offered by platforms like Blogger, WordPress, Medium, Substack et al are, clumsy and restrictive to use. And I wholeheartedly agree that writers should be able to use whatever tool they find best for them, and that publishing platforms should make it easy to upload text and implement whatever formatting is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My own journey has taken me about 90% of the way towards that. I decided years ago that from henceforth everything I wrote would be composed as ASCII text rather than in a proprietary format (e.g. Microsoft Word) and stored as such. So I started doing that, relying on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to transform my text into pdf, Word, LaTex or whatever. (In doing that, I was of course harking back to when I first started writing on a Unix time-shared machine, producing plain marked-up text which was then fed into troff to produce beautifully typeset copy.) When John Gruber and Aaron Swartz (RIP) came up with Markdown in 2004 as a lightweight way of marking-up text, I adopted that. And eventually, thanks to Quentin I found a writing app that worked for me — &lt;a href=&quot;https://ulysses.app/&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; — and have used that ever since. Once WordPress started to accept Markdown text, all my blog posts (except the daily Substack version of the blog) have been written that way. Ulysses will also spit out a version of any text I write in a variety of proprietary formats and so looks like being the only writing tool I will need from now until I keel over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, to your point that “Basically, it should be possible to hook your writing tool directly to both WordPress and Substack”… It turns out that Ulysses eventually cracked the WordPress route, and so I can now hit a button and have it immediately uploaded to, and formatted on, &lt;a href=&quot;https://memex.naughtons.org/&quot;&gt;Memex 1.1&lt;/a&gt;. The HTML looks a bit verbose and clunky, but it renders just fine. And it’s efficient and quick. So getting Substack to create an API that enables Ulysses to upload as easily would that I would be nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nearly, but not quite — which is why I really appreciate your feature request to Substack to also enable paragraph-level permalinks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Keep well.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;John&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FInal notes from Dave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, note to self, I have to make it so that when people copy the text of my posts, the # permalinks don't get copied. Every time JN quotes me I see them there, and it makes me cry because I work so hard on the words and the pound signs just do not belong there! Oy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also, to John, I'd love to hear what you say re my conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/04/174604.html?title=theLostAppsOfThe80s&quot;&gt;Ray&lt;/a&gt;. We'll figure out how to make this work. Hosting a salon with great minds such as yourself and Ray is something I love to do. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was asked if I know that tech companies hate the web, and asking them to help the web is stupid. I can't defend that, it might be stupid, who knows. But it isn't taking a lot of time, and in talking about wanting to rekindle the writing tools category, I'm not just talking to the platform devs, I'm also talking to users, who may not have realized that they don't have to become copypaste machines just to have a newsletter, or cross-post to Facebook. There's no technical barrier. And if they wanted to use their favorite editor to write blog posts or newsletters, because they now understand that it's possible, that would create pressure for tech companies to do it. Now the big ones wouldn't, at first, but one of the also-rans might, as a way to get users to use their service. And if the feature is as sexy as I believe it is, they &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; get more users, and in doing so might attract the other, bigger companies, to do it too. Also there are some idealists around, believe it or not, some tech founders who believe in the web, and even read this blog, and might respond to a friendly nudge. Anyway, what's the difference. It gives me pleasure to stand up for the web, and hope. I think the world can work better, and if I can help, you bet I'm going to say something.</description>

			<description>This story isn't really about George O'Connor (a made-up name), it's about something else. Here's the story. Many years ago I was at a party at CES, only people with connections were invited. So you could walk around this big ballroom and every few minutes you'd run into someone you know from a long time ago. In this case I ran into George, a person I knew from the early Mac days because he worked at Anderson (also a made-up name), one of the networking hardware companies of the Mac. A respected company, and George was well-thought-of. But I had another connection to him, his sister had worked for my company, a few years before, and I wanted to ask how she was doing and to say hi for me. George started talking after I said hello, and he said he couldn't help get me into TED. He was a producer there, and presumably everyone in the room was hitting him up for tickets, I guess he was tired of it. I didn't want to go to TED, and I also didn't hold this against George. I think I see this all the time, but rarely is it so open as it was at that party. People assume you want something from them, when you just wanted to say hi because you have good memories of them. It's the flipside of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/theguyatthegasstation/&quot;&gt;story I wrote in 2013&lt;/a&gt; about a clerk at a gas station having a bad day.</description>

			<title>Copy/paste-to-publish</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing this email to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jjn1&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; re his recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Memex&lt;/a&gt; daily posts, but I thought both of us being public writers, I should just post it here and send a pointer. So here goes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;John, I've been following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/monday-5-april-2021&quot;&gt;story of the strange URLs&lt;/a&gt; from your Substack newsletter. I also appreciated your telling how you produce your newsletter by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/06/naughtonWorkflow.png&quot;&gt;copy/pasting&lt;/a&gt; from WordPress into Substack. I bet 90 percent of Substack's text comes in this way. And that's what this letter is about. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I've been asking them to automate that part for you via an API or RSS, or whatever they specify, to remove the copy/paste step from your publication workflow. I am deliberately being a squeaky wheel, hoping that writers who use Substack will join in.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Basically, it should be possible to hook your writing tool directly to both WordPress and Substack.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I would have used Substack myself if it weren't for this limit. As a writer, I want to eliminate steps, to make my writing more effortless. Publishing an idea takes too many steps, as a result, a lot of ideas don't get out. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to have a better flow on the web as a writer, and I think if other writers knew what was possible they'd want it too, and hopefully they would write about it. You wrote about it yesterday! ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;JN, writers have a lot more power imho than they think. Esp in the early days of a service like Substack. They are listening to you. They know they depend on you. If enough writers wanted a feature, they would implement it. That's how development works. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Please consider writing something yourself about eliminating copy/paste-to-publish step. There's a lot of power trapped in that limit. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Dave&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;PS: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1379453137963122688&quot;&gt;feature request&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink&quot;&gt;permalinks&lt;/a&gt; in Substack.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why is it interesting to think about what became of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/04/174604.html?title=theLostAppsOfThe80s&quot;&gt;Apps of the 80s&lt;/a&gt; -- because imho we still need what they do. I want to use one writing tool, the perfect one for me, and flow the text through various services. We know how to. Rather than just accept more and more editors, let's build interfaces that allow choice. APIs. We know how to do it. We just need one or two products to demo the concept and define the interfaces. Any blogging tool or newsletter mailer could take the next step.</description>

			<description>I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chia.net/&quot;&gt;Chia&lt;/a&gt; today. Sounds like it's a crypto currency, but what makes it interesting is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Cohen&quot;&gt;Bram Cohen&lt;/a&gt; is involved, and he's the guy who brought us &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;, and that works pretty well, and seemed really wild when it first came out.</description>

			<title>The lost apps of the 80s</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you know I've been asking a question pretty persistently -- where did the apps go? Specifically where did the writing tools go? Before the web, there was a deep market for software writing tools, all kinds of word processors, text editors, desktop publishing tools, even spreadsheets and database software were used to write. Yet few of those tools transitioned to the web. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the web, we thought it was very innovative for browser-based apps to create and write for public websites, which eventually became blogs, entirely through web forms in the browers. It was such a miracle, look at how easy it is! -- that we overlooked that as a writing tool, the web browser is pretty awful. We know how to do it so much better! Why didn't we? Why don't we do it now?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introducing Ray Ozzie...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've been having an email conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Ozzie&quot;&gt;Ray Ozzie&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow productivity tools developer from the 80s. We never worked together but we worked with people who worked together. He did several products you might be familiar with. Lotus Symphony which was the height of the &quot;integrated software&quot; period in the mid-80s, and the corporate groupware product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.com/article/2431837/7-things-it-managers-should-know-about-lotus-notes.html&quot;&gt;Lotus Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Since then he has been CTO of Microsoft, and has founded several successful startups. He was recently honored as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://computerhistory.org/events/building-a-better-world-through-tech-for-collaboration/&quot;&gt;fellow&lt;/a&gt; of the Computer History Museum. I asked if I could include some of his comments in a blog post here, and he agreed. I didn't do any editing, his words appear exactly as he typed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dave (me) kicks it off...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There used to be, as you know, a deep market for tools for writers. Highly customizable products, or products with UIs with character, people had something they don't have now -- choice. And that made it competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, we don't have choice. If I want to write on Facebook, I have to use their awful buggy editor. If I want a Substack newsletter or a Medium blog, or whatever -- I have to use their editors, which vary in quality, but none of them would have stood a chance in the 80s software market.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We could argue how this happened, but there's no question that it did happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also there should be networked spreadsheets. And since it's 40 years later, there should be products we never imagined in the 80s. They aren't there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the starting point. I'm not saying we should fix it, I don't want to take that on, but I want to focus the tech world on the fact that this happened. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now Ray opines on the lost apps of the 80s...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I agree wholeheartedly that there are things that we were incredibly fortunate to have experienced, and they seem to be gone.  Seemingly forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;ThinkTank and outliners in general is one of them.  I don’t understand this because I think there are many outliner-type people out there who would enjoy them, but because they never became mainstream they aren’t being given a chance to be mainstream once again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also think that there were calendar-centric PIM-centric extensions to the outlining concept that were in Agenda that were worth saving; they’re gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pito Salas’s spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/pito-s-blog/why-improv-didnt-succeed-3e06a43acf73&quot;&gt;Improv&lt;/a&gt; had incredible things – far more than just the pivot table – and yet the world is now deprived because the world seems comfortable with a simpler concept of a spreadsheet.  And yes, networked spreadsheets of one form or another would be amazing – especially given that many real-world spreadsheet scenarios involve periodic consolidation/roll-up involving multiple people and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A VC friend told me several years ago that it was incredible that even though there is now a wave of “low code” tools such as Airtable, that there is nothing out there with the power and usability that Lotus Notes had back-in-the-day.  And so we cobble together many tools, ignoring the fact that there was a better answer that we’ve chosen to discard.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you said, I can’t fix it.  I can’t even explain it.  I’ve put an incredible amount of energy and love into products that have commercially failed, and it has made me a bit more cautious.  I’m fortunate that I don’t tend to descend into cynicism, but it remains perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As a writer and an analyst, I do think this would be a great topic to explore: why have so many great ideas been discarded?  Even if their initial implementation was destined never to withstand the test of time, why do we choose to ignore those aspects that were good?  In an internet that was supposed to allow us to have ‘bubbles’ of special interest groups, why haven’t we created a thriving environment that might support the creation and maintenance of bespoke power tools for creativity and productivity?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's where I'd like to leave it for now, there will be more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: I wrote my side of the conversation in GMail. A pretty standard browser-based text browser and editor. In Chrome on my Mac. I don't know what email app Ray used. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PPS: There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26692308&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about this piece on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Yes, journalism is a thing</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03.html#a131835&quot;&gt;Journalism is a thing&lt;/a&gt;, a whole, it makes sense to talk about in the way I talk about it. I don't need a lecture at this level, although people often do it for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I read a piece recently somewhere, I forget where, that said people who think rapid universal change can't take place -- they aren't paying attention. The example they cited was that not too long ago people were smoking everywhere. Now there are severe limits on where you can smoke, and people seem to respect the limits. We made a decision as a society to change our behavior and it happened quickly. And you could have made the same kinds of arguments, that there is no such thing as a &quot;smoker&quot; -- but there was. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It also happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#Legal_recognition&quot;&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Hard to believe it first became legal in the US in 2015! Had you asked me in 2014 if that was possible I would have said no. Then it changed, just like that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Covid is another one. Who would have thought that people could hibernate for more than a year in the US. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html#a181825&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in March last year, just to mark how ludicrous I thought it was yet at the same time inevitable. We do go through real transitions. I expect there will be plenty more. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And at some point some journalism org will trip over the idea that repping the people's interest makes their art work as a business like nothing else before. Sometimes I think that's all we're arguing about in the US. The elites talk to the elites and ignore the rest of us. So remind me, why are we supporting this?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
