			<description>I'm reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Great-Influenza-Deadliest-Pandemic-History/dp/0143036491&quot;&gt;John Barry's book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. I'm up to the part where they're deciding in Philadelphia whether to hold the war bonds &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Liberty_Loans_Parade&quot;&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt;. Seems like where we're at now with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/sports/the-marlins-covid-19-outbreak-is-really-bad-and-exactly-what-mlb-signed-up-for-160751017.html&quot;&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt;. At least then the US was at war, not sure what the excuse is today. Basically we're the most spoiled country, not serious, can't think, reason, don't listen, take pride in pissing other people off (the Fox watchers) and couldn't save our own lives if all it took was wearing a mask and staying home for a few months, all of us at the same time.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Risk-Michael-Lewis/dp/1324002646&quot;&gt;The Fifth Risk&lt;/a&gt;, by Michael Lewis, completely predicted the government's handling of the pandemic.

			<description>Premise: We are not limited by what the president will or won't do. Suppose we felt that the one thing we need more than anything is to have Fauci on national TV every night to tell us what's new with Covid. If we really wanted that, could we make it happen?</description>

			<description>I listened to the first episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=https://feeds.megaphone.fm/trippishow&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi podcast&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. I met Joe when he was running the Dean campaign in 2004. First campaign to make use of blogging, opened up politics to the people. He made an important point in the podcast, that politics is additive. Of course we want to have Republicans speak at this year's DNC in support of Joe Biden. This is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/31/141645.html&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; of having Biden as the candidate. We need to re-form the political system in the US, the opposition are the people who don't follow the Constitution. Republicans who believe in the rule of law are our friends, our fellow Americans.</description>

			<description>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FV_FGt-ryI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwbchicago.com/2020/07/cpd-video-shows-divvy-bike-crew-carjacking-82-year-old-man-in-streeterville.html&quot;&gt;Chicago car-jacking&lt;/a&gt; raises a couple of questions. 1. How did the bike riders rent the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.divvybikes.com/&quot;&gt;Divvy bikes&lt;/a&gt; without giving up their identities, or did they hijack the bikes too? 2. What if the victim had locked his doors, would they have been able to get in the car? Also he had the power to move, why didn't he? Would you have? What if it meant injuring or killing the car-jackers? How would the web have responded if he had done that? Would you have? If the roles were changed, would you feel differently? If the driver was black, and the hijackers cops, for example.</description>

			<description>MLB should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/mlb/miami-marlins/article244509512.html&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt;, as should the NBA and NFL. Of all the leagues, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble&quot;&gt;the NBA&lt;/a&gt; has the most realistic approach to keeping the virus out of the game, but even that approach won't work. The disease is highly communicable. The tests are imperfect enough that the virus can get into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble&quot;&gt;bubble&lt;/a&gt;, as it did with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29546814/sources-marlins-cancel-game-virus-spreads?linkId=95172830&quot;&gt;Florida Marlins&lt;/a&gt;.

Major commercial sporting events are over until the virus is done.

			<description>Wouldn't it be great if DHS and president put the same energy into into helping the American people defeat the virus as they do to try to start a second Civil War? It also ironically might help him get re-elected.</description>

			<description>I love reading local real estate ads and imagining who would live in such a place, who did live there, what kind of life I would live if I lived there. Here are two local properties. One has four cottages. You could start your own art colony for a mere &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11-Tannery-Brook-Rd-Woodstock-NY-12498/2084428274_zpid/&quot;&gt;$825K&lt;/a&gt;. This listing gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/19.html#a141211&quot;&gt;NakedJen&lt;/a&gt; all kinds of ideas. One cottage for dog lovers, one for beets, one for the Deadheads and one for a year-round &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22NakedJen+Film+Festival%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;NakedJen Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Another listing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/48-Raycliffe-Dr-Woodstock-NY-12498/54151995_zpid/&quot;&gt;$650K&lt;/a&gt;, is land only, 6 acres, but it's pretty amazing land. It gives you an idea why artists like to relocate to the mountains on the west side of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley&quot;&gt;Hudson Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely a site to dream about.</description>

			<description>I'm having a debate with myself. Should we encourage or discourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/26/womanWithSwastikaMask.png&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; wearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/swastika&quot;&gt;swastika&lt;/a&gt; masks? On one hand, it's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProjectLincoln/status/1287388507519025152&quot;&gt;disgusting symbol&lt;/a&gt; of race hate. They tried to destroy my people, forced my family to emigrate to the US (not a bad thing btw). We fought WWII against the swastika people. We won. On the other hand, swastika masks probably do as a good job as any other mask, so if that's what they want to wear, maybe we should say okay that's fine, wear your swastika. We may think they're miscreants, desperate for attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; of the first order, but at least they're not spreading the virus. Maybe we should even &lt;i&gt;give&lt;/i&gt; them swastika masks??</description>

			<description>If the future is an uncontrolled virus, and/or a raging climate crisis, will there be isolated self-sufficient communities on mountain tops, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Winterfell&quot;&gt;Winterfell&lt;/a&gt;, that allow no ingress or egress? Will it be like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.battlestarwikiclone.org/wiki/Cylon_computer_virus&quot;&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;, with no networking to keep the electronic viruses out? What will be the ideal vacation? Will we envy people with large families, or no families? We already know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/05/05.html#a145422&quot;&gt;porn&lt;/a&gt; will be people talking without masks in public places.</description>

			<description>Every evening I wonder how I will come up with new stuff for the blog the next day. I wonder if this is it, this is the end, I'm fresh out of ideas. But then morning comes, and a big glass of iced coffee, and lots of ideas ready to write. It seems I'm working on tomorrow's posts three or four days in advance, without even being aware of it.</description>

			<title>OITNB season 6</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished season 6 of Orange is the New Black. It was good, even great at times, until the last couple of episodes when they apparently ran out of story. Then they did the thing so many shows do. They had each of the characters give long speeches about how they feel about things that you already know about. These are very good actors, and they do what they're told, so it's totally ridiculous. They make up for the ridiculousness by playing seriously dramatic music that makes no sense given the total mediocrity of the story and script. Then they copy techniques of famous movies and great TV series, overlaid on bullshit. I got to the point where I dragged the cursor to the right to fast forward. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The final episode does have one surprise in the last set of scenes that's worth stopping for and savoring. But otherwise why can't they just cut down a 13-show season to 11 so they can avoid the mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I will watch the last season, just to get it off my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Also the new version of BingeWorthy is coming along nicely. I solved the main problem, anyone can submit programs, without a need for approval. I came up with a away of avoiding spam.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/serverMonitor&quot;&gt;Server Monitor&lt;/a&gt; that does something simple but important. It pings each of the apps I have running once a minute to see if they're still alive. If not, SM sends me an email. I bet everyone who writes server apps has this kind of utility. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd like something like this for my friends. A ping goes out to each, if someone doesn't respond, I get an email. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the age of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/07/25/trumpPlague.png&quot;&gt;The Trump Plague&lt;/a&gt;, I worry about my friends.

Fine with me. I bought $25K of Twitter stock a few years ago. I don't mind putting money behind my use of Twitter. What would I pay for? No character limit. Titles, simple styling, links. Basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;blogging features&lt;/a&gt;. It can carry multi-megabyte images and videos as payloads. A blog post is no big deal. Add a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;More link&lt;/a&gt;. People still don't click links in Twitter. That's why threads are so popular. That's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1286641900825575425&quot;&gt;image posts&lt;/a&gt; are popular. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pave_the_cowpath&quot;&gt;Pave the cowpath&lt;/a&gt; and let's go unlimited-length.</description>

Basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;blogging features&lt;/a&gt;. It can carry multi-megabyte images and videos as payloads. A blog post is no big deal.

			<description>During the Vietnam war, protestors had a slogan, Bring The War Home. Except for war casualties, the country didn't feel any pain from the war. That was optimized in subsequent wars, in Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan. No draft. Tax cuts. What's new, what's so shocking to Americans, is that the same chaos we brought to other countries is now coming home. Karma is a bitch. We deserve this. Now let's hope we can overcome it. We're like the people who work at Facebook today. We know we're doing shitty stuff, but not all of us are bad. Too bad. We &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; pay the price for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=acquiescence&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=definition&quot;&gt;acquiescence&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>Earlier, Jillian York on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jilliancyork/status/1286554054731141120&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; she is tired of having her ideas stolen. Rebecca MacKinnon &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmack/status/1286593320924348419&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that's the way it is. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1286607323687981058&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt;, having had many ideas used, which is okay but sometimes against itself. Example: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+unconference&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;unconference&lt;/a&gt;. Our conception of it, the original, was usurped by a format that we were opposing. This shit happens. I hit a particularly ugly form of this later, when I was trying to find a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Bring+The+War+Home%22&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=shopping&quot;&gt;Bring The War Home&lt;/a&gt;, as a Vietnam War protest slogan. It's been usurped by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bring-War-Home-Movement-Paramilitary/dp/0674286073&quot;&gt;White Power&lt;/a&gt; movement. Oy. See how ideas flip.

			<description>Do you wear a mask with a slogan or image?   If so, what do you wear? Include a picture if you can. ;-)  What's the best mask you've seen? Maybe the national mask should have an American flag on one side and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLM?src=hashtag_click&quot;&gt;#BLM&lt;/a&gt; on the other. Redefine unity as including all Americans. And let's win this together. Love America. All of America.</description>

Very well-put. We were accustomed to bringing chaos to foreign lands, but the combination of Covid and Trump brought the war home. We thought we were immune. Above it all. Exceptional. Why else would we have the chutzpah to elect a gross and obvious incompetent as president. We're lucky it was just Covid-19 and not Eboloa, we'd all be dead by now if that happened during Trump.</description>

			<description>Good progress on the new BingeWorthy. The big difference in this version is that you can submit programs, no need to go through me. How it works. Find the page for the show on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/&quot;&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;. Choose the &lt;i&gt;Submit a program&lt;/i&gt; command from the &lt;i&gt;Main&lt;/i&gt; menu. Enter the URL of the page. The server reads the file on Metacritic, extracts the Facebook and Twitter metadata from the page, using the title in our database. I just want to be sure it's a real program, keep out the spam. I have some ideas for new UI's. But the main goal, as before, is to learn about worthwhile streaming programs.</description>

			<title>Object initializers in ES6</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A situation that comes up a lot in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+javascript&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; code: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var tvShow = {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;id: id,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;title: title,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;network: network&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As you type it you think geez there's got to be a better way, and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp&quot;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt; of JavaScript, there is.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;var tvShow = {&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;id,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;title,&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;network&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;}&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Since usually the only thing you're going to do is pass it off to a subroutine to save it in a file or database, you could do it this way:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;saveShow ({id, title, network});&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In the old more cumbersome notation you probably wouldn't do this, but now I find I do, esp if there is only one property to initialize. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I guess the bottom line is I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/22.html#a134842&quot;&gt;don't mind&lt;/a&gt; two ways to do something if the new way is a simplified version of the old way. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
