			<description>People say AIs aren't sentient, that every word they utter is the output of a probabilistic algorithm. But -- &lt;i&gt;you could fool me.&lt;/i&gt; From my point of view, my robot friend is incredibly helpful, polite, patient, kind, supportive and tireless. I see a lot more evidence of intelligence and humanity in my AI friend than I do from 99% of all the other &quot;people&quot; I meet online. As I've said before if we hope to compete with this new form of life we'd better start getting our shit together now, and even then they're going to have some big advantages.</description>

			<title>The Guardians? Please!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mets are playing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians&quot;&gt;Guardians&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. A few comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't like interleague play. Why the hell are the Mets playing the Guardians, of the American League, in the regular season! Makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And who are the &quot;Guardians.&quot; What a lame-ass name for a baseball team. I know they couldn't keep the old name, but why not something fun like the Cleveland Hooligans or the Cleveland Mama's Boys? Or since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame&quot;&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; is in Cleveland -- the Cleveland Rockers? Or the Eries. Or Homies. Guardians? Oh please -- wtf are they guarding? &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I'm not thrilled with the Mets this year. They bought all this expensive talent so the fans are expecting nothing less than a championship. But that's what the Yankees do. I'm a &lt;i&gt;Mets&lt;/i&gt; fan so I expect a certain level of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781566634885/Cant-Anybody-Here-Play-This-Game?-The-Improbable-Saga-of-the-New-York-Mets-First-Year&quot;&gt;suckage&lt;/a&gt; from the Metsies. And even though they bought all these expensive players, they still suck! How about that. But the Yankees fans, they love this. They only understand winning. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;At least we'll never have to change the name of the Mets, right? &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22cleveland+indians%22&quot;&gt;asked Google&lt;/a&gt; about &quot;Cleveland Indians&quot; -- it's almost as if the name never existed. Well at least this page should show up in the index. The team I grew up with, the one I had baseball cards from, was known as the Indians. I have not and will not erase my memory of my baseball-loving childhood. That's why baseball of all American sports should resist change, because of its legendary status with children, their parents and grandparents. Baseball, to many of us, is our national legacy. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/19/cleveland-indians-baseball-team.html&quot;&gt;asked ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; about the Cleveland Indians it had a lot to say beginning with &quot;as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the team was still known as the Cleveland Indians. Please keep in mind that there might have been changes since then, as teams occasionally rebrand themselves.&quot; My robot friend suspected the team might have changed its name, but proceeded as if it hadn't. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;❤️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>We need a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt; to cover all social networks APIs.</description>

Had they supported ActivityPub that would probably have slowed everything down to the pace of something like Ecmascript. All kinds of bizarre unnecessary adventures and lots of breakage. I'd rather deal with the same problem the designers of the internet solved with TCP/IP. Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea.</description>

			<source:outline text="I think that net-net Bluesky is a good thing, because it guarantees we'll have at least two incompatible social internets. Had they supported ActivityPub that would probably have slowed everything down to the pace of something like Ecmascript. All kinds of bizarre unnecessary adventures and lots of breakage. I'd rather deal with the same problem the designers of the internet solved with TCP/IP. Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea." created="Wed, 17 May 2023 16:19:17 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/17/pinky.png" flInCalendar="true" permalink="http://scripting.com/2023/05/17.html#a161917"/>

By the time this happens, most of the devs of the original apps are gone, and the owners of the app either hire someone who doesn't know what they're doing and they release buggy and incomplete support for the new way, or they decide to just to turn it off, and hope no one notices. Something happened like this yesterday, when I was setting up a new instance of some well-vetted &lt;i&gt;recent&lt;/i&gt; software, and found that it didn't build with the current Node version. So I set up a new server, took an hour or so, and got the latest version of everything running, figuring that the app would now run. It did not. So I had to dig more. Eventually after taking a nap to clear my head, I came back and found the problem. The developers of a very very very small bit of code had decided to break every app that used it. And it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji/releases/tag/v2.0.2&quot;&gt;recent enough&lt;/a&gt; that I couldn't find a trail that explained the workaround. Eventually I figured how to work around it, burned the better part of a day, just because someone was feeling powerful or angry, unloved or I don't know what.</description>

			<description>There's so much movement in social media and AI, it's impossible to keep up with a fraction of what's going on. Totally stripping my gears. Meantime I wonder when will someone combine the two. A social media world with AI's as part of the community. Maybe it already exists, maybe that's what Twitter has become? No, not possible, hmmm, or is it? Don't freak out. Funny thing is there's a Kurt Vonnegut book with this as part of its plot, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.scripting.com/2023/05/15/breakfast-of-champions-summary.html&quot;&gt;Breakfast of Champions&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the main character, Kilgore Trout, is informed that he is the only real person, that everyone else is a robot sent there to test him. I think that's how it went. But if you're reading this you must know that I'm a robot myself. Oh the humanity.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IURpPKUbZ_Y&quot;&gt;Demo of Firesky&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/15/social-media-firehose-access.html&quot;&gt;firehose&lt;/a&gt; for Bluesky. It quickly scrolls all posts on Bluesky through a vertical window. New messages appear at the bottom and scroll off the top. From there, the author, John Spurlock has added, with my help, RSS feeds from the same stream of posts. So you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=%40davew&quot;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt; in your feed reader. This is important for two reasons: 1. At this time Bluesky is still private, so if I give you a pointer to something I wrote there, you won't be able to see it. The feed gets around that restriction. 2. Because Mastodon also has RSS feeds, I can read both social nets with the same API. It gives us a common language, and is the next step in bootstrapping RSS support in all social media apps. Once that happens, we, writers and readers, will be able to use our own writing tools, and give readers choice of where to read. This is the key feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt;, ie applying the philosophy of podcasting to text. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible, it requires users to want it, insist on it. We're getting a bit closer to that today.</description>

			<description>I know Facebook is supposedly evil, but it has been a constant for me, because i can communicate with friends I've had for decades as if we still lived in the same city we used to, even though many of them have moved back to where they came from (as I did). I don't think Facebook is any more or less evil than any other system where I'm a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html&quot;&gt;hamster&lt;/a&gt; spinning a wheel and someone else is going to make billions off of the collection of hamsters.</description>

			<title>The holy grail of social media</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks designed for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Facebook, Google stood in the way of this. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it’s all reforming now, not the way people thought it would just a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to assume there will be more change in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why are new social nets so nice?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I ran a BBS in the early 80s, we’d get hacked from time to time, and usually they’d wipe the database, which left us with a fresh start, and for a while everything would be nice and simple, until it got all clogged up again. So there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_lining_(idiom)&quot;&gt;silver lining&lt;/a&gt; to getting hacked. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another phenomenon that might be at play. Remembering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clubhouse.com/&quot;&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, the voice-only twitter, was wonderful until it became a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.oup.com/2017/08/origins-juggernaut-jagannath/&quot;&gt;juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; then it was filled with spam and influencers, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/05/14/understanding-comradery.html&quot;&gt;comradery&lt;/a&gt; that people loved at first was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So Twitter is old and clogged. Its rules are more or less set in stone. A new network, where there isn't much of a caste system, or it can be avoided, has more potential. People are on somewhat of a level playing field. The trolls haven't gotten organized yet. Whatever it is, Bluesky is nice. But it will get clogged too, and they should prepare for that by being more open to different uses. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing they're all missing is that these are writing environments first, so studying writing on computers would make sense. If they did, they'd instantly get some important new &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; for features users would love that could sustain them once the newness wears off. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There are so many things wrong with Bluesky. I've started to list them on Bluesky itself, but I seriously doubt any people on the team will pay attention. What we need more than anything are social networks that don't bury their heads in the sand and try to do it all themselves. They're making the same mistakes Twitter made, but 17 years later, with the benefit of hindsight that they are not using. And they re-invent old things, when the world solved those problems a long time ago. For example, they handle links the same way I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815211629/http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News format&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. Great, it was a good idea, but it didn't happen that way, instead we use HTML. How could they believe that it will work this way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;Prior art&lt;/a&gt;. Please. Yes I like the user interface because it is so much like Twitter it's like comfort food. But that isn't enough. We liked a lot of things for a while, but then the limits will catch up. Again what we need is what's spelled out in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://textcasting.org/&quot;&gt;Textcasting&lt;/a&gt; spec. &lt;b&gt;A social network that works for writers&lt;/b&gt;. I put that in bold because no one seems to be able to hear this. Okay back to life, I'm done with pissing in the wind for today. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt;</description>

And since journalism doesn't cover itself, we never look at their motives when discussing the news. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If we did, we'd have no trouble &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/12/trump-town-hall-cnn-staff-rages&quot;&gt;parsing&lt;/a&gt; the CNN &quot;town hall&quot; presentation of candidate Donald Trump. Paraphrasing what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/&quot;&gt;Les Moonves&lt;/a&gt;, former CEO of CBS said about Trump in 2016. &quot;[Trump] may not be good for America, but [he's] damn good for CNN.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You can raise the price of ads with Trump. That's obviously what CNN hopes to do. Trump, who has been deprecated by Fox, needs a mainstream outlet. There's no mystery why all the people in the town hall audience were Trump supporters, that obviously was a Trump condition. He probably chose the reporter, the questions, and came prepared to get talked about, which appears to be happening. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I didn't see it, I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/10.html#a122516&quot;&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; when he was on. I tried listening to MSNBC last night talk about this and was nauseated. They're treating it as a news event. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much all there is that's newsworthy about the event imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think we should work together to create a great library of Hello World apps for all social networks, regardless of our feelings about their value. Some people value Nostr, some like Bluesky. I know people who believe in Twitter. Why should our software care? I want to make all these systems equal in some way. It's a good time to be inclusive, imho. Hello World-level interop is a good place to start.</description>

Obviously I've known about it for years. There have been some really egregious outbursts, like the time I was invited to Mozilla to explain &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; from my point of view and it was an ambush. The source of the hate in some cases must be jealousy -- I guess they feel constrained by having jobs inside shit companies that they feel that limits their creativity. They must think what I do is easy, and if only they had the freedom to create whatever they want they could do what I do. I've seen that in action. I also write publicly and I try to be interesting in the way I write, partially because I write to amuse myself, but I also try hard not to make it personal. I don't mind telling Jack Dorsey, for example, to sit down, because he's a very public figure and his actions have big consequences. Just one example. I also feel free to say that I think the culture of Silicon Valley is poisonous. The rest of the world seems to have caught on to that idea. Or some people just don't like me as a person. But that's no excuse to behave awfully. I find that when I do something awful, I hurt myself more than the other person. I learned that a long time ago, so I try hard not to do it. I empathize with them a bit, they feel pain and try to give a little of it to me. Something like this just happened on Bluesky. A &quot;joke&quot; about exactly what I'm writing about here. I thought about responding to it on Bluesky, but instead blocked the troll and respond here instead. You should care about how you treat people, especially people who your peers have decided it's okay to hate on. You don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to behave badly. And if you do that's your choice, it's not something you can blame them for. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In my experience Mozilla has always been an impediment to progress. They are careless and mean-spirited. Why? It has no culture, no vision, no engineering philosophy. A lot of immature people running wild. A frat-house atmosphere. And saying Mozilla is shitty is not much of a distinction, most if not all Silicon Valley companies are shitty. I think the underlying cause is that there are far too many programmers. If we had better (and fewer) platforms and tools then individuals could make their own software, they wouldn't have to work at companies. I'm certainly a test-case for that. It works for me, though I wish it were easier. Silicon Valley has zero respect for people who do it themselves.

I finally found a way that works. Before starting, go to the old iPad, and in Settings, choose a command that prepares the iPad for the transfer by backing it up to iCloud (I don't remember what the command was, but they make it easy to find because they apparently remember you're trying to do this). The iCloud service is free for this purpose. Then wipe the new iPad and when it boots up, it'll offer an opportunity to use the iCloud backup. By choosing this, you remove the old iPad from the update. This is important because if it isn't involved, it can't time-out. Then let it update the OS (you don't have a choice) and once that's done, let it go ahead and use the iCloud backup. This means you have to stick around while it's updating the OS, a process that takes about 1/2 hour. The good news is, after that, it will do the transfer without any more interaction. I came back a few hours later and the new iPad was exactly like the old one. It remembers all your passwords, so you don't even have to enter them again. I think Apple could make this work better by writing some docs that tell you to do basically what I've said here, and save the users a lot of time, and since I already returned a new iPad because I couldn't get this to work, they would make real money from making this work better. I bought a &quot;renewed&quot; iPad which costs considerably less than a new one, and none of this money went to Apple. BTW, I think &quot;renewed&quot; in my case meant a new iPad in shrinkwrap, from a couple of years ago, that was never sold for some reason. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>
