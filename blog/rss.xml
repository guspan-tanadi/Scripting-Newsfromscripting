			<description>Yesterday I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/theViewFromNowhere.m4a&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/151128.html?title=packingTheCourt&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about The View From Nowhere. I just realized that Joe Biden may be &lt;b&gt;The Politician from Nowhere&lt;/b&gt;. I can't think of a single issue that he's associated with. Oddly I think that's exactly what we need from a president in 2021.</description>

			<description>New blog feature. There's now a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/06/bidenHarris2020.png&quot;&gt;Biden/Harris ad&lt;/a&gt; on the home page of my blog. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingDesktop.png&quot;&gt;desktop browser&lt;/a&gt; it's in the right margin. It was tricky on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/10/10/scriptingOnPhone.png&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;, so I just had the ad overlay the page, at .5 opacity. You can still read the text underneath it, but it's better if you scroll it out of the way. A blog version of a lawn sign. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>Happy to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/friday-9-october-2020&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; quote my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/07/001200.html?title=breakingUpTechCompanies&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; on breaking up tech monopolies. He calls it radical. It's the kind of judgment courts issue all the time. Look for ways to set things right.  Make everyone whole. The web should have remained open. Google and Facebook didn't respect that. So undo what they did. It's the way a programmer looks at things, and imho that's the right way, because it's tech we're talking about setting right. Usually they don't consult techies in these things, however.</description>

			<description>I hope Trump does his rally in Florida tomorrow. His supporters should see him in his all his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekChFdIe00&quot;&gt;Captain Queeg&lt;/a&gt; paranoia. Explaining the strawberries and how no one listens to him. Calling for a former president who many of them voted for to be put in jail, or perhaps worse. Maybe some of them will be shaken out of their entertainment stupor and realize this is the president of the United States, a formerly great country that is being flushed down the toilet because people in the middle of the country feel unappreciated, bored and purposeless.</description>

			<title>Packing the court</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The court at 6-3, if it gets to that, will be far out of sync with the people they're meant to govern. This has to be resolved somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution doesn't say what we should do, but it isn't up to the Dems, and I wish Harris had said that in the debate, it's up to the people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The people will demand it, as soon as it becomes apparent that the court as configured is going to reverse Roe v Wade.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Further, if it is a huge win for Dems, they will be mandated to do something else. Change the Constitution so we have a democracy, not something that can be so easily hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The press has a lot of gall trying to pin the Dems to &quot;packing&quot; the court. The press are citizens too, and voters, and have an interest in how the country works.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They should ask themselves, before trying to make a controversy, in alliance with the Repubs, do they accept a 6-3 conservative majority?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This circles back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/09/theViewFromNowhere.m4a&quot;&gt;View From Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;. Now is the time for the press to stop and think, am I in favor of the United States? That is not too big a conflict of interest to carry. Then you should be careful when you try to create controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Remember how the press set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillary's Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; thing. Don't back us into a corner. We're going to have to reconfigure the court if the Repubs do what they plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We will have to do it. President Biden will do it for us. Stop ignoring the people. We are the government. We really are. That will be more clear at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW, this time I tried to watch the debate, but gave up after a few minutes. Pence lies and spins. I find it insulting to be lied to that way. And then he talks over his limit, way over. Then you realize he's setting it up so that when he starts answering the question he was asked, it's already past the time limit, so the moderator keeps interrupting him with &quot;Thank you Mr Vice President.&quot; Until finally he stops. At her request. That was enough for me. I heard about the fly on Twitter, and thought that was interesting. Probably the fly was a messenger from the alien robot spaceship parked in synchronous Earth orbit, relaying messages from the Home Planet to the robot Pence. Or a robot supplying a booster for Pence's adderall and steroids cocktail. Possibly Ruth Bader Ginsburg reincarnated as a fly? The mind drifts to other topics and there was a hellacious windstorm going on outside, so I quit early. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>The fourth and final season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Robot-Season-4/dp/B07X1V834N&quot;&gt;Mr Robot&lt;/a&gt; is now on Amazon Prime. It was so good, one of the best shows ever. But a lot of people stopped watching the show during the second and third seasons, which dragged on, were slow, arduous at times and always dark. This also happened with The West Wing, it languished in its late seasons, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing_(season_7)&quot;&gt;final season&lt;/a&gt;, the campaign for Bartlet's successor, was riviting, emotional, idealistic, optimistic. A lot of people missed it. I rated both shows tops on &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;my BingeWorthy list&lt;/a&gt;. The finale of Mr Robot was a joy. I know it's hard to believe. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Breaking up tech companies</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When they contemplate breaking up a tech company, this is how you should do it. Find the component of the company that really is open tech. Something that was open before they came along, that they foreclosed on, and used their monopoly to put everyone else out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's where you draw the line of separation. The core should be spun off into a new company that's well funded, with a charter to commercialize the tech while maintaining zero lock-in. Totally replaceable. Defined APIs that don't break.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the company is viable with these constraints, great. If not, they have enough money to plan their own demise. The key thing is they cannot use their dominance to launch new products. Just the open tech.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You would find people willing to staff such a company, there are lots of idealistic developers, still, who believe in the open internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft's case, in the 90s this would have meant spinning out the browser. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today with Facebook it would mean spinning out the open graph.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;With Google, it would have to be at least the core search engine. If Alphabet wanted to run ads on search, they'd have to get in line and compete with others who did. This is the price they pay for trying to use their dominance in search to control everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Google would also have to spin out Chrome, same way Microsoft would have spun out MSIE in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That's the basic idea. Look for the old open tech buried in the company, that is the source of their monopolistic control, and extract it. Hopefully it's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; painful, to keep successors from tying to do it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>26 years blogging</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;To get to to 25 years it could be stubbornness, the desire to reach a goal. To get to 26 is something different. It says I was really born to do this. I just cruised through the last year, of course I blogged it, through all the crazy shit, and beauty, why wouldn't I?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It might be time to change the motto from &quot;It's even worse than it appears&quot; to the motto of Battlestar Galactica.&quot; All this has happened before, and all this will happen again.&quot; Because it really is a loop.

			<description>In a way, we are lucky Trump is so incompetent. In January, if he weren't insane and deaf he could have gotten his approval ratings to 90% simply by doing exactly what science said to do. He would be coasting to a landslide election at this point.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; has really good docs, and they strive for simplicity, and they pull it off.  Good performance and pricing too. I've migrated all of my network apps to DO. Started using their database platform a year ago, and it &quot;just worked.&quot; I don't like all the jargon in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-digitalocean-app-platform-reimagining-paas-to-make-it-simpler-for-you-to-build-deploy-and-scale-apps/&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; of their new &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?i=e2ff93&quot;&gt;app platform&lt;/a&gt;, but it's probably pretty good. Glitch is here too, but I don't think &quot;real&quot; developers get that it'll be useful for them, but it is. The core idea is put your app on GitHub, connect it to a node on the host (Digital Ocean, Glitch, etc), and deploy changes by updating on GitHub. I expect Microsoft will be here too. Imagine a button on the repo that says Deploy (MS bought GitHub recently). We're about to see a huge simplification of writing apps for the net. There's no reason it can't be a lot easier. Note that AWS or Google aren't remotely here, their systems are labyrinthine, designed for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22priesthood%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

			<description>If Fauci had a podcast we'd hear what he thinks every day. You wouldn't have to go hunting for him. The public needs a pulse for guidance about what's going on. Not getting him on the podcast network at the time that say Cuomo was booting up was a mistake. I think it would have saved a lot of lives. I don't know, maybe he's being so effective inside the government that they can't spare him. But I've seen his main value this year as a reliable communicator.</description>

			<description>It's hard to believe but Repubs plan to challenge every absentee ballot in swing states. When they say it might take months to get a result, that's because they plan to make it take months.

			<description>You know how sometimes your brain as it scans sees one word but the word that's actually there is something else? It happens every time I see NakedJen's logo on Twitter. It says &quot;nakedjen anarchist &amp; agitator.&quot; But my brain always sees &quot;antichrist&quot; in place of anarchist. It keeps happening, finally I had to mention it. Sorry Jen, I have no idea what it means, if anything.</description>

			<title>What's wrong with Facebook</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/10/04/135949.html?title=checkingInOnTwitter&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about what's right with Twitter these days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Today -- Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing overshadows all other considerations. They swapped out the old user interface in favor of a new more modern-looking one. It is more attractive, better use of fonts, the text is generally more readable, and it has a brighter look. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But that's all that I can say about it that's good.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's bad? The product is depressing. Almost everything it shows you is junk. They must be trying to get us to stop using Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the usual thing, users hate redesigns, but get used to them and after a while see that it's better in some ways, worse in others. I've been using it for a while, and it's every bit as ridiculous today as it was a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;First all the spam friend requests are treated as super important, higher priority than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It's like opening your real-world mailbox and all you get are catalogs, mailers, special offers, political ads, notices, most of it goes in the garbage, but you have to look at everything, because there will be things you have to pay attention to. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How can their code fail to see that all the friend requests I get are spam? &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No one with any influence inside Facebook is using the version of the software we are using or they'd revert it immediately and then fix it. I've seen companies ship upgrades so bad the company failed, and this one is right up there. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken&quot;&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; on MSNBC yesterday. He talked for several minutes uninterrupted. Riveting. No doubt he's the best communicator the Dems have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez&quot;&gt;AOC&lt;/a&gt; is great too, as is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt; (he should run for something). &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; excels, esp the last few weeks. But Franken is tops.</description>

			<description>Also, I tried listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alfranken.com/listen&quot;&gt;Al Franken's podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He has a long ad at the beginning, and I don't do that. He should find a different revenue model. He's got a long road ahead to come back. The podcast should be instrumental in that, but the advertising disgusted me, and I won't listen to it. Too many people with something to say do this. Shame. Podcasting wires you directly into people's brains when they have the attention to really listen. Don't waste that selling some cheesy house ornament or utility.</description>

			<description>Right now it would be interesting to have 10K permanent protestors in DC, until the election, to make sure the Repubs know and feel that the people are watching.</description>
