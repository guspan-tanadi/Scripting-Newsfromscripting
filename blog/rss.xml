			<description>I wish Facebook would silence the spammy viral phishy poll messages that get thousands of shares, my friends fall for them, and they're certainly gathering all kinds of data that hurt people, they're easy to detect, it should be a big issue for journos, but for some reason it isn't.</description>

			<description>I saw a supposed expert on Wolf Blitzer's show on CNN last night saying there was nothing the Dems could do about Roe v Wade. This is what passes for expertise at CNN these days. People who look nice in a suit and learned how to speak in CNN style.</description>

			<description>Drummer user note: When you're creating something new in a chronologic structure, use the big + icon at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/03/plusIcon.png&quot;&gt;top of the icon bar&lt;/a&gt;. Don't do it by hand. The software that cares about chronologic notes ignores nodes that were created by hand. The + icon puts special attributes on the nodes that matter. You could if you wanted to do it yourself. But why would you? I'm saying this 20 different ways, here on Scripting News and everywhere else I can think to because I want &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; users to get this right. It's important. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>I'm doing user support for the first time since &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/span&gt; days and am reminded of what sucks about it. In the groups I am part of, as a user,when I ask for help I have reproduced the problem on my machine several times. I have tried workarounds. I've thought about it. I don't immediately ask for help, because I know the other people are like me, doing it for love, it's not their job, they're helping because they like to help. For whatever reason the groups I assemble often don't do this. At the first sign of trouble they post something that's impossible to understand, and it's really clear they didn't try it again, or they would have spotted their mistake. Support is a dear resource. Use it when you need it, but be sure first that you do need it.</description>

			<title>We have to fight, at some point</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I saw Amy Klobuchar interviewed on CNN and the reporter pressed her to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/jun/13/stephen-breyer-retire-supreme-court-alexandria-ocasio-cortez&quot;&gt;Breyer should resign&lt;/a&gt; while there's a Dem president, was wondering why no one wishes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg&quot;&gt;RBG&lt;/a&gt; had resigned when Obama was president, but of course there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland#Supreme_Court_nomination&quot;&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in hindsight, we should have had the fight over the Supreme Court when Garland was nominated and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2016/03/16/470664561/mcconnell-blocking-supreme-court-nomination-about-a-principle-not-a-person&quot;&gt;McConnell refused to confirm&lt;/a&gt;. Obama could have taken that as an affirmation, and seated Garland. It would have been a better time to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I said it at the time. If McConnell won't vote, then after a decent amount of time, Garland takes the seat. Set a new precedent, if the Senate abdicates its responsibility, we go forward without them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The good guys have been scared of a fight, and the Repubs have been walking all over the Constitution. You can't be nice always, sometimes you have to hit back. We've been delaying and delaying. And btw, where are the indictments of Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland#Attorney_General_(2021%E2%80%93present)&quot;&gt;Mr Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kairyssdal/status/1433803558290223104&quot;&gt;On Twitter Kai Ryssdal asks&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;What happens now?  I mean, courts/procedure-wise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am not a lawyer...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court declined to put a stay order on the law, so Texas can and will presumably enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But the lawsuits can proceed, as if the SC did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's another question even more ominous imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now that Texas found a way around the Constitution, what other rights can they infringe on this way?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pick an amendment, it's easy to construct an analog.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Pass a law saying immigrants can't ride on public transportation. If one is caught doing it, you just have to document it and, you (or more likely your employer) can sue the bus driver, the bus company, the city, other passengers. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade&quot;&gt;Roe v Wade&lt;/a&gt; was decided in 1973, 48 years ago. I was 18 that year. I was on the edge of awareness for what it meant. I don't remember a time when abortion was not legal, not in a way that could have affected me. We're all going to learn about it now.</description>

			<description>On Facebook, when you reply to a post you disagree with, your followers will then see it in their timeline. This puts people who follow you in an awkward position. I want to unfollow you because I don't want my timeline polluted with nonsense about how great the former president is (for example), and the only way I can do that is by unfollowing you. So your momentary feeling of righteousness has a hidden potential cost you should be aware of. 1. You help a cause you disagree with and 2. You alienate your friends.</description>

			<description>BTW, &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; runs on Linux, in case that wasn't clear. And Windows and Mac. I use a Mac mostly, but I'd love to convert to Linux. Only one app is keeping me on the Mac, the OPML Editor, and only for its ability to manage my development work. But Drummer is getting pretty close to being able to do that. When it's fully up to speed I will be able to run everything in Linux, and believe me -- I will relax. I'm skating on thin ice on the Mac and know it.</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/08/31.html#a153800&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I put out a call for new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/04/03/133021.html?title=theMakingOfDrummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; testers, asking for people with blogging and/or scripting experience. I should have also asked for people who have used &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/span&gt;, such as LogSeq, Roam, Obsidian, Org-mode, my own MORE, ThinkTank and Ready, or others. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/span&gt; is all about outlining, as I said yesterday -- unabashedly so. We used to be reserved about software centered on outlining, but no more. Send an email or Twitter DM if you're interested in being in the test group.</description>

			<description>The usual monthly ritual is complete. Archived the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/08.opml&quot;&gt;August posts&lt;/a&gt;, and started my outline with a fresh slate for September. Trying to imagine what wonders and atrocities await us! &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<title>Tagging in Scripting News</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My use of &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;tagging&lt;/span&gt; has been going for a while now, and i'm still doing it, which in my experience is a total success for a categorization system. Even better, some of the tags are getting enough references to be useful, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tag=drummer&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What seems to come next is to hook all of this up with a Wiki, so the landing page for a tag can have more than just links to articles. In other words all of this amounted to integrating an outliner with a Wiki, which was one of my goals after hanging out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ward+cunningham+site%3Ascripting.com&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of days &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html&quot;&gt;a few years back&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Software development sometimes is like painting. You do something over and over iteratively, from a lot of angles, and arrive somewhere, but that itself is probably just on the road to what's next after that. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
