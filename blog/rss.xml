			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean_2004_presidential_campaign&quot;&gt;The Dean campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 2002-04 was on the verge of turning a campaign into a social network. I was there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;Here are my notes&lt;/a&gt; from the last night of the campaign, the Iowa Caucus in 2004. I was at Dean HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont&quot;&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt;. I was blogging on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/01/19.html&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; and on the main Dean weblog. We also rolled out &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/howChannelDeanCameToBe.html&quot;&gt;Channel Dean&lt;/a&gt; that day, basically a linkblog managed by campaign people, linking to articles and blog posts their community would find interesting. These were all precursors to the social nets of today.</description>

			<description>I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacritic.com%2Ftv%2Fbetter-things&quot;&gt;watching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Better Things%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Better Things&lt;/a&gt; very slowly, one episode a night on average. The nice thing is how the mom and her three daughters have open affection for each other, it's their baseline. They get pissed off, mostly the kids with the mom, but they quickly get back to hugging and being motherly to each other, across generations. It's sweet. Nothing at all even remotely like the environment I grew up in btw, just sayin. Anyway, I'd kind of like to see Donald Trump as a guest on the show. They would listen to his sad stories, and try to help him. I think there could be some good jokes in there.</description>

			<description>I used to put Donald Trump's image in the right margin of this blog quite frequently, but I've stopped. He's a vampire we've managed to lock in a crypt, and I worry that just showing his image here might wake him up. He's now got the smell of loser on him, like an old version of Sarah Palin. She was pretty charismatic too, in her day. And about as talented as the lame duck. Better to let him fade away. Think of him as a dead relative. Maybe he was an asshole, it's hard to remember, it's been so long.</description>

			<description>One of the nice things about using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22outliner%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt; to edit my blog is that I can move things around quickly, but sometimes things get moved to the wrong place. That happened yesterday. I was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;my new TV&lt;/a&gt; and all of a sudden there's a paragraph about how screwed up journalism is. And then there was a post that I thought I had deleted and didn't. Oy! That was pretty disturbing. I left it there, but edited it a bit so it made more sense. Yesterday was a good day in general, but a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; day on the blog. Anyway, I've corrected it &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14.html&quot;&gt;on the web&lt;/a&gt;. Ooops. I'll try to do better in the future. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html&quot;&gt;Ben Smith explains&lt;/a&gt; why it's bad that Apple is now a media company. He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html&quot;&gt;biggest media buyouts&lt;/a&gt; in history (at the time). I wanted to know when he/she was going to write about it. Never. That opened my eyes to something I should have been able to see much earlier. We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us. Yet they feel transparent to us, the mere conveyors of information, or so they would have you believe. We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory&quot;&gt;triangulation&lt;/a&gt; here. A source of news that is &lt;i&gt;totally disconnected&lt;/i&gt; from the media industry.</description>

			<description>BTW, a disclaimer. Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt;, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story. And Apple, btw is the perfect example of a tech company that should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; have a say in what stories get told.</description>

Almost 20 years later, it has, and still does. The web has none of the limits of broadcast. Simple idea. That it worked, thatâ€™s kind of a miracle. If youâ€™re doing a podcast now, just know someone believed in you a long time ago.</description>

			<title>My new TV</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new TV made by LG.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Their user interface is a classic corporate historic disaster mess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What a piece of shit. In every way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The picture is very nice though. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The software does all kinds of stuff I don't want it to do, automatically, like starting selecting programs for me to watch when I'm trying desperately to figure out how to tell it to show me the programs I'm trying to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing about it is there aren't many things a person watching a TV wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I want to choose between: Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube TV and YouTube. Inside each site I already know their UIs. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I need to go to settings, to change options for video, sound, captioning, turn off annoyances I don't want. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't want to turn my life over to you by accepting legal agreements for the ability to do that, btw.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This TV has Alexa built in, I thought maybe I could use that to control the TV, but no, it's used to control everything but the TV. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Shovelware. That's what this thing is filled with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paid $2000 plus tax for this, btw. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the TCL/Roku combo is very good. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have a Roku stick which I have hooked into the TV and I can get there, but I'm not convinced that the apps in there have full access to the high resolution display. Who knows. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The NYT and Hillary's Emails</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The further we slide down the slope remember that it required some grease and a push from the great NYT which still has not accepted their responsibility for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/14/butheremails.png&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails story&lt;/a&gt; that was so pivotal in 2016. I mistakenly thought we were witnessing journalism's self-awareness and shame when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/14/nytheadline.png&quot;&gt;this headline&lt;/a&gt;. But no, they weren't accepting blame, they were blaming you and me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A friend writes: &quot;Why does the blame lie with NYT?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Good question.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;They were fed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Hillary's Emails%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; story by a conservative dirty trickster, and they went with it, made it a campaign, based on either cynicism or ignorance.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It hinges on whether the people at the NYT understood what email servers are, and have some basic idea of how they work and what they do. If they didn't know then it was ignorance. If they did know, then it was cynicism that basically their readers would have no idea and would trust them when they said &lt;i&gt;this is a big story&lt;/i&gt; by repeatedly putting it on page one.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Yet the things they said amounted to WTF -- how is this relevant. They never explained. And of course we now understand that there was nothing there.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't doubt that HRC would have been president for the last four years if they had done their job honestly and competently. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The NYT's impact was at least that of Facebook. So when they blame Facebook they should have just as many column-inches about how the NYT screwed us in 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>When will journalism stop covering the disappointment of Trump supporters. They lost. They're having a hard time dealing with it. Meantime we're in the middle of a pandemic. Let them get over it on their own. My mother understood this. When my little brother was complaining about something, very unfairly, and loudly, my mother would say if you just ignore him he'll stop. She was right.</description>

			<title>The moment CNN was not prepared for</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Porter_Anderson/status/1338173209389240322&quot;&gt;CNN accuses Fox&lt;/a&gt; of lack of proportionality. I've been watching CNN the last few weeks. I find it mind-numbing. (A good thing, for now, I play video games and watch Twitter while CNN is on.) They repeat the same two stories over and over since Election Day. Literally the same words, over and over. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's really going on imho.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Both Fox and CNN are paralyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They are prepared for hurricanes, earthquakes, even another 9/11. But they have no idea what to do with a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Similarly the Trump rebellion is on a scale they have no concept of how to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are people &lt;i&gt;who do not improvise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;As Chris Hayes said, they all did very well in school. Rose through the ranks. Lots of book learning and discipline. They can make looking like a maverick as tame as a lamb, which is good for the cash flow of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But they can't improvise. They can only do what they were taught to do. They weren't taught how to do this job. So they are stuck. Paralyzed. Going round and round trying to catch a familiar beat, but they can't because it doesn't have one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>The moment podcasting came into being</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It happened in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10.html&quot;&gt;October 2000&lt;/a&gt; in NYC. I met with Adam Curry over a couple of days at a hotel in midtown on the west side. I mention the meeting in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/12.html#myUserlandOnTheDesktop&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on December 28, 2000. Here's an excerpt. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It helps to have a user in mind when you're developing. In NY, when I met with Adam for two days he kept trying to explain what he wanted, but he's not a software developer, so to my ears it came across like hodgepodge. But I listened anyway, I kept trying to feed back what I heard, but we weren't connecting. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;When I got back home I did what programmers do, I iterated, and kept showing it to him. Is this what you wanted? Eventually we got there, this software hits his button. It's also a framework for his vision for last yard connectivity. You can move huge pieces of content without any waiting and using the bandwidth that you don't use. When you're home sleeping in your bed your desktop system can get the big stuff, you won't even know it's there until it's fully downloaded on your hard disk.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is how video and music are going to move over the net in 2001. Who would have thought RSS would play a role in this? Adam did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This was the key idea on podcasting. How to distribute large bits of audio and video without having to wait for them to download. At the time, it was the slowness of the net that stood in the way of what we now call podcasting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The significance of this is that it was 20 years ago. It led to a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot; title=&quot;The official RSS 2.0 spec.&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; which supported enclosures for the first time. I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/12/27.html&quot;&gt;wrote this up&lt;/a&gt; on the blog that month. And the software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22MUOTD%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;MUOTD&lt;/a&gt; became Radio UserLand, which was a two-way blogging and reading app for RSS. It's something the software industry hasn't replicated, not because it's so hard technically, it isn't. Not sure why. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The two-day meetup was on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/26.html&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;. It still took a couple of months from then before we had any real demos. It was competing with other projects we had at UserLand at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There was also a Scripting News dinner at Katz's Deli on Houston St during the same visit on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2000/10/25.html&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Two of my favorite movies: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)&quot;&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets&quot;&gt;As Good As It Gets&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because I identify with almost all the characters in some way. Such incredible story-telling. So much truth about our failure to understand our own struggles and beauty, try as hard as we can, and to accept the beauty in others. Also a short interruption as I got a spam call that I answered. I leave this kind of stuff in my podcasts. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸš€&lt;/span&gt;</description>

They're all expecting that if Biden takes office, they will be soon be implicated openly with something horrible, likely treasonous. And what that is is not really a mystery. They were all working for Russia. Either for money or because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat&quot;&gt;kompromat&lt;/a&gt;. There's an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_for_a_penny,_in_for_a_pound&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound&quot; that applies here. And who is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; implicated? The governor and secretary of state of Georgia and a few other Republican state officials who stood behind the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan. And very oddly -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;US AG Bill Barr&lt;/a&gt;. Amazingly, he didn't go along with the coverup. He appeared to be the most corrupt of them all, except for the Trump family. Go figure!</description>

They were all working for Russia. Either for money or because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat&quot;&gt;kompromat&lt;/a&gt;. There's an old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_for_a_penny,_in_for_a_pound&quot;&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound&quot; that applies here. And who is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; implicated? The governor and secretary of state of Georgia and a few other Republican state officials who stood behind the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan. And very oddly -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;US AG Bill Barr&lt;/a&gt;. Amazingly, he didn't go along with the coverup. He appeared to be the most corrupt of them all, except for the Trump family.

			<title>How to ask for help with software</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Three things your report must include: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What you did.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What you expected to happen.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What actually happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It may help to include a screen shot if it reveals something that is hard to communicate in words.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you can access the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/&quot;&gt;JavaScript console&lt;/a&gt;, take pictures of any messages in red, or anothing else that sounds like an error message.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're using free software rememeber that any person who helps you is doing the work for free. Make it easy for them and they're more likely to help. And when it works, say thank you. For good karma. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
