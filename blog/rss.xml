			<description>The best part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/31.html#a004613&quot;&gt;The Making of Sgt Pepper&lt;/a&gt; is the very last line, with Paul McCartney. &quot;The musical papers which you used to read, started to slag us off because we hadn't done anything, because it took five months to record. And I remember with great glee seeing in one of the papers 'ohh the Beatles have dried up, there's nothing going on, they've been in the studio, can't think, what are they doing. And I was sort of sitting rubbing my hands just saying Oh you just wait.&quot;</description>

			<description>A famous John Lennon quote. He was asked if Ringo was the best drummer he knew. “Ringo wasn’t the best drummer in the world,&quot; Lennon is said to have said. &quot;Let’s face it, he wasn’t even the best drummer in The Beatles.” Ringo complains about that in the video. He says all the other Beatles wish they were drummers. I think we were having our legs pulled.</description>
