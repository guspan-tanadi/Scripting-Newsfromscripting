			<description>Facebook is useful. Journalism is evil. This contrarian view is brought to you by open media. You will never hear these simple ideas on closed corporate media.</description>

			<description>The best podcasts are the ones with experts who simply share their expertise. So many podcasts begin with a long discussion about how everyone feels, with lots of chuckling and self-praise and inside jokes. No. One. Cares. The first time I noticed this was a podcast about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans&quot;&gt;The Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a great show that I loved, with cast members. That's cool. Talk about the characters you play. But I really don't care where you, the actor, grew up. Exceptions are obvious. If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot;&gt;Beatle&lt;/a&gt;, go ahead and talk about yourself. If you're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson&quot;&gt;Jack Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep&quot;&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;, yes please. I would like to know what makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Ernst&quot;&gt;Joni Ernst&lt;/a&gt; tick. But most experts aren't interesting as people. Your audience is looking to learn something, so teach us.</description>

			<description>As was pointed out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianstorms/status/1345045516644659211&quot;&gt;Brian Dear&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, it's now January 1, 2021, and I still haven't received a letter or email from the US government telling me how and when I'm going to get my Covid vaccine. As a user of Medicare, I am surprised they haven't yet sent me an email about this. This is actually the kind of thing they do at Medicare.</description>
