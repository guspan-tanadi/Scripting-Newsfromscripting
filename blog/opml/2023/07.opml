				<outline text="Something important about voting. Don't think of your vote as expressing yourself. It's not like First Amendment speech. Your vote is you governing us. We're like a fourth branch of government. We don't get to say who runs everything, just our part of everything. One vote is a small thing, but they add up to a decision. So when you vote for a third-party candidate, or you don't like any of the candidates and don't vote at all, you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; expressing yourself, but you are not governing. You don't like Hillary Clinton, so you stay home. You are not motivated. Then a few years later you're holed-up in your appartment, quarantined, because the government couldn't get its shit together to stop transmission of Covid. Or you're stuck with paying back your student loan because the court is 6-3 instead of 5-4. Because you and a lot of other people didn't &quot;like&quot; Hillary Clinton. See how whether you like her or not is beside the point? Or you or a family member has to carry a pregnancy to completion, have a baby you didn't want, or maybe die because your doctor couldn't figure out what the legislators meant, and didn't want to lose their medical license. So maybe next time, show up to govern. Put your feelings aside. Say what you feel on social media but use your mind when you vote.

I have a few things to say about that. First, I don't think that Twitter &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; changed its name, at least not yet. Reorienting all those memory cells in all those human brains isn't a matter of changing the logo on a home page or putting a big X on the roof of a San Francisco building. 17 years of repeated drill has burned the Twitter brand into our minds. Second, I don't think HBO changed its name to Max, in fact I think the new owners of HBO (and many other names) are preserving the value of the HBO name by taking it off the the streaming site, which is a hodgepodge of random content, some good, some not. HBO is a small part of that. Instead, they withdrew HBO from the set of popular streaming services, which are due for years of battle for dominance. Why drag the HBO name into that mess. It also may make it easier for them to spin HBO off, or sell it to another media conglomerate. I thought it was weird at first, but now it makes sense.

				<outline text="What Musk actually destroyed -- Twitter as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(geometry)&quot;&gt;vertex&lt;/a&gt; for a certain kind of news and discourse. Until late last year, almost everything I posted online would flow through Twitter. Today, very little does. Not by choice really, I'm not like other people who think that my not posting to a site has political meaning. It's more of a sense of &quot;does it belong there.&quot; It used to be that everything belonged there, that somehow it hadn't been said if it wasn't said on Twitter. That's a very recent and very fast change. It doesn't matter imho that Musk tries to change the name, what matters more is that he's given up on Twitter being &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; place of record. Kind of like what would happen if the US gave up on the dollar being the reserve currency. And of course people much like Musk are trying to make that happen. What if all this isn't a big mistake as people in the press seem to assume? What if more likely it's a plan being executed in front of our eyes. I think in general you should assume the latter, not that people you want to think are idiots actually are.

I had an early 90s Miata. I've owned a bunch of BMWs of varying quality. My Model Y combines the feel and agility of the Miata with the intoxicating power of my 2007 BMW 535i. I've had the Tesla for 1.5 years and I still feel it's a privilege &lt;i&gt;every time I drive it. &lt;/i&gt;That has never happened before, driving a great car usually becomes normal too fast. I pity people who are so one-dimensional that they think they understand everything about other people. I wouldn't want to be a relative of theirs, never would be a friend.

In hindsight, how foolish was it for Facebook to change its name to Meta. Google is still Google now whatever they changed their name to (yeah I remember, but it takes some effort to pull it up, and as I'm doing it, I'm reminded how much I don't care) Alphabet. These geniuses should study &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)&quot;&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt;.

But the smart money is on &lt;i&gt;responding&lt;/i&gt; to the problem, not running away from it, which 99 out of 100 people recognize this as. Classic example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/your-money/IHT-tylenol-made-a-hero-of-johnson-johnson-the-recall-that-started.html?unlocked_article_code=gWK-iA9wveiOjplePMkV9rusl42zxaU_Pvryh4Q-pWSVTiHcVIRZl0j9Gs1alyhNC6S17ugB-KdmrhO0hiIK5ekDKtatn8CTsf9f8_xknxRHGL-bmxPht7I83CBkyyD4jwhJVtQSdkZtRSLgGwHlAwh5JCcVcSFwiGTWK7OEu9ttcqdxuYahRef57njo0bPLYNn1c6-viHLu-lbo3lpRIokcpOh4jmTCQ1FMMLIOKK8LkR4bR3Hl9bkziIx2UvDAD69rBc4ctSPeNNUbs64VaWO2fN1MF4DdoXDi09ckve3Tn-16svkRa4XJJfQUQGf6uDVFM6K59jzVlKY6ieeaPj3tNzAnJWlvnCWPVywmGjitQ_VDtaFRu12N4ygQjXcqx__bzFS6J5T0Nzqy3jQ&amp;smid=url-share&quot;&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and Tylenol.

Think of another brand that sinned -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke&quot;&gt;Coca Cola&lt;/a&gt; with New Coke.

You get an idea, in this case it came from Adam Curry (thanks) and start figuring out how it will work. Then you make the software for both publishing and listening, and then publish Grateful Dead music, thinking all the people will now figure it out but they don't. So you try something else and another thing, and you give up for a while. Then you meet an NPR guy and ask him if he wants to try this idea out. For some reason he says yes, when everyone else said no or didn't listen. So you get that going, and it's great and for sure you figure now everyone will get it, but they don't. So a year later in frustration you decide to put out your own show, and do it again and again, and leave the freaking mistakes in, and because of that people get the idea that Hey if that schmuck can do it, I bet I can too, and 20 or 30 people start doing it, and it's fun, and from there, it builds and after four years you have the start of a new medium. And no that idiot journalist did not give this new medium its name.

I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3k2jrmmygel2w&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I don't think they or anyone else can afford to stand against abuse on the web, it's diseconomic.

				<outline text="Over the last couple of days I moved &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/&quot;&gt;this.how&lt;/a&gt; to an HTTPS server. It was fairly painless, but it did break some pages. If you have an &lt;i&gt;img&lt;/i&gt; element in the HTML or use the &lt;i&gt;image&lt;/i&gt; attribute in OPML, and the url of the image is on HTTP, the browser will refuse to load it, and at least on Chrome it'll look like it's still loading for a long time, possibly forever. For most of these, I'll never get around to fixing them, it just is what it is. So HTTPS despite the hype, no matter whether you convert or not, still breaks the web, and Google must know all about this and doesn't care. If a platform vendor really cared about the web as a platform, they'd look at the risk in reading an img over http and say wtf, let it go. They're like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt;, they have you by the balls, you know it and they know it.

I guess all feed readers have this problem, and I guess images from &quot;Scripting News&quot; have always been broken? But this isn't how I remember it. Hmmm. Maybe they're doing something special, like accessing the image through a proxy running outside of Chrome's control. Haha if so &lt;i&gt;holy shit.&lt;/i&gt; Either it's a security problem or it isn't. I really don't think images need to be protected, but what do I know.

				<outline text="I'm starting to think about writing a validator for the W3C's feed validator. A validator-validator. I'd submit my feed to it via a web service (not sure if they have an API), and if that feed doesn't validate with the W3C validator, and we believe it is valid per the RSS 2.0 spec, we would open an issue on their repo. Maybe if they want to be really cooperative, they could run the test feeds against their validator whenever they make an update as part of the validation process, and never release a version where those feeds didn't validate. This would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/allay&quot;&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; my concern about them breaking RSS because they don't respect or understand the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. I'd start with the Scripting News RSS feed, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscripting.com%2Frss.xml&quot;&gt;does validate&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validation.png&quot;&gt;this time&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, their warnings are bogus imho. They should recognize the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Source namespace&lt;/a&gt; not warn me about it. A copyright statement can and should be able to have a &amp;copy; character. Why not? The spec doesn't prohibit it, and it's part of the language we use for copyright. And this is not an Atom feed so that warning about Atom was a bad move. The authors of the original validator were promoting Atom at the expense of RSS. Why not put that to bed, it's not exactly an ethical thing for a validator to do imho.

				<outline text="Over on Masto and Blueski you hear a lot of people rooting for Twitter's demise. I am not one of them.Twitter is deeply installed in our society. It would take a long time to rebuild something like Twitter, and I don't think it's even possible. I don't like Musk's politics, an understatement, but I see that problem as possible to overcome.

				<outline text="This is a test. I realized something, ever since &quot;FeedLand&quot; moved to email identity and therefore had to use HTTPS to protect the passwords, any time I include an image in the right margin of a blog post, it has to also be served by HTTPS or else the browser will refuse to load it when the item is viewed in FeedLand. It has probably also meant that the right-margin images weren't showing up in other RSS systems for much longer. So anyway, if you see the delicious &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2010/11/12/loveRss.gif&quot;&gt;Love RSS icon&lt;/a&gt; in the right margin of this post in FeedLand that means I've found a workaround that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/itWorked.png&quot;&gt;works&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="As with most online services, there's a virtually impenetrable wall between users and the people who run Bluesky. Has to be that way. There are hundreds of thousands of us, maybe tens of them. They're having trouble keeping the system running. As I dig in more on Bluesky, not because I'm getting married to the platform, btw -- more friends reach out and ask for help getting an invite code. It isn't about Bluesky though, it's just that we got &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html&quot;&gt;the feeds up&lt;/a&gt; there first, so there's a way I can build. Ultimately my goal is to build a layer on top of all the social nets I can, so it doesn't matter which service you use, the stuff I create can make it to you and will. I used to write about &quot;when a big tree falls it creates room for new growth.&quot; I wrote that about Jerry Garcia. And it's equally true about Twitter. As they vacate, and get smaller and more focused, I believe understandably, the places they vacate once again become interesting places to develop. I can't miss an opportunities like these.
