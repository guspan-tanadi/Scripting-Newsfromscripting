				<outline text="I've already watched the last episode of Succession about five times, and I expect to watch it a few more. As my understanding grows, I hear different parts. I swear there could be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt; thing going on here. Anyway, yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/30.html#a122242&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about bullshit and about how Tom didn't win if winning means being the chosen successor of Logan Roy. That was the Swede. My jaw dropped when &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/30/bullshitBullshitEverythingsBullshit.png&quot;&gt;Roman said&lt;/a&gt; they were bullshit. There's that word. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/30.html#a122242&quot;&gt;Bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. The kids were bullshit. Nothing. Tom was a great choice to be the new Gerri. The book closes so neatly. The ending wasn't dramatic like the ending of the Sopranos or Mad Men, or clever like Six Feet Under. it was more like the ending of The Wire, things just wound down in a natural way. The truth was the people who really run the world (a &quot;world of a father,&quot; says Shiv) are Logans. The people we see on the news shows are Toms.

The fans and their employees made demands, and the band gave them what they wanted. I had never heard the story of the Dead told this way, but it matches up with the facts I have from living through that period myself, and going to quite a few Dead shows, and being one step removed from people who worked in the Dead company, and almost dying myself from similar kinds of pressure. Ultimately if you want to live, you have to not be selfless. " created="Sun, 28 May 2023 19:26:16 GMT"/>

Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters&quot;&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. The top of the journalism food chain, where they all want to be. In the last episode she talked about how many times she had talked with Rupert Murdoch, who the patriarch of Succession is patterned after. That was a strange idea for me. Not only have I never spoken with him, if I were to meet him, I probably wouldn't find anything he said interesting. I went to a lot of conferences in the 80s with people like him. I hated it. Yet my vision of tech has been implemented, in the interim. She and I live in dramatically versions of tech. We don't even remotely speak the same language. Yet she is considered an authority on what tech has value and doesn't. That was the big epiphany for me, the moment I realized we are completely living in different worlds. She created this Facebook, Twitter, Spotify world as much as Zuckerberg, Musk or Ek. So if you don't like the way it turned out, you shouldn't look in that direction for leadership. That said she does good interviews, I will miss the podcast after next week, although I gotta say they could probably keep doing it for &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; and still be interesting. Succession is great TV, terrible reality. :boom:" created="Wed, 24 May 2023 16:05:18 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/01/mrFrog.png"/>

				<outline text="An old friend Steve Smith, who tends to like sports teams from Los Angeles, asks how I could not admire LeBron James. I suppose I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; admire him, if I wasn't so tired of him. And I don't like what he pioneered in basketball, the idea that a player not a team wins championships. He did that when he moved to Miami and then back to Cleveland and now in Los Angeles. His selling proposition was &quot;buy my contract and I'll bring you a championship.&quot; I had enough of that when he relocated to Cleveland. I've seen other players do it, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Kevin Durant&lt;/a&gt; who I also despise, and teams that fall for it over and over like the Brooklyn Nets, only to find out not only that it doesn't (usually) work, but that who the fuck cares if &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; how you win a championship. Another reason I don't like LeBron is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+melo&quot;&gt;Melo&lt;/a&gt; can't get a job and LeBron still has one. They're of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NBA_draft&quot;&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, and Melo never won a championship, that's his own fault, not blaming LeBron for that. But everyone from LeBron's era is retired now, except LeBron and maybe Chris Paul, who's probably been done for a couple of years now and hasn't admitted it yet. And I don't like Los Angeles teams in general, having lived in New York and the Bay Area, that factors into it as well.

				<outline text="I think that net-net Bluesky is a good thing, because it guarantees we'll have at least two incompatible social internets. Had they supported ActivityPub that would probably have slowed everything down to the pace of something like Ecmascript. All kinds of bizarre unnecessary adventures and lots of breakage. I'd rather deal with the same problem the designers of the internet solved with TCP/IP. Interestingly, we have been at this almost-exact place before in the early 00s, when the two &quot;biggest&quot; vendors, in some sense (neither were very big) were Blogger and UserLand. We had a big sprawling API for our Manila system. And then Blogger came out with a much smaller API for theirs. I wanted to just move over to their API so we could be compatible, but we needed more features because our product did more. But we only added what was absolutely necessary to keep it small. So first we supported the Blogger API. I think that surprised them. Pretty sure it did. Then we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/03/14.html&quot;&gt;came out with&lt;/a&gt; a slightly bigger API called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlrpc.com/storyreader/story2198.md&quot;&gt;MetaWeblog API&lt;/a&gt;. They both became instant standards. To this day WordPress supports MetaWeblog. And here we are again. We need what the MetaWeblog API did, and it should cover: 1. Mastodon. 2. Bluesky. 3. Twitter (it's still got the biggest installed base, even if the CEO is dangerous). 4. WordPress (of course, it already does). I'm also going to put out a reference implementation that supports all the features of the &quot;textcasting&quot; plan. And hope we get a great new layer to build on and no single company gets to push us into a corner and lock the door. Make text like podcasting. That's the idea.

				<outline text="One of the most frustrating things about developers who get in charge of standards, is when there's already a consenus among developers to do something the same way, they'll come out with something that does the same thing, but works completely differently. By the time this happens, most of the devs of the original apps are gone, and the owners of the app either hire someone who doesn't know what they're doing and they release buggy and incomplete support for the new way, or they decide to just to turn it off, and hope no one notices. Something happened like this yesterday, when I was setting up a new instance of some well-vetted &lt;i&gt;recent&lt;/i&gt; software, and found that it didn't build with the current Node version. So I set up a new server, took an hour or so, and got the latest version of everything running, figuring that the app would now run. It did not. So I had to dig more. Eventually after taking a nap to clear my head, I came back and found the problem. The developers of a very very very small bit of code had decided to break every app that used it. And it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji/releases/tag/v2.0.2&quot;&gt;recent enough&lt;/a&gt; that I couldn't find a trail that explained the workaround. Eventually I figured how to work around it, burned the better part of a day, just because someone was feeling powerful or angry, unloved or I don't know what.

So you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=%40davew&quot;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt; in your feed reader. This is important for two reasons: 1. At this time Bluesky is still private, so if I give you a pointer to something I wrote there, you won't be able to see it. The feed gets around that restriction. 2. Because Mastodon also has RSS feeds, I can read both social nets with the same API. It gives us a common language, and is the next step in bootstrapping RSS support in all social media apps.

				<outline text="There are so many things wrong with Bluesky. I've started to list them on Bluesky itself, but I seriously doubt any people on the team will pay attention. What we need more than anything are social networks that don't bury their heads in the sand and try to do it all themselves. They're making the same mistakes Twitter made, but 17 years later, with the benefit of hindsight that they are not using. And they re-invent old things, when the world solved those problems a long time ago. For example, they handle links the same way I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20000815211629/http://scriptingnews.userland.com/xml/scriptingnews2.xml&quot;&gt;Scripting News format&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;.

How could they believe that it will work this way. &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod&quot;&gt;Prior art&lt;/a&gt;. Please. Yes I like the user interface because it is so much like Twitter it's like comfort food. But that isn't enough. We liked a lot of things for a while, but then the limits will catch up. Again what we need is what's spelled out in the &quot;Textcasting&quot; spec. &lt;b&gt;A social network that works for writers&lt;/b&gt;.

				<outline text="BTW, I've re-learned recently that the hate some people in Silicon Valley have for me is real. Obviously I've known about it for years. There have been some really egregious outbursts, like the time I was invited to Mozilla to explain &quot;RSS&quot; from my point of view and it was an ambush. The source of the hate in some cases must be jealousy -- I guess they feel constrained by having jobs inside shit companies that they feel that limits their creativity. They must think what I do is easy, and if only they had the freedom to create whatever they want they could do what I do. I've seen that in action. I also write publicly and I try to be interesting in the way I write, partially because I write to amuse myself, but I also try hard not to make it personal. I don't mind telling Jack Dorsey, for example, to sit down, because he's a very public figure and his actions have big consequences. Just one example. I also feel free to say that I think the culture of Silicon Valley is poisonous. The rest of the world seems to have caught on to that idea. Or some people just don't like me as a person. But that's no excuse to behave awfully. I find that when I do something awful, I hurt myself more than the other person. I learned that a long time ago, so I try hard not to do it. I empathize with them a bit, they feel pain and try to give a little of it to me. Something like this just happened on Bluesky. A &quot;joke&quot; about exactly what I'm writing about here. I thought about responding to it on Bluesky, but instead blocked the troll and respond here instead. You should care about how you treat people, especially people who your peers have decided it's okay to hate on. You don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to behave badly. And if you do that's your choice, it's not something you can blame them for. :boom:" created="Thu, 11 May 2023 11:25:59 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/03/mrToad.png"/>
				<outline text="Also when I say Mozilla is a shit company (I didn't actually &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; it, but it was a pretty obvious connection) it should be understood that is imho only. Some people think Mozilla is the best company ever. Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;blind men and the elephant&lt;/a&gt;. In my experience Mozilla has always been an impediment to progress. They are careless and mean-spirited. Why? It has no culture, no vision, no engineering philosophy. A lot of immature people running wild. A frat-house atmosphere. And saying Mozilla is shitty is not much of a distinction, most if not all Silicon Valley companies are shitty. I think the underlying cause is that there are far too many programmers. If we had better (and fewer) platforms and tools then individuals could make their own software, they wouldn't have to work at companies. I'm certainly a test-case for that. It works for me, though I wish it were easier. Silicon Valley has zero respect for people who do it themselves. They don't even admit we exist. :smile:" created="Thu, 11 May 2023 13:07:01 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/30/beetlejuice.png"/>
				<outline text="Follow-up on the iPad transfer &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/05/10.html#a155235&quot;&gt;saga&lt;/a&gt;. I finally found a way that works. Before starting, go to the old iPad, and in Settings, choose a command that prepares the iPad for the transfer by backing it up to iCloud (I don't remember what the command was, but they make it easy to find because they apparently remember you're trying to do this). The iCloud service is free for this purpose. Then wipe the new iPad and when it boots up, it'll offer an opportunity to use the iCloud backup. By choosing this, you remove the old iPad from the update. This is important because if it isn't involved, it can't time-out. Then let it update the OS (you don't have a choice) and once that's done, let it go ahead and use the iCloud backup. This means you have to stick around while it's updating the OS, a process that takes about 1/2 hour. The good news is, after that, it will do the transfer without any more interaction. I came back a few hours later and the new iPad was exactly like the old one. It remembers all your passwords, so you don't even have to enter them again. I think Apple could make this work better by writing some docs that tell you to do basically what I've said here, and save the users a lot of time, and since I already returned a new iPad because I couldn't get this to work, they would make real money from making this work better. I bought a &quot;renewed&quot; iPad which costs considerably less than a new one, and none of this money went to Apple. BTW, I think &quot;renewed&quot; in my case meant a new iPad in shrinkwrap, from a couple of years ago, that was never sold for some reason. :rocket:" created="Thu, 11 May 2023 11:15:15 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/08/18/indianaJones.png"/>

				<outline text="I'm trying once again to transfer the contents of an old iPad to a new iPad. It insists on installing a new version of the OS before proceeding. While that is happening the original iPad times out. When I try to restart the transfer, it hangs. Come back hours later, still hung. Then I tried to get the new machine to restore factory settings but it wouldn't accept my password, after a long wait. Tried it three or four times and thought maybe it needs wifi turned on to do this. It does. Okay now, with the new machine restored to factory settings, it has started the new OS install again. I started this at 7AM, now it's almost noon. I did do other stuff. My wifi is fast btw, so installing a new version here should be fast relative to other setups. But after all this time I don't believe I'm any closer to having the transfer of data even start. It's starting to look like reinstalling all the apps and data by hand would be faster.

I don't follow very many people there, and I don't know how I would do that quickly enough for it to color my impression. There's so much more on Twitter. As much as insiders are repelled by the new Twitter management, and I'm one of them, I think most people who use Twitter are far above that, to them it's just noise, and life goes on as always. There was a very interesting episode of Succession last night, and there are lots of good memes on Twitter. I haven't seen anything on Bluesky. But as quiet as Bluesky is, it makes Mastodon look even quieter. Ultimately we join these networks for companionship, it's a trip to the water cooler, or a walk around the block during a workday, or while watching a sports game. The new services have a steep hill to climb. The focus on technology has largely been a distraction in that context. What matters, as always, is not the tech -- but the people. And Twitter is still far ahead of the others, despite all the wishful thinking to the contrary.

						<outline text="The US government is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1700s/1791_First_Bank/&quot;&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. " created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:16:44 GMT"/>

						<outline text="A lot of people put their money in the government bank, even though it doesn't pay the highest interest, because unlike all other banks, it's thought to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Savings_Bonds#:~:text=They%20are%20considered%20one%20of,of%20the%20United%20States%20government.&quot;&gt;safest place to put money&lt;/a&gt;. When you want it back, to spend, or give to a relative or friend, or invest in stocks, the odds are nearly 100% that you will get the money." created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:17:22 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Why do people feel that way about the US government bank? Because it's one of the core values of the US. The first treasury secretary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/alexander-hamilton-debt-national-bank-two-parties-1789-american-history-great-courses-plus-180962954/&quot;&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, set it up this way. In all the years since 1776, through a civil war, depressions, two world wars, the United States has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; met its obligation to return money to lenders. " created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:18:29 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Now sometimes terrible things happen, and a bank can't give money back to depositors. What happens then is: 1. There's a run on the bank by depositors and the bank fails. Depositors lose their money, or 2. Some larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposit, and the run stops, because confidence returns among creditors. " created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:20:05 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The &quot;larger institution&quot; often is the United States government, because it is the most solvent bank in the world for the simple reason that we are the only entity that can print money that will be accepted everywhere in the world. It's an incredible privilege to have. Imagine if you could buy anything you want just by writing a check. It wouldn't matter if you &quot;had&quot; the money, because you can print the money. It's as if the check itself were worth money. It's why all the comparisons to smaller countries like Greece are ridiculous. Greece can print money if they want to, but people will only accept dollars not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma&quot;&gt;drachmas&lt;/a&gt;. We can have anything we want and as much of it as we want and all we have to do is invent the money to pay for it! (Obviously if we abused this privilege in a way that seriously hurt the world economy there would be a problem, so we don't do that.)" created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:45:00 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Okay, now suppose one day, just for the hell of it, the government decides to try defaulting, for some reason that's hard to fathom. Remember, we have the ability to pay the bills. It's as if you told Visa or MasterCard that you weren't paying your bill, but please don't ruin my credit rating because I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; pay, it's just that I don't want to. By defaulting I mean, a depositor goes to the bank and ask for their money, and the teller hands them a card that says &quot;Sorry no money for you.&quot; Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlQYBcsq54&quot;&gt;Soup Nazi&lt;/a&gt; in Seinfeld. As a depositor you would be very angry and you'd tweet about it to tell everyone what happened, and they'd all go to the bank and demand their money, and voila, you have a run on the bank. That would probably be the first thing that happened after a default. Everyone who had money on deposit with the US government would demand it back so they could put it somewhere that wasn't managed by lunatics. But because we're defaulting we give everyone the &quot;No money for you&quot; card instead of their money. " created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:23:28 GMT"/>
						<outline text="What normally happens in a bank run, a larger institution steps in and guarantees the deposits, can't happen here because there is no institution larger than the US government. So what happens? No one knows. But it won't be good, that's for sure. We got a small taste of it in 2008 when a relatively small bank, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers&quot;&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, was over-extended, and a run resulted, and as a result other banks who had money in Lehman, couldn't get it, they started defaulting, and the economy of the &lt;i&gt;whole world&lt;/i&gt; froze. Shipping stopped. Airlines couldn't fly. It was a very scary time. The US government started writing checks, huge checks, and we just got through it by the skin of our teeth. But again, this time, it's the US government defaulting and no one can play that role in this meltdown." created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:27:52 GMT"/>
						<outline text="If we're lucky, and people believe they can trust China or the European Union, they might write off the assets they have stored in the US, and never use our bank as the safest place to store value, because we all lost so much in the run that followed the default. We'd start storing value in Chinese or European currency. And the US would become an ordinary country, with no special ability to print money that everyone accepts. It won't be a recession in the US, instead we will see an invisible support for our economy disappear in an instant. Some of it already disappeared, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades#Background&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; we flirted with default. But if we actually default, the US economy will become much less potent. We no longer will have the ability to print money to pay our bills. Now some people will tell you that's a good thing, but they're the worst kind of idiot. It's like saying it's better to be homeless because you don't have to pay rent. We won't have an idea how our lives are elevated by this privilege until we lose it. It's been there for our whole lives. " created="Sun, 07 May 2023 12:32:06 GMT"/>

Most of my relatives had strong opinions and stated them often and did not welcome dissent. My father and mother. Both grandfathers. My maternal grandmother. Uncle Ken. They all had opinions about everything. Sometimes they even changed their minds, to their credit. And one hid something about himself that I learned later from Wikipedia (amazingly my maternal grandfather was a communist, still not sure I believe it, Wikipedia is often full of misinfo). Anyway the point is that all the people I listed are now dead. If anyone cared about their opinions when they were alive (I don't think anyone did) they certainly don't care about them now. Soon enough you and I will be dead. So go ahead and have the opinions if it makes you happy. But if it makes you miserable, as it often did for my relatives, consider not bothering because simply does not matter. And the stupid thing is we've built our networks around the idea that opinions matter. Think of all the wasted bandwidth and server space. Maybe it'd be better if the AI bots win. At least they don't repeat themselves all the time with complaints about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti&quot;&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt; and whatnot.

I also was a machine language programmer at one time, where you had no choice, this was the way you wrote code. Intermediate values went in registers, R0-R7.

				<outline text="I have a 5th generation iPad Mini that I use all the time. It's a couple of years old and the battery doesn't hold a charge very well. So I decided to treat myself to a new mini, and since there's a new version, the 6th generation, I went for that. I also decided to get 64GB instead of the 256GB I have on the current one, because these days most of the video I watch is streamed, not downloaded, and I don't use that much space, or so I thought. After four attempts to transfer the contents of the old iPad to the new one, each one taking hours, I gave up. The design of the transfer app is terrible. You have to be there for the whole process, because it asks questions after long pauses. It doesn't do enough preflighting. So it takes an hour before it decides it can't do the transfer because the old one has too much data for the new one. I hoped they would do something smarter than just refusing to do the transfer. I don't really care if it moves any of the movies or audio files. What matters is that it correctly moves the apps and the configuration data for the apps, the stuff that takes a huge amount of time to do manually. In the end, I realized this wasn't any fun, and remembered how Steve Jobs obsessed over the unwrapping experience of new Apple products, and felt sad that Apple didn't hold on to that value very well. Instead I'm going to buy a 5th gen iPad Mini from Amazon and save a hundred dollars. I won't be able to do a trade-in, so maybe I'll find a deserving person to send my old iPad to instead. Or maybe I'll just stick with the old mini until its battery completely fails. " created="Wed, 03 May 2023 11:57:00 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/05/03/ipadMini.png"/>
