Work your way up the list. Those were amazing days, lots of firsts and imho lots of fun. I kept the archive because I hoped at some point someone would want to know how it happened. Maybe grad students will do a thesis on this stuff? This is a new medium being born. I tried to keep good records. Also recommend looking at Scripting News archives for 2004 as well.

					<outline text="Having done it with &quot;FeedLand&quot;, I was starting to think about how to wean &quot;Drummer&quot; off Twitter identity, and had a stunning realization -- it may not be necessary, since (I believe, haven't tested yet) it might be possible to host Drummer from a FeedLand instance. " created="Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:01:11 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/15/kristaps.png"/>
					<outline text="I would actually have to do it to be sure there aren't any roadblocks I haven't foreseen. But they're both running the same server software, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/daveappserver&quot;&gt;daveappserver&lt;/a&gt;, and once you've established an identity in FeedLand I don't see why it can't be used with Drummer. " created="Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:22:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Ken Smith was tripping out on the synergies between Drummer and FeedLand. This, if it works, would blow the doors off that. They would be storing their data in the same place. You would be able to open your FeedLand bookmarks menu in Drummer, to start. " created="Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:21:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I figured something else out. I was wondering what would happen if Twitter broke their identity with developers like me as they did with the clients, how would we transition Drummer then? I don't want people to have to start over. I could ask them to do what I asked FeedLand users to do, is make a connection between their Twitter identity and an email address, as a backup. But this would have to be done before any outage. Something most people probably wouldn't do. " created="Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:23:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then I realized we would be able to do what we do now when we want to associate an email address with a domain, ask the user to post something to their Twitter account, some magic string. When we see it in their timeline, voila, we know they are who they say they are and we can move the files to the new server. So we can relax. Users shouldn't have to lose data if Twitter pulls the plug." created="Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:29:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One more thing, when Twitter was blowing up, I was getting harassed by idiots (no other word for it sorry) who didn't understand that you can't unwind a connection just by snapping your fingers. Identity is baked into an app at a deep level. And, when it already has users, and has gone through a ship cycle, you can't just flip a switch or everything you worked so hard for would just fall apart. It would be like, for example, making the NYC subway system run on a different track gauge. Sure you could do it, but it might take a few weeks. :smile:" created="Mon, 30 Jan 2023 15:29:57 GMT"/>

We kept throwing ideas out there, and it wasn't until MCN in the summer of 2004 that other people got the idea that &lt;i&gt;they could do it.&lt;/i&gt; That was the breakthrough. You didn't need a big studio and money to produce good audio programming. That's what MCN did. It was as crucial to the growth of podcasting as Serial or The Daily were many years later.

You'd think that we'd get the new version of package1 but we don't. The only way to get it to update that I've discovered is to make a change to package3, publish it, and then npm update. But nothing changed in package3, why should I have to rebuild it just to get the change reflected in the app. I have a feeling that this is because NPM modifies the package.json that NPM passes up the chain of require's?

The mail-sending software had never encountered such a thing before, and it turns out there was an assumption that all linkblog entries would always have links.

Adding a protection against such a situation was also easy. This is how software gets mature.

						<outline text="Here's a parallel. My TV doesn't have a brightness control.

Maybe if TVs never had brightness controls I wouldn't miss it, but they do in my mind, require one. Same thing here. &lt;i&gt;Like&lt;/i&gt; is something that's part of the language of social media.

					<outline text="I've been bingeing some highly rated but very mediocre TV series. What makes them so bad is how they present human relations.

The person who is supposedly hurting, or sad, confused, troubled, about to die, grieving some horrific event (that we might know about) puts on a happy face and says &quot;No everything's fine, what makes you think I'm hurting, sad, confused etc?&quot; We know it's fake and so does the accuser. I imagine that a lot of people watching it think this kind of interaction is okay, but it's actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting&quot;&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; which is a terrible thing to do to another person." created="Mon, 02 Jan 2023 21:51:54 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/02/thePetries.png"/>
					<outline text="Another thing is how they portray romantic relationships. A wife is dancing wildly at a party. The husband grabs her and takes her home, and on the way back explains how embarrassing her behavior was to him. I want to yell at him -- hey who cares if you're embarrased. It has nothing to do with you. And she was having fun. I can imagine being married to you is pretty stressful. Etc etc. Or a young dude once gets to have sex with an older woman and is therefore obsessed with her for his whole life, even after he's married to a very nice age-appropriate woman. The way he describes his feelings might be the way an infant would describe their relationship with a caregiver. &quot;Without you I can't live,&quot; he says. Sorry but that's bullshit. The baby is dependent. No matter how you feel, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; live without your age-inappropriate GF. " created="Mon, 02 Jan 2023 21:56:18 GMT"/>

				<outline text="My wish for us, in the blogging world, for the new year. We'll know it's working if most people feel their best place to write is their blog, where the editing tools work just as they like them to, and there are no boundaries to where those ideas can be published." created="Mon, 02 Jan 2023 03:11:24 GMT" type="outline"/>

Every day she teaches us something about what's happening, in a historic context. This is blogging at its best. If she has a business model it isn't in your face. She has something to add and she does it generously and with great expertise and sass. A role model for us all, and a perfect example of the blogging ethos and a perfect choice for my 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty&quot;&gt;BOTY&lt;/a&gt;." created="Mon, 02 Jan 2023 03:29:15 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Mastodon has a cute way to validate sites as being yours. If you put your masto address in the text of the site that's good enough. But it has to be HTTPS. Oh well. I think they get most things right at Masto, but the trying to force people to adopt HTTPS is selling out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and their thirst to own the web, which is imho not theirs to own.

				<outline text="A new application for AI. Rate the humor level of a tweeted &quot;joke&quot; response.
