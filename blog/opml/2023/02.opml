I want to see all the comments I've posted in reverse chronologic order. Where is that command? Then it hit me, they need &quot;ChatGPT&quot; as the UI of their product. Let's give it a try. &quot;In Facebook, how do I see a reverse chronologic list of all the comments I've left on other people's posts?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/28/chatgptguide.png&quot;&gt;Here's the result&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="A few days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/06.html#a153119&quot;&gt;asked Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt; where we go to talk about ideas for making our products work together in interesting new ways. Where do we go to congregate? I just watched a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/19.html#a160614&quot;&gt;fantastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Laurel-Canyon-Season-1/dp/B0882JGTTV&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Laurel Canyon in Hollywood in the 60s and 70s, near &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Strip&quot;&gt;Sunset Strip&lt;/a&gt;, which had lots of bars, for all kinds of music and the musicians who made the music. Lots of famous names. People who created a generation of pop music, with lots of collaboration. This is a necessary component for tech. When I first arrived in Silicon Valley in 1979, I kept looking for the pulse of the place. Where do people meet up. And within hours I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almanacnews.com/square/2007/05/09/what-are-your-memories-of-kens-house-of-pancakes-in-menlo-park&quot;&gt;Ken's House of Pancakes&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/888+El+Camino+Real,+Menlo+Park,+CA+94025/@37.4524062,-122.1802984,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fa4b21d83e8ef:0xd20e5a3bace86209!8m2!3d37.4525122!4d-122.1802369!16s%2Fg%2F11b8v7w2wj&quot;&gt;El Camino&lt;/a&gt; in Menlo Park &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almanacnews.com/morgue/1999/1999_03_17.kens.html&quot;&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; a good place.

Okay so now we're on the web, we've been here for 30 freaking years. Where do you go if you have an idea you want to share ideas with other developers, who may not develop for the same platform, or work for a large company. This is missing. At one point the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg000001.html&quot;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt; on this blog served that purpose, but it was taken over by trolls, of course.

				<outline text="I don't believe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2023/02/27/rounding-up-to.html&quot;&gt;character limits&lt;/a&gt; in blog posts. I hope in a few years all these discussions about what's the optimal number of characters for a post will be seen as farce, like the scene in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)&quot;&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt; where the Emperor says Mozart's opera has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMWy3EpEo_o&amp;t=29s&quot;&gt;too many notes&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think it's up to Emperors or software developers to have opinions on what's the right number of characters in my writing. What if in turn, as a writer, I said your code couldn't have more 500 characters per file. What's the likelihood that this edict would make any sense? Hopefully that puts it in perspective. There's a simple solution available to everyone, a &lt;i&gt;More&lt;/i&gt; link at some arbitrary breakpoint, that does enough to encourage short posts if that's what you're after. And it also makes sense to writers.  " created="Mon, 27 Feb 2023 14:51:50 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/27/mrPeanutButter.png"/>

				<outline text="I keep finding legit tasks for &quot;ChatGPT&quot;. For example, I have a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlCloud/blob/main/desktop/iobridge.js&quot;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; that hooks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt; up to websockets. If a file is modified, a message goes to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/opmlCloud/tree/main/server&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn forwards the message to N listeners. Chokidar is a very nice utility with lots of configuration options, but sparse docs. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to improve latency, ie the time it takes for a change to a file to be noticed and acted on. The docs provide some vague clues, but when I asked ChatGPT if I could adjust the latency, it gave me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2023/02/27/reducelatencychokidar.png&quot;&gt;clear yes&lt;/a&gt;, and showed me how to do it. Also suggested there might be lesser-known toolkits that would be better for this kind of application. " created="Mon, 27 Feb 2023 19:37:07 GMT" type="outline"/>

Electric Drummer is essential software to my daily work. I do all my for-work writing here.

					<outline text="Another favorite movie, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/heaven-can-wait&quot;&gt;Heaven Can Wait&lt;/a&gt;, starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. He plays a football star named Joe Pendleton who is accidentally killed but when he gets to heaven they realize the error and send him back to earth in the body of Leo Farnsworth, a rich capitalist who is among other things is screwing a town where Julie Christie's family lives and she has come to protest. But Joe is a sweetheart hippie type, and a really a nice guy but he's in the body of an asshole. They fall in love anyway, but then the angel (played by James Mason) says Joe has to give up the body of the asshole, it's his turn to die for real, but he can have the body of another football player, so he tells Julie to watch out for a stranger who has a twinkle in his eye, and she has no idea wtf he's talking about. But then Farnsworth dies, and she's somehow at the big football game and meets the quarterback (who is really Joe but doesn't realize it) and they go off for coffee and you can tell they're going to fall in love and all is good.

				<outline text="BTW, I've now been through switching two HTTP apps to HTTPS, and what they say about it being easy to retrofit is just marketing, ie nah, it's no more true than Node is single-threaded. In some cases, for a simple static website, it can be totally automatic. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;. It's a miracle, if you think HTTPS is a requirement. But if you're talking about an app like &quot;Drummer&quot; or &quot;FeedLand&quot;, it's a pretty large undertaking, with cascading problems, and fraught with opportunities for breakage that could be hard to find (I'll let you know in a year or two, knock wood). Using HTTPS means you have to use it in everything the app comes in contact with. Google and EFF as bright as they are haven't anticipated every way of building software on the net. This was a lesson I had learned before. We thought converting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/17/science/personal-computers-software-first-idea-processor.html&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt; from the IBM PC and Apple II to the Mac would be easy. Ultimately we had to write a new product from scratch. The assumptions were different. But in that case &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; made the choice, not Google and the EFF.

				<outline text="I need an outliner to manage my email drafts. In a perfect world I'd be able to plug one in. But we are very far from that. We were closer in the late 80s and early 90s. That was my goal then, to turn the apps of a GUI into toolkits for people who wrote scripts to connect them to create their own applications. Why should I have to write a whole word processor to have a new feature that no one else knows they need. If I could hook my emailer up to my outliner, I would get better use of the drafts I wrote. The ultimate goal is to do all my writing in my favorite writing app, and send &lt;i&gt;pointers&lt;/i&gt; to the writing to the other apps, emailers, chat apps, CMSes, there would be only one original, and if I made a change to the original the updates would flow to all the places I sent pointers. Again we were much closer to this 30 years ago than we are now. But I think we have a chance to start fresh now with these goals. That's when you want to do this kind of integration for interop, at the beginning, before there are any apps. It's very hard to retrofit later, I can't say I've ever seen it work.

Finally I got a new doctor and after two visits and one visit to a specialist, we had it nailed down, I got treatment and it's getting better. That's a full year of dealing with a problem because no one doctor could focus on the problem long enough to see what the problem was.

				<outline text="Coming back from deep in the innards of FeedLand and Drummer, where both are learning HTTPS. Under development, not yet ready for users. But here's something cute. If FeedLand supports HTTPS in all its functionality, it will end up demanding that people with feeds support HTTPS too, and will fail for those who don't. If we continue down this path, I will be doing Google's work, helping them take ownership of the web. Here's the deal. Suppose you're displaying an item from a feed that includes an image. Suppose that image is served from an HTTP website, but your reader is running HTTPS. You won't see the image. The browser will refuse to load it. This came up when Scott Hanson tried to look at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/08/022722.html&quot;&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from Scripting News that contained a painting from René Magritte.

But the first problem I see is that they think (apparently) that each dev has a single app. Which for me is far from the truth. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/12/whyIMovedOffHeroku.html&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; made the same mistake, they came up with what they felt was a fair price, assuming the developer made one big app. The problem is with a free product running for so many years, we made lots of really small apps. Why build something huge if the idea is small. The cost of staying with Heroku would have been totally diseconomic when full servers could run all my apps for $10 a month. Why should I pay Heroku $500 for the same thing, even though I had to do a lot of work to dig out of the hole. Now with Twitter, I think I'll just bow out, and let other people find out if this is workable or not. I'll leave my servers running, and if they stop working, we'll figure out what if anything to do then. None of the apps I've made that depend on Twitter are worth $100 a month to keep running. That's another story, because the Twitter ecosystem for cool utilities was practically non-existent.

To deploy shortly after, with fingers crossed, praise &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law&quot;&gt;Murphy&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="&lt;s style=&quot;opacity: 0.9&quot;&gt;Note to people who read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;linkblog tab&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News and in the nightly email. &quot;Radio3&quot;, the tool I use for linkblogging, relies on Twitter identity. Twitter is not allowing me to log in. I see that's happening for other users too, but I've also heard of users who are able to log on to Radio3 via Twitter. Obviously I'm going to have to fix that app too. Until that happens, the linkblog will not be updating. Can't be helped.&lt;/s&gt; I'm not against Twitter btw, I see it as something that stretches back in time, and likely has some kind of future. It's struggling now, that's for sure. Maybe it'll come back together. I am most definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; rooting against it, and it bothers me to see other people doing it. This isn't a sport, it's a world-level communication system that we use. While Mastodon has taken the Twitter idea for its own, it is not in any way a replacement for Twitter. In the past few days it's become painfully obvious how much we depend on it, and how it's negatively impacting my work when it's in trouble. I don't see any victory really for anyone in this other than people who get a charge from of other people's misery." created="Sun, 05 Feb 2023 18:36:18 GMT" type="outline"/>

Why does it turn off media? What kind of sense does that make. And from a UI standpoint, there should be some clue somewhere near the slider as to why that it's disabled.

You have to be an active member to listen to the books you bought. So you can't, if you have too many unread books, suspend the service so you can start to catch up. For the most part Amazon is pretty good at not keeping money it isn't entitled to. If something goes wrong and you jump through all the hoops, they give you your money back. They want a long-term relationship, it seems. But this policy of Audible's seems to be the exception. As if they don't give a shit what you think of them. How very un-Amazon.

You can help test it out by using Drummer with the JavaScript console open, and note any errors that have to do with HTTP and HTTPS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/173&quot;&gt;report them here&lt;/a&gt;.
