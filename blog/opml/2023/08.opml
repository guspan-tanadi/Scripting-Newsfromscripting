Funny thing is I so totally looked forward to summer, and it's almost over, and I should feel sad, but right now the changing season actually feels good.

These feelings come from evolution and natural selection. It's time for the season to change, so our body feeds us chemicals that makes us feel like this is a good thing.

				<outline text="I was once told by a famous and stupid NYT columnist that people my age have trouble learning about new tech, saying that I specifically had not aged well tech-wise. It was just an insult from a very stupid person, but it did hurt. Anyway, now that I'm much older I'd add aging means learning about all kinds of things, like sore and weak backs, knees, hips, memory, hair, lower metabolism, and all kinds of other things. My father as his health declined kept saying old age ain't for sissies, and I could see it in his body and his suffering, and now begin to feel it in my own.

				<outline text="I've become interested in viewing WordPress in a different way, not as just a blogging system, or CMS, rather as a back-end for a twitter-like system, or my idea of what a twitter-like system should be. Rather than staying on the sidelines, as I have for the last 17 years or so, going right for the middle. I like WordPress because there's wordpress.com which is huge, millions of users and now a 100-year plan (or at least the idea of having one), and thousands of functioning clones that interop nicely. Does this sound familiar? And their devs are pretty friendly and open-minded, I've found. " created="Wed, 30 Aug 2023 14:01:15 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="We're having a reunion at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkman&lt;/a&gt; on September 7th and 8th in Cambridge and of course I'm going. Just reviewed the schedule where there were several references to the term &quot;unconference.&quot; I think we should talk about how good ideas are usurped or erased. The term was actually coined at Berkman, to describe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloggercon.scripting.com/iv/format.html&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; we &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/06/22/rethinkingTheConference.html&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; for the second day of the first BloggerCon in 2003 by one of our participants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennpryor/&quot;&gt;Lenn Pryor&lt;/a&gt;, who was at Microsoft at the time. The term was eventually taken over for a imho much less interesting conference format, one where the sessions are chosen in real time at the event, but the format of the sessions is the same one used by non-un-conferences. In our version the hallways are empty, in the other format, well it's business as usual, the interesting stuff happens outside the meeting room. Maybe a university could help make sure that true innovation is rewarded? Something perhaps to discuss at our reunion. I tried to write this comment on the website, but they only allow 280 characters.

				<outline text="A friend said I should check out a new movie on Netflix entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/you-are-so-not-invited-to-my-bat-mitzvah!&quot;&gt;You Are So Not Going to my Bat Mitzvah&lt;/a&gt;. She said I'd like it because the rabbi is played by my favorite SNL performer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Sherman&quot;&gt;Sarah Sherman&lt;/a&gt;. I watched it and highly recommend. It's not a great movie but it is amazing for me, a 3/4 Jewish boy from Queens, son of holocaust survivors, and I found out from this movie someone who is more uncomfortable with being Jewish than I previously understood. Everything about this movie is Jewish. The same way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/atlanta&quot;&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/insecure&quot;&gt;Insecure&lt;/a&gt; are thoroughly black. The teenagers in the movie are 100 percent comfortable with being Jewish. I don't think there ever has been a movie that approached being Jewish so naturally without any sense that they have to explain themselves. And I kept having the thought -- Why Not? -- as my discomfort came up and then faded out -- why shouldn't there be movies that share modern Jewish culture in America using comedy, without being embarrassed by it? To me this is proof that antisemitism is strong inside me, and I don't understand how it got there. If Blacks have the same thing about their race, they have used culture to help dismantle it. I watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/swagger&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;, why shouldn't I also watch a show about my own people, and accept that we have a right to love ourselves as much as anyone else does? So to me, YASNGTMBM was amazing, and did something huge. And btw, the girls who play the lead roles are incredibly sweet and cute, and I expect we'll see more from them. And yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Sarah+Sherman&quot;&gt;Sarah Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, as  the rabbi was wonderful too.

				<outline text="Google did something I expect more tech companies will do, they use AI to help people figure out how to use their software. For example, they changed the way downloads work in Chrome. It used to be that when you clicked a download link, a tab would open at the bottom of the window, but now it's been &lt;a href=&quot;https://mspoweruser.com/download-bar-missing-in-chrome/#:~:text=Google%20has%20moved%20the%20download,%2C%20Windows%2C%20and%20ChromeOS%20devices.&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/a&gt; behind a menu at the top of the window. How would I know that? So I kept clicking the download link, all the while starting another download of the file. Finally I looked in the Downloads folder on my Mac, and saw five downloads of the same file, creeping along slowly, because they were all competing with each other, slowing each other down. So I went to the Google search engine and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+downloads&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about downloading from Chrome, and immediately it gave me &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/28/googleAiOnChrome.png&quot;&gt;the answer&lt;/a&gt;. This is new, it's the result of having turned on Google's new AI for search. It showed me where I had to go to cancel the downloads, and I did. Problem solved. I still hate Google for what they're doing to the open web, but I know how to separate the good from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;.

I much prefer working at my house, where I can take a nap when I need a break, or just walk around and mutter out loud or scream in delight when something works that I didn't expect to. Or &lt;i&gt;laugh&lt;/i&gt; out loud when I write something that amuses me, like right now. I'll just smile. Don't want to freak out the people around me. This idea of commuting to work kind of sucks. It's been a very long time since I did this. On the drive into work a guy cut in front of me merging into one lane (from two) with lots of advance warning. Okay I was a dick, I made it hard for him to do it, and the fucker hit my car!

				<outline text="I think it must be very hard to rework the UI of an open source product because responsibility for different parts of the product are allocated according to the structure of the UI. Same for a product that's managed by a large development company with lots of users. It's virtually impossible to re-think the top-level structure of the product. Much the same way you can't re-think how the streets in a city work. Too much is built around the way things are. Maybe it's true for movies and books too? Hmmm. Maybe you can only make big changes early in the life of an idea. What set me going in this direction is the way the UI of Radio UserLand was organized. We decided to start over from scratch in 2001. We already had a blogging tool, Manila, which had grown into a sprawl as we invented new tools to hang on a structure that wasn't designed for so much functionality. With Radio, I wanted to see if we could take the same functionality and make it tight and focused. It worked. There were two main screens, one for writing (the home page) and one for reading (the first link off the home page). Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/14/radioUserland.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;. Could you rework a product like WordPress to work this way? Yes, I believe technically it's possible. It would just be another interface on the same functionality. It would not be able to do all that WordPress could, but for most people that's fine because most of what most people do can be covered by much less than all the UI, at least in theory, imho, ymmv, I am not a lawyer, murphy-willing, my mother loves me and all other disclaimers." created="Mon, 14 Aug 2023 13:53:02 GMT" type="outline" image="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/14/miniPatrioticSanta.png" imageLink="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/14/radioUserland.png"/>

					<outline text="Our early success caught the eye of Guy Kawasaki who was newly hired as Apple's chief evangelist. We were a tiny startup but they seeded us with an early Macintosh along with the big software companies, and while we ported to the Mac platform it wasn't uncommon for Mike Boich, who was in charge of developer relations at Apple and himself a programmer, to be at our office helping us debug. They got involved with developers. There was no idea that success meant developers succeeding on their own. This very wrong idea would be the fatal flaw of a few otherwise excellent startup platforms." created="Sat, 12 Aug 2023 14:55:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We raised angel money and by early summer 1984 we had ThinkTank/Mac shipping. Apple bought full page ads for our product in Fortune, Business Week, Time, etc, out-spending us by a lot. Targeted at education and business, the Mac also caught on in government, and esp the military. To be clear, they invested in quite a few other products, not just ours.

But Apple's Mac strategy eventually worked. It took time for the developer community to grow, lots of other factors were at play, mostly that the PC had limited memory and the Mac could grow without practical limits.

Early users would get a special price, but it would &lt;i&gt;never be free.&lt;/i&gt; This is a key part of the positioning of the service. Unlike social networks, users pay for this product, and are viewed in every way as the customer. " created="Thu, 10 Aug 2023 23:44:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The MacWrite/MacPaint startup apps would be released as open source so developers not only have the ideas in the product to help them get started, but also working source code. The bundled products would also define documented open file formats, that developer products could &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; with, and thus would set the precedent that interop is a core value of this platform. More than any idea, it shows that we are investing in user's power and choice and will commit to getting them lots of software they can use without having to leave their favorite tools behind. There never has been a commercial platform with this ethos, as far as I know.  " created="Sat, 12 Aug 2023 14:41:41 GMT"/>

It more or less outlines a business plan for bootstrapping an app ecosystem. We help developers, as Apple did with my product in 1984, and they commit to deliver products in time to be part of the bootstrap of the platform. " created="Thu, 10 Aug 2023 23:48:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There would also be a venture capital part of this platform, and it will mainly focus on product quality, not headcount, or even number of users.

					<outline text="But if the users get value from the product, developers will receive dollars from the platform. That means this can work for individuals.

					<outline text="There are many reasons for not wanting to emulate that model, but for me the most important is that it cripples developer creativity.

It used to be if you wanted to do what he's doing, go back to the beginning, study the roots of rock music in episodes, to teach people who love music how things got going, how our culture changes, he would have needed backing of a big media company to get distribution, and for that he'd have had to accept their limits, and also have a good idea up front of what he was trying to do. Without the gatekeepers, he could try out an idea, iterate, and after a few years become so influential, with so much by now obvious value, to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/a-music-podcast-unlike-any-other&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; from the New Yorker. Our culture is changing thanks to pioneers like Hickey and podcasting as an open platform. A local friend pointed me to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://500songs.com/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, in a conversation in her Woodstock driveway. I gave it a try and was immediately hooked. Now music means so much more to me. I'm a proud sponsor, like so many others. Reminds me of a story from the 80s -- once when I was doing a presentation at MacWorld Expo in a crowded auditorium, I asked for a show of hands of people who used my product. The first hand that shot up, super high, with gusto, was that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak&quot;&gt;Steve Wozniak&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn't even seen him.

As president he ruled like an autocrat, with contempt for the most American idea, that we pick our own leaders. So the jury will be asked to decide if he should go to jail for being an autocratic president. In other words, will the system validate itself. It's like asking a program to decide if it's functioning correctly. If the validator works, it should reject any argument that Trump makes. Sorry, you're going to jail because you tried to rob us of our right as citizens to replace you with Joe Biden. It's pure, brilliant, gets right to the heart of the matter. Is our system of voting real, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; we choose the president, or does our system crumble when it's violated by its top official. Finally we're asking the right question, making the correct accusation. And if it's decided the way it should obviously be decided our country says no to this bullshit, no matter what a bunch of our fellow citizens want.
