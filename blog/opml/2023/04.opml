All the caricatures of AI from culture, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4EfdnMZ5g&quot;&gt;HAL from 2001&lt;/a&gt;, seem to have gotten it wrong about how bots will write. They write like good human writers do. Let the ideas come to the front, remove extravagance. Aim to communicate directly with the human who is reading. But another funny thing, I am aware more that I'm writing for the bots, because I want them to &quot;understand&quot; what I'm saying. Human readers -- they don't pay a whole lot of attention. Finally I have a reader who is listening. The future is interesting, and it never is the way you thought it would be. " created="Sun, 30 Apr 2023 15:38:09 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Back in the early days of the PC, we got a lot of putdowns from people from the mainframe and mini worlds. Our computers &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; less capable, but they made the mistake of thinking &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; were less capable too. We came from those worlds, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/04/26/whyILovedTheAppleIi.html&quot;&gt;chose&lt;/a&gt; PCs because we loved the idea of having our own computer that we could do anything we wanted to with. That was never true of the larger computers. The result is what you see now. Same will be true of AI. It is that big a deal. Apple then dismissed the web when it first came out, but eventually realized it wasn't going away, so they ended up embracing it. So did the big-iron computer makers with PCs but they were too late. And even IBM which did have the guts to be a first mover, once they came to dominate tried to retake control and were flushed from the system. Microsoft did it too, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172276538/world-wide-web-internet-anniversary&quot;&gt;when&lt;/a&gt; the web came out, with the same result.

				<outline text="I remember when I was a Comp Sci student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW&lt;/a&gt; taking the Compiler Design class, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fischer/cs701.f05/lectures/Lecture01.pdf&quot;&gt;CS701&lt;/a&gt;. It was the class that weeded out those who would get graduate degrees from those who would not. The class project was to write a compiler for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122103/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ohearn/Algol/intro.html&quot;&gt;Algol-like language&lt;/a&gt; that the professor desgined. He gave us a set of test apps that we had to compile and run correctly. I didn't get it. I thought code generation was like a magic box. Somehow the machine had a copy of every program you could write, and when it saw you were asking for that one, it would just spit out the code. Knowing what I know now, this was a ludicrous idea, but it's the best your mind can do when you just don't get it. Then there was the moment when I did get it. I started writing a code generator for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop&quot;&gt;while loop&lt;/a&gt;, and plugged it into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler&quot;&gt;compiler-compiler&lt;/a&gt;, and saw what it generated worked. From that point on, it was just writing code. Same thing with the web. I thought of big data centers, until I visited one of the most popular sites on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Underground_Music_Archive&quot;&gt;IUMA&lt;/a&gt;, and found it was just an old Sun terminal and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box_form_factor&quot;&gt;pizza box computer&lt;/a&gt;, sitting on the floor in a random dusty one-room office in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Cruz,+CA/@36.9758914,-122.04748,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808e441b7c36d549:0x52ca104b2ad7f985!8m2!3d36.9741171!4d-122.0307963!16zL20vMGwwbWs&quot;&gt;Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;. That's it? I couldn't believe it. So I'm sure there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gestalt&quot;&gt;gestalt&lt;/a&gt; like that for &quot;ChatGPT&quot;. Behind the magic is a bit of software, as magical (or not) as my compiler, or the pathetic Santa Cruz machine with the huge net presence. I'm sure there's something very mundane behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZR64EF3OpA&quot;&gt;curtain&lt;/a&gt;, but for now I love the magic of it and I don't believe the explanations that say it's stupid.

				<outline text="Another ChatGPT use-case. There's an open source package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor&quot;&gt;medium-editor&lt;/a&gt; that I use to edit text in most of my products. I believe it's popular, but because of its name, it can be hard to use a search engine to find technical information about it.

I asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/20/medium-editor-package-familiar.html&quot;&gt;ChatGPT how to&lt;/a&gt; do it, and it gave me fantastic docs, because it could sort out what Google simply can't.

After reading the book many years ago, I had a teacher named Jeru, whose tapes I have put on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeru.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;, who said many wise things that made a huge difference in my understanding of myself. But he also said one thing that I think was too judgmental -- that most love relationships have the partners taking turns acting like children. We, the students, laughed, as if to say -- yes but we're smart enough to not do that. To which I, Dave, now 25 years older and hopefully a little wiser, say yeah okay, that's cool, but please -- that's bullshit. Because we're &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; acting like children, all of us, because that's what we are. 99 percent of our energy comes from the child, maybe 1 percent from the intellect, the adult. The fun of life comes from the child. At our core, where our joy lives, we're kids, human puppies. Our partner is our best friend, and we play together and make huge messes, but our parents (our intellects) are watching over us, and are ready to step up if there's danger. But as long as it's fun, let the kids play. Most relationships I've had have been love-starved. We're expected to live up to an impossible standard, something out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet&quot;&gt;Ozzie and Harriet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver&quot;&gt;Leave it to Beaver&lt;/a&gt;. Ward and June, Wally and the Beaver. All I've ever wanted is someone to let me love them, who I could learn from, who would read my stuff and laugh at my jokes and tell me I'm a good boy. I really meant what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/04/014347.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; about getting from my human partner the same kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/03/04/014347.html&quot;&gt;love a dog gets&lt;/a&gt;. Okay so I tore up the pillows and pissed on the carpet. But you still love me right? Here let me get you the stick, now please throw it so I can be a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/02/23/161945.html&quot;&gt;good boy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; again." created="Wed, 19 Apr 2023 12:16:08 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/25/blackLab.png"/>

				<outline text="I suppose everyone has a different experience for every social network. I have a lot of old dear friends on Facebook who I'd never see online or in real life -- and this is such a huge blessing, given that I live in the remote Catskills, where some very nice &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; people live, and many of them are friends on Facebook too. There is no such thing as a purely good social network, whether it's owned by the mega silicon valley tech cartel, or if it's a distributed fediverse -- the networks for most people are defined by the users, not who provides the system. Yeah in a way that's naive and in another way it's humble and practical. We all are only going to be around for a few more years. Enjoying the people you like and love, imho, is a big part of what makes being alive worth it. So if it's a small sin to help Facebook dominate in a very very very small way, well sometimes I don't recycle either. And no one knows the big picture, so I'm going to go ahead and keep using Facebook, because I find love there, and that's a big deal.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; was a breakthrough, it accumulated a library of solved problems that you could borrow from, but you'd have to figure out which pieces went with others, and that was often an long arduous process, when it worked, and it didn't always work. ChatGPT is the next level after Stack Exchange. Now you just ask the question and you get docs customized to the exact problem you have and it writes docs that are better quality than what programmers write on Stack Exchange (not in any way diminishing their contribution).

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Good_as_It_Gets&quot;&gt;As Good As It Gets&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best movies ever made. It's got something for everyone. Heterosexual men get the example set by Melvin, played by Jack Nicholson, who despite his obvious insanity, is able to find love. Carol, played by Helen Hunt, gives up on not having a life, and accepts Melvin, even though he's so obviously completely out of his mind (as is she btw). For the mom, she gets to see her daughter have a life. The kid gets healthy and Simon gets a place to stay and friends who respect him for the loving generous person that he is (and also crazy). And we the audience get to relax and stop believing the lie that there is such a thing as human perfection. We learn to accept ourselves and others as having valid points of view, that may seem crazy, especially when combined with our own insanity, and realize that we can be kind and generous to each other, even if they aren't the perfect person we insist we're entitled to.  The title sums up everything. If you're happy, if you feel good, that's good enough, in fact it's as good as it gets. BTW, I like to write about this movie. I've done it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22as+good+as+it+gets%22&quot;&gt;bunch of times&lt;/a&gt;." created="Mon, 17 Apr 2023 13:47:27 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/17/asGoodAsItGets.png" imageLink="http://scripting.com/2013/08/20/whatIfThisIsAsGoodAsItGets"/>

The book is an introduction to psychology, it explains why we aren't the logical perfect people we imagine we are, as we are told we should be, and why the people we mate with always push our buttons so thoroughly and seem to contribute to our misery, when the promise was that they would do alleviate it. Basically our upbringing and education about how life works were all lies, designed to get us to conform, to be good little consumers and reproducers, and our happiness had nothing to do with anything. So if you are lucky enough to find yourself in a loving relationship and find it isn't working out as you hoped it would, I couldn't recommend this book more highly.

It's relaxing to check in with a group of fictional people every so often, to see them behaving with ordinary human dysfunction, so our subconscious can project itself into their drama. The death of the central figure in a simulated community is why I feel so unsettled today, I think. At first I couldn't place it. What happened? I have a fairly ordinary week planned.

				<outline text="I've picked up a project I had put down about a year ago, to do a command-line language based on JavaScript, with the only change being that functions don't return until they complete. After programming in JavaScript for almost a decade, I still don't accept the basic design choice they made to require that whether or not a function does I/O is visible in the syntax of the program. It's exactly the kind of thing that should be sucked down into the interpreter. It makes the code 10 times more expensive and fragile. And achieves absolutely no efficiency. Zero benefit. I don't know why other people don't see this, but I'm going to keep going until others join up and help. It's the same approach as we used in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/scripting.opml&quot;&gt;scripting in Drummer&lt;/a&gt;, only in this case the scripts run at the command line, like bash scripts.

I think it's worth that much to have a personal playground and have them do the hosting and also collaborate on new features. I'm going to help them recruit really special people to use their service, because that's where I think the juice is right now. People who already have interesting content flows (ie blogs) that could be pushed through this new kind of software machine.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, when I first got there in 1979 was the place where big change was coming fast. There's always been confusion about the power of individuals, even the richest ones -- imho they don't have the power to change the world, even though they're in the middle of the big change. If they weren't there someone else would be. The changes happening now can only happen because the systems they depend on are already in place. As individuals we get to make art from the change, give it style, a message, make it usable (or not), make it come into existence a bit faster perhaps. But the change itself is coming from evolution, not from individual people. " created="Sat, 01 Apr 2023 17:05:18 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/01/siliconValley.png"/>
				<outline text="In a voicemail to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_Malik&quot;&gt;Om Malik&lt;/a&gt; yesterday I observed that these things are not chatbots. I don't like the word chat. They have a chat-derived UI, true, but I find I go there when I have a question, much like I go to a search engine. It's a way to search a database that's also capable of writing. I'm looking for docs that might not exist, if so the software will try to create it for us. Much more useful than Google. As much of an advance over Google as Google was over Yahoo's directory.  " created="Sat, 01 Apr 2023 15:50:15 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Jake Savin, longtime friend and ex-UserLander, has been playing with my &quot;personal chatbot&quot;.

It also appears he was able to correct mistakes? I wonder how that works. But it's no longer purely my chatbot, now it's Jakes too? Hmm. (I trust Jake, that's not a problem. But I might not trust other people who explore my pod.) " created="Sat, 01 Apr 2023 15:42:43 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/10/31/camel.png"/>
