It provided a list, but as far as I can tell they're all bogus, awards that may exist, that I did not receive.

I think the bots are now going to help us do the factoring we humans wouldn't do on our own. All the layoffs in tech foretell this. The truth is stranger than fiction.

It's pretty good, even though some of its facts are wrong, and includes some ideas I never came up with but make sense.

					<outline text="Frontier is a software environment developed by UserLand Software in the late 1990s (Note: development actually started in 1988). It was designed to be a high-level scripting environment that combined an outliner-based editor, an object database, and an integrated scripting language. Frontier was used to build a variety of web-based applications and services, including content management systems, blogging platforms, and syndication tools." created="Thu, 30 Mar 2023 16:26:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="At its core, Frontier is an outliner-based environment that allows users to create and manipulate hierarchical outlines of information. These outlines can be used to store and organize data, as well as to create scripts and macros that automate tasks within the environment. Frontier also includes an object database that allows developers to store and retrieve data in a structured way, as well as an integrated scripting language that can be used to create custom applications and services."/>
					<outline text="Frontier was a pioneering platform in the early days of the web, and it played a key role in the development of many of the technologies that we take for granted today, including RSS syndication and web-based content management systems. While Frontier is no longer actively developed, its legacy lives on in many of the tools and technologies that we use today." created="Thu, 30 Mar 2023 16:27:09 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Today's song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtJ34oFnpog&quot;&gt;Loving Cup&lt;/a&gt;. It took me the longest time to find this song which was buzzing around my head this morning, but I couldn't find the lyrics. What I was ultimately looking for was this line: &quot;What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz.&quot; I was asking for &lt;i&gt;beautiful world&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;beautiful girl. &lt;/i&gt;A few minutes later another bit of a lyric became clear and it turned out to be the title of the song. I brought it to Bard, it got it right off. A few seconds later Alexa was playing it for me. So ChatGPT is also like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt;, which was a breakthrough because all of a sudden we could program our own music. It'd amaze today's young people to know there was a time when we had to depend on radio stations to get around to the song we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jonesing&quot;&gt;jonesing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jonesing&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt;. We'd sit there with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck&quot;&gt;cassette recorder&lt;/a&gt; waiting for the song to come around so we could get a copy of it. Then think of what a huge revelation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;/a&gt; was. All of a sudden the floodgates of music opened up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia&quot;&gt;Jerry Garcia&lt;/a&gt; didn't make it to that moment, he would've loved it, I'm sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Seeger&quot;&gt;Pete Seeger&lt;/a&gt; was alive, not sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bollier.org/blog/goodbye-pete-seeger&quot;&gt;how he felt&lt;/a&gt; about it. But anyone who really loved music imho, had to have been overjoyed. People were talking about music in airports and supermarkets. You had to be there. Napster was like years of Christmas every day for music lovers everywhere. Of course the music industry didn't agree.

I still don't buy that there's a Knicks-Nets rivalry. There aren't any Nets fans. They are a backup team so if the Knicks are out of town you can still go to a game. Now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/kevin-durant-hasnt-talked-to-kyrie-irving-since-nets-trade/&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; have left, everything is back to normal.

I've got Electric Drummer more or less working, and I think I'm going to stop short of getting all of it working, given that I want to keep taking this break and am not up for more grinding away. Something changed over here, and I'm more inclined to let you all take care of yourselves for a while. Mastodon is fine, even though I can't write for it using the tools I like to use. So far only my blog qualifies, and my docs and this.how stuff. I'm enjoying the winter here in the Catskills and dreaming of other cool things to do. Software right now far from my mind.
