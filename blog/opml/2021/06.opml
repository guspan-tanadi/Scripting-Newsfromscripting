When you go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20210308124857/http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of their archive pages, the shell is visible -- the header graphic, title, footer, but the contents is missing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/06/29/archiveOrgScriptingScreen.png&quot;&gt;Screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.

If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/03/08.html&quot;&gt;actual page&lt;/a&gt; on the web, it looks fine. If a simple site like this blog can't be rendered by archive.org, perhaps we are making a mistake by &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/08/14/132503.html&quot;&gt;depending&lt;/a&gt; on it as the record for what was said on the web. The question remains how do you maintain a record for a medium that thrives on its distributed nature that has a chance of lasting for decades or even centuries. The programmers at archive.org have an inhumanly impossible task, with all the experimentation on the web, over time, and like all programmers, they can make mistakes. Developers of websites make mistakes too -- a lot of the early UserLand sites are inaccessible via archive.org because they saw its crawler as a denial of service attack. Obviously our code was wrong, but there's no way to go back and fix the bug. The sites are long gone.

					<outline text="First, pricing for podcasts, as they have implemented it, is awkward and confusing, as evidenced by the way NPR did it. The pricing is voluntary, according to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2021/06/15/1006687574/support-your-favorite-npr-podcasts-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="But, what if there were something new, call it a &lt;i&gt;paycast&lt;/i&gt; perhaps, where you pay per episode. Maybe $1 per. Flat price, everything costs the same, at least at first. Keep it simple and easy to understand. " created="Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:58:22 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I would love to try this out because I'm pretty sure this is the way web news will ultimately work, and there is no pricing model for podcasts, therefore nothing to displace, unless you consider ads a model, see below. As long as we're trying something new, might as well try something better than what's already out there, from the point of view of users (we're the ones with your money in our pockets)." created="Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:58:37 GMT"/>

Basketball, to me, is like watching a great chess tournament, with athletic performance and chance playing a bigger role. If you see any meaning in a random event, you've found god.

There are rules to baseball and earthquakes. When chance seems to be making a moral statement, that's god. Just a choice of terminology. You could call it anything really.

I have to table this idea for now and move on. I'm going to use S3 in its place. I know how it behaves, I have simple code to write to it that works. Unfortunately S3 does not come in a user-friendly package, so it doesn't get us anywhere as far as user control of their data. I think this is an ethical mission for devs, akin to the &quot;First do no harm&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere&quot;&gt;edict&lt;/a&gt; for doctors. Don't lock your users in. I want to establish a norm here, for [[Tools For Thought]], that users expect to be able to move their data around where ever they want. Not giving up on this. We've done it before, with [[RSS]], for example.

" created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:17:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The idea matches the as-yet unachieved ideal of using the web as an operating system, that for me goes back to 1994. It's the potential I saw when I first understood how HTTP works. Now in 2021, the one thing the web OS doesn't have is reliable storage for users that multiple apps can access to edit and render on the user's behalf. The same way you might have a text file on your desktop, that you write in a word processor (of your choosing, this is important) and send it over email, put it in a tweet, or a Facebook post, or print it. Or any of a million other uses. The key thing is the text file is yours. Not just for Mac or Windows, for everyone, anywhere. It's the wedge we need to be able to build a new world that's been technically possible for a couple of decades now. :-)" created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:18:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's important that we're using GIT which is an open and often-cloned data structure. You could move your data to another GIT provider if GitHub proved too expensive, or their service was failing, or really any reason at all. " created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:21:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Dropbox was getting close to this idea, but they pulled back. That's why I did &quot;Fargo&quot;, which used Dropbox for storage. But no other app could access Fargo's outline files. They couldn't even access public files, that's the feature they withdrew. They had reasons to change course, not faulting the company.

					<outline text="&lt;b&gt;LogSeq&lt;/b&gt;" created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:24:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The main reason I picked up using GitHub as storage, again (I had experimented in 2017 with a GitHub-backed &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/english/&quot;&gt;text editor&lt;/a&gt;) is that another app developer, &quot;LogSeq&quot; is going down this path: using GitHub as a place for users to store their data. Even better LogSeq is an outliner! And even better, they're supporting &quot;OPML&quot;. So now it gets interesting. I can imagine a user opening an outline in &quot;Drummer&quot; because it has a feature they need, and then opening the same file in &quot;LogSeq&quot; because it has features that Drummer doesn't. This is the nirvana we've been waiting so long for. And we're close to having it. " created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:24:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="GitHub is tempting, but there appear to be problems when accessed through their API, as I am doing. For example, if I saved a file to a user's repo, it might take 20 minutes before the changed version showed up to other apps. There must be a cache somewhere in there. I don't have a clear statement of how GitHub works here, maybe it's out there, but I wanted to do a reality check. " created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:29:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="LogSeq says they use a Node package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git&quot;&gt;Isomorphic-Git&lt;/a&gt;. It has been reliable. But there are other problems. " created="Thu, 24 Jun 2021 14:31:10 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Anyway, I succeeded at getting several apps running on Glitch last year, but it wasn't simple for me, an experienced Node developer. That's okay. I left them the apps there, and they continued to work. But when I tried to update my &quot;PagePark&quot; installation on Glitch to the latest version, all of a sudden I'm getting errors from Node that make no sense. Things that worked before. There have been hardly any changes in PagePark in the last year. I have no idea what the problem is. And I'm concerned it might take days to figure it out and get things working properly.

Glitch is inexpensive, but not the least expensive way to run a server, if you don't want the server to go to sleep. It takes (it seems) a minute or more for it to wake up. Perhaps that's the incentive to get you to pay. I'd understand that. But their &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/pricing&quot;&gt;price&lt;/a&gt; is $8 a month, paid annually. I can host a server on Digital Ocean for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new&quot;&gt;$5 a month&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pay as you go. If you use the server for a week you pay for a week. And while I appreciate that Glitch is trying to make it easier by factoring and editing in the browser (good things to do!), Digital Ocean makes it as easy as possible to get started using standard Linux at the command line, and their docs are excellent, the best I've seen. It's what got me to switch from AWS in the first place (their docs are impossibly bad). I've been using Digital Ocean for years now, and the other thing I like about it is that my apps continue to work, they don't break them, as apparently has happened on Glitch (which is okay, not complaining, just making a decision)." created="Wed, 23 Jun 2021 14:52:23 GMT"/>

They probably need to be reminded what team they're playing for (i.e. the [[Brooklyn Nets]]). Kyrie is playing for Team Durant, as is Harden and the others. Durant, who has already won championships, was bored, is a sour person, who on coming to NYC thought it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyknicksnews.com/kevin-durant-the-cool-thing-right-now-is-not-the-knicks/&quot;&gt;okay&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2857179-nets-kevin-durant-says-the-cool-thing-right-now-is-not-the-knicks&quot;&gt;dis the team&lt;/a&gt; that everyone in NYC knows sucks horribly, epicly, a self-sabotaging monster of a basketball team that despite everything NY basketball fans love.

This Nets team was founded to win. Having lost, do they have any reason to exist? So today Knicks fans breathe a sigh of relief. There is a basketball god after all, and the Knicks still rule NY.

				<outline text="A few days ago I asked for an idea of what the term &quot;garden&quot; meant when applied to a software product. I had seen it used in conjunction with various [[Tools for Thought]] projects. I also saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/holden&quot;&gt;Mike Caulfield&lt;/a&gt; talk about it on Twitter. I wanted to understand what it means. After reading his &lt;a href=&quot;https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/&quot;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; on the garden and the stream, I think I get it. My garden is various product and technology sites, like &quot;XML-RPC&quot;, &quot;OPML&quot; and &quot;RSS&quot;. The product sites for &quot;Frontier&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, the &quot;OPML Editor&quot;. There's even a &lt;a href=&quot;http://outliners.com/&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; for outliners of the 80s: ThinkTank, Ready! and MORE. And the stream? That's a blog! And podcasts, and RSS itself. OPML is more the language of the garden. These are useful words to apply to ideas we've been developing since the dawn of the web. It's good to have these words. I also thought of Chance the Gardener's idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgGvd1UPZ88&quot;&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_There&quot;&gt;Being There&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful comedy about how the world really works.

					<outline text="I've been all around this one. I can and often do save both [[XML]] and [[JSON]] versions of RSS and OPML. Truth is almost no one uses the JSON versions. The reason is simple. If you already have support for the XML version, what's gained by adding support for JSON?

						<outline text="JSON is supposedly more readable than XML, but if you look at what people actually put on the wire, it's not true. There are no rules about [[whitespace]], tabs, newlines, spaces in either format.

It's bad engineering not to try to make your data files readable, imho, but it's also the default practice." created="Sun, 13 Jun 2021 20:33:02 GMT"/>
						<outline text="JSON is supposed to be easier to process, but that also is not true. First you have to support the XML versions because that's what's out there. So even if it were monumentally more difficult, you can't avoid supporting XML formatted data in your code. Adding a second version makes your code more complex not simpler.

						<outline text="If your development runtime doesn't have a package to serialize and deserialize XML as easily as JSON.parse and JSON.stringify, then do a good deed for your fellow developers, write it and release it as open source.

My parents' IRAs outlived them, so I'm holding them, the taxes still deferred. They will be one of the last things I sell to pay the rent and buy groceries. It might be that their IRAs will outlive me too! I also am holding stock that has appreciated. Nothing like Bezos or Musk, but I don't want to sell the stock until I have to because I don't want to pay taxes on the appreciation, and I think/hope the stock will hold its value. In other words, everyone tries to keep taxes to a minimum, not just the super rich. The government knows this, and uses that desire to create incentives. In the case of IRAs, they want people to save for retirement. " created="Tue, 08 Jun 2021 11:45:18 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/10/xmlRpcBookOReilly.png"/>

Iâ€™m too old for that shit, bro.â€ I love this guy. If any Knick could boast, it's DR, but he's cool. He likes playing for the Knicks, and we like him.

				<outline text="I started watching the HBO series &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Treatment&quot;&gt;In Treatment&lt;/a&gt;. At first it's boring, but it develops as it goes along. Some of the most despicable characters become sympathetic, and vice versa. You see real love between some of the pairs, also a lot of fear. 90 percent is conversations in a therapist's office. I found it hard to imagine how that could work, but it does.

				<outline text="A segment this morning on NPR, a discussion between two alumni of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_High_School_(Jacksonville)&quot;&gt;Robert E Lee High School&lt;/a&gt; in Jacksonville, FL. It's in northeast Florida, an area I'm fairly familiar with, my uncle used to live in the area. It's more like rural Georgia than most of Florida. The thing that hasn't gotten through to the whites there is that slavery is still ongoing in the US. They can't yet relate to the blacks as fellow Americans. If they could, they could understand the history they cherish was slavery to the blacks. They were considered property, animals, they could be killed with impunity. Asked how he would feel if it were Adolf Hitler High School, he said it was nothing like that, but it is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; like that, only the Third Reich lasted only 13 years. American slavery lasted &lt;i&gt;250&lt;/i&gt; years. Renaming a high school is a very small step. When we are fully reconciled, all of us will see the slaves of America as our ancestors. In the South they resist even beginning going down that path. " created="Tue, 01 Jun 2021 12:29:11 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/04/18/roots.png"/>
