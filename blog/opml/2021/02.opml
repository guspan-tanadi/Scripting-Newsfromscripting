If we had a good scripting tool for the internet as a whole, then we could pull together all our creations, so at least we could archive, index and make them searchable. I hate when I deposit a good idea on Facebook or Twitter. They often are impossible to find even 24 hours after I write them. We can do much better.

					<outline text="I started a newsletter using &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html&quot;&gt;Twitter's newly acquired service&lt;/a&gt;, just to see how it worked. Four people subscribed. The email went out last night at midnight. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/02/28/reportForNewsletter.png&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sun, 28 Feb 2021 14:11:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Since &lt;i&gt;no one&lt;/i&gt; read the newsletter, I thought I should post the content here. Why waste some good off-the-top-of-my-head writing? " created="Sun, 28 Feb 2021 14:14:38 GMT">
						<outline text="What I want, and will accept no less, is to be able to use my editor, my writing space. Ask any writer how they like to write, and they’ll tell you that they like to write where they write. Forcing me to use your tool says you have an attitude of world domination. Unfortunately quite a few other tech companies have the world domination strategy. This is how we get silos, and how we create weak tools and limit communication. At a time where we need better communication tools." created="Sun, 28 Feb 2021 14:15:34 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Also one other question? Why don’t they suck in my tweets? What a missed opportunity. In my editor, I have a command that gets all my recent tweets, so I can use them as a starting point for more writing. Twitter now makes a pretty good place to drop an idea for exanding on later. You’d think Twitter itself would understand that."/>
						<outline text="One more thing. Their writing app needs automatic vertical scroll. I don’t want to take my hands off the keyboard while writing to do something like scrolling the screen vertically, that the software should be doing for me."/>
						<outline text="Anyway that’s enough for one issue of this proto-newsletter."/>

					<outline text="PS: I am one of the four subscribers and as far as I can tell I did not get a copy of the newsletter via email. It says I subscribed over three years ago. That's pretty weird. Maybe I tried it once before they were acquired by Twitter? I tend to do that. Oh well. :boom:" created="Sun, 28 Feb 2021 14:16:05 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I write code the same way I write blog posts: as if someone is going to read it. I want to make sure they understand, to the best of my ability. So I leave clues, and use names that hopefully give the reader an idea of my intention. With code, it has to work, at a machine level, so sometimes you have to trade off some human sense for machine sense. But the basic motivation is the same. If I can't work on it later, even when it isn't fresh in my mind, it's not worth nearly as much.

				<outline text="In the early 2000s we had an &lt;a href=&quot;http://1998.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi.html&quot;&gt;API for writing tools&lt;/a&gt; to plug into content systems. We felt that writing tools should develop independently of how the writing is distributed. Simple idea, any developer can understand the need. But today, the systems don't offer choice. If you want to publish in their environment you have to use their text editor. Facebook makes you use their editor, it's a piece of crap, it has tiny little type, hard to read, super buggy. Why can't I use my own editor. Just want to tell non-devs out there, they could do it, easily and cheaply. Their reason for not doing it is to lock you in to using their tool. What a waste of our brainpower. It's as if your printer came with word processing software and you could only print stuff from that app. That's what Substack is doing, and Twitter's new newsletter software does it too. Use our primitive writing tool, that's the only choice. Ridiculous. It's a throwback to the way tech worked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=929&quot;&gt;in the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;. Bottom line, start evaluating these services based on the quality of their writing tools, really criticize them, until they get tired of hearing it, and offer you a chance to use the ones you love.

I said &quot;there are two packs of muffins, please run that through twice.&quot; When I finished she said she didn't see any muffins. I laughed, and pointed to the &lt;i&gt;English&lt;/i&gt; muffins. We had a nice discussion about whether or not they really are muffins.

					<outline text="In response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/23.html#a224008&quot;&gt;yesterday's bit&lt;/a&gt; about Scoble and me lusting after a Tesla, I got a wonderful email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Naughton&quot;&gt;John Naughton&lt;/a&gt; about his love of Tesla. Even better, he told me which one to get! :boom:" created="Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:43:38 GMT">
						<outline text="I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://scobleizer.blog/2021/02/21/teslas-data-advantage-can-apple-or-others-keep-up/&quot;&gt;Scoble’s post&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought was perceptive.  I was receptive to it because last year I took the plunge and bought a Tesla — a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3&quot;&gt;Model 3&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s been a transforming experience. What makes that remarkable is that I’m a recovering petrolhead — I had a 3.8 litre Mk II Jaguar towards the end of my grad student days — and believe me that was a big deal in those days.  So I’ve always been interested in cars, and over the years have owned lots of good and interesting ones." created="Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:44:37 GMT"/>
						<outline text="But the Tesla is something else.  It’s basically software with wheels.  Every week or so it gets a software update — mostly bug fixes or minor features added.  For example, it used to be quite a palaver to open the glove box: you had to go to the touchscreen, go down a level, find glove box and tap on the icon.  Now you have voice control and you just say “Open Glove Box”.  That came in a software update.  Every so often there are more consequential updates — there’s one coming soon to the Autopilot and, eventually, to the (optional) Full Self Drive software which, theoretically, enables a measure of autonomous driving. So it’s a car that improves steadily the longer you have it." created="Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:48:30 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I’m not interested in FSD because I rather like driving. But also I’m getting older and I wanted a car that could look ahead and take avoiding action if I missed seeing something — which it already does when Autopilot (which is basically just smart cruise-control) is on."/>
						<outline text="The Model 3 is a delight to drive — it’s as nimble as a Porsche (and indeed seems quicker — zero to 60 in 3.1 seconds — than even a Porsche 911).  And it’s soooo quiet. My wife and I can whisper and hear one another at 70mph on a freeway."/>
						<outline text="The other big deal is that Tesla starting building a supercharger network almost as soon as they started building cars.  This was smart because the non-Tesla charging networks are still chaotic and often unreliable — which is why people with non-Tesla EVs continue to find long journeys sometimes erratic and problematic."/>
						<outline text="If you do decide to go for one, I suggest you go for the long-range, dual-motor version of the Model 3.  That has all-wheel drive, which I reckon is necessary in the winter for where you live."/>
						<outline text="And get a home charger, so that whenever you leave the house the car is fully charged."/>

				<outline text="I keep sharing this idea with my friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, but I don't think they get it. It's the same advice I'd give to any professional news org. Build more community around your podcast. If you do a weekly show, say on a Thursday, compile a set of emails from listeners and publish it on Tuesday, via email, as a newsletter. That way you get to know who's listening, and we get to know each other. Chris's podcast no doubt has some very interesting listeners, who are they and what do they think, what do they know? They've set up, imho, a too-narrow pipe, necessitated by the technology &lt;i&gt;we used to use&lt;/i&gt; for radio. Today's tech makes so much more possible. You just have to want to do it. I don't doubt they could find volunteers to read and curate the emails, so only the really interesting stuff goes out. What made me think of this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/write-like-the-russians/&quot;&gt;last week's show&lt;/a&gt;, with a famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Saunders&quot;&gt;English prof&lt;/a&gt;, going through how short stories work.

				<outline text="I don't watch a lot of movies these days thanks to the pandemic I guess. But in the last two days I watched two, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadland_(film)&quot;&gt;NomadLand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Care_a_Lot&quot;&gt;I Care a Lot&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to imagine two more different movies. NomadLand is a character study, played by a 63-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_McDormand&quot;&gt;Frances McDormand&lt;/a&gt;. Her age is important. I understand this somewhat because I'm 65, and it's like that great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z_7eu64y6c&quot;&gt;Al Pacino speech&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday&quot;&gt;Any Given Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, as you get older &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/_Z_7eu64y6c?t=102&quot;&gt;things are taken&lt;/a&gt; from you. Parents, friends, lovers, and then pieces of yourself start going, and you're left wondering what the fuck. That's NomadLand in a nutshell. The acting is beautiful, the scenery, the characters, the feelings (somewhat) -- but the story? It's like viewing a work of art in a museum. It's just there. It's for you to decide what it means and a lot of that will depend on how old you are, I imagine. I Care a Lot is very much the opposite, but interestingly it's also about things being taken away from an old person, in this case played by 72-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Wiest&quot;&gt;Dianne Wieste&lt;/a&gt;. So much happens in the first few minutes of the movie, and it's so anger-making, I turned it off at least three times to regain my composure to continue watching. But then it becomes a rollicking ultra-violent comedy, kind of like a Quentin Taratino movie, but funnier. If you want entertainment, I Care a Lot is for you. I will watch NomadLand again. Sometimes movies like this don't grab me on the first viewing, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood&quot;&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/a&gt;, which i panned after a first viewing, then &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; after a second.

				<outline text="I thought &quot;cutting the wire&quot; would save me money, but it actually costs a lot more for the same programming. I am currently spending $65 for both YouTube TV and Fubo, and $12 for Hulu, and no HBO, though I really want it. If you add it up, it's about $150 a month. So I called Spectrum to see if I could get that without the set top box, and if so, how much would it cost. Turns out it's about $40 on top of my internet service, with all the local sports, weather, news, CNN, MSNBC and HBO. I'm going to cancel the others, I'm sure I'll miss something, but one thing I won't miss is having to remember where to go for each of the shows I'm interested in. And of course I still have Netflix and Amazon. So I'm back to where I was before I naively threw all my cards in the air. Back to Roku and Spectrum.

Next up, a woman sings an Irish ditty a cappella telling a man to stop explaining things to her. Then a NYT reporter who's been attacked the way only a woman can be attacked, to which I say, no -- men really do get attacked on the net too, in more horrific ways than you describe, sometimes involving police with weapons drawn, with all the fire trucks in Berkeley, lights flashing and sirens blazing. Other times, knocks at the front door in the middle of the night at your real actual house, the place you sleep. Also people who stalk your friends, so you have to have a conversation with your friends about this. Anyway, long story, sorry, I know I suck.

				<outline text="Part of program design is checking your assumptions. Sometimes things that conceptually seem like a lot of work, might not take a lot of time to run.

It would watch a folder and mirror any changes to a server. That way you could maintain a website on your local hard disk. I had investigated ways to do it through the operating system, but it was too complicated, or not reliable, I don't remember why, but it wasn't feasible to use it. So I decided to write a bit of script code that watched the folder, the simple dumb way, to see what I was up against. To my surprise it took virtually no time to scan a large nested folder looking for changed files. It was something you could do every few seconds without a performance hit. The product shipped, thousands of people used it, upstreaming worked. I try to keep that in mind.

His reporting is full of information and history, it was more than great reporting. They don't have a prize for this, but they should. Reporting that's useful.

Here's what I understand happened, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/02/06.html#a161003&quot;&gt;McNeil's statement&lt;/a&gt;. He was asked by a group of high school students a question about whether it was okay for a friend of theirs to say a racial slur in a video. In answering the question McNeil himself used the word. This is a word that is used publicly, often as a term of endearment, in a lot of contexts to refer to all kinds of people, and it's not controversial, it's accepted. He didn't aim the racial slur at anyone. Grammatically it was the subject of a sentence, not an adjective. He said the word. And now, many months later he was fired for it. " created="Sat, 06 Feb 2021 15:41:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Maybe this isn't what happened. I'm open to hearing more. But if this is it, the Times should apologize and offer him his old job back. Apparently some reporters will object, and somehow threaten the Times. &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; should be fired. It's an honor to work at the Times, and if you don't like it, leave.

					<outline text="What the Times did here is disgusting. This isn't the first time I've said the Times is disgusting. I think it virtually every day as they flaunt their conflict of interest re tech, never offer an opposing view to rebut their nonsense. They either naively or corruptly promote stories that put our country in danger, based on lies, just like the ones Fox is being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/podcasts/the-daily/smartmatic-fox-news.html&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; for now. These are well-known. The Times doesn't seem to care. " created="Sat, 06 Feb 2021 15:52:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't expect the Times will reverse itself. So I hope McNeil lands somewhere where there is a daily podcast he can be interviewed on, and who will sponsor his reporting, which was exceptional, deep, informed by an enormous base of experience, thoughtful and caring. Let's make sure he's still viable as a source of information and encouragement to us. " created="Sat, 06 Feb 2021 15:45:43 GMT"/>

A story to illustrate. As a student at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW-Madison&lt;/a&gt; in the late 70s, I'd often go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/&quot;&gt;Memorial Union&lt;/a&gt; with a copy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, on a sunny afternoon perhaps, and sit on the patio by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Mendota&quot;&gt;Lake Mendota&lt;/a&gt;, people-watch, and read the news. Today I'd do it in a minute if I could, but today I'd read news on an iPad or laptop using &quot;RSS&quot; feeds. I'd have an all-in-one bundled news experience as I did in the 70s. But: My system kind of sucks, I never put any effort into maintaining it, and my system is vastly better than what most people get as a news experience. No wonder the truth has trouble getting out. The news industry blames Facebook, but as a former entrepreneur, I blame them. They've invested so little in understanding how their readers use their product. Their system is based on an incomplete understanding of their roles. The news industry product needs to be re-bundled. I believe the rewards will be huge for the first publication that bets on this idea. They wouldn't be the first, btw -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/06/19/whatToDooWithYahoo.html&quot;&gt;My.Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; did it in the 00's. Have the guts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;point to your competition&lt;/a&gt;. And if you have a paywall, send them some money &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; some readers. Now that Jeff Bezos is retired, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/washington-post-to-be-sold-to-jeff-bezos/2013/08/05/ca537c9e-fe0c-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; such a platform, I would stand up and applaud if they had the guts to try this out. I'd also line up to hook my blog into such a network. Not because my writing depends on making money from it, it doesn't, but to help disrupt the news industry that's daydreaming itself to death over distribution, competition and economics.
