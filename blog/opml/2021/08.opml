				<outline text="&quot;Drummer&quot; testing is going well, still more features in development, but it is pretty stable. So I'm looking for more people to join the test group. I'm looking for people with either blogging experience or scripting experience, best if you have both, and even better if you've done development in Frontier. Think of [[Drummer]] as the continuation of the blogging work we were doing at [[UserLand]] before we took the turn toward [[Manila]] and [[Radio]]. Drummer is unabashedly about the [[outliner]]. It's the most fluid way to write, and I want to hook it up to as many rendering engines as possible, using open protocols, as possible. I see outlines as the center of the writer's universe, but you already knew that if you read my blog. Send an email or DM on Twitter if you're interested. Not guaranteeing access, and not saying when. We're still a ways from opening up to the public.

				<outline text="I'm reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)&quot;&gt;Player Piano&lt;/a&gt;, Kurt Vonnegut's first novel. I probably read it before, but didn't remember. It's a slog unlike later Vonnegut novels. This was Vonnegut before he was Vonnegut. His writing is very relaxed, American, and irreverent. And very much his. If he wants to go to some weird place in his story-telling he just goes there. I think the peak of this was Breakfast of Champions which was about a character he invented (of course all fiction is) but he writes about &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; he invented him, and why. It's hard to explain. But in Player Piano, he's sticking to the basics of novel-writing. Only hints of a Vonnegutisms to come in later writing.  It's dull and my mind wanders while reading it. I guess that's the thing about later Vonnegut writing. He gets your full attention while you're reading. More than other writers. " created="Tue, 31 Aug 2021 15:58:05 GMT" type="outline"/>

I'm glad because I want to let the players know that I used to mow Mets' players lawns in the 60s. I went to games with my parents, uncle, grandfather, brother. We had a slogan &quot;Shea Stadium Rules&quot; which meant that even if we had our differences underneath it all we're still rooting for the Mets.

Spoilers follow. One of the faculty, a young white male superstar, is accused of being a Nazi by students. They have demonstrations. Make demands. The faculty freezes. He tries to respond, his colleagues tell him this never works, when men try to defend themselves, it only makes it worse. He's seen as not contrite. We see the issue only from the faculty standpoint, all we hear from students are slogans and soundbites. We do hear from one student who will be hurt by the takedown. We understand from the start that the professor is not a Nazi. As I watched the confrontation, I wondered if the individual students knew they're wrong. Why was this not explored? Do any of the students argue that they should help the professor instead of attacking? (He's a sympathetic character, his wife died recently.) I know this is TV and they're subject to the same dishonesty they're portraying (Netflix defends Nazis). As I said yesterday, the acting is great, the characters are appealing, it's a page-turner of a binge-watch. But with one small exception, the students are portrayed as flat angry unreasonable monsters. They can't be that single-minded, unconflicted, thoughtless. It left me feeling dissatisfied. Now that I've written it up, I can move on. :boom:" created="Sun, 29 Aug 2021 13:12:57 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/16/cannedCherries.png"/>

Trump did a deal with the Taliban in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_peace_process#:~:text=The%20second%20peace%20treaty%20was,the%20terms%20of%20the%20agreement.&quot;&gt;Feb 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The Afghan government was not included in the deal. The Taliban agreed to stop shooting at American troops, and the US agreed to withdraw completely by May 2021. There were probably private deals that will enrich Trump and his buddies. Remember our government was an unabashed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy#:~:text=Kleptocracy%20(from%20Greek%20%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%80%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82%20kl%C3%A9pt%C4%93s,misappropriating%20government%20funds%20at%20the&quot;&gt;kleptocracy&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Once the deal was in place, it set in motion something that should have been obvious to the US negotiators, and for that matter, American journalists -- the local governments and probably the national government made individual deals with the Taliban. In exchange for money and protection, they switched sides. I probably would have done it too. So there was no resistance when the US withdrew. The Taliban just marched in, having won a political and economic victory if not a military one. No one gave the order for the American-supplied troops to fight. They took off their uniforms and went home. We'll have to see what happens to these people once we're fully gone from Afghanistan. A lot of Afghans didn't see this coming, that's why there was so little preparation for an immediate evacuation. Hard to blame this on the US. People wanted to stay and see what would happen, maybe the US-supplied army and the US-puppet regime would prevail?

It was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140102022028/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/940179%7C0/Robert-Osborne-on-Joan-Crawford.html&quot;&gt;Joan Crawford Month&lt;/a&gt;, so I watched every JC movie they had, going back to silent movies. She was a super cutie, whatever you think of her &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2014/02/06/publicShamingIsWorthALook.html&quot;&gt;as a mother&lt;/a&gt;, I could watch her all day, esp with the Oxy. Then they did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_in_film&quot;&gt;movies of 1939&lt;/a&gt;, which was probably the best year ever for Hollywood. The way the early web may have been the best time for tech. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/08/14.html#When:1:03:47PM&quot;&gt;The Women&lt;/a&gt; was an unusual movie from 1939. You don't realize this right away but there are no men in the movie, not even an extra. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Women_(1939_film)#Cast&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; of superstar women actors of the day. There was also The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Anyway, after all this time, I can't get Oxy anymore (glad for that, I liked it too much) but I can get as much TCM as I want, and I get to do the programming. Geez. All I need is a bungalow in the Florida Keys or a hacienda in Taos, and nice way to watch TCM, and I could just disconnect. :boom:" created="Sat, 14 Aug 2021 20:58:58 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/08/14/joanCrawford.png"/>

It had barely registered with me until about a week ago, when I, in a fit of boredom, decided to give it a try. I was hooked almost from the beginning. Rick, Morty's grandfather, has spent his life exploring the universe, and has a really depraved sense of everything, but he also loves to party. Morty, who is high school age, sort of puts up with Rick, and he always has issues with him. Every episode has at least a couple of really novel and funny scifi themes involving alien civilizations who are truly weird, and horrible situations Rick gets them into. It's like a lot of sitcoms, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeymooners&quot;&gt;Honeymooners&lt;/a&gt; for example, where Rick is Ralph Cramden and Morty is Ed Norton.

I did not tag the names of the shows I compared it to. In the post about the Olympics gold medal game, I tagged the Brooklyn Nets, because I have an issue with them, and that issue a pivotal reason I didn't love the US Olympic team as much as I would have if they were more of a team. The Nets aren't a team either, maybe they will at some point. We're going to keep watching them, so I think there's a reasonably good chance I'll write about them again and again in this same context. They're an ongoing thread on my blog.

				<outline text="I got to watch the second half of last night's gold medal game between France and the US. Something strange happened, almost immediately I was rooting for France, because the USA team reminded me of the [[Brooklyn Nets]]. A team formed quickly with star NBA players for the sole purpose of winning a championship. The French team, on the other hand, while they had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert&quot;&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; or two from the NBA, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier&quot;&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ntilikina&quot;&gt;former&lt;/a&gt; Knick, practiced together for quite some time, and had the fluidity that comes from being a team. The American all-stars did not. But they did have [[Kevin Durant]], and that made the difference. He is an awesome talent, maybe the best to ever play the game, certainly in the top ten. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/06/sports/olympic-basketball-usa-france&quot;&gt;USA did win&lt;/a&gt;, and I can't say I'm sad about that, because I'm a nephew of Uncle Sam, but I did like the spirit of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_men%27s_national_basketball_team#2020_Olympic_roster&quot;&gt;French team&lt;/a&gt;, and I would have been happy if they won. I am not a fan of the [[Olympics]]. I think they are playing for NBC and their advertisers, and I also think they should have one great venue for summer and winter, and stop all the waste. We have to change the way we run our civilization, or we won't have a civilization.

				<outline text="The monthly ritual is complete. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/07.opml&quot;&gt;OPML for July 2021&lt;/a&gt;. And just for fun, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/publicfolder/misc/scriptingNewsArchiveInOpmlFromMay2017.zip&quot;&gt;zipped up&lt;/a&gt; an archive going back to May 2017, when I deployed my &quot;new&quot; content management system. It's all a matter of perspective I guess. 2017 seems to me like a short time ago, but then a lot has happened in the interim. Some of it is in the contents of the blog. I think some interesting apps could be built using this archive as a seed. So far there haven't been any takers that I know of, but I think we may be getting close with all the [[tools for thought]] activity. " created="Sun, 01 Aug 2021 15:41:33 GMT" type="outline"/>
