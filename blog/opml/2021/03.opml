				<outline text="The best platforms are ones with lots of users. For example, the Finder on the Mac needs a simple scripting language. Starting with Lotus 1-2-3, spreadsheets had macro languages. Programmable editors are popular because writers love to get their writing environment just-so. The theory of Frontier was to pour lots of attention into the scripting language, and make it work across all apps. We did a pretty fair job. It didn't get as much attention as it deserved because Apple got in the way. We shouldn't give up on this ideal. It's still possible.

					<outline text="At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+userland&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt;, a company I founded a long time ago, we had a rule called Rule 1. It said simply: No breakage. It meant you couldn't change the environment such that apps that ran in version N did not run in version N+1. It meant you took longer to release a new version because once released, you had to live with it forever. This rule came from bad experiences when we did things that broke users and developers. Since we were both the developers of the platform and users of the platform we had a realistic perspective of this.

					<outline text="I was once having a discussion with someone who wanted to implement a successor to Frontier, intending it to be compatible with Frontier, in some way, but right at the beginning said he was going to make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity&quot;&gt;case-sensitive&lt;/a&gt; where Frontier is not case-sensitive.

					<outline text="Rule 1 was not a joke, it was dead serious. I was sick of programmers who choose to break users and developers. I had worked with a deprecator, for years, and learned the hard way that a development process that permitted user breakage was not much of a process. Eventually the users will go somewhere where they aren't always having to start over because a programmer changed their mind about how something should work. Sometimes breakage happens, all rules have exceptions, but you have to work really hard to avoid those situations, and usually there's a way to do it. " created="Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:32:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When a language goes out of its way to say Rule 1 demands no breakage, not Rule 27, or Rule 18b, but Rule 1, the first, the one that all other rules follow, well you can't break that rule and still say you're doing the thing you say you're doing.

					<outline text="I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/health/live-news/covid-pandemic-doctors-cnn-special/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN's two-hour special&lt;/a&gt; last night, with interviews with some of the doctors from the last administration on what went wrong. All of these people sold us out to some extent, including Fauci, just by staying in their jobs. None of them admitted last night that they were as complicit as they were. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Birx&quot;&gt;Deborah Birx&lt;/a&gt; takes the fall for everyone, and that's wrong.

					<outline text="People say what if Birx had quit, with a statement about how the Trump administration was botching it, that could have made a difference. But it couldn't have. Anyone who was paying attention knew what Trump et al were doing, including news people. Yet they made the story every night about how Trump and his minions were screwing up. If you report that every night, as they did, it stops being news pretty quickly, and becomes a copout, a coverup of the cowardice of journalism. Tell me something that isn't common knowledge.

					<outline text="If the press wanted to make a difference, they could have changed the story from &quot;Trump Sucks&quot; to &quot;This is what we need to do today.&quot; They could have found a way to tell us where the virus was storming and where it was quiet. They could have, instead of coasting along in neutral, tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22save+my+life%22&quot;&gt;save lives.&lt;/a&gt; For some reason they didn't see this as their job.

					<outline text="They could have done what Trump was supposed to be doing, but (guessing) they were too scared to step out of their comfortable role, which is ironically what people hypocritically accuse Birx of. " created="Mon, 29 Mar 2021 14:16:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But last night it was good journalism on CNN's part, &lt;i&gt;now,&lt;/i&gt; to sit all these people down, while they're all accessible and their memories are fresh and the pandemic is still ongoing, to get them on the record.

Most he's recently has been working in Oakland, helping people get their Covid vaccinations at the Coliseum. This morning he asked for help on Facebook. They needed a simple app that could tell them when 15 minutes and 30 minutes were. These are the amounts of time people have to wait before leaving, to be sure that if they have a bad reaction to the vaccine, that they can be helped by medics. Makes sense that in the middle of everything else they have to do, adding 15 and 30 to the current time is a bit much to ask. I said I would be happy to do it. Just a small JavaScript project. I was glad to help. The result is this site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://timeshifter.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;timeshifter.scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="From the Something-Users-Don't-Understand-But-Could Department. Developing software is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. It's analogous to building a bridge. Start by pulling a wire across the river. Use it to pull up another wire. When you have enough wires, bundle them to create a thicker wire, and use it to pull up something bigger. Eventually you have two thick cables going across the body of water. Use the cables to pull up a roadway. Build on-ramps and off-ramps and toll booths. But you can't build things out of order, and sometimes things are added earlier for features that won't be added until later in the bootstrap process. People who have evolved products know about this. And you never see it more clearly than when you're building your second  or fifteenth or 200th bridge. By that point, you figure, if the users really wanted to understand they could, because they're teaching classes about it in universities." created="Sun, 28 Mar 2021 16:04:03 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/28/marley.png"/>

We used to believe in the goodness of everyone, but forgot the humanity, and that as a community grows, eventually you attract &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who try to make your life miserable. The pressure of dealing with these people literally made me sick. I got better as soon as I stopped. We've learned a lot about moderating community systems since then. So I'm going to keep my promise to myself, this project is mainly for me, because I want it, and I love the idea of other people using it, and helping each other, and that includes me, but when they start abusing me, I'm turning them off without a second thought.

				<outline text="One reason I ask questions about the process by which people want to deprive a person of their life, is that it's come to the point where they want to erase an accomplished person because they don't like his ideas, or the questions he asks. When I read the accusations, I cross out all of those, give them no weight at all. It's fine if you don't like his ideas, now mind your own business. Why do I care? A couple of reasons. Offensive questions and foreign ideas help me think through my own values, and sometimes I find a way to compromise, and sometimes I even change my mind. I don't mind discomfort. I check to see if I'm in any danger, or if anyone else is, and if the answer is no, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Live%20and%20Let%20Live&quot;&gt;live and let live&lt;/a&gt;.

I can imagine a mob of internet &lt;s&gt;assholes&lt;/s&gt; people deciding that my ideas are too offensive to be permitted. If I can imagine that then I have to question it when it's happening to someone else.

Once i get over the sheer waste of it, the price is actually competitive. YouTubeTV costs about the same, w/o the AppleTV. And YTTV does not have the Knicks. Where I live there is no other way to get the Knicks. I actually think this is true for the entire NY area.

						<outline text="First, I got a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1374541139970260996&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; from Jay Rosen thanking me for pushing him to keep his own web presence, to not depend on any of the platforms.

I think there's more to it than what Drum says, that the disappearance of Google Reader, while it certainly hurt the cause, is only part of the puzzle. The problem is that I can't write on my blog and share it with the popular publishing platforms without limiting what I can do with my blog. If you add up all the limits of Twitter, Facebook, Google Reader and Medium, then you can't blog at all because their requirements are contradictory. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:35:02 GMT" collapse="true">
							<outline text="One requires titles and two don't allow titles. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:52:02 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Facebook doesn't support the basics of blogging, links, simple styles, podcast enclosures and (again) titles. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 15:08:19 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Medium supports most of what you would want them to support but doesn't allow updating, so if you make a change you have to do it by hand. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 15:08:25 GMT"/>
							<outline text="None of them want to peer with blogs. They all insist you do your writing with their tools of greatly varying quality, and some are reallllly bad. Even the new hope of writers everywhere, Substack, requires you to use their editor. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 15:08:32 GMT"/>
							<outline text="So, trying to keep this short as possible, in 2017 I gave up trying to peer with any of those services, and went back to writing my blog the way I like to write, and the lights came back on. It works again. So the moral of the story imho is to forget about peering, and just blog the way you want to, and I think we can all be happy." created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:52:40 GMT"/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Now I mentioned Google Reader in the list of limiting environments. Oddly, even though it's long gone, it is still controlling how we blog. They didn't support the full RSS spec, they don't handle posts without titles. And all the replacements for Reader copied their limits, so even though it's gone, it's influence is still strong, contributing limits to blogging that weren't here before they came and went. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:41:26 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Is Twitter's character limit protecting Medium? If so, please now would be a good time to change course. Twitter is only increasing in importance.

As much as I love Twitter, its constraints are still unbearable. " created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:42:48 GMT"/>
						<outline text="One more thing.

The difference is this time I'm writing the docs. Last time I didn't have the energy to do it, but now it's the structure for my review of various aspects of the system. Reading the verb docs you'll know I went through that verb's functionality before release. Of course I'm also documenting the bugs.  " created="Tue, 23 Mar 2021 16:22:00 GMT" type="outline"/>

Far less useful than the editors we had before the web. What if Microsoft had chilled and brought together the best minds from the PC era and asked some basic questions like how are we going to make the web better for everyone, at least as good as what we had before. What a time that would have been to do just that. But they acted like spoiled children. Andreessen et al could be excused, they really were basically children then. Gates had a dream of world domination forever, or at least until he was tired of it. So selfish, narcissistic, and so wrong.

Try to imagine something like that being said about two women politicians, using the female equivalent of &quot;dicks.&quot; You'd never hear it, and a respectful discussion of politics can't be at that level. It's not just disrepectful of the people she's talking about, but it's disrespectful of the audience and the interviewer, and the NYT which hosted the interview.

And maybe present another side of it, about what it was really like for us one year ago. Why were her liberal peers so willing to overlook their dislike for Cuomo? Perhaps because they, like the rest of us, were scared out of their minds. Just a theory. (I certainly was.)" created="Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:30:46 GMT"/>

They do whatever it takes to create an illusion of potential growth, then they sell that to seed investors, who in turn sell it to angels, then to Series A and B and so on, and ultimately to the public. Huge amounts of money are raised, and none of it goes to the writers who keep the wheels spinning, in the case of Substack and their ilk, writers.

				<outline text="I was having a philosophical conversation the other day about the difference between an app being scriptable or having an API. This has always been a big question. It's like this question: when does an actor become a star? Aren't they doing the same thing? Yes, they are, but no they aren't. An app being scriptable means that its API went through a process, it was conceived from a user's point of view. The designers looked at the user interface and made sure everything you could do there was also possible in a script. The terminology matched the UI. You didn't have to learn a new vocabulary. There were examples provided that showed how to do things the app couldn't do on its own, things that a user would want to do, and would inspire a script-writing user to want to do more. You're looking for the tiny fraction of users who in their hearts are developers, but don't know it yet. These people make software system devs don't think of, and aren't impressed with, because what drives the user-programmer is utility, not programming prowess. Further if you tell them they're programmers, they'll disagree for a long time -- no, I'm a lawyer, no I drive a bus. No I do this or that. But eventually quite a few will come to see that they are programmers. Then, as the programming priesthood takes hold, these people are confined to niches where the devs thought to add a scripting interface. That becomes a platform and the process begins again.

				<outline text="I was telling one of the devs I work with yesterday about Lotus 1-2-3's macro language. I'm going in that direction again, I think the web needs a scripting language. Not one written for devs, but for people who think of themselves as users. That was the thing about 1-2-3. Also Hypercard. And my own product, UserLand Frontier. The idea that there are programmers who would reject the idea that they are programmers. It's a very subtle idea, people who are great hackers in the sense that they will work endlessly to find a way to do the thing they must do, who will develop a deep understanding of the problem they want to solve, but not as much depth on the nature of programming. Mitch Kapor was one of these people. He wrote a product in 1980 or so called VisiPlot. Written in BASIC. It sold really well. Programmers didn't like it. But they sold a lot because it worked really well with Visicalc, the leading spreadsheet of the day. He went on to found Lotus, and they put a macro language into 1-2-3, and the loop was closed. A user created a tool for other users to create tools for other users. The beat goes on. I love the idea of empowering users to create the products they want out of the components us &quot;serious&quot; devs create.

But I stopped that nonsense in 2004, and ever since I can't imagine why any sane person would. I also know that Andrew Cuomo was part of a very nasty campaign against Ed Koch on behalf of his father, Mario Cuomo, when both were running for mayor of NYC.

Back then this was nasty bullshit, but it didn't disqualify his father.

Decisions about life and death must not be part of a political process, and neither should someone's banishment from public life. If the charges stick, if we believe the person is really guilty, first take steps to protect potential victims, then have a process for determining innocence or guilt, and apply that process to everyone equally, regardless of whether they are a nominee for president, governor of a big state, or just some random schmuck.

In the interview the author said that hate speech by men includes the statement that not all men hate women. We always have to be so careful because you never know what's going to be considered hateful. Not hating women and saying so is not hate, imho, it's more like pleading for mercy.

It's hard to summarize the whole philosophy in a short blog post, but I'll try. When you win, try to protect the dignity of the people you defeated, assuming you have to live with them. He would say the women's movement in 2021 is doing it wrong, by aiming to destroy the lives of men.

Everyone suffers when people are abused. I know this first hand, from the experience of my parents and how that was passed down to my generation.

And when you see someone rushed off, as is happening with Cuomo, and what happened to Franken, and other people you probably never heard of, this has a nasty side-effect with people who identify with Cuomo and Franken and the others. They think you're going to do the same to them. Some would say if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about. Hah. You know where that comes from. That's the kind of shit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy&quot;&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; used to say about people who worried about being purged in one of his un-American trials.

					<outline text="I have a friend who I have known for a long time, who I love very much, who is one of the smartest people I know, who I would trust with my life, who says she does not want the vaccine. I have told her I'm going to write about it, without naming her, because the goal isn't to shame her, not even slightly, but rather to explore why I was enthusiastic to receive the vaccination, and to be open about it, to share my thoughts and experiences." created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:06:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, why I wanted the vaccine. The main reason: I was horrified to think of dying alone, suffocating, feeling awful, surrounded by people who were overworked and exhausted. Your body is theirs. Your life is in their hands. " created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:08:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Hospitals are harsh places. It's never quiet, the lights are always on, people come and go at all times. You're in pain, weak, and groggy from the meds they give you, and you have to grapple with whatever the future holds for you. I've been there myself, with parents who were gravely ill, this is not a place you want to go in good times, and it most definitely is not a place to be during a pandemic, where the odds of survival, if you're sick enough to be in the hospital, are awful. 1 in 10, say. So you're lying there, feeling terrible, with no one to help your soul through the most difficult thing a person has to do, knowing you're almost certainly not getting out of there alive. The fear of dying that way overwhelms me. I'd do almost anything to avoid it. Take a vaccine, twice? Sure! No problem. " created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:41:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay so what about the other side. Why would you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to take a vaccine. I listened, and skimmed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandemic.solari.com/family-financial-disclosure-form-for-covid-19-injections/&quot;&gt;brochure&lt;/a&gt; my friend sent. And I thought about it. Conceding that the vaccine makers are all big companies with problems in their history, I also know they went through a vetting process with the FDA, and other regulators elsewhere. Yes, it's possible that the government officials could be bribed, but I honestly don't believe they were. Had it only been the Trump government that was supervising it, I would have been more suspicious than I am now. I'd say I'm 95% confident that the FDA can be trusted, and they say the vaccines can be trusted so that's 95% good enough for me. Considering the risk of the awful death I outlined in the first part, this would be enough for me to risk it. But there's more. Suppose the government was in cahoots with the drug manufacturers, what is the probability that that fact would not leak? That's where my real trust lies. I think most professionals in every profession want to do it well. But in this case, &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; doctor and researcher would have to be in on it. And that's just not possible, imho. The world doesn't work that way. " created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:12:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="As much as I love and trust this friend, I also have a friend who is a biomedical researcher who I've known since he was a little person, five or six years old. A real brat who grew up to be a wonderful friend, who I have been talking with since the beginning of the pandemic. He's now in his mid-30s, and because of his field, had early access to the vaccine. He took it. The question of me not taking it never came up in our talks. " created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:23:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I follow lots of doctors' advice. Some of it has been awful and left me with disabilities. Ones that I can live with and are not painful, and ones which are actually hard to live with. So I am very skeptical of the competence of individual doctors. But I also understand that their prescriptions are the result of a huge amount of testing, statistics, cost and risk analysis. With vaccines, they aren't just prescribing a treatment for individuals, I also got the vaccine for everyone else. " created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:24:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is true of all medicine. The drugs we take to control our diseases aren't designed for each of us individually, they are designed for all humans, we are all assumed to be the same, because there's no other sane way to do it.

					<outline text="I'm juggling too many balls in my development work. I just lost about 24 hours tracking down a problem. I had some code outside of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/twitter&quot;&gt;davetwitter&lt;/a&gt; module that really belonged in there, so after a half-day of working on something else, I decided to quickly move the code from where it was to where I wanted it. However since I was actively developing the davetwitter module, I included it using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/&quot;&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; call to include a copy of the file, without going through NPM; and here's the key thing, in one place, and in another I used NPM. I couldn't understand why a properly initialized config object at startup would all of a sudden be completely uninitialized when I used it later. The answer was there were two davetwitters, one initialized the other not. A sloppy mistake I would never have made in a bootstrap. This kind of thing only happens when factoring. I guess the moral of the story is I should only attempt these integrations at the beginning of the day, when no other project is loaded into my brain, and I'd be more likely to spot these kinds of mismatches. In the end it cost me a lot of time to try to do it quickly. That's a lesson I've had to learn many times, and still am learning. I even have a slogan for it -- &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; " created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 15:18:35 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/12/juggler.png"/>

The very things that make Cuomo such an asshole may also make him a great leader in times of trouble. In this way it's totally parallel to the Al Franken cancellation. Also I suggest his daughters, whom we've heard a lot about (too much, although his critiques of their boyfriends were funny, I guess, you may have to be from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens&quot;&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; to get the humor), have a talk with him. Sit him down and make him listen. Dad we can possibly save your ass if you listen now. I'm guessing they know how unacceptable his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-209&quot;&gt;non-apology apology&lt;/a&gt; is. But ultimately this is not a decision for the press, or for other politicians, it's for the voters of New York to make. I think that in all but the most egregious emergencies, that's the right answer.  " created="Wed, 03 Mar 2021 14:23:39 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/01/mrFrog.png"/>

They had a two-sided discussion of the filibuster. One side for getting rid of it, and the the other for preserving it. The latter was argued by a establishment Republican &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JessAnderson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heritage.org/&quot;&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.

The real &quot;others&quot; are the nutjobs and fascists. They want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc&quot;&gt;burn the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; down.
