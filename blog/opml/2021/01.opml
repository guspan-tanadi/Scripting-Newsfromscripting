				<outline text="The pandemic came closer to me yesterday, I heard from a friend whose sister died of Covid. I feel lucky to have been vaccinated, but am confused about where we are now, and the future is still hard to have a feel for, or to even have a theory of. At least we have solid management on a national level, and that will help everyone, everywhere. The US never forgot how to be the US, even though we had an insane clown-like president for four years. The vaccine is here now, and more are on the way. And I know enough math to understand that the benefit of the vaccine starts as soon as one person is vaccinated. The more people who are immune, the slower the spread of the virus, complicated by its mutations which give it new power to evade. We're running a race now. At least we're &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the race now. That's something. But think of all the unnecessary suffering and death we're leaving behind. Today, it has a more substantial meaning to me than it did just a couple of days ago.

				<outline text="BTW, when you get vaccinated you are told to sign on to a CDC website and create an account. I did that. I want everyone to know it looks very well done. They're going to use a government network to track progress of the vaccine. First smart thing I've seen from the government, with my own two eyes, since the pandemic started.

I'll let you know. In the meantime, I solved the problem with the crappy UI for the LG screen I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;.

I loaded on all the apps I need, including Fubo, which is not available for the LG, and after a few hours I realized why the Roku remote is so superior. There are so few buttons, and they're big enough, that I don't have to look at the remote to operate the UI. This is important for a TV where you use it in a dark room, ideally. Roku is the best. People say it's dated, I think it's really that it works, and that's what I want. ;-)" created="Sat, 30 Jan 2021 16:25:14 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I think some people think if you can develop software that you can't have interesting ideas in, or deep knowledge of, other topics. We're a mystery to them. People have no idea how the bits do their dance to make the things happen on the screen. So if we talk about politics or media, well there can't be much there. They won't look into that box. Interestingly, it seems our supposed ignorance also extends to how the computers work. They always have to get an expert who if they ever wrote software hasn't done so for 20 years.

				<outline text="I read in a NY Times op-ed that we have to tax the rich to pay for pandemic relief. Not an income tax, which most would support, but an asset tax. So if your house has increased in value, you have to give the government money. Even if you didn’t sell it. There is no rule that you have to pay for the relief btw. The government prints money. There is no inflation, kind of the opposite pressure on the economy, we’re in a depression. Part of the reason for relief is to stimulate the economy. So a wealth tax could cause a stock market crash, I’m sure economic advisers would warn the president. All those rich people selling stock to pay the trillions in tax. Maybe we should tax people who write stupid op-ed in the NY Times instead. 🤪" created="Sat, 30 Jan 2021 15:49:03 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily&quot;&gt;NYT Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes very good, riveting even, and certainly useful. Esp covering the pandemic. But on politics, they are often in the woods. Taking something simple and not only making it sound complex, but &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt; that they're doing that. It's tricky. If I tell you right now there's no point reading further because you'll never understand what I'm saying, you might keep reading but you wouldn't understand. A certainty. Or if I say &quot;You're not going to like this..&quot; you won't like it. I've seen myself react this way. And later thought, hold on, I never got a chance to like it or dislike it! Oy.

I can't believe the reporter and interviewer didn't understand, but they kind of pretended they were confused. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:19:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So here's a rough timeline of the advent and demise of the filibuster in the US Senate. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:20:38 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true">
						<outline text="It was a rule first adopted for the US Senate in 1917. It said this. If someone is talking endlessly, you can stop them, with a 2/3 majority. When you stop them, you can vote, and then a 51% majority rules. Simple. Before 1917 there was no way to shut up a speaker and start to vote, believe it or not. The vote to shut someone up is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloture&quot;&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:20:31 GMT"/>
						<outline text="In 1974 they made it so that when you're voting on money only, 51 percent rules. No filibuster allowed. You'll hear this referred to as &quot;reconcilliation.&quot;" created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:21:24 GMT"/>
						<outline text="In 1975, they dropped it to 3/5 or 60 votes. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:21:19 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Then a key change. The speaker who wants to hold up the vote didn't actually have to take the floor and do the speaking. They just said they would do it if they had to. That was enough to prevent majority rule. One senator. That's pretty fucked up if you ask me. BTW, they call this a &quot;virtual filibuster&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. Cool." created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:25:18 GMT"/>
						<outline text="In 2013, they made it so that it didn't apply to confirming cabinet members and judges, except for Supreme Court judges. Only in Supreme Court confirmations would 60 votes be required, all other confirmations required 51. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:21:36 GMT"/>
						<outline text="And finally in 2017, they made it so it worked that way for Supreme Court judges too. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:21:45 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Sometimes it's the Repubs and sometimes the Dems that change the rules. It's a dance. When it's the Dems it's the Repubs who forced them to do it. Not so sure about the other way. The Repubs are the obstructionist and flamethrowing party. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:33:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Dems are Charlie Brown, the Repubs are Lucy. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 19:23:41 GMT" inlineImage="http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/29/charlieBrownAndLucyWithFootball.png"/>
					<outline text="Right now the filibuster can only be used for non-budgetary laws. There's a lot to that. For example, if  you wanted to overhaul health care in the US, you'd need a &quot;filibuster-proof&quot; majority which is a fancy way of saying you need 60 votes. Practically speaking neither party can get that many, so if it holds the current Congress can only pass legislation about money, and of course confirm judges. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:43:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway the TL;DR version is that they're whittling it down, and probalby next time, it'll go away altogether, going back to where they were before 1917. Simple majority rule, speaking time limited by rule, not vote (as it is in the House). I think everyone understands that's the fair way to go. Otherwise 40 percent of the Senate, which often is much less than 40 percent of the people, can stop anything from happening. That's what happened during the Obama presidency when teh Repubs controlled the Senate, and they are poised to do it again. But this time the Dems have it in their power to nuke the filibuster, and end the tyranny of the minority. And if they have the votes and guts to do it, they should. Because someday soon the Repubs will do it, and the first to do it, gets the greatest reward. They can change things so that it's unlikely the Repubs ever get a majority in the Senate again. And since they have been a solid minority party for quite some time, it's time for their party to end. Regroup, come back to earth and try to get a majority of the votes. They'll have to stop being autocratic authoritarian conspiracy theorist nutjobs to get the votes, one would hope. :boom:" created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:21:52 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Everyone relax. The Repubs are a fascist party. You don’t have to pretend you’re just discovering this. You’ve actually known it for quite some time. But it was worse. Previously they were the fascist party that ran the country with no checks. Now they're the minority party. And if the Democrats have the guts to nuke the filibuster they can add a couple of new states that are likely to vote Democratic, adding four members to the Senate. That should help a bit. And they can fund the recovery through reconciliation even if they aren't willing or able to get rid of the filibuster. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2021 01:31:48 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Today I am in agreement with NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Yang about the Knicks and Jeremy Lin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bflats2020/status/1354055404393811969&quot;&gt;He says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the Knicks dumped Jeremy Lin that was the last straw for me. This is the franchise that gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/5-worst-contracts-handed-out-in-nba-history/2&quot;&gt;Jerome James&lt;/a&gt; $30 million. You let the most beloved Knicks figure in years who lit the Garden and City up walk over money?  Come on.&quot; Amen. Under his note are a mix of comments including the usual that Lin wasn't that good, but who knows. If the Knicks had loved him maybe he would have continued to be an inspiration to the team and to New Yorkers. Instead, the Knicks stuck with Melo, who clearly was jealous of the attention &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/12/19/whatIfTheKnicksHadKeptJeremyLin.html&quot;&gt;Lin&lt;/a&gt; was getting. Lin might have done great if they had kept coach &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D%27Antoni&quot;&gt;Mike D'Antoni&lt;/a&gt;, but they let him go too. Who knows. But nothing was known at the moment the Knicks said goodbye to Linsanity. And for all the Asian-Americans who live in the city, a cause of celebration disappeared. I think I may have loved the whole thing mostly because of the way it made them light up in civic pride. And I couldn't help but feel that the NBA was being a bit racist in their treatment of Lin. My suggestion to the mayoral candidate, Mr Yang, is that he campaign on giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan&quot;&gt;James Dolan&lt;/a&gt; the boot. Find a new owner for the Knicks. I also agree with commenters who said you can't decide to leave a team.

However if they call for showers that means it will rain on and off, and it might be raining in one town and not in the other. It's more intermittent.

I think I paid $3300 new. Those were the days. It was a very reliable little car. I called it the Lawn Mower because that's about how powerful the engine was (slight exaggeration). Back in those days, the mid-70s, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.cfm&quot;&gt;Interstate Highway System&lt;/a&gt; wasn't finished, and I drove it all around the country, and a lot of it was on two-lane highways with heavy truck traffic. My poor little lawn mower (with me inside!) would get blown around a lot. But it was very reliable. Only broke down once, and that was due to operator error. I ended up trading it in for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/25/voyager.png&quot;&gt;hippie van&lt;/a&gt;, a high mileage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsqWuR9JI54&quot;&gt;1974 Plymouth Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, which I also drove all over the country.

Anyway one thing is for sure, we won't get many more chances to fix the country. I believe I know the answer -- look to the left and right not up or down. We don't have to unite with the miscreant Republicans in Congress. Most of them work for Moscow. We have to connect with other Americans who vote against democracy. This is not optional.

I’m a first gen American, child of people who ran for their lives, and were welcomed to this great country. They had no other place to go. What if America hadn't welcomed us? I've been to places where they hate outsiders, and many more places where they welcome them. I had a warm feeling walking around a small city in Italy, where I didn't speak the language and almost no one spoke English, but people were patient and smiled a lot and were gentle with the tourist from America. I got lost on the train, hundreds of miles out of my way, and the workers on the train spoiled me, passing me off to the next one to get me to my destination. Maybe they laughed, but I never saw it. The note they gave me explained my predicament in Italian, very respectfully (it was translated for me by my host when I arrived in Trieste). So I try to go out of my way to welcome visitors. Because it's a generous thing to do, but also because I know that I have benefited from this kind of generosity myself.

Anything more than 10 years old say, you can have for $1 a month, and do a bundling deal where I can get everything that's 10 years or older from any of the majors for $10 a month.

I can have one of them, but if I want both it'll cost me an extra $65 per month. If I felt strongly about either, or both, the decision would be easy. It's difficult only because I'm somewhat ambivalent about each. CNN is for mindless relaxation. I like watching Wolf Blitzer because he's so pompous. &quot;This &lt;i&gt;just in&lt;/i&gt; to the Situation Room,&quot; he likes to say, but of course it's a studio not a room, and nothing is &quot;in&quot; there. It's the most old and stuffy place. It's totally out. I find it relaxing the same way I used to find it relaxing to watch my grandmother knit, or my cat lick herself. I like watching Erin Burnett because (I know this is weird) I think she's hot. Esp when she's angry, and these days, she is very angry, a lot (at the same things we all are angry about btw). I also like CNN because they have better guests. But I could live without them. For 20+ years I never watched CNN. Then there are the Knicks. I've been a Knicks fan, on and off, for most of my life. I came back strong for Linsanity, and hated them for screwing that up, and then they fired Melo and Porzingas, well I kind of gave up for a while. The pandemic and the bubble made it seem illegit. But with a new coach this year, they're looking interestings, and they're competitive, and sometimes they win! I'd like a chance to watch, not sure I would actually watch. The sports news service Fubo doesn't have CNN, and YouTube TV has CNN but no Knicks. So I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1351299875791634486&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; to find out what people thought. As I write this the consensus is to leave CNN and go with the Knicks. I think it's time for a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_la_carte&quot;&gt;à la carte&lt;/a&gt; menu. Most of what's on either Fubo or YouTube TV doesn't interest me. Too many good choices on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, and podcasts are great these days too.

				<outline text="Trump doesn't need Twitter, he could just use a blog. If he did, there would be pathways for people to find out he updated, and software that would let his followers read his latest messages, in reverse chronological order. There would be no Twitter to shut him down. Now, I'm not sure where he could go to get the blog hosted. I wonder if Blogger and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/11/messageFromWordpress.png&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; et al have considered what they'd do if he started a blog in either of those places. Thing to know is &quot;RSS&quot; is a lot easier to deploy than a Twitter-like system, and it could be distributed. We looked at lots of those things in the heyday of [%search: Napster%] to route around the music industry. I hate that I'm helping Trump be the monster he is, but I feel obligated to share this with my followers, who probably want to think about real-world applications of distributed internet technology.

				<outline text="The arguments about how you don't have free speech on private platforms don't reflect the reality of Twitter and Facebook, which have monopolistic power in the worlds they define. Those worlds are huge, powerful, growing, and most important here -- exclusive. We call them [%search: silos%] in tech, but they behave like monopolies in other contexts. They don't imho have the rights of truly private companies because they wield government-like power that can have the effect of restricting speech. Because they are silos, there's no way to route around them. This is dangerous stuff. Suppose for example the Republican Party owned Twitter. You can see how that would damage free discourse in our political system. And it's not impossible for a political entity to take control of Twitter, they're not very highly valued in the stock market. That's why the government must be involved in decisions that cut off political leaders. What made this situation so difficult is that it was &lt;i&gt;the president&lt;/i&gt; who needed to be silenced, before he could do more damage. A tough call, and a very difficult precedent. BTW, I do advocate for political parties becoming social networks. I think they already are that.

				<outline text="Also, having the employees of Twitter and Facebook influening the censorship decisions the companies make is not good ethically. The employees should do their jobs, they should not personally have any say in who gets to use the network. We need ethical rules for professionals in tech. Here's an example from the medical profession. If you were a doctor in a hospital, and they wheeled in someone whose political opinions you abhor, you have to treat them no matter what. We insist that bakeries in Indiana bake cakes for gay couples as they would for heterosexual couples. It's easy to see when people you disagree with overstep professional ethical boundaries, much harder to see it when you do it yourself. " created="Sat, 09 Jan 2021 16:39:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="These kinds of decisions have a lot of impact. For example, I was blacklisted from speaking at a few tech conferences probably because their sponsors didn't like the affect my work was having on their closed networks. As a result, I'm perceived to having left tech, when in fact, a couple of powerful and/or rich people pressured conference promoters to not allow me a public presence. When I complained about it on my blog, or in person to friends, they shrugged it off, kind of the way Repubs shrug off ethical failures in their work. There are consequences to this kind of back-room deal-making. By this time very few people have any sympathy for Trump, but this act sets a precedent.

It was time for a purge. Saddam had decided to execute the whole legislature. The doors were locked and they started taking out people one by one and shooting them. Saddam, sadist that he was, videotaped it. So you could see what these guys were doing as they figured out, one by one, what was happening. So what did the condemned legislators do while waiting to be shot? They gave speeches, denouncing each other as the real enemy of the state, and proclaiming their love for Saddam, the best friend he ever had. Didn't work, they were all killed.&quot; They used to have video on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/&quot;&gt;PBS site&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a victim of the deprecation of Flash.

				<outline text="I had a conversation with a friend yesterday about why I go for connecting big things to other big things. It's not for money or fame, it's about power -- for the users of the open web. Which is what got me back into software development with a passion in the early 90s. I had already lived through a couple of generations of wide open &quot;blue sky&quot; that was later foreclosed on by the bankers. I felt that the technology of the web, as with the personal computer before it, could be used to enhance communication, and that could be used to solve problems, the ones we're still grappling with today. That's why it's not enough to make cool software, though I admit I love doing that -- it's for the power it gives to people to solve our problems. I still believe in that, as I did when I first got into software development in the 1970s.

						<outline text="I'd start with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/01.html#a204659&quot;&gt;45-minute podcast in 2020&lt;/a&gt; -- an oral history of how Frontier came to be.

						<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for the Frontier environment are online. " created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:10:08 GMT"/>

						<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tedchoward/Frontier/releases&quot;&gt;codebase&lt;/a&gt; is being maintained by Ted Howard. It's licensed under the GPL. (It's called the OPML Editor, but it really is just a distribution of Frontier. The result of some early disharmony when Frontier was initially released as open source in 2004.)" created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:20:56 GMT"/>
						<outline text="There are several levels to think about Frontier. At the base level, it's an outliner, object database, Algol-like language and its interpreter and verb set all &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; integrated. The language for example is designed to be edited in an outliner. The outliner is scriptable by the language. The database is the memory space for the language, so you don't have to get data and save data, your code runs in the context of the data. You can write scripts to write scripts and they're stored in the database. " created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:13:23 GMT"/>
						<outline text="At the next level up, it's applications, that again -- since they live in the same data space can share data, easily. We were able to build the first web CMS, blogging system, develop syndication for the web, podcasting, etc because Frontier is such a high level system, something that has become much more apparent to me now that I develop in Node and in the browser where you have to do all that yourself for every application. We could build much higher in Frontier, more quickly. " created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:15:01 GMT"/>
						<outline text="It's also a system scripting language. That was the original idea. The Mac is great because of the graphic user interface, but I was originally a Unix programmer, and missed the ability to script things in the OS. I knew the Mac OS was very capable, even if it was mostly hidden. We went further than that, since I came from app development on the Mac, I could see that with not very much new tech, we could wire up the apps so they could be combined by scripts, just like the OS. This all worked beautifully, we got support from lots of apps, including page layout, databases, web browsers. And later we added TCP verbs to Frontier, so it becamse in addition to all the other things it was, a hub for web development." created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:24:17 GMT"/>

					<outline text="My dream is to have a Linux port of Frontier. It's the only thing that keeps me on the Mac these days. All my servers run Ubuntu. Plainly put, products like Frontier that give users so much power are not really consistent with Apple's view of the world, but are very much consistent with Linux's. " created="Mon, 04 Jan 2021 14:11:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But just as important, I want to bring the ideas of Frontier to the Node/browser world. And we're getting there. Slowly. We have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;outliner&lt;/a&gt;, and are working on an easy scripting language based entirely on JavaScript, for one-off things that are imho too much work in asynchronous JavaScript.

				<outline text="The best podcasts are the ones with experts who simply share their expertise. So many podcasts begin with a long discussion about how everyone feels, with lots of chuckling and self-praise and inside jokes. No. One. Cares. The first time I noticed this was a podcast about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans&quot;&gt;The Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a great show that I loved, with cast members. That's cool. Talk about the characters you play. But I really don't care where you, the actor, grew up. Exceptions are obvious. If you're a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot;&gt;Beatle&lt;/a&gt;, go ahead and talk about yourself. If you're &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson&quot;&gt;Jack Nicholson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep&quot;&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;, yes please. I would like to know what makes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joni_Ernst&quot;&gt;Joni Ernst&lt;/a&gt; tick. But most experts aren't interesting as people. Your audience is looking to learn something, so teach us. " created="Fri, 01 Jan 2021 19:00:23 GMT" type="outline"/>

As a user of Medicare, I am surprised they haven't yet sent me an email about this. This is actually the kind of thing they do at Medicare. " created="Fri, 01 Jan 2021 16:41:19 GMT" type="outline"/>
