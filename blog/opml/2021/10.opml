You could see the revelations differently, at least now Facebook is trying to control the damaging speech. That's progress. But we do have bigger fish to fry. Journalism has decided that we should all aim our hate at Facebook, exclusively. That's a Fox-like tactic. If we're blaming Facebook, I guess we can't blame the NY Times or the WSJ or CNN, MSNBC, etc. As authoritarianism rises, we have to watch our journalism, for signs they are manipulating our focus, for signs they are controlled by or pandering to the fascists. Right now most of us, regardless of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/355526/americans-trust-media-dips-second-lowest-record.aspx&quot;&gt;what we say&lt;/a&gt; to pollsters, accept what the press says as truth.

Everyone's still in the game, and new people are showing up, more powerful than ever. And it seems the most powerful ones are the women. At one point Kendall says as much. I love this stuff.

				<outline text="I've been dealing with some complicated problems with JavaScript dates in &quot;Old School&quot;, which is the blogging CMS that Drummer uses. It's the same software I use to build Scripting News. I had to take a step back on the project yesterday because I was having so much trouble wrapping my head around what exactly the problem was. It was showing up in India and the Far East mostly. We didn't hit this set of problems with &quot;Fargo&quot;, because the blog rendering happened on the user's machine, so there was no timezone difference. And oddly, there is no problem with the RSS feeds of sites in the Far East. But at some times during the day if you posted something new from India, Malaysia or Australia, it would not appear on your home page. Anyway, it's great to have a bunch of smart super-interested people. It's very early days in Drummer Land, and the people really want their blogs to work, and of course I want this even more than they do. But I've never dealt with these issues before and they are mindfucks.

This is a big problem. They don't understand that there's a line they're not allowed to cross. In the US, Kanter has a right to his opinion. And the leader of China &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a brutal dictator.  And even if there's some question about it, Kanter is allowed to say what he thinks. This is a similar problem to the one they're having at Netflix with Dave Chappelle's show which I have not watched. I find him incredibly offensive. I'd love to have a private conversation with him where I ask what he's trying to accomplish. I find his stories humiliating. Is there some lesson I'm supposed to learn? If so, could we skip to that part. Anyway, I won't watch him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/business/media/netflix-protest-dave-chappelle.html&quot;&gt;Employees at Netflix&lt;/a&gt; were offended too, and they want Netflix to remove him. That's just as wrong as what China is doing to pressure the NBA about Kanter. One more. The NYT fucked up when they fired &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+donald+mcneil&quot;&gt;Donald McNeil&lt;/a&gt;. I think even the assholes who forced him out would agree, as their coverage of Covid is now bullshit, where before McNeil was canned, it was stellar. They had no place trying to control what appears in the NYT. They just work there. It's a platform for speech, I think even the most jaded and cynical reporter at the NYT would agree with that. And just because you get a paycheck from the NYT, that doesn't empower you to control other people's speech, same as China and Netflix. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/10/20/194852.html?title=whenPeopleLoveRss#a194954&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that when Zuck rolls out his new thing next week, we'll find out if the journalists properly understand their role. There will be no fake news yet on their new platform for them to complain about. But I guarantee you it will restrict speech in an effort to appease the journalists. Will they see this, and call bullshit? Or will their vanity and narcissism prevail.

My mother was one of those people, she didn't get sick until she was in her 80s. Me, on the other hand, I would have died before I was 10 if it wasn't for health care and antibiotics. I had a ruptured appendix, mis-diagnosed by a doctor as a stomach ache. Okay so medicine fucks up, a lot. I have limited vision because two eye doctors gave me bad advice and did surgery, the first fucked my left eye and the second made it worse. My hearing is blown in my left ear, because a doctor used a device to clear out earwax that damaged my eardrum. So now loud noise, including loud music, makes my head vibrate in an unpleasant way. Too bad, I used to love loud music. &lt;i&gt;But I am alive. &lt;/i&gt;My life having been saved twice by medicine now.

Invest as much time in tools as you do in product, and some years, invest all your time in tools. BTW, when I say a Linux version -- I mean an exact clone. The benchmark is whether it runs my software, not that it's a cool project. With these things it's the base of apps that matters. I think the language designers at big companies have lost the tune. The apps are what matters. That's why I program in JavaScript -- it's where all the code is.

The only thing to do when a tech company gets too big, is to force them to unbundle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling&quot;&gt;Bundling&lt;/a&gt; is how their size becomes a problem for us. So, for example, [[Google]] owning the dominant search engine and the dominant browser means they're inevitably going to turn the web into a perfect way to continue to own search. That's all that's going to matter to them. But the web has more to do. Google doesn't care. Facebook has also been successful at strangling the open web, forcing all writing on the net to flow through them. Or at least keeping it from flowing outside of them. If Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/18/1269.html&quot;&gt;fat ass&lt;/a&gt; wasn't squatting over the web, there would be a lot more movement. That might not solve the problem of Nazis ruining the world, but at least it gives the rest of us a chance to organize and solve the other vexing problems we have to deal with. RIght now all we're tasked with doing is making Zuck even richer, and even Zuck must be bored with that by now. The task for FB is to make it easy for the rest of us to run our own FB's and stay in touch with the people who use his FB. That's what happens when you get as big as they are. And it's far from an unsolvable problem. In fact they already have all the software written.

I guess it's the answer to the question: &quot;What's possible with computers that most people don't know about.&quot; They posted this in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheFutureofText/status/1447969903571505161/photo/3&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; at the same time I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1447971032053293066&quot;&gt;posting one&lt;/a&gt; about how we fixed the big problem with JavaScript in &quot;Drummer&quot;. I love JavaScript because it's the closest thing we have to a universal language. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; to thank for that (no sarcasm!). But there's no reason JS has to be hobbled by &lt;a href=&quot;http://callbackhell.com/&quot;&gt;callback hell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsmanifest.com/promises-in-javascript/&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/async-await&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever new hack they think up next. It's not hard to factor all that out. Every other language does it. There is absolutely no reason JavaScript has to leave all that mess visible to the programmer who wants it hidden. We proved that in [[Drummer]]. Now our implementation may not be fully baked, and at least one JS guru thinks it may be too slow, all that can be fixed.

This could be the last big product ship I do in my career. Docs were always treated as an afterthought. I want to try, just once, making it not an afterthought. To let the docs have enough time to become something I'm proud of, and something I can invest more time in, like the software, after we ship. Instead of staying away from them, I wanted to reach in, and do it up. As a result I've done enough writing for a book this year, you'll see it not only in the docs linked into the sidebar of the docs pages, but also in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.readUrl&quot;&gt;DocServer pages&lt;/a&gt; for each of the built-in scripting verbs.

They're all pretty bad, and could make a simple improvement that would completely eclipse the others. Here's the idea. I have a fixed space to put a fridge, and it's unusually narrow. I wish the designer of the house had left more space but it is what it is. Now, they make fridges in this shape, but they don't always have them in stock, esp now, when the supply chain is so disrupted. Here's the feature, it's a very Doc Searls-like thing, btw. I want to say hey Home Depot, this is the space I have. Let me know when you have a fridge I can buy that can be delivered within a couple of weeks. Instead they send me links to their website for refrigerators (at least they remembered that I'm shopping for one, so has Amazon) but they make me start over from scratch every time. That really sucks. Esp if they, at the moment, have a fridge that fits my very easy requirements. It would also be good for energy savings, because my current fridge is not running efficiently at all.

They are a product of tech, and there was some good in the foundations we built for them to use. And that good is in their product, whether or not they know it, or anyone believes it. It's still there. And if you use it, you must know that.

					<outline text="In 1983, my little software &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; was lucky to be invited to work on Apple's new computer in development, the Macintosh. Back then Apple wasn't as secretive as it is today. Everyone knew something was coming. We knew what it was called, but no one was saying what it was.  " created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:22:47 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2011/10/06/mac128.gif"/>
					<outline text="I gladly signed the agreement, and to this day I remember my first glimpse of the Mac. I arrived at a building on &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=10460+Bandley+Drive,+cupertino,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.328093,-122.033772&amp;spn=0.034364,0.027509&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=10460+Bandley+Dr,+Cupertino,+California+95014&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;vpsrc=6&quot;&gt;Bandley Drive&lt;/a&gt; in Cupertino some time in August 1983, and was met by Mike Boich and [[Guy Kawasaki]] from the Mac team. As we walked to the conference room, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a beige plastic box that was small and upright. And personal. How it said that to me, in just a glimpse, I have no idea. Is that a computer? Another thought popped into my head: It said &quot;I'm new.&quot; And that was something because back in those days everything was new. And it was personal, for me. All this from a fraction of a second look.  " created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:24:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Before that I had been an Apple II developer for a number of years, and was a devotee of Apple's products, though I also loved IBM's PC. There was a sense that we were all creating a new world, we all loved our work -- and Jobs and the people he nurtured at Apple, were leaders. I was on stage during the rollout of the Mac at Flint Center on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/01/dayintech_0124&quot;&gt;January 24, 1984&lt;/a&gt;. We shipped our product later that year and went on to have one of the first hits for the Mac. " created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:25:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But I want to tell a different story. Not a personal one, because I did not have a personal relationship with Steve Jobs. However, I built products that made it to market through his platforms. And in doing so, my vision was shaped by his. And later, with podcasting and RSS, I got to influence the direction of his products.  "/>
					<outline text="I wish Jobs had been a blogger, had written about his design process, so I could quote something. But he was the opposite of a blogger. Jobs was a mass communicator. No one in my generation has mastered the art as Jobs did. Today, with the outpouring of feeling on the net, are people mourning the man, or the phenomena he could unleash, just by saying &quot;One more thing.&quot; "/>
					<outline text="And he was a designer, even though people seem to be overlooking that in their remembrances, calling him more of a visionary. He got down in there and made small but very important design decisions about his products. Ones that had wide impact, for better, or worse. And often they weren't things his products did, rather things his products didn't do that defined them. "/>
					<outline text="The Mac was full of them. No cursor keys, so you had to use the mouse to navigate. I doubt if money was the reason, though leaving out the cursor keys probably saved a bit, and allowed the other keys to be bigger. It also meant Apple had to design its own keyboard, because they all had cursor keys. "/>
					<outline text="No hard drive. No expansion slots. No fan. "/>
					<outline text="A standardized user interface. This was very controversial with software developers such as myself. We felt what we did was user interface design. What would we do if the UI was already designed. New ideas sometimes don't get accepted right away by everyone.  "/>
					<outline text="And there were the almost-great ideas, like having networking built into every Mac starting with the Mac Plus. At the time networking wasn't even an option on IBM PCs. The networking, while a bold and great idea, didn't have the impact it should have had because the programming APIs were impossibly difficult. Had they been easy the Mac would have been the web, and we could have saved 20 years of incremental upgrades to turn the web into what the Mac was in 1984. #"/>
					<outline text="And at times Steve forgot where his ideas came from, or seemed to. He tormented Bill Gates, probably in jest, that he was stealing his ideas from Apple, when they both stole from Xerox. "/>
					<outline text="I had some personal interactions with Jobs, but they weren't very special. I doubt if he knew who I was. He called me once, out of the blue -- to rant about the stupidity of people at Apple. This was in 1997 just after coming back. Even today, after all these years, I have a hard time saying I agreed with him, and I didn't say so in the conversation, I just stayed silent. He doesn't suffer fools quietly, that's for sure. Ooops, he didn't. Hard to think of him in the past tense. Why did he call me then? I have no clue. #"/>
					<outline text="One more thing. "/>
					<outline text="In the first rush of memorials, people are comparing Jobs to Henry Ford (industrialist), Thomas Edison (inventor) or Walt Disney (media). But there's also a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright&quot;&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt; in there. All these men had imperfections, and greatness. But Wright's were, imho, more Jobsian than the others.  " created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:23:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&quot;He's so wonderfully prickly and famous for bursting into any house he built un-announced - just come in with a troop of people and show them the house, rearrange the furniture. He would even sneak into the houses to rearrange the furniture when the owners were away,&quot; T.C. Boyle wrote of Wright, but it also describes how early Mac developers felt after demoing their products for Steve. " created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:23:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To both Jobs and Wright the people who used their products were not as important as the computer or the building. More than the thing itself, what mattered to Wright, and I think what mattered to Jobs is the integrity of his vision. In a way it was a shame that the vision had to be instantiated.  ">
						<outline text="Jobs has also been compared to Leonardo Da Vinci, but I think that's something for historians to say, a couple of hundred years from now. Honestly, even comparing him to Ford or Edison is a bit over the top, because their achievements are understood with a hundred years of perspective. We are all contemporaries of Jobs, so our judgment isn't historical. He had a lot of impact on our lives, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a historical impact." created="Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:22:59 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Of course that's what made their ideas so great and influential. Among the many Jobs quotes worth remembering, and quoting -- Artists ship. I agree. And when you ship, along with the vision, comes reality. And then you learn and ship again.  "/>
					<outline text="There might still be Jobs shipments to come. We don't know what's in Apple's pipeline. But his thinking and vision, his person, will influence others and drive them to greatness, for generations to come."/>
