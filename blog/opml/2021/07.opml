				<outline text="I know the American Olympics basketball team is playing right now, where can I watch it? That's a hard question to answer, believe it or not, in 2021. In the early 90s, I did an experiment with my brother, in Palo Alto. We knew the Mets were playing in Los Angeles. We decided to try to find out the score, as an experiment. We knew we were living in information impoverished times, that it would eventually get much better. We tried calling the news organizations in NYC and Los Angeles. They had no idea what the score was. Certainly someone at the news org would know, we said. The person answering the phone didn't know. Tried calling the ballpark. The teams. We couldn't find out the score. Maybe it was possible but we couldn't think of a way to do it. This was before cell phones and before the web.

				<outline text="I heard from a friend of [[Gary Sevitsky]], a colleague of mine in the late 70s at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He and I were both smokers and grad students in Computer Science, so we'd go out for smoking breaks together while working at the Unix lab on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/1210+W+Dayton+St,+Madison,+WI+53706/@43.0711993,-89.4087568,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8807accf34599401:0xcbdcc82ca4309b0f!8m2!3d43.0711993!4d-89.4065681&quot;&gt;West Dayton St&lt;/a&gt;. It was in one of our hallway smoking conversations that he told me about Lisp editors that understood structure. I loved the idea, but I was programming in C, so I decided to build an editor for that language, with the same idea. That started me down a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;path&lt;/a&gt; that to this day I'm still working on. The combination of outline structures and programming, it's a big deal.

				<outline text="I never expect to hear any challenging ideas on cable tv news, but yesterday I actually did hear one, in passing, from a surprising source, [[John Heilemann]], who I think of as the ultimate &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jheil&quot;&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;. A good looking person, speaks well, but just shovels shit. But yesterday he said something &quot;out there&quot; not on the script they're all singing from on CNN and MSNBC. He said that Biden's response to the threat to democracy is too weak. He said if Biden was really signed on, he'd be putting roadblocks in the Repubs' way, every day. Using the incredible communication system that the White House can be, if used bravely, to expose the threat, again: Every. Damned. Day. I just gave [[Joe Trippi]], Dan Gillmor and Jay Rosen &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1420401709214572545&quot;&gt;grief&lt;/a&gt;, for only being willing to dip a toe in the water on the mess we're in. Trippi had an episode where he must've mentioned my name 20 times, but he never told his listeners &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/06/08.html#a152650&quot;&gt;what I told him&lt;/a&gt; he had to do. And of course he's not doing it. Presumably because he's still holding on to the option of having a career if the Repubs prevail? Doesn't he see that won't happen. And we're all about the same age, in our mid-60s. This isn't time to be thinking about our careers, it's a time in our lives when we can afford to take some risks. Think about it next time you decide to play it safe. (That's the problem with every successful person, you can't trust them, even when they're old, they're so set in the groove of safe-playing, they'll never actually do anything to change how things work. And very few young people are willing to risk, or would know what to do if they did.)" created="Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:13:41 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/05/13/knicksFan.png"/>
				<outline text="[[White Lotus]] on [[HBO]] got really &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-white-lotus/season-1&quot;&gt;good reviews&lt;/a&gt;, so I gave it a try.

However I have watched the first three episodes and I can see that I'm probably going all the way.

You don't have to pay close attention to what's going on. They were trying to make another Lost, which was okay, but they didn't get there. It's just plain garbage.

				<outline text="In the end I was rooting for the Milwaukee [[Bucks]]. I don't understand why, maybe it's because I had been following the east more than the west, largely due to the time difference. Or maybe it was my connection with Wisconsin? Whatever the reason I was happy last night because the Bucks won the series, 4-2, over the Phoenix Suns who are also an excellent team. I felt bad for [[Chris Paul]], this was his first chance in the finals and at age 37 perhaps his last, after a long playoff career, marred by injuries, and he didn't win, not just because the Bucks wanted it more. The playoff process is a long grind. He was still standing, but the Bucks prevailed -- because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo&quot;&gt;Giannis  Antetokounmpo&lt;/a&gt;. He's a superstar in league with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AooUnpj5nzE&quot;&gt;best&lt;/a&gt;, plays through pain, and basically carried the team on his back. He is also famous as a terrible free throw shooter, but last night he made 15 of 16 free throws. Without that, the Bucks would've lost, and we'd be going to a game 7 showdown in Phoenix tomorrow night. The most important thing to me, and Giannis commented on it too, is that the Bucks are a team that was developed through the draft and trades, not as a superteam formed for the purpose of winning a championship, like the detestable [[Brooklyn Nets]]. The two stars of the Bucks, Giannis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khris_Middleton&quot;&gt;Khris Middleton&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the Bucks since 2013. I feel great that the NBA, despite the best efforts of the superteams, is still a game where talent and perseverance wins. The playoffs were good this year, it was the year the Knicks competed well, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young&quot;&gt;young talent&lt;/a&gt; impressed and entertained.

Two teams I spend no mental energy on. I know the Suns are great. I watch their teamwork, amazing stuff.

You don't see them complaining about each others' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ltWN98PTJY&quot;&gt;manners&lt;/a&gt;. They get on with it. They have a goal. Another reason this year's playoffs are interesting, no matter who wins, the players on the winning team will be champions for the first time. So they're playing for something that's real to them. Next year, if they make it back to the finals as the Warriors, Heat, Lakers, Cavaliers, etc have in recent years, you wonder how they get motivated. Another trophy, big eff'in deal.

					<outline text="The interesting thing about drugs, I learned, is there is no such thing as a drug you enjoy that your body doesn't already produce on its own. Feelings work like that too. If someone's anger or fear upsets you, it's only possible because you already had the anger or fear yourself. It's also why people sometimes completely miss how other people feel, they mistake their own feelings for the other person's feelings. If someone does X that evokes my fear, I assume they caused the fear, and therefore are somehow to blame for it. It's usually not the experience the other person has. If you ask them &quot;Are you scared or angry?&quot; in a non-judgemental way (very hard to do I know) you might find they are not. Or if they were, it has passed. Do you remember how, as a child your emotions would flow so easily, one second a baby is smiling and happy, and two seconds later the baby screaming in apparent agony.

					<outline text="There is one important caveat. Fear and anger are useful feelings when you're really in danger. If a bear is attacking you, fear is correct! It doesn't matter if you had the feelings before, you're not projecting, you have to decide right now in real time to fight or run. And your brain is flooding your system with drugs that increase your chance of surviving the attack. But, if you mistakenly feel fear, ie there is no real threat, your body still releases the drugs. It's why we accumulate tension in the neck, because it's part of the fight or flight response. If you're in constant fear, your neck never relaxes. " created="Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:54:10 GMT"/>

I didn't go for it, felt like a stunt. Discussion leaders are like editors or teachers. They choose people to speak. We tried to discourage people from raising their hands (hard to enforce). The discussion leader is also empowered to move the mike to another person via a monitor (a human being, usually a student), who &quot;owned&quot; the mike. That's why things kept moving. I didn't choose DLs based on their fame, though I admit sometimes I gave into that, I chose people who could think on their feet in a classroom setting. So I often went with teachers, if one was available. There was a rule that vendors couldn't talk about their product. That became an issue at BloggerCon III at Stanford because Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurs will whore their product no matter what you say. BloggerCon was a users conference.

This is the kind of woman you see in Manhattan, perfectly made up, wearing a black dress that perfectly fits her body. They congregate here, somehow knowing this is where they should be. She is a Master of the Universe, can instantly command the attention of anyone she wants. And this godess wants to speak to me.&lt;i&gt;Me?&lt;/i&gt; What. It couldn't be. Must be a mistake. But in an instant, I realized this was the student I was waiting for. Of course she was talking to me. But in that split second my reaction was instinctual, not intellectual, a whole story had played out. I thought of this story the other day, while looking out of my house at a green mountain far in the distance, a field in the foreground, a stand of trees, a huge bird of prey flying overhead. Everything verdant, alive, ideal, perfect as a young confident aloof woman in a black dress in Manhattan. As impossible to describe as a whole.

				<outline text="The conclusion: archive.org, no matter how good it is and how ethical the people there are, is a last-resort way to backup the web. It can and should get better, but if we want to create a historic record of any kind about this era, we're going to have to be much more deliberate about it, even competitive. There are nothing but holes in our approach, all the way down to the architecture of the net itself, and at every level above it. We've created a very temporary way to record history. And like everything else, we aren't doing anything about it. " created="Thu, 01 Jul 2021 12:45:57 GMT" type="outline"/>
