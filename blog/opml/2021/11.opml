				<outline text="I'm glad I read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/19.html#a160302&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu&quot;&gt;1918 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; last year, because I understand something that most people should and don't. Mutations aren't necessarily bad, in fact over time the mutations will make the virus less deadly. It's all about evolution and survival of the fittest. Mutation is how evolution happens. A new variant shows up and if it is in some way more likely to propagate and survive than previous variants, it will stick around and thrive, and continue to mutate. If a virus kills its host -- that's not good for survivability. So what happens over time, a virus like Covid becomes less harmful and more transmissible, that's how it becomes &quot;the flu.&quot; The 1918 influenza virus is still with us today. But it doesn't kill people in the numbers that it did a hundred years ago. Over time Covid will get less deadly too." created="Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:44:30 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/04/19/coronavirus.png"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/november-29-2021&quot;&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/a&gt; confirmed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/30/hcrquote.png&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; that I had been wondering about -- do Congresspeople in the US, esp Republicans, worry about the safety of their families if they were to act independently of Trump. I was sure that some of them do, but I had never heard this reported on the news. So far they only talk about threats involving losing their jobs. But if the threats were about physical well-being, that's another thing. That's how it works in Russia for journalism and politics. The one year I was at Davos I spent some time hanging out with Russian journalists. This was in 2000, when Russia had supposedly liberalized. I went to a big session in the main hall where one of the officers of the Russian government was speaking, someone who I had been introduced to by my sponsor, the person who got me my white badge (a journalists' credential, the best one available, got me entry to every session, unlike most journalists attending). At one point I stood up and asked a challenging question of the Russian. He gave me a typical evasive answer. But here's the thing -- after I did that, none of my Russian journalist friends would talk to me. Obviously their political system didn't work like ours. Today when there is no pretense at freedom in Russia, I imagine it's much worse. And according to HCR's reporting, we're headed down that path in the US. The next year seems to be our last chance to turn it around. " created="Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:06:11 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/12/russianDressing.png"/>

					<outline text="I haven't been using the autopilot more than just trying it, seeing it veer into a head on collision, I quickly took control. i'm pretty sure it wasn't actually going to kill me, it was a simple situation, Highway 28 from Boiceville to West Hurley, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9792245,-74.2513003,3a,75y,117.7h,55.47t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPO1fyoXuIDtIHcKA4Ip3wRL8bdSc58hv_Qfmlh!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPO1fyoXuIDtIHcKA4Ip3wRL8bdSc58hv_Qfmlh%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-4.4466395-ya52.469-ro-1.6197597-fo100!7i7680!8i3840&quot;&gt;wide road&lt;/a&gt;, easy for the autopilot." created="Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:53:26 GMT"/>

I was doing no such thing." created="Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:54:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The thing that really distinguishes the Tesla as far as i'm concerned isn't the power, or battery, those are nice -- but the full integration of the computer system in the experience. The Subaru is a hodgepodge of different systems that don't know about each other. Very confusing. i've gotten to just using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CarPlay&quot;&gt;Car Play&lt;/a&gt; for everything and ignoring the rest.

And the same or better integration. It'll be running Apple, Amazon or Google software. and it will be as good as Tesla's software because they hire out of the same talent pool.

This is insane. Twitter is an important platform. Not supporting text is a religious thing, as if they didn't have water fountains in The Vatican. (I just came up with that randomly.)

The Beatles were falling apart, but all they needed was a little help. A manager. Someone to keep the assholes away. So many jerks were wasting their time and talent. And someone to make sure that George Harrison felt loved, and they were focusing on the music, which is what they were so incredibly great at. At one point, John Lennon is getting briefed on some bullshit plan for a concert, it's all nonsense, and in the background Paul McCartney is working out the music and lyrics for one of the greatest songs of all time -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYfEBY9NM4&quot;&gt;Let It Be&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="I hear there's some kind of controversy over a frying pan that VP Harris bought. I also hear this is getting a lot of play on the news. My filters must be working, because all I've heard of it are ridiculous rebuttals from people trying to argue somewhat logically that this is an illustration of old white men in charge of the Republican Party. I'm sure that's not it. It's marketing. They are always focus-group-testing bullshit like this to see if the people will pick it up, and then they shoot blasts of this bullshit at news people, and 1-in-10 of the focus-grouped bullshit gets picked up by the press. It's worth it, because it keeps the real news off the air, and helps people forget that Trump paid for his golf vacations at his own resorts with taxpayer money. Hundreds of millions of dollars. There's no logic to any of this. And they're not old white menu, that's bullshit. It's just marketing people, and computers.

				<outline text="I wonder why the tech industry hasn't done something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://bingeworthy.io/tv/&quot;&gt;BingeWorthy&lt;/a&gt;.

BW should really be a product offered by Netflix, Metacritic, Twitter, Facebook, even Google. What show to watch is a question millions of people have, esp this time of year. This is what the platform should look like. Share profiles w friends. An interesting twist, it's not just about finding shows to binge, it's about finding friends with similar taste.I was surprised to find that Jake Savin, who I worked with a long time ago, and I, have very similar taste.

The Silicon Valley design ethos, which I am schooled in and in a small way helped develop, is eating the world, as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/software-is-eating-the-world-5-years-later/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; so well. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/11/26.html#a201945&quot;&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt; I drove last year is a fine machine, and in some ways it's more comfortable than the Tesla, and it'll probably do better if we get a blizzard in the mountains. But its software is a jumble of poorly designed components that don't work well with each other from a UI standpoint. In that area the Tesla is perfect. It's a system designed to be understood by a modern user. The pre-Tesla car manufacturers have a long way to go to catch up to Tesla. " created="Thu, 25 Nov 2021 13:30:20 GMT"/>

Here's something I figured out the other night, driving on a mountain road with lots of turns and ups and downs, a road I'm quite familiar with -- the Tesla makes you a better driver. This is something my Subaru does too, you only have to hold the steering wheel loosely while navigating the turns and ups and downs. The road is well-marked and the car knows what to do. The Tesla even more so. It's like my iPhone which takes better pictures in 2021 than the 2011 model did. We like to say &quot;no filters&quot; but the truth is they're just really good filters that make you think you're the photographer, but the phone did the hard work. Same with the Tesla. I like driving it in the same way. It flatters me to think I'm that good a driver. I know the truth though -- I didn't become a better driver, I just got a car that makes me feel that I did.

				<outline text="The name of the scripting language in Drummer is Drumkit. I have reserved a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drumkit.org/&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for it.

When I read the post, I was pretty sure this was the name. I love how it connects to the name of the product, and it conveys the utility of having a language in a product such as Drummer. It also reflects the duality of the product. You can beat the drum in Drummer by writing, if you're a poet, and if you're a plumber, there's Drumkit. It's also nice because it leaves open the option of the language existing outside of Drummer, but no one will miss that the language &lt;i&gt;came from&lt;/i&gt; Drummer. That's important I've found. I left similar clues in RSS and in podcasting. I think naming a product is a community thing, the best names don't come from one person's mind. Gary understands a lot about what I'm trying to do with the language, how else could he have devised such a perfect name. He can be proud, much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;Dannie Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; can be proud of coming up with the name we eventually used for what we were calling audio blogging, even though there's a British journalist who falsely claims to have coined the term.

				<outline text="I'm spending a couple of days &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/7&quot;&gt;baking&lt;/a&gt; GitHub into &quot;Drummer&quot; via scripting.

Then when &quot;Frontier&quot; moved to the web, the apps were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudora_(email_client)&quot;&gt;Eudora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer&quot;&gt;MSIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHTTP&quot;&gt;MacHTTP&lt;/a&gt;, then Google and &quot;Manila&quot;, then WordPress and Twitter.

What I meant is that it's basic low-cost storage for everyone with a GitHub account that's about as easy to work with as MS-DOS was. For early adopters, what we used to call power users. It's an amazing resource. And that made me think of MS-DOS because both are owned by Microsoft and storage is basically what MS-DOS did, and btw, MS-DOS is the one product they didn't use as a weapon when they were trying to usurp the web, so it has a nice taste to it, still.

I guess a lot of families have it, but I think we had more than most because before my uncle and myself, we were the first in our family to be born in the US, everyone emigrated, running for their lives from the Nazis, and coming close to not making it. They were all survivors, and had traits of people with severe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder&quot;&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt;, untreated because this was the 60s and 70s, before they even knew such a thing existed in any formal treatable way. Anyway, I must've had a heavy family dream last night because I woke up feeling upset, unsettled, unloved -- all the feelings I knew very well in childhood.
