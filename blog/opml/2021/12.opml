For the first, I highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Color-Purple-Alice-Walker-audiobook/dp/B07LCSL8PS&quot;&gt;audiobook&lt;/a&gt; which is narrated by the author. Want to understand how slavery works in the United States? How the culture it spawned is American culture? This is your book. Beautifully written story, a real page-turner, and a total eye-opener. Klara and the Sun is near-future science fiction, about artificial friends. It's interesting in a meta-way because the artificial friend in the book, Klara, becomes &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; artificial friend.

				<outline text="I didn't watch a lot of movies this year, but my favorite, hands-down, was (of course) &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Don%27t%20Look%20Up&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Don't Look Up&lt;/a&gt;. It's more than a movie, it's an anthem, identifying the conclusion of our civilization one way or the other. We either overcome our need to be told simple bedtime stories and thus transform into something else, or we self-destruct. Either way, the past is not a template for the future. And they deliver the message in such an entertaining way! Maybe it's the last fun movie our species will ever create? People who judge the movie on its ability to entertain alone are totally missing the point. We have not only hit the wall, but it destroyed us. Now it's time to pick up the pieces, the best we can. As Dr Mindy &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/28/weReallyDidHaveEverything.png&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; at the end, &quot;We really did have everything.&quot; Note the past tense, and it's very true, in the movie and in our lives.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1476513810018099200&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis hit a nerve&lt;/a&gt; with a post about how journalism covers science, which is a process -- and rarely produces a final answer. Same is true of software of course, and law, and pretty much everything that humans learn about. So what to do? Well, that's where blogging comes in. We need a combination of expertise and understanding of the scientific process, and the ability to communicate in a way that non-scientists can understand. So you can either teach journalists to be better at science, or give scientists the tools and training to be more effective communicators. There is a compromise possible -- merge the two. Bring expertise into the journalistic process, don't force science through the minds of journalists who dumb it down, or misrepresent it. This was the initial idea of blogging, it's why I went into academia in 2003. And why a person like Jarvis, who is a professor at CUNY and a pioneering blogger, is in an ideal position to start bringing about the needed change.

She didn't start blogging this year, but this is the year I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=heather%20cox%20richardson&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;reading her&lt;/a&gt; daily posts, and I found them valuable and quite bloggy. I also loved her weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/now-then&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;.  But in one of the latest nightly posts she writes about &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=smoking%20gun&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;smoking guns&lt;/a&gt; as if we don't already know the extent of Trump's involvement in the January 6 coup. This general lack of courage on the part of the establishment press and politics is putting our future at great risk. The question isn't whether there's enough evidence to indict every member of the Trump Administration at the end of 2020 and early 2021, but rather why isn't the DoJ led by the supposedly courageous &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Merrick%20Garland&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt; doing anything to save the republic! When is it going to happen? And what are they afraid of. I think at the end of 2021 a blogger of the year should be grounded in reality. Our patience is long exhausted. Maybe a Civil War is inevitable. Maybe the original Civil War never ended. But I know this, I'd rather have the war while Abraham Lincoln (as played by Joe Biden) is president than &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Davis&quot;&gt;Jefferson Davis&lt;/a&gt; (Donald Trump). So let's say, for now, there is no Blogger of the Year for 2021. It should have been Heather Cox Richardson, and maybe if she stands up for the republic we can amend the record in 2022.

				<outline text="In the last decade or so I modified my art from making software for everyone to making software mostly for myself. Some projects take years to complete, and some remain on the shelf waiting for their turn to be rolled out. But the best product I've ever made I think is &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Daytona&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Daytona&lt;/a&gt;. A project that I was thinking about for a few years, but when it finally came time to write the code, took about &lt;i&gt;two weeks. &lt;/i&gt;Of course I spent a fair amount of time in advance of those two weeks creating packages and techniques that made it possible. But it is right now by far my favorite writing tool. I have most of my writing for the last 20+ years available to me through search, with full text, and a usable UI, unlike the increasingly sparse and unusable commercial search utilities. This proves one thing, there's still a fair amount of unexplored territory in the web. " created="Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:59:30 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="My favorite community project of 2021 are the art curators on Twitter. There's a group of Twitter users who, on behalf of great painters throughout history, are posting their works to Twitter. I follow many of them, and have written an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader&quot;&gt;open source app&lt;/a&gt; that reads their feeds and stores the art in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/data&quot;&gt;GitHub-hosted database&lt;/a&gt;. Current count: 31,867. It's downloadable and ready to be used in a Mac screen saver. It's a wonderful thing. Sometimes as I'm browsing Twitter one of the works shows up and I stare at it and experience the art, and how observe contrary it is to the rep of Twitter as being a place for loudmouths, psychos, narcissists and insurrectionists. This is pure art and art about art. You can't hold art down, pave it over, commercialize it. Art has a way of popping up through the cracks and sprouting whole new experiences.

The sad part is Google could have and should have done this years ago. I think that's why I had the mental block that kept me from pursuing this. I figured it must be hard. It wasn't.

But first, if you've watched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1474288736477356035&quot;&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; of the movie, this review is not a spoiler. It's a farce, along the lines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr Strangelove&lt;/a&gt;. It's LOL funny all through. The acting is amazing because they've got a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/24/cast.png&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; of the most wonderful actors of our day. It's hard for me to not love a movie that stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence&quot;&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;. The movie is sexy and true. Yes, we had &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/28/weReallyDidHaveEverything.png&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;, and we blew it -- in the movie and in real life.

I've already watched the ending twice, and I expect I'll watch the whole movie all the way through to the end at least once more. As to why the critics don't like it, the movie blames journalism for pretty much everything. I can imagine they must have realized doing so meant bad reviews, but they went for it anyway. If you're a climate change denier or a MAGA person, you probably won't like this movie either.

I like story-telling in movies, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix&quot;&gt;the first Matrix&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, was one of the best movies ever, as a story. It's a puzzle. Red pill, blue pill, who is Agent Smith, and The Oracle, and why does Morpheus think Neo is The One. And wtf is the Matrix! It's a beautiful story, and the characters -- young Keanu and Carrie-Anne, Hugo Weaving, Lawrence Fishburne. In the 2021 version, they recast a bunch of them and spent huge amounts of time explaining why. Who cares. When I switched it off last night, the characters were still yapping about what changed and why. It reminded me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood:_The_Movie&quot;&gt;Deadwood movie&lt;/a&gt;, a movie whose plot didn't start until they finished re-introducing all the main characters. And then they had about 40 minutes for something unmemorable, even stupid. Anyway I will finish Matrix 4, if only because maybe there's something worthwhile there. And I know some people really liked it, I don't understand why, but I respect that. Maybe sequels like this shouldn't be made, or maybe no one has figured out yet how to do it. Or maybe all movies these days have to be all about action and narration without acting or plots getting in the way.

I started by reviewing the top level folders on scripting.com. I saw a folder called opmlArchive. In there were folders for the years 1997 through 2010. I opened them up, and saw folders with each of the months, 01, 02 and so on. Then I opened each of those, and there were OPML files for each of the days. And inside the OPML files, the source text for that day's blog. And they're pretty much exactly the same format as the format I use today. My CMS isn't called Old School for nothing. Anyway I'm just merging the daily files into monthly ones, to be consistent with the archive that I've been keeping on GitHub since 2017. In few minutes I'll be adding 12+ years of source text. And then after a bit I'll load all this into Daytona. My memory is so weird, I vaguely remember setting this up. I mostly just do things like that and forget them.

				<outline text="Why podcasting isn't dominated" created="Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:42:05 GMT" type="outline" description="Users have the power, but they have to use it. ">
					<outline text="I asked this question &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/20.html#a142628&quot;&gt;on the blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1472930147137466372&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. And so far all the answers have been about the companies, and imho they've been wrong. First, there are plenty of huge tech companies that have set out to own podcasting, and were fairly sure their dominance in other categories would help them achieve dominance in podcasting. I've listened to their bluster and at times have been worried that it might work. After all Google owns search, and Apple made the iPod (and therefore it's assumed by many that they invented podcasting). Amazon owns Audible which dominates audiobooks. Spotify is huge, and they've set out to dominate podcasting, and maybe they will, but they haven't so far. " created="Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:42:20 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/22/paulBunyan.png"/>
					<outline text="Second, how do I know that no single tech company dominates podcasting, or as some people claim a few of them do? Because the market doesn't behave like one that is dominated. There is no gatekeeper that can turn down your podcast, make you not cover topics they don't want covered or use language or images they don't think are acceptable, or compete with them. All these are features of dominated product categories. The press doesn't turn to Spotify or Apple to blame them for something someone said on a podcast that incited a riot or threatened a celebrity or politician. They don't turn to the companies because they are not dominant and they know it. I know no big tech company dominates podcasting because if you want to start a podcast there's no one who can tell you you can't. If you want to listen to a podast on your favorite player, yes there are some you can't, but you can for the vast majority of them. " created="Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:44:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now to the question that I actually asked that no one seems to want to answer. Why? Why is it this way? Why podcasting and not the other tech-based media. Why is podcasting still open after over 20 years? Drumroll please. The answer: there are enough users who understand how it is supposed to work. They expect to be able to listen to any podcast anywhere they want. Most probably don't understand why they have this ability, about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=podcasting&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and technology design that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/12/21/metaImage.png&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; it possible, but they understand that they have the ability. And it doesn't have to be all of them or even most of them, just &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; of them, whatever that means. And for right now, at the end of 2021, there are enough. Podcasting has always been and remains an open platform. I can't say it will be for the future, but so far so good. " created="Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:46:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'm not saying this as a form of self-congratulation, or an appeal for kudos, though I gratefully accept any that are offered. I'm focusing your attention on this because &lt;i&gt;we can do it again.&lt;/i&gt; Start a new medium with the understanding that users have the right to move, the right to use any tool they want to create media or listen to (or read or view or experience) it. That there are no gatekeepers that control them. " created="Tue, 21 Dec 2021 12:49:54 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/06/23/mrNatural.png"/>
					<outline text="In other words the example of podcasting says there's hope. We don't have to accept a bad answer. We can have freedom, and users are the key to that.

This is the problem in all docs. Even if you're a good docs writer, and I've had a lot of practice, and you know the product well, and care about the users, some things just won't have a place. So you document them on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, or in the Change Notes outline, and hope people can find them in a search engine. But they keep doing a worse job of indexing our stuff, and they don't know what is a Drummer doc and what isn't, so you can't say for example, &quot;search the Drummer docs for instructions on how to restore a blog.opml file in a myfiles archive&quot; which is a question a user posed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/140#issue-1082790948&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.

I come from both cultures, Maisel from my home in NY. Miriam's mother and father could have been my parents or grandparents. And I lived the HACF life in Silicon Valley in the same timeframe as the show. But for some reason when I tried MMM this week, I got into it. I think I figured out why. The family I was part of is now completely gone, and has been gone since early 2018 when my mother died. Enough time has passed that the memory has softened and idealized in an emotional way. I still remember why they upset me so, but I don't feel it so much any more, so Maisel is tolerable, even adorable. And bingeable. TV shows are excellent because they immerse you in their society, you start thinking of the characters on the show as members of your clan. Maybe I should try HACF again. Also, it's really funny that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; comes even closer to the lifestyle I led, and I loved it when it came out!

					<outline text="It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/manila/opml/spec.html&quot;&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt; designed as the interchange format for the outliner in &quot;Frontier&quot;, a scripting environment I created at UserLand Software in the late 80s and 90s. In Frontier, an outline could be a script, a menu, an object database, a blog, a blog post, or just an outline. We needed a way to exchange outlines with our product and other outliners, so this is what we came up with. OPML wasn't the first interchange format for outlines, there was a format called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/fatpages/misc/dotHeadFormat.html&quot;&gt;.HEAD&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced dot-head) that we used for outliners in the 80s, but OPML was better because not only did it handle structures of text, they could also have attributes. Anywhere you could put an outline node, you could add attributes. They aren't visible when you're editing, but they're accessible through a dialog, or software can automatically attach attributes, such as the creation date of a node, so that they are indentifiable and can be pointed to from outside the outline. " created="Sat, 11 Dec 2021 14:53:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then came a very special attribute, the &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; attribute -- which says basically that this node in an outline is a document, so the outline containing the node behaves like a file system. That's how I edit my blog. Each post is a document contained within a day, which is part of a month. I find it convenient to start a new outline every month, and archive the previous month in a GitHub repository. You can study what real-world OPML looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opml&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, I have 4.5 years of archives there. I recently created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;search utility&lt;/a&gt; for those, which is kind of like the tagging systems you see in Tools For Thought products, but I don't have to tag anything, I can just search for the words.

					<outline text="Anyway that's a longish answer to a question that can be answered simply by saying that an OPML file can be whatever size makes sense for the application. It's just a file format. Its signficance, I hope, is that it can provide a way for all kinds of outliners, and applications that accept outlines as input, to share the same data, making it possible for lots of outline-based tools to co-exist, and for users to be able the use the right tool for whatever job they want to do right now, without having to convert any data.

I really like the tunes, there's a Tom Petty song (American Girl), and Fleetwood Mac, Genesis, even a Beatles song. I know them in order. I pay attention to her instructions, somewhat, but I do what I want to do. I take a break after every song, even though she wants me to keep going. As long as the music is off I don't have to pedal. I take a sip of water and let my legs recover a little. And then I'm back at it. I sing along. Close my eyes a lot. And before you know it, the ride is over. And I always feel great after the ride.

The rooftop concert was a Ouija board thing. Something Ringo could have an opinion about, so they had the concert. I thought it was awful, esp for the last live performance of the Beatles.

Or they could have arranged to be surprise guests at a London club. I'm sure they were there, and any of them would be happy to host the Beatles.

It seems like everything they did in the album Let It Be was no more interesting than what they did in Magical Mystery Tour or the White Album or Sargent Pepper, Revolver, they were all huge leaps.

					<outline text="Another thing I learned, over the whole three episodes, is how little the Beatles cared about business and how much of it they delegated.

Lennon was in awe of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Klein&quot;&gt;Allen Klein&lt;/a&gt;, but he sounds like a schmuck. I think if the Beatles had a manager who loved them, and cared about them, they might have continued writing music together for many years, and gotten what they wanted out of independence. It doesn't seem like it had to be either/or, and what's also clear is how much love there was between them. It's a common pattern, something great happens, and the assholes move in and squeeze the life out of it. How strong the Beatles were that they got so far. Or how much their manager, who had just died, must've loved them. " created="Sun, 05 Dec 2021 15:02:39 GMT"/>
