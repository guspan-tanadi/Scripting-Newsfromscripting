Nothing much will change when the product is available publicly, the process will continue, more fixes and features, more interop.

					<outline text="Yesterday I noticed that one of my server apps had restarted 21 hours ago, so I looked at the log, saw where it should have checked if something was &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/a&gt;, added the check, published a new release, then went to the app, updated it, tried to restart it, and it failed. The source of the failure was a very small module known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat&quot;&gt;dateformat&lt;/a&gt; that had updated, which is fine, maybe they have bugs. So I went to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/releases&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;, and saw a reference to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/29/breakingChange.png&quot;&gt;breaking change&lt;/a&gt;, which sounded like it might be the thing that broke my app (not well documented imho), and I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/releases/tag/v4.5.1&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; before the breaking change, released on Jan 30, and updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/blob/master/package.json&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of this tale to require the earlier version, rebuilt it, and it worked.

					<outline text="Sounds painless enough, but each step involved me figuring out how this or that worked. A tiny area of one app that I had long ago forgot about because you figure once date formatting is done, it's done. Right. It's not like there's any great technological breakthroughs in date formatting, btw. " created="Wed, 29 Sep 2021 13:38:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It turned out that the maintainers of the dateformat module wanted to use a feature that wasn't in the version of Node my server was running. As far as I can tell the feature had nothing to do with its mission, formatting dates. What they were saying is I should accept their change and upgrade to the version of Node they require.  if I were to do that, I'd have to shut down the server, upgrade Node, and then test all of the apps running on the server to see whether the new version of Node broke them, which imho is much more likely than dateformat breaking them. " created="Wed, 29 Sep 2021 13:39:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is the culture of development these days. Breaking changes for stylistic reasons are fine. It's the reward for maintaining a useful &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; module -- you can force the attention of developers all over the place. This is just one module, add it up and the half-life of a Node app is very short indeed. Not a good situation imho. " created="Wed, 29 Sep 2021 13:39:29 GMT"/>

All of a sudden the phone app on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a&quot;&gt;Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt; refuses to connect over wifi, a requirement since there's no cell service here. Not having a reliable way to make a phone call, that's not okay. And the way I used to make calls on my computer with Google Hangouts, that doesn't work anymore either. They said use Google Chat now. OK, but where in Google Chat, on my desktop (which they have) can I make a phone call? Every one of these companies is missing part of the plan for how to build reliable service around the still relatively new (I guess) open network. They all still want to completely control you and soak you for services you don't want, and change things around so you never get to feel confident in using their software.

In the latter, the platform vendor has all the power, you can only coexist with them on their terms, and they can change the terms at any time. This has always been true in my experience. The way we work as equals is we agree on an interchange format. I have committed to supporting [[OPML]] in all my products. So they can all be replaced. And so can yours, if you make it easy for users to migrate, and when you do that you also open the door for people to create products that plug into yours without having to replace yours. We compete as equals. We compete to please users. We are free to build on each others' work. That's the kind of discipline I like as a developer.

They're having a grand time, while I (the listener) am deciding whether or not to cut them off, based on the probability that they'll ever say anything interesting before the end. Yesterday I cut them off and listened to music for the second half of my ride. It's the same reason I can't watch any MSNBC show for more than 3 minutes. They're filling the air, meantime I know there are things going on they should be informing me of, and add to things my mind can think about. Okay so N&amp;T had a bad episode, not the end of the world, the other most recent episodes are totally worth listening to, I highly recommend them, and I will keep listening in the hope that the NYC episode was just a bad idea they followed through on instead of canning.

				<outline text="Thinking about the extent that Boomers are held responsible for where we're at, I still think that's nuts, the more I learn about slavery and how the Civil War is still going on, that's what we are fighting about in the US, that's why we can't get our shit together. We haven't accepted a very large part of our population, people who are fully entitled American citizens. Then I wondered about all the post-boomer generations that blame us. I wonder if they voted in every election they were entitled to vote in. What are the percentages of participation in democracy among the generations. I don't know if the idea of the vote as a sacred right is a Boomer thing, or what.  I know my parents had the participation bug. I got it from them, I'm sure. But if you didn't vote, I think it's hard to blame others. My friend NakedJen has a wonderful slogan for this.

She showed me all her icons. I asked how she knew that, she said &quot;I just know it.&quot;"/>

That she would get back a ton of time for doing this, and I'd be able to show her a lot more cool things she could do with her Mac. But she won't do it. It's as if one could drive a car without knowing which pedal was the brake and which the gas, or what the gear shift was, or the difference between the steering wheel and the volume control on the radio. If my mother drove her car like she drives her Mac the streets of NYC would not be a safe place to drive."/>
					<outline text="This came up over the weekend because I was trying to teach her to use WordPress, software that seems fairly straightforward and easy to use -- to me, but when viewed through my mother's eyes was unbelievalby difficult. It's not totally WordPress's fault. There are so many layers to the screen of a Macintosh. First there's the OS, it has menus, a desktop, windows, etc. All of which have controls and their own logic. Then there's the browser. It has an address bar, a search box (hers got stretched somehow so the address bar was tiny and it was huge (why is the search box even resizable?).

				<outline text="I'm doing user support for the first time since [[Fargo]] days and am reminded of what sucks about it. In the groups I am part of, as a user,when I ask for help I have reproduced the problem on my machine several times. I have tried workarounds. I've thought about it. I don't immediately ask for help, because I know the other people are like me, doing it for love, it's not their job, they're helping because they like to help. For whatever reason the groups I assemble often don't do this. At the first sign of trouble they post something that's impossible to understand, and it's really clear they didn't try it again, or they would have spotted their mistake. Support is a dear resource. Use it when you need it, but be sure first that you do need it. " created="Fri, 03 Sep 2021 14:58:48 GMT" type="outline"/>
