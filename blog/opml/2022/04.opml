				<outline text="Four months ago I shipped a package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/myLogseqBlog&quot;&gt;myLogseqBlog&lt;/a&gt; that made it possible to publish from LogSeq outlines to Old School, following the same path as blogs written using Drummer, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. My hope was this would serve as a seed that would help someone who was skilled at doing LogSeq add-ons to take my code and convert it to something that ran inside LogSeq, so blog publishing from an outline would be just as easy there as it is in Drummer. Well it took a while, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/phonetonote&quot;&gt;Scott Block&lt;/a&gt;, a brilliant and persistent programmer, made it work.

					<outline text="Then we got personal computers. Steve Jobs had a term for this. He called them &quot;fractional horsepower&quot; computers, to compare it to large mainframes." created="Sat, 30 Apr 2022 19:40:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I loved the idea of the Mac because it made the power of the mainframe usable by independent and free individuals. People who had ideas, and wanted to organize and share them. In the old centralized way of doing things it wasn't so easy to get a computer to do the kinds of things Macs did, because there was such a variety of software, and anyone could make software, ordinary people who were motivated. That's how the great stuff was made, by people. This was a form of freedom we don't enjoy so much these days because we all use big corporate mainframe-style software, like Twitter, Facebook etc. (I'm different, I've kept making software in a personal way, now for almost 50 years believe it or not.)" created="Sat, 30 Apr 2022 19:40:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Back then freedom was a big part of what tech offered. And it worked. We wouldn't have Twitter today if it couldn't build on PCs. Twitter is made out of our freedom, captured and condensed into billions of dollars to make a few very rich people even richer. You and I how much do we get for our risk and creativity? Nothing. They've been really cheap in sharing the profits, and the credit, btw. " created="Sun, 01 May 2022 02:34:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Tech goes in cycles, like everything else. Now that an oligarch owns Twitter, even though he knows how to tweet, and feels like a man of the people, he lives in a different world from you and I. He's cute but he owns us. He has freedom, don't believe for a minute that you do. Key point. This is how rich people trick us all the time. They get us to identify with them. That's why so many poor people vote Republican. This idea goes all the way back to slavery." created="Sat, 30 Apr 2022 19:42:44 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The old owners of Twitter used their power to make Twitter be like they wanted it to be. If you were their friend you did better than if you weren't. This is a fact. That kept people from criticizing them. The same way the owners of the big media companies are immune from criticism, or even exposure. Who owns MSNBC. Think about it. I bet you don't know.

					<outline text="There's a lot of talk on Twitter today about what to do if Elon Musk ends up owning Twitter.

If we're willing to trust our bodies to an algorithm, why not moderation? I think the problem is solvable. Musk's other companies solve bigger problems adequately.

There weren't many people rooting for the Nets in the arena. There was a lot more enthusiasm for the Celtics, because they're an exciting team and they're going somewhere. Boston is close and NYC is so huge there are already a fair number of Celtics fans here. Today's Nets don't have a home court. They haven't sold the idea of the Nets to the NBA fans here. NYC is huge, even a team without much of a following should be able to fill the arena with enthusiasm. But Kevin Durant, the leader of the team, the reason the Nets are supposedly contenders, never approached the city as something he had to win over. They must've thought fans are simple. They loved me in Oklahoma and Oakland, of course they'll love me here. I don't think anyone in particular loved KD in Oakland, they do love Curry, Thompson and Green. KD was a carpetbagger in Oakland as he is in NYC. He came to the city with disrespect for NBA fans here. He could have said hey it's great to be in NY, love the energy of Knicks fans, I hope some of you will come out to see the Nets. That would've been appropriate. Instead he disses the Knicks, the Garden and by implication those of us who have suffered with the Knicks all these years. Yeah we know they suck, but we &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; them. They're family. You don't get to dis them. So this is the price. No one here cares if this year's Nets win. And some of us want them to lose. At this point it seems unless there's a miracle, the Nets are eliminated. If he's going to stick around KD should ask for a reboot with Knicks fans. Forget about a crosstown rivalry. For now the Knicks own the city, even if they suck. Ask for our support. You might get it next time you're in the playoffs. But you'll have to earn it by showing up in our city in the meantime.

One reason it's so cool, no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/2022/04/06/lakers-eliminated-from-playoff-contention-suns-loss&quot;&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt;! Hopefully at some point he'll stop trying to form superteams and finish his career with humility and grace, away from contention. I am rooting for teams with stars who have never won a championship, notably the Phoenix Suns and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul&quot;&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also glad to see the Warriors are back in the mix with the same big three and no Kevin Durant, who I will be rooting &lt;i&gt;against&lt;/i&gt; every time he takes the court. I hope Boston blows the Nets out so that embarassment for the great city of New York is over for another year. Maybe they want him back in Oklahoma? I'm interested to see if James Harden can get it together to have a good long run, and while he has never won a championship, hmmm, I don't know. He played on the Nets this year, and for that reason I question his motivations. I do not like artificially created superteams designed to win championships. And of course they rarely do. So hopefully that chapter of the NBA will be over.

				<outline text="I noticed this morning that &quot;1999.io&quot; was getting a bunch of hits. It's a blogging system I wrote in 2015 and 2016, after learning Facebook, and liking a lot of the features in it, and thought they should make their way back into the blogging world. That was the idea. It's a full-featured blogging system, written in JavaScript with a Node.js backend, intending to be a revisit to the ideas in Manila, which came out in 1999, hence the name of 1999.io. But -- I decided to stop building on it in 2017, because I wanted to use something else. The thing about 1999.io, is it made a compromise with Google Reader and the RSS readers that followed it. All posts had titles. And they were meant to be multi-paragraph things, and it had no provision for short titleless posts. I was trying to surrender to the mass decision that blogs had a certain form, but it wasn't my form. That led me to create &quot;Old School&quot;, which was a return to the blogging system I used before Manila, based on the editor being an outliner. That meant leaving 1999.io behind. But it's still there. And someone out there is using it for something. I don't have any plans to work on it or use it, but does still appear to work. Here's a Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for 1999.io on this site, in case you're interested in exploring.

					<outline text="I think this same idea applies to the evolution of software. The theory says FrontPage and Dreamweaver will never fit well into the writing and publishing environment of 2022 and beyond. The evolutionary fork that took us off that course was when Apple made the decision in the late 80s to make networking virtually impossible to write software for. It was such a tease, because Macs all had builtin networking hardware, and the wires were easy to set up and inexpensive. They wanted all Macs to be connected. But for some reason the APIs were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inscrutable&quot;&gt;inscrutable&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I banged my head against those APIs for years. I gave up when I saw how easy HTTP was to develop for. If Apple had the same insight for software that they had for hardware, if they factored their APIs so that networking could easily be added to any application, as it is on the web, we'd be evolving off a base with a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/ImagingWithQuickDraw.pdf&quot;&gt;well-documented GDI&lt;/a&gt; and a well-defined graphic user interface, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/files/papers/Apple%20Human%20Interface%20Guidelines%201987.pdf&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that made sure all software worked the same, as opposed to the user interface chaos of the web.

In a world where most people are using smart phones, there isn't that much you can do with wizzy tools that shows up for the reader. Today's writers need the UI to get out of their way, and make it easy to create more complex and useful structures for notes. I think this is the way forward. And we should of course keep improving and simplifying the underlying network protocols. " created="Fri, 08 Apr 2022 15:19:35 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I'm working on a piece of software built around a single closure. The data type that's at the center of the user experience. When you create it as a closure, it is very easy to tweak it up. Every instance of a closure is a little world unto itself. You have to set up protocols for the outside world to speak to the object. That's good because there can't be any other interactions. When debugging you just have to look there. And when there are no deeply hidden bugs, its deliciously easy to work on. But when you type &lt;code&gt;[feedItem, theFeed]&lt;/code&gt; when you really meant &lt;code&gt;{feedItem, theFeed}&lt;/code&gt;, and your eyes are imperfect as mine are, and you tend to see what you expect to see in debugging, and miss the little subtle mistakes. Whether you use square or curly brackets makes all the difference in the world. It can turn rich structures into &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. And all the debugging code in the world doesn't help until you see the square brackets are where there should be curly ones. I think this is a lot like Wordle. The pattern has to be seen by the subconscious. You don't move on until you've solved the problem. But unlike Wordle you get as many tries as it takes.

				<outline text="BTW, written explanations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;closures&lt;/a&gt; always read like gobbledygook. Here's what I would say. A closure is an &lt;i&gt;instance&lt;/i&gt; of a function, as opposed to a &lt;i&gt;call&lt;/i&gt; to a function, but they start life as a call. If when you call the function, it still has work to do, in the form of local functions that run every second or minute, for example, or to respond to messages from the outside, such as a click on an object it created (and is linked into the DOM), or an HTTP request, then all its data sticks around. And it's private to the function, no one else can get at it. That helps you keep the overall program simpler, there are fewer things that can go wrong.  Now as I read this I'm not sure I got it, but it's close. I guess the thing is I've never written an interpreter for a language that has closures. In my experience that's when you really understand a piece of machinery, when it stops being magic -- when you've implemented it. " created="Sun, 03 Apr 2022 13:44:25 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I hate April 1 on the web and esp in news orgs, whose &lt;i&gt;business&lt;/i&gt; is posting stuff that's true. I tend to take things literally as I read them, and puzzle my way through strange news, until it hits that I've been burned. I waste a fair amount of time on April 1 wading through this nonsense. The only thing you can do is let people know in advance that if they troll you with one of these things, if it's on a system where I can block you, that's what I do. If it's a news org, I try to remember never to trust anything they write, because they clearly have no respect for their own mission. So I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/1729710617236336?comment_id=1729845797222818&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/01/fbwarningaboutapril1garbage.png&quot;&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1509848417098518534&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; establishing this rule, and wouldn't you know it, some people actually post &quot;jokes&quot; there. Mostly it's harrassment. Bitterness I guess. They don't like life, so they drop little turds on message threads to get attention. Yes I block them. Yes, it's tiresome. There is a certain amount of overhead to maintaining one's integrity. If you say you're going to block someone, you have to actually do it.
