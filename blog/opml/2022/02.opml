				<outline text="You really should listen to this week's &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/russian-invasion/&quot;&gt;Radio Open Source&lt;/a&gt; for a unique view of what Russia's invasion of Ukraine means. Remarkable agreement among the academics. Whatever you think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin&quot;&gt;Putin&lt;/a&gt;, Russia &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; been provoked. At some point we all decided that Russia's nukes no longer made it a superpower. We never asked Russia what they thought about that conclusion. What a show of power in the 2016 election. I have no doubt had Russia not interfered HRC would have won. It never occurred to me until today that we (ie President Biden) could have negotiated with him on that. Stand down and we'll do X for you. Sorry Ukraine, no to NATO but you get something even better, a US government that isn't owned by Putin. Sure Putin is a short, ugly, and by our standards a mean person. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Badenov&quot;&gt;Boris Badenov&lt;/a&gt; without the charm. But underneath that façade, he's actually been pretty patient.  " created="Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:49:50 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/08/24/borisBadenov.png"/>
				<outline text="How much better for Putin if he had waited until 2024. Didn't he see that the US is sliding down the path to electing a Putin lapdog in 2024. Why bother with Ukraine? He was about to land the big fish. I don't think Putin understood how scared of him we in the west are and how easily we could be united if we had even a slight chance to bring him down." created="Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:04:42 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I have been watching Fox. Their coverage of Ukraine is equal to or better than CNN or MSNBC. They are loving Ukraine. Makes me wonder if Fox was really a Putin property, or if they just gravitated toward stories that raised the ire of their audience. The Ukraine story of 2022 is like Gone With The Wind, but the sequel of the sequel, and without slaves. The story has Fox all over it. Remember they liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/10/14/slayer-pete-buttigieg-fox-news-orig.cnn-business&quot;&gt;Mayor Pete&lt;/a&gt; there. That was puzzling too. For a moment, Putin has brought us together in North America, maybe. We found something we agree on -- it's time for Putin to go. But remember on January 7, 2021 we had that unity too, but it didn't last long." created="Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:05:21 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/28/ukraineFlag.png"/>

				<outline text="I have to say I didn't give my paternal grandfather, &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Baruch%20Winer&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Baruch Winer&lt;/a&gt;, enough respect when I was young. He loved to talk, but didn't listen. He wore hearing aids. My mother, his daughter-in-law, was pretty sure he turned them off when we came to visit. Whenever we said anything he'd go &quot;What what did you say?&quot; So you'd say it again, at the top of your voice, and he still wouldn't hear. Repeat this a few times and remember your job is to listen. The things he said made no sense to me, a well-fed youngster in the America of the 1960s.  We listened. We tried. Every so often he'd use strange words like oligarch and plutocracy. He had the idea that my brother and father and I would join him in an uprising against the plutocracy. He'd say &quot;It's the plutocrracy, Daveed!&quot; in his thick Russian accent. These words were strange then, but it's funny how we use these words fairly regularly today. He had a vision of what was to come. One thing he said, loudly and clearly, I remember very well. &quot;David, some day the Nazis will come to America and this is what I want you to do.&quot; After a short pause he said the next part slowly. &quot;Get a gun. Go up on the roof -- and shoot them!&quot; My mother was horrified. He wasn't kidding. I wrote this off as the ramblings of an old and crazy man, out of touch with the world as it was then, in modern America where we flew coast to coast on 747s and listened to rock and roll, as he ranted in his row house in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canarsie,_Brooklyn&quot;&gt;Cararsie&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn about a long-gone world in the old country. Here's why I'm telling this story today. My grandfather and his family ran for their lives in World War II, from the Nazis. They were living in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Bucharest&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, Rumania at the time. Before that they came from Odessa, Ukraine. Now, here we are, decades later, and once again, the old man's vision was perfect. I don't see myself getting on a roof and shooting Nazis, when they come -- but when I listen to the Ukraine people, many of whom not surprisingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EnglishUkraine/status/1497986717470580744&quot;&gt;look like me&lt;/a&gt;, teachers, programmers, doctors, clerks, people from all walks of life, going up on the roofs of Kyiv and Odessa to shoot at Putin's soldiers who I guess are not all that different from Nazis.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&quot;&gt;Maddow&lt;/a&gt; did a special show last night on MSNBC and it was great. Obviously a little time off did her good, but so did a change of subject. Just as I, as a viewer, couldn't watch Maddow anymore after &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; of the same story -- 1. Trump investigated, 2. obviously guilty of great crimes. 2. Nothing comes of it. But this is a new story, and a continuation of the tragedy of Trump, and she was fantastic, putting it all in perspective, and offering one very valid theory of why Putin is moving now. There are others. I'm hearing them on Twitter and on Facebook, much more realistic than the garbage they say on CNN, where they repeat Putin's spin as fact all too often. I can't stand that shit. NPR does it too. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dan.conover.714/posts/10224858840872004&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a story my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danconover.com/&quot;&gt;Dan Conover&lt;/a&gt; just published on Facebook. He was an American soldier based near Czechoslavakia, I think it was probably in the 80s, not sure. Best thinking and writing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidfrum&quot;&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter is also fantastic, and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/energy-crisis-russia-gas/622884/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on The Atlantic (one of my monthly free articles, I am not a subscriber) was also fantastic. I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/02/the-old-habits-of-news-consumption-died-with-the-internet-whats-replacing-them/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niemanlab.org/author/jbenton/&quot;&gt;Josh Benton&lt;/a&gt; on Nieman late last night that said we get our news outside the control of the news orgs, and I think that's exactly right and good for us. If only they'd truly get on board with that idea, we might solve some of our problems which are in case you hadn't noticed are getting worse. Today's news involves a bit more navigation through paywalls and silos, but the ideas that get out these days are far more varied and informed than those we got in past crises when all we had were the NYT and the three networks. I lived through that period too.  " created="Fri, 25 Feb 2022 14:31:41 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2021/03/26/comradeStalin.png"/>

If I were them, I'd have someone drive the freaking phone to me from an Apple store in the area. That is, if this is an uncommon occurrence. If they depend on their customers doing work for them to get their product, I expect for most people that will be a bridge too far. For me it is. When I buy a luxury item, and that's what this is, I want to be treated with basic respect. And I want to use the freaking product, not argue with Apple about who has to do what. They have to do it, I'm the customer. I paid for this experience. Geez Louise. " created="Sun, 13 Feb 2022 14:29:22 GMT"/>

They're saying it once again &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/todaystatus.png&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;. I signed up to receive updates on delivery events and in the first email they sent the full log of UPS actions with the second phone Apple shipped after UPS apparently lost the first phone. This log starts on Feb 4. I ordered the phone on Jan 27. The log is so long that i had to take two screen shots: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/part1.png&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/12/part2.png&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple Support, after requesting I send them a DM on Twitter, hasn't responded after ~36 hours. $1300 plus tax, paid on 1/27, 16 days ago. We had two storms in this period, and one 2-day power outage, to be fair to Apple and UPS, but -- if they had delivered it in a timely fashion all that would have happened while I had my iPhone. They also mysteriously changed my credit card in their system and then tried to charge $1 to the account and it failed, holding the delivery up by 24 hours, and requiring me to spend an hour on the phone with an Apple person before even considering the possibility that they had the wrong number. To anyone who trusts Apple to store their data, this is something to be concerned about. Also I understand this happens frequently to customers. Maybe Apple is short-staffed, there is a labor shortage in the US. And stealing products while they are in shipment is a big problem, getting bigger all the time.

It has happened over and over. An unmistakeable pattern. Every time I heard about it, I was really puzzled. Some of the people were software developers who should understand that when you get someone's source code you're getting a very small thing, relative to understanding all the decisions that went into it. If you take over the project you don't know any of that. And when it has happened, for example at UserLand, I knew there was trouble when one of the developers complained that there was too much code to figure out how it worked. He couldn't understand why there was so much of it! This was a guy who had shipped real products. Why would he be surprised by this? Doesn't he understand that it takes a lot of code to create something simple and consistent, so the human mind can deal with it. I have thought about his comment for years. And why didn't he call and ask me to walk him through it. I was alive, I would have taken his call and I would have helped because it would have been an example of that elusive &quot;working together&quot; thing that I've been searching for.

It was way too early to bet on any one model. Again I don't think they had any idea what I do and how you make the tech work. Adam did understand the basic idea.

Pretty disturbing considering Apple is a &lt;i&gt;computer&lt;/i&gt; company. So that delayed them sending the replacement for the lost or stolen phone.

He projected an avatar, but of course living up to the image he projected was impossible. As with the Beatles, how much better it would have been (imho or so it seems) if they could have been creative for decades and just been themselves. There's this great scene in Get Back where Paul and John are stressing out, and John lowers his glasses and says to Paul &quot;It's just me.&quot; What if every album didn't have to be the best one ever made. Relistening to the Beatles classics, the Beatles had a sound, and none of the ex-Beatles took it with them when they broke up. I've come to absolutely adore songs that just passed me by when I was young, and had no sense of art compared to now. I can't believe how good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Jm5epJr10&quot;&gt;I Am The Walrus&lt;/a&gt; is. I laugh every time at all different parts because it is so Beatles and they create so much beauty. BTW much of John's sound came from George Martin, as he interpreted what John wanted (I got that from watching a long interview with Martin). The Beatles were a thing. It's unfortunate it had to consume the people of the Beatles, or they didn't understand what they had created. George Harrison desperately wanted to get out from under the Beatles, but imho, the Beatles made George Harrison. BTW creative life is exactly the same today was it was then. We don't nurture creative people, create safe environments for them to develop over full lives. And there's little that glues us together. Too much focus on being a hero, inflating the avatar, which ultimately kills the creativity.

Oh how the mighty have fallen. " created="Thu, 03 Feb 2022 13:35:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I remain an Apple shareholder. I hope they can fix this. It really needs to be redone from top to bottom. If they can't handle a $1300 sale for a phone and get it delivered without incident in seven days then they should shut down everything until they can do it. Start over. Fire everyone. It's just not worth continuing if this is how you're going to do business. " created="Thu, 03 Feb 2022 13:49:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Update: Apple had tried to charge &quot;my&quot; credit card $1 and it was declined. I don't understand why they were doing that, they had already charged me $1300 plus tax, but they did. Turns out it wasn't my credit card, somehow my card number was replaced with someone else's. In all saga of incompetence and bad design, turns out their database doesn't work. Or it was hacked? For a computer company that operates a huge cloud for its customers, this is shocking. So here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/03/status.png&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the current status of my purchase. Can you tell when they think the computer will arrive, I sure can't. " created="Thu, 03 Feb 2022 19:17:11 GMT"/>

Journalists are rarely around when the new technologies are formed. By the time they are in the loop there's the cynicism of VCs, and journalism brings its own cynicism. They listen to the money and dismiss the individual. They assume the individual never survives an onslaught from huge companies. But there are times when the money doesn't win.
