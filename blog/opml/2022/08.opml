My two cents. OK with me. But tune up your pricing so it lets your product grow like a weed. The tragedy of Heroku, which I was building my software base on, is that they made the product diseconomic for its natural niche -- quick scripts that need to run on the net 24-by-7 but are very low bandwidth. I run dozens of those. It makes no sense to pay $7 a month to run each of them when they can all run together on a $5 a month server at Digital Ocean. It took me years to reimplement Heroku but I did. The shame of it is that lots of other people did it too. One of the responsibilities of a company that makes a product as useful as Heroku is to not get too much in the way of its destiny.

				<outline text="President Biden gave a speech about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1563225299378003968&quot;&gt;Maga Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. Interesting idea. It'll work if you start to hear pundits use the term. Intuitively -- I think the truth is there are no Maga Repubs. If anyone has voted with the Republican Party through the 2020 election, and there were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election&quot;&gt;74 million&lt;/a&gt; of them, they are not separable. Muddying this up doesn't seem to serve any purpose other than calming Biden's supposed friendship with remaining fence-sitters such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-national-abortion-ban-possible-roe-v-wade_n_62772e80e4b0b7c8f0851155&quot;&gt;Moscow Mitch&lt;/a&gt;. That's really who the term seems to be a gift to. Through the ongoing Trump crime spree, he's still campaigning for the Republican candidates. The other term I don't like is &quot;semi-fascist.&quot; Another dream -- somehow there are two kinds of fascists, ones who are on the way to being fascists and the real fascists. Again anyone who voted for Trump in 2020 qualifies as 100 percent American grown Nazi Party fascists, imho -- that is. :smile:" created="Sat, 27 Aug 2022 15:22:08 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png"/>

I heard that the DoJ had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/barr-mueller-report/index.html&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the heavily redacted memo by former &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr&quot;&gt;Attorney General Barr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22187584-barr-unredacted-memo&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/n5SRHdcPLAI&quot;&gt;basically said&lt;/a&gt; that the Mueller Report (that we hadn't at the time seen) was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nothingburger&quot;&gt;Nothingburger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/barr-mueller-report/index.html&quot;&gt;without the redactions&lt;/a&gt;. So I expected there would be something interesting on MSNBC. The show opens with an in-detail horse race story that said basically we fucked up and it wasn't a foregone conclusion that the Repubs would take Congress in the upcoming midterm election as we have been reporting since just after the 2020 election. Right. This is now horserace journalism of a higher order, the horserace we're judging is how well Hayes et al were doing at predicting the outcome of the election, which btw, is a theoretical thing because (pause here) THE FUCKING ELECTION STILL HASN'T HAPPENED. Sorry for screaming, but this is such a waste, and how could anyone possibly care about this. Every time they report &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom&quot;&gt;conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, they have driven far off course, they are no longer doing news, they are doing self-butthole examination. What a waste. And it's kind of obvious (imho) that Hayes has been going to the Tucker Carlson School School of Acting. He's trying to talk like him. It's really sad. Maybe MSNBC could just hire Carlson to work for them. After all if the Mets can buy players from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor&quot;&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer&quot;&gt;Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;, why can't MNBC buy an actor from Fox News to play for them.

				<outline text="Most of my immediate ancestors, the ones I knew, had strong opinions. They're all dead now. Their opinions don't matter. So if the opinions mean nothing now, what did they mean when they were alive? I would say they meant nothing then too. And if it applied to them it must certainly apply to me. I find it relaxing to know I don't have to figure everything out, because it doesn't matter what I think. It just doesn't matter. Now innovation might matter, but most of it goes unrecognized. My uncle for example, invented a windmill that didn't need to be repositioned to catch the wind. If the wind was blowing it would capture the energy. Earlier this evening I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/1560757203870547970&quot;&gt;saw&lt;/a&gt; it had been invented again, because no one heard about my uncle's invention, except for people who loved him. Even so, I think that matters, because his ideas led to more ideas. That's very different from opinions. Ken thought all kinds of things that, to me, were bullshit. He could have saved the energy, because it didn't end up meaning anything. Also how well did they communicate their ideas? My maternal grandfather, Rudy Kiesler, Ken's father, actually got a mention in the Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for my great uncle, his brother-in-law. They said he was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/08/21/rudyKieslerCommunistQuote.png&quot;&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;! I spent a lot of time with him growing up and in million years I'd never have thought he was a communist. He was a voracious capitalist, but then -- he always seemed to support liberal causes. And he was a Mets fan. So maybe there was some truth to it? He definitely had strong opinions, that man, but he must not have communicated them effectively, or maybe he was hiding this from his grandhildren? Hmm.

But it's now a destination. It felt like a foreign country. What a thing to return to where you grew up, to experience it as a white American man would in a foreign country, Hong Kong or Seoul. What was odd though, was when the locals talked the young ones talked like me. Makes sense, but strange.

Turns out it was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbanklocations.com/reliance-federal-savings-bank-29210.shtml&quot;&gt;Reliance Federal Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, where I, as a 5th-grade boy had my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passbook&quot;&gt;bankbook&lt;/a&gt;, a hand-written thing, maintained by someone behind a counter who carefully stamped the date, and wrote the amount and balance in the account for every transaction. I don't remember what I was saving for, possibly a new baseball bat or glove, or later sound equipment. And of course all that remains of that little person, the former future Dave, are little vague bits of memory. How unlikely all this was I imagine that boy would think.

Engelbart thought augmenting human intellect was his real life's work. I know because 1. he told me and 2. same with me. Augmenting human intellect sounds spacy, something only a genius could understand, which is why it's not a good term for something that's pretty simple. Using an outliner to take notes and manage a project is an example of the computer augmenting your intellect. Doing something for you that you are not as good at as a computer is. Using a spreadsheet to augment human intellect could mean doing what-if analysis on a projected balance sheet. Sharing a recipe on Facebook with a group of friends is another example. Remember, Engelbart was talking about this long before there were computers outside of research labs. What seems kind of obvious today was anything but obvious then.

It's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/29-31+170th+St,+Queens,+NY+11358/Utopia+Bagels,+Utopia+Parkway,+Queens,+NY/@40.7747863,-73.7984347,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7949205!2d40.7696434!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a61da3d0acd:0xe857931aa5334a2a!2m2!1d-73.7937332!2d40.7802255!3e1&quot;&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; I grew up in. The people behind the counter looked nothing like the people I grew up with, coming from the current working population of Queens, one of the most diverse places in the world. The night before I had gone to see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlb.com/news/edwin-diaz-gets-6-out-save-as-mets-beat-braves&quot;&gt;Mets beat the Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;. This year's Mets are unusually competent. Anyway there was a man there, in the crowded bagel store, probably in his early 80s, wearing a rent-a-cop uniform. I thought he was one of the few people remaining from my time there. He looked like a drinker and smoker. He could have been one of my childhood friends' fathers. He picked me out and asked if I knew what he thought. I said nothing. He said &quot;America matters, that's all.&quot; I mumbled quietly well we can agree to disagree. After that I avoided him, looked around, he and I were among the oldest people there. This, I thought, is the new Queens, we are part of the old (and I am long-gone, just back for the Mets game and the bagels). On the way out, on an impulse, I tapped his shoulder and said in a voice that I was sure he could hear, but not too loudly -- Black lives matter.

				<outline text="I think Twitter, with Musk largely history, can become a stronger company than they've ever been. The way forward imho is to focus on the platform, so lots of apps can be made to run on it, not just one way to use its capabilities. Lots of user experiences. That's something none of the other social media platforms have let happen. Amazingly in 2022, while there are standards for images, movies -- everything but simple documents, with titles, unlimited length, simple styling, links and enclosures. That's where I'd like to see Twitter be the leader. Be the world-scale distribution system for simple text documents.  Lead by filling the void. No standards bodies. PS: I bought a small amount of TWTR stock a few years back and continue to hold it.

				<outline text="The other day I read that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Scobleizer/status/1552379565603000322&quot;&gt;Scoble thinks&lt;/a&gt; Tesla's way of playing music from an iPhone is as good as CarPlay or Android Auto. At first I couldn't think why that was wrong, but I just went down to the car (a Model Y) to set it up to work with the new Pixel 6 Pro I got yesterday, and remembered. When you're playing music on a phone in a Tesla, you have to use the UI of the phone to control the music. With CarPlay it's integrated with the display of the car, and it's simplified to be like a car control. And it's easy to switch apps, again using the UI of the CarPlay software, integrated into the car. It's so dangerous to do the same with the Tesla system that &lt;i&gt;I never do it unless the car is stopped.&lt;/i&gt; The difference is integration. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/03/141929.html?title=teslasMissingAppEcosystem&quot;&gt;wrote about this&lt;/a&gt; when I was first transitioning from CarPlay to Telsa, and it's a serious problem for Tesla that they don't have an app &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_ecosystem&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, and unless they do a deal with Apple and Google, they probably aren't going to have one. It's no small thing to build one of those, they might have done it when they had the electric car business to themselves, but that's already past.
