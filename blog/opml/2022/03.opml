					<outline text="I drove as much as possible with the car self-driving such as it is. It's a lot of fun to see what it can and can't handle. There was one place where the Thruway narrowed to one lane, and it freaked out because it couldn't tell if it was driving off the road or what. So I took over. It's like having a teenage driver helping out, and you just have to be ready to take the wheel to get it through difficult situations.

					<outline text="It correctly merged onto the Thruway all on its own. A long curved on-ramp, its max MPH as I instructed it was 70, but it slowed to 30 to handle the curve on the ramp. The speed limit was 25 btw. As as passenger, basically, I was glad it slowed down a little. More time to appreciate how well it was doing.

					<outline text="One other thing -- instead of listening to my own music I let Amazon Music choose it for me. Very nice. I don't know how they know I like the bands they gave me to listen to. But they guessed very well.  Their best choice was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTPndsG_KA4&quot;&gt;Dead song&lt;/a&gt; I hadn't heard in a long time but had special meaning to me.

Finally we could stop obsessing over Nixon. He was obviously guilty right from the outset. Yet it took what seemed an incredibly long time to get from the initial reports of the break-in to his waving goodbye from the White House lawn as he left for the last time. That was the way I wanted to remember Nixon. Humiliated, brought down, going &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0&quot;&gt;off to exile&lt;/a&gt; to spend the rest of his days wondering what if he hadn't cheated.

I guess Trump, who is also old enough to remember it (he's ten years older than me) wasn't too concerned about paying a price if his attempted coup didn't work.

					<outline text="First, my goal for the web has always been that I want the bright minds to be on the web, sharing important stuff that comes from what they do. These people would be considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; in journalism, not reporters.

We need more of that. Journalism has stood in the way of good uses of the web. Maybe they don't know they've been doing it, but they have been doing it just the same.

It was time to pull together the code I use to parse feeds these days in JavaScript apps and publish it as open source. It builds on Dan MacTough's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; package, so it inherits its support of different feed formats: &quot;RSS&quot;, Atom and RDF. The result is what developers want in 2022. A simple JavaScript object containing the information in a feed and nothing more. One system call to parse it. Works like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse&quot;&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/a&gt;. From there, a simple feed reader could be built.

				<outline text="At one point in the ride I was shuffling podcasts and thinking this is too dangerous and then I remembered I'm driving a car that theoretically can drive itself. So I clicked the right stick down twice to activate the driving functionality and took my hands off the steering wheel. I talked to the car as if it were a 17-year-old learning to drive, giving it encouragement and preparing to take over when it started to drive off the road. Something weird happened, it started flashing red, and then really started flashing red, which I interpreted as &quot;I can't handle this, you take over, Mr Human.&quot; Which I did. But I was driving on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_209&quot;&gt;US 209&lt;/a&gt;, basically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9641439,-74.0222502,3a,75y,200.84h,80.17t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DBdPeWXXAcL1ImkR6rqNM-g%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D284.48877%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;, two lanes in each direction, divided, lots of room everywhere, good weather, well marked lanes.

				<outline text="I listened to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://radioopensource.org/a-new-nuclear-age/&quot;&gt;latest Open Source podcast&lt;/a&gt;. You must listen to this one. It's about the new reality of nuclear war. Chris Lydon talks to all the most interesting academics, and it's clear they really like and respect him. If you watch MSNBC, skip Rachel Maddow one night every week and listen to Chris and his guests. I think they should put him on TV with exactly the same guests as he has now, and let him cover exactly what he covers. It's much higher quality than anything you get from any other source.

				<outline text="So I was thinking about a lot of things. Like how I have really good friends for a long time who have never used an outliner, and somehow must think they understand me at some level, when they just can't. Imagine for example you had a friend who was a guitar player. Not the most famous or best ever, but still someone who had devoted their life to creating music with guitars. And then imagine not only had you not listened to your friend playing the guitar, but you hadn't listened to &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; play a guitar. You didn't know what a guitar was. You sent them a link to a story about someone humming while driving and asked if it was like that. That's been my experience. I live with it. But I've never liked it. My software actually isn't hard to learn, at least not compared to other software like Twitter, Facebook, a word processor, an ATM. It's a low-grade source of frustration. Most days I write stuff on this blog and hear back nothing. But it seems some people read it. I just write for myself. I think I'm going to go back to doing that with software too. 2021 was an exceptional year, I decided to devote the whole year to creating a real end-user piece of software -- &quot;Drummer&quot;. I never hear anything nice about it. Mostly from people who refuse to read the docs complaining that they don't know how to do something that's covered in the docs. This isn't what I had in mind when I spent all of last year building the product and writing excellent docs. " created="Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:25:05 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Another example. I probably spent in total a whole month doing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2022/01/23/153755.html?title=howToUseTreechartFromDrummer&quot;&gt;Tree Chart&lt;/a&gt; app. Two comments. One saying they wanted more features, and another from a semi-famous person who said he missed MORE, so I pointed him to Drummer. He complained that the tree chart part of Drummer wasn't as good as MORE's and that's it. Nothing beyond that. I wonder if people know how much effort it takes to create something like this (obviously they don't) or are willing to invest anything at all in helping? Obviously not that either. So I think the only way to go is to create software for a market of one -- me -- and leave it at that. Maybe I'll share some of it, maybe I won't. It's a lot of extra work to share it, and from my point of view, the work is an utter waste of time. Basically most people are selfish assholes. I think the Beatles felt this way about their fans too. I've been learning so much about them this year. But at least we all listened to their music, even if we had no idea who they were, and how they created the music. " created="Tue, 15 Mar 2022 15:30:54 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="A few months ago I read a comment on Twitter, not directed to me but with my name tagged, that said that RSS will be able to move again once Dave Winer is dead. Isn't that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puwoUKhZQbg&quot;&gt;special&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure that's not true btw, but to be thought of as only contributing obstruction. I think it's like that in a lot of things I've worked on. People have tried to buy my products away from me, not realizing I still owned them. That was comedy. Other people, supposed friends, told me they were taking over, I should get out of their way or I'd get hurt. The first couple of times that happened, from someone who was very rich, I fell for it. It wasn't true. His products were flops because he had no idea what people valued in the products. I did because I had connections with the users and I listened, systematically. At LVT we got very good at listening, we knew in advance that new releases would be loved because were simply giving the users what they wanted. Once another rich guy offered me $1 million for my company or he was going to blow me out of the water (his words). Yeah I said, i've heard that before. Go right ahead. He never shipped anything even remotely competitive. BTW, our product was making more than $1 million &lt;i&gt;a month&lt;/i&gt; at the time. He didn't even bother to get the numbers. All this says to me is that &lt;i&gt;we should fucking work together dammit. &lt;/i&gt;Look at the Beatles and how individually they reached out to other musicians and recorded with them. Why don't we do that in software. If there's going to be more RSS, why shouldn't it benefit from what I've learned? You might be surprised to find that a new RSS can't happen &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; I am involved, Mr Waiting For Me To Die. Why take the chance? I didn't save the tweet because I didn't want to ever close that loop. Imagine how that felt. The world is full of self-important assholes, and we've given every one of them tools to express their assholyness. You can quote me on that.

It's even more clear that the Beatles didn't &quot;break up&quot; as much as they stayed together for a long time. You get the sense of how exhausted they must've been of being a Beatle. This goes back to something I've learned myself in a career that included more than the normal amount of public presence. We all are just individual people, no matter how big the rep. It doesn't get much bigger than being a Beatle. But it doesn't really have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/08/whatIsIntegrity.html#3&quot;&gt;integrity&lt;/a&gt; to be a Beatle, because a human can't be that big.

McCartney at one point says we're just a small band, we do rock and roll and the blues. So why were they doing movies and having boutiques and planning big concerts where the fans were kept far away. I wish, as a fan, they had found a way to continue doing what they did so well, and branch out and do all the other stuff they wanted to do as individuals.

				<outline text="I think if I were designing an RSS reader app now, I would first do a reader that only worked with content written in my own blogging tool. That way I could really drill in there, sharpen the edges, create an ideal user experience for both writers and readers. I would not try to support everything that's out there. Anyway, once that was working well, I'd try to add feeds with the help of people who write on other sites, and hopefully they can tweak up their feeds so they work really well in my reader. Ideally I'd have good communication with the devs who work on their blogging software. But writers and readers drive the process, ideally ones with experience with user testing software. All the while I'd publish my notes so other designers could emulate them. See, the thing is: RSS is supposed to be a standard, but in the early days there was a free-for-all wild west mentality that meant no one worked with anyone else because they were all hell-bent on world domination. The idea was I don't need you because I own this shit. Well you can't all own it. That made a mess of things. &lt;i&gt;Now it's almost 20 years later,&lt;/i&gt; and it should be obvious that hurrying up isn't the answer. We can create another mess, or we can slowly rebuild and create a strong, well-understood standard, and forget about world domination, let's just make a nice reading and writing environment. Software is an art, not just a way to get rich. That would be what I would focus on. I have a motto &quot;Slow down to hurry up.&quot; Think about the 15 wasted years in RSS-land, and you'll see what I mean.

I think there's a chance we'll see a return to the more thoughtful blogosphere of the late 90s and early 00s, and I think Substack is part of it. I also would love to know, without having to dig through the app, if they've extended RSS, added a new namespace with Substack-specific data, or if it's straight RSS with common namespace extensions. Also it looks like their reader requires items to have titles. Is that so? I've been playing around with some new reader ideas, no claim that anything will ship, but one thing we have to accommodate is title-less posts, otherwise we're going to end up right back where we are now with a division -- the quick stuff on Twitter, and only long stuff in RSS. That was a divide forced on us by the now long-defunct Google Reader. Also factor in the idea that Twitter might be about to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/02/21/224554.html?title=twitterArticles&quot;&gt;longer titled posts&lt;/a&gt; to their ecosystem.

I'd like to propose an alternate theory. Once Zelenskyy is gone, Putin will give a speech saying that the Nazis did it. He will have a black ribbon on his lapel, the standard thing people will wear to mourn the death of Zelenskyy. He will say Russia entered Ukraine to &lt;i&gt;protect&lt;/i&gt; Zelenskyy, not to kill him. They will round up some Ukrainian &quot;Nazis&quot; and kill them. The Russian army, their job done, will return home, leaving Uktraine to be run by a Putin puppet. I think this is much more likely than Putin repeating his mistake of invading Ukraine, or at least wait until a Putinite is in power in the US, and they've had a chance to withdraw from NATO, rendering it powerless,. Then all of Europe will recalculate and accept Russia as Stalin 2.0, and try to coexist, without the protection of the American nuclear shield.

				<outline text="So if you listen to Putin he doesn't want the countries touching his border to be aligned with the US. At first you think okay I can understand that. But why should he care. We had Cuba 90 miles away from Florida for decades, they were a client of the USSR, and were spreading revolution all through Latin America, which according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine&quot;&gt;Monroe Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; was our sphere of influence. We didn't like it, and we did try to invade Cuba, but in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion&quot;&gt;small way&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn't work and that was the end of that. So why does Putin care if Ukraine becomes part of NATO. So what if they don't like Russia. Russia isn't going to get invaded the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia&quot;&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa&quot;&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; did. Why would they bother dealing with all the mud and the ferocious Russian soldiers. Why not just hurl a few nukes at them. I think we all know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340&quot;&gt;World War III&lt;/a&gt; will be fought with nukes. So what's the point in Putin owning Ukraine? Why not just launch some nukes at us. That's where this is headed, right? I'd love to see someone sit down with Putin, like a therapist, and work this out with him. What would his dream outcome be? What would make him feel like he won? This is all so confusing.

					<outline text="I've figured out something about evolution and how it relates to software, and I think it's time to try to write it up. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:40:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It goes back to a puzzling statement made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson&quot;&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt; in his Cosmos series. He said that human eyes evolved when our ancestors were fish and thus are designed to see under water, and don't work nearly as well in the air. You might think that evolution would fix that, but it doesn't work that way. Evolution never goes back. Evolution never fixes a mistake. We just muddle through somehow with what we have. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:40:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I'm not a biologist so I can only guess why it works that way, maybe someone reading this is more savvy and will correct me. Basically evolution can't revise the design of our eyes because to do so would require a mutation that has no eyes, so it could re-evolve eyes the way the first fishes did. But that eye-less animal, which no doubt has existed, would have to have a survival advantage over humans with eyes, even the flawed ones we have, but such a creature would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have a survival advantage. So we're stuck with our inferior fish-evolved eyes. I think that explains why evolution can't fix past mistakes. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:44:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then I came across something I posted on Facebook a few years ago, imagining that a programmer from the 80s had time-traveled to the 2020s and wondered why we used such crappy writing tools, when in the 80s we had a remarkable variety of excellent writing tools. In evolution terms here's my theory of what happened, and I admit I'm vastly simplifying this, I know a lot more about it because I lived through it, and made software in this period, and until recently was puzzled why some ideas took off and other good ideas did not. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:45:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the early 90s a technological asteriod hit the software world called the web and wiped out all the GUI apps. To access the new network (the asteroid) all you needed was a web browser. And that was all that survived from the desktop operating systems of the 80s. The server operating system, Unix, came to dominate because it had the networking that the new world evolved from. The creatures from the network survived, the ones that lived on GUIs did not. To the animals that lived in UnixWorld, the web looked pretty amazing. But they liked their editors, and didn't see the need for anything more. Further, the desktop writing tools couldn't do the things a Unix programmer needed to do. So they just kept using the ones that came with Unix, Emacs and the like." created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 14:08:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Evolution could have taken a different path in regards to eyes and writing tools. If the first life evolved on land, our eyes would see much better in air. If the Macintosh developed open and easy networking as Unix had, making the switch to the web unnecessary, ad we could have kept using all our wizzy writing tools. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:53:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Looking back, it seems obvious now why some of my ideas caught on and others didn't. For example, the idea of editing a website in a browser, something I called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, an idea that evolved into blogging, then Twitter and Facebook and all the other stuff we edit in browsers or browser-like environments (iOS and Android). That thread had a long life. But editing a blog in a word processor or outliner, for example PageMill or FrontPage, desktop apps which everyone thought would be used, didn't go anywhere. They weren't of the web, so it wasn't continuous with the Unix philosophy, they were part of the species that were wiped out by the asteroid, even though they came about after the asteroid hit. The ecosystem they depended on was no longer viable. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:55:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Similarly, much more powerful programming and runtime environments were possible, but didn't catch on like Python and JavaScript et al, again because they weren't of-Unix. Even if they borrowed big ideas from Unix but were still tied into the GUI philosophy, that made them unusual, not on the mainline of evolution. " created="Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:59:13 GMT"/>

It's too complicated, so many characters, and they keep adding new ones, there's too much to remember, and I never got caught up with the story before the last episode was over. They're making different kinds of shows now, and the one episode per week style of distribution often doesn't work. For a show like Rick &amp; Morty, fine. I don't even know if there's any continuity between episodes. The characters talk about the season, the fourth wall is often permeable in that show, but I don't care. The shows stand alone too. Some series, like the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Counterpart&lt;/a&gt; are completely unwatchable except by watching one season immediately after the other.

Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury&quot;&gt;Freddie Mercury&lt;/a&gt; perform &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0omja1ivpx0&quot;&gt;Radio Ga-Ga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbvyNnw8Qjg&quot;&gt;Bohemian Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid&quot;&gt;Live Aid&lt;/a&gt;, you can see that it is possible to live a greater than a human-size life. Here I am watching this event that took place 37 years ago, electrified, emotionally touched, and FM is long-gone. So it is also possible to achieve some amount of immortality. Mercury has the experience that few of us get to have -- he can make love with many thousands of people at once, over decades.

				<outline text="The thing that's so cool is how much the fans love Freddie Mercury. That's because, unlike a lot of musical performers and other kinds of leaders, he knows they're there and includes them in the performance. If you want to be a big hit and have your fans love you, you have to do that. Let them in on the fun. " created="Wed, 02 Mar 2022 20:15:08 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/general.opml#1629044069000&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/a&gt; in Drummer are pretty spectacular. Makes you wonder what some products would be like if the devs really focused on Bookmarks. A product that desperately needs bookmarks is Amazon S3. Count the number of steps it takes to get to a folder you need to get to all the time. A simple bookmark facility could reduce that to one step. Amazon if you'd like help with the design, I've learned a lot about it. My rates are reasonable. :smile:" created="Tue, 01 Mar 2022 17:27:55 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/23/blackLab.png"/>
