				<outline text="One of many things that's great about the pairing of the Celtics and Warriors in the NBA Finals is that they're not the Lakers and the Nets. Both teams grew their own talent, formed teams in an artful way and patiently developed  their players until they found the right formula and nurtured it along. I also like that they have welcomed back Al Horford and Andre Iguodala, two heros of previous Celtics and Warriors campaigns. Not only is this a good way to build a winning team, but it also feels right to the fans. I don't want my teams' geography and legacy used, as if it were an airline, meant to take a couple of superstars somewhere, to host them -- but I see, all fans really -- a family, with generations coming and going, and a continuity all the way back to the beginning. I esp like that the Celtics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/hunterfelt/2022/04/21/why-boston-celtics-fans-will-never-forgive-kyrie-irving/&quot;&gt;shook off&lt;/a&gt; one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger&quot;&gt;carpetbaggers&lt;/a&gt; on their way to the Finals.

The result was High Files, which also had a simple tabular database. Outlines could be cells in a database table, and tables could be contained within outlines. When I had that running, I moved from Madison to Mountain View, and did a deal with Personal Software for the outliner. It was hard to fit that app into 64K on an Apple II, but eventually we did, by then they had a big hit in VisiCalc, and they gave me back the product, and a settlement, and I spent the next few years doing online bulletin-board software. I was totally fascinated with using computer as networking tools. " created="Fri, 27 May 2022 13:31:54 GMT"/>

I can never understand why developers who have worked on the language itself aren't as bothered by this as I am. I realized there might be one difference, something that's been a foundation for all my programming work -- before I was a programmer, I was a math major. In math, you're always looking for broader and simpler statements that you can derive from more narrower and more complicated truths. In a sense that's what math is. So perhaps the language designers of JavaScript didn't study math? This has been a vexing puzzle for me ever since I moved into JavaScript.

Unless you understand how the human mind works, how can you market something to humans? It's like becoming a driver, you have to learn what all the controls do. And how products fit into people's minds is one of the biggest controls, and you'd be surprised how not-different people's minds are when it comes to positioning. An example. An ad I saw on Facebook recently for &lt;a href=&quot;https://freshcleantees.com/&quot;&gt;T-shirts&lt;/a&gt; of all things. How many brands of T-shirts can you think of? Probably not too many, but you know there are a lot of them. None have any particular meaning. But what about a T-shirt that Looks Good On You? That's a position. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgl-LFrlPw&amp;t=228s&quot;&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; that no one, so far, is positioned on. Maybe the ladder doesn't exist? Positioning has lots of examples of those. But sometimes it does, and it's huge. Think of all the brands that defined new ladders. Like Starbucks. Tesla. Nike. Coca Cola. There was coffee before Starbucks and cars, shoes and cold drinks before these brands carved out new segments of these markets and because they were first in the prospects' minds, they own them, until they throw away their positioning, which many products do, foolishly, through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_line_extension&quot;&gt;line extension&lt;/a&gt;. Heinz is a company that does not understand positioning and is as a result destroying their #1 brand. Think about Heinz. What does the name mean to you? Ketchup, right? Then, recently they decided there are lots of &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; ketchups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heinz.com/products/0000000117&quot;&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; at all of them! And they named them all Heinz. Oy. I bet when you add the sales of all the different Heinz ketchups, it's less than standard good old Heinz ketchup. Go to the grocery store, look for ketchup and try to find the Heinz ketchup you grew up with. Good luck!  Line extension is a bad idea. If you own the top spot on a ladder, don't do line extension.

So all I was risking was a little time. " created="Wed, 18 May 2022 13:23:23 GMT"/>

						<outline text="I had to download their app just to turn it on, and then I had to create an account on their service. I also had to check off their agreement, which of course I didn't read.

						<outline text="Okay now finally, I say &quot;Alexa WNYC,&quot; our local NPR station. Nothing happens. Then the speaker upstairs starts playing WNYC. I yell ALEXA STOP upstairs. No good. So I go upstairs and tell it again to stop, and again it doesn't. So I pull the plug. Then I hear the Alexa in the bedroom is doing the same thing. I go in there and pull the plug. Go back downstairs. The Bose speaker is doing nothing. Okay I take a deep breath and try it again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Exactly the same thing happens. So I go upstairs again, pull the plugs on the speakers, this time, leave them unplugged, go back downstairs and try again. &quot;Alexa WNYC.&quot; Nothing. I figure I'll try it again later." created="Wed, 18 May 2022 13:13:37 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I'm not done with the flaws of the product, but I want to pause here for a moment. I'm accustomed to setting up Alexas by plugging them in, waiting a few seconds while it boots up, then it looks around and somehow finds one of the other Alexas and asks if it's okay if it uses the data on it to configure this one. I always smile at this point, man that's good design, and I say YES of course, and in a few seconds I'm listening to NPR. The process involves no work beyond plugging it in and giving my consent. I imagine it needs to download updated system software, but wisely waits until late at night to do it. Why make the human wait while the robot does its housekeeping?" created="Wed, 18 May 2022 13:16:19 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Okay the next day I figure enough with Alexa, let's see how this is as a speaker. So I press the Bluetooth button on top of the speaker, and I connect my iPhone in the normal way for Bluetooth. Then I play an old McCartney song. It sounds like any of the other speakers I have. I hit pause and start playing another song, and it never plays. I hit pause and play again, and it plays for a few seconds then freezes. I repeat the pause-play thing again and again, that's it -- it never plays another bit of music. " created="Wed, 18 May 2022 13:18:24 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Conclusion: This is a piece of shit product. Maybe the Alexa problems are really Amazon problems, but if so, I can't believe they shipped the thing in this condition. But Bluetooth is mature technology. I've never had a problem with Bluetooth on any of the other speakers. " created="Wed, 18 May 2022 13:20:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And there's no way this product is worth $400.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Lorenz&quot;&gt;Taylor Lorenz&lt;/a&gt; gets a lot of shit, what else is new, that's what happens when you speak from a terrific pulpit, as she does -- she's a Washington Post columnist, before that was a reporter for the NY Times. If you go back far enough she was a blogger on Tumblr, so we feel pride, a local girl did good. And she adds a bit of open web, user-centric thought to everything. As a software developer, I see things the same way. I don't care how much money Zuck or Bezos or Musk have, like most journalists seem to, I care how empowered the users are, because that's how we will solve the problems of our world, by smart people who see things from important perspectives, who say what they see. Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://wapo.st/3sBrFLS&quot;&gt;recent piece&lt;/a&gt; in the WP is about a group of startups who want the big silos to make it easier for their users to migrate to other platforms. This is a hard problem both economically and technically, and I'm not sure the startups are sincere, it could be they only want the publicity. There are no details &lt;a href=&quot;https://myfriendsmydata.org/&quot;&gt;on the website&lt;/a&gt;, and a project like this is all about the details. Also VC-backed startups are the last devs I expect to go this route and I don't imagine if one of them is successful that they're going to rush to share their user lists with the others. The only way something like this can work is if they share a membership system from the start. And if they do that, and want credibility, there should be some non-VC open source devs in their group. One more thing, why not just use Twitter's identity system. It's got a great API, scales really well, and other devs (such as me) are using it that way. Instead of building my own identity system, I just use theirs. I have no interest in controlling my users, so it's a no-brainer. Sure the day could come when Twitter shuts off the API, but I could also get hit by a car riding my bike on a country road, or any number of other calamities." created="Sat, 14 May 2022 17:52:10 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2012/04/12/web.gif"/>

Much later, in 2015, I ported the World Outline software from Frontier running as a server, to Node.js, but I left the site private, probably because I wasn't planning to build in this direction, I just wanted to get some sites that were running in Frontier to work in Node. This morning some of my work led me to this software, and I saw that it was private, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/worldOutline&quot;&gt;made it public&lt;/a&gt;. Basically the &lt;i&gt;wo&lt;/i&gt; is like the &lt;i&gt;www&lt;/i&gt; except with outlines instead of HTML. You can of course render the outlines as HTML, and that's what the WO software does. Given all the interest in outliners these days, it seemed like a good time to open this stuff up. However at this point I don't plan to run the server software here.

I think that's the challenge of our generation and all subsequent generations. We're not dealing with climate change, for example. We're losing our minds as a country in other ways, for example the decision the Supreme Court is contemplating. You know it's not going to work, it'll be as big a disaster as climate change, but we'll feel it right away. We can't connect enough so that the people who we've supposedly trusted for being wise to avoid jumping unnecessarily, with no possible gain, into an abyss that will certainly lead to war. It's that big a deal. At age 67, I don't have the same goals I had at 22. I'm not trying to set the world on fire, I'm trying nudge people into working with each other, even today's 22 year-olds.

There's a basic bug in the American myth of self-reliance, the bug is this -- it's a lie. Humanity is like an ant colony. Our lives follow a rigid template that's &lt;s&gt;hard&lt;/s&gt; impossible to break out of. Unless you're a hermit, you pay taxes, get the same medicine as everyone else, celebrate the same holidays (even non-Christians in the US observe Christmas in some fashion). You are only unique in your mind, but even there, where you are free to be different, there's a lot of conformity. We rely on each other, there is no such thing as a pioneer on the open range, fending for himself. Richardson doesn't say any of those things, at least not in the beginning of the book, instead she describes the American myth. And as I'm reading it, I recognize it as the argument between the people and the oligarchs that's still raging. We think of it as North vs South but that's all part of the puppetry. We're being manipulated into blaming each other for nothing, distracting us from what we could be if we didn't pander to the oligarchs.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1521805736124325889&quot;&gt;My response&lt;/a&gt; -- I do leave big code comments, and it's not painful because I use an outliner, and do it carefully and consistently. There's a big comment the top of each major routine, it’s like a blog, with reverse chronologic notes about each major change. At the end of the list in the first comment is an explanation of what it does, params, etc. And since it’s in an outliner, it’s all collapsed until you need to read it." created="Wed, 04 May 2022 13:38:14 GMT"/>

Their political system was undermined by Putinites, proclaiming their right to speak, but they were undermining their democracy like the Putinites here are today. They solved the problem by being hardcore about it. Free speech is not more important than survival of democracy. We will have to make that choice too, until we do, we'll be stuck where we are.

					<outline text="The problem on Twitter is that no one will hear this tweet. Because trying to stay in touch with 1000 people is utterly impossible. Some people follow many more.
