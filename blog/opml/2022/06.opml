				<outline text="So why is the court rushing to do it all this crazy stuff at once? They think there's a chance we might wake up and do the easy thing to neutralize them, by adding more members to the court. So they have to get it all in on the off-chance we might get smart. What's next is probably going after the presidential election, to give states the right to override their voters' choices." created="Thu, 30 Jun 2022 19:09:16 GMT" type="outline" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1542534669706694658" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/06/27/sarahSquirm.png"/>

I can't imagine where he could possibly go. Maybe somewhere in the midwest like Denver or Dallas. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-kevin-durant-requests-trade-from-nets-185500155.html&quot;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; to try to fill the shoes of the great Chris Paul. Maybe he and Russell Westbrook and James Harden could get back together somewhere to finish up their careers. Or maybe the Clippers. I'd like the Knicks to please turn the other way. No he's not welcome in NY. Thank you. I bet he thinks he's going to Boston. That would be a huge mistake imho. Maybe he can play in Europe or China. &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=durant&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Durant&lt;/a&gt;, no matter how good he is choked twice. He didn't fit in Golden State, and what a fiasco in Brooklyn which anyone could see coming. Maybe he could take a sabbatical or a gap year to see the world. I think he'll be boo'd in every NBA city.

But yesterday one of the arms on the chair broke off. Just like that. I thought no big deal, I'll get used to it. No. It doesn't work that way. I spend so many hours each day in this chair, the missing arm throws me off balance, sometimes literally. Almost fell off the damn thing a couple of times. I have another much more expensive chair (older) that I hate. I tried using it. No not going to do that. So I ordered a new cheap replacement. Even the littlest things matter it seems. Of course I have to assemble these things and I hate that part. So many opportunities to screw it up (I think that's the problem with the older chair btw)." created="Thu, 30 Jun 2022 13:55:27 GMT" type="outline"/>

Yesterday it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/06/17.html#a132248&quot;&gt;my bit&lt;/a&gt; about Ron DeSantis. I think for sure he's running for president in 2024, and if the Repubs are smart, they'll nominate him instead of Trump. He gets a clean slate. He's just dog-whistle-level racist enough to get all the votes Trump got and enough of Biden's to win without having to resort to an insurrection. But he is a solid white supremacist, return-to-slavery type Republican. Won't make even the slightest attempt to win support from blue states or minority voters. All white all the way. At the same time, it's a good bet that by the election in 2024, Twitter will be run to please the MAGAs. Why do I think so? Well, everything Musk says about free speech is just another dog-whistle for the MagaVerse. Joe if you're listening, please tell your friends in the the political consultant sphere that we need to at least start a social network for electing Dems in 2024 and beyond. Don't depend on Twitter being useful in that election. We'll need new ways to organize that go beyond fund-raising and advertising. We need to have a 365-by-7-by-24 connection with voters.

Lots of non-Internet stuff going on.&quot; In other words, I was going for a doctor's appointment to check out the problems I knew I had with my heart. They put me on a treadmill, didn't like what they saw, walked me over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Hospital&quot;&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography&quot;&gt;angiogram&lt;/a&gt;. Didn't like that they saw. A few days later I had heart surgery, and a week later I was back home, weak as a kitten, with lots of new meds to take, and a non-smoker. I felt like I was in the house of a dead relative, that's how profound the change was. In accordance with Bruce Sterling's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html&quot;&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that you can make big changes when something big happens, a few months later I was more or less recovered, strong as a bull, determined to make good use of the time I had been given. A few months after that I had moved to Boston, was starting up blogging at Harvard, then BloggerCon, podcasting, and a new life. Lesson learned, don't wait for the bottom to fall out before making the changes you long to make. Also it's a lot easier to quit smoking if you're in a hospital for the first week. :smile:" created="Tue, 14 Jun 2022 12:55:16 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="It's possible to use your identity from one system on others. When I say &quot;Drummer uses Twitter for identity,&quot; I'm just saying that rather than invent a new name here, we're happy to use the name you're known by on Twitter.

Even if for some reason you don't want to create an identity on Twitter, if you have a Mac you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml&quot;&gt;desktop version&lt;/a&gt;.

Think of all the fancy things Twitter does to support hundreds of millions of users. Think of what you expect of them. If somehow you get locked out of your account, you have to connect with a human somehow to get it back. They have it set up, skillfully, so you get a very small amount of human time, because otherwise the economics don't work. If I ran the identity system I use, I wouldn't be as efficient as they are and it's a thankless job, and I don't want it." created="Wed, 08 Jun 2022 14:44:55 GMT"/>

I still might do that, but I decided for now to go another way, by writing the simplest program possible, an app that just posts a tweet that says &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/a&gt;.

I was taking notes on the process that led to RSS 2.0 on 9/18/02. At first the project was called RSS 0.94, but after a while, listening to other developers, I changed it to 2.0. It's a long messy story, and by calling it 2.0 we said enough of the messy story. All we want is a feed syndication format that works, and that's exactly what RSS 2.0 is. It works. We got support from all the major news organizations, we already had the support of the NY Times. In the process of designing RSS 2.0, the BBC opened its feeds. And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/09.html#When:10:25:22AM&quot;&gt;9/18/02&lt;/a&gt;, the spec was published. From there a small revolution happened, leading to the social media world we enjoy today.

I had been saying all along that namespaces will be added to RSS when the spec is ready to be frozen, so growth can continue, after there is agreement on a common core of functionality. I felt that adding namespaces too early would encourage people to go their own ways, with different ways to do the same thing, which isn't good for interop. I wanted to encourage people to seek adoption from other developers. Otherwise what's the point of having a standard? Since RSS 2.0 was going to be frozen when it was published, that was the time to open the door for extensions. It's a way of saying &quot;this is done&quot; but it's not the end. :smile:" created="Mon, 06 Jun 2022 13:44:37 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/08/theTruthCanBeAdjusted.png"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson-ebook/dp/B084FLWDQG&quot;&gt;Caste&lt;/a&gt; is a perspective-altering book. We have a caste system in the US. It gives roles to each of us based on appearance. Gender, race, age are big signals. I think the concept of caste is basic to who we are. We all experience it to some extent. As a man, I'm supposed to be unable to cook, pay the bills, shop for food, I'm expected to be helpless in a home. As an older person, I can't be active creatively, I must be retired. It's also not possible that I understand the new technology. Not complaining (that much) just to say that it's there, and I recognize it in myself, when I judge other people based on appearance. If I see a black person demonstrating the positive traits that I was raised to associate with being white, it's notable, i.e. I note it. I have to be careful not to act on it, though I'm sure I do. I am 3/4 Jewish, and somehow got in my head as a kid that Jews were dirty and ugly and sad. That's a judgment of &lt;i&gt;myself, &lt;/i&gt;and I've always known it. Self-hatred. Again, aware of this, I try not to act on it, and to balance it with a commitment to being kind to and loving of myself. I don't know what to do about all this as a society, it seems impossible to overcome, almost as this kind of judgment is part of being human, at the same time, intellectually I know it's wrong.

				<outline text="When I bought my new house in the country I hired a painter to do over the inside of the house. I talked with him on the phone and arranged a meeting at the house. When I arrived he was already there. He was a black man. I had no idea. When we spoke on the phone I thought he was white. In the first few minutes of the conversation I told him this, because I was absolutely sure that I couldn't have hidden my surprise. It happened again, more recently, when my new Tesla was delivered. The man they sent was black, very nice, we had a polite conversation, but I felt awkward. One time, there was a group of white men working in my house, and I was sure one of them had said something antisemitic, and guessed he didn't know I was Jewish. I didn't say anything. And of course when I was a kid, I remember the antisemitic hatred of fellow school kids, who blamed Jews for the deaths of their uncles in the war. I was born ten years after the end of WW II, a war they felt wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Jews. I expect that's what they were told by the adults in their family, around the kitchen table. It's all those adults and their kitchen tables that perpetuate the caste system.
