				<outline text="When was the last time you said &quot;you're right&quot; to someone who was trying to convince you of something? In the house I grew up in, this is something no one ever said, because (as the theory goes) if you said it, you'd be forever reminded of the time you were &quot;wrong&quot; and they were right. You would be subordinate to this person, be it your mother, father, brother, grandfather, grandmother. Not my uncles so much, they were more on my side than the rest of them. Anyway it took me a number of years of living outside this house to realize that not everyone is like this. Some people relax when you &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/01/12/heyYouDidAGoodJobThere.html&quot;&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the magic words. They open up and say more things that you can learn from. Everyone has a point of view, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;blind men&lt;/a&gt; and the elephant. What they see as truth may not be a &lt;i&gt;universal&lt;/i&gt; truth, but to them it seems that way. And you are one of those people too. One time a long time ago, when I realized all of us can learn from everyone else, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html#5&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that we're just barking, farting chihuahas, even captains of industry like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison, with delusions of grandeur and a sense that they matter. Nothing we do really matters, in the end, but we can pretend that it does, in the moment, and if you can say something true that makes someone happy, why not? :smile:  " created="Thu, 29 Sep 2022 12:22:13 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/05/30/elephant.png"/>

The Mets and Braves were playing at the same time in different cities, tied for first place in the NL East, as both games went into extra innings. I was sure the Mets were going to lose because they kept doing the exact wrong thing. But the hero of September 2022 for the Mets, a man who is not known for heroics, the third baseman &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Escobar&quot;&gt;Escobar&lt;/a&gt;, came to the plate in the 10th inning and hit the ball into left field, and the shortstop, Lindor, who was on second base, came around third, as the ball was coming to the plate, but the throw was off and the shortstop scored and there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/29/escobar.png&quot;&gt;pandemonium&lt;/a&gt; everywhere. And meanwhile in the other game, the Braves were losing, so as they say it was a win-wn. But I'm not sure I can stand the stress of the post-season that's starting in a week, but actually feels as if is already underway. " created="Thu, 29 Sep 2022 12:58:50 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Another story. When I was in grad school, in Wisconsin, I lived in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0683469,-89.387218,3a,75y,133.83h,83.15t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1siwxmm2ZOCoKITaSDRlnXwA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3Diwxmm2ZOCoKITaSDRlnXwA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D131.00456%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; with nine other students, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://davetravel.scripting.com/2004/08/27#a36&quot;&gt;West Wilson St&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Monona&quot;&gt;Lake Monona&lt;/a&gt; and a park with tennis courts. It was the best time of my life. Always a party to come home to, and I loved the work I was doing with computers at the university, and I had a cat named Nurse, who I brought with me to Madison from NYC. She was a great cat. When I adopted her from a cat lady in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan, who had at least 50 cats in her small apartment, she pointed out this kitten who was protecting a sickly cat from the others. That's the one I took, and I called her Nurse because that's what she was when I met her. Anyway, in Madison, Nurse found a boyfriend, I guess, and she got pregnant, and had her kittens in the big house on West Wilson. I gave her a box in the corner of my room, and people were coming in all the time to see and touch the incredible kittens she had birthed. But one morning, they were all gone! The box was empty. No Nurse, no kittens! I did eventually find her, in a drawer in my dresser which I had left open, with some socks and stuff, there she was. I didn't tell anyone because her intention was clear. Then a few days later, kittens everywhere! Nurse was sitting somewhere off on her own and the kittens were discovering all aspects of the big house they were born in and all the people. A couple of days later we put them up for adoption and Nurse went to the vet to get fixed, and when she came home they were gone and she went on with her life hunting mice and birds.

				<outline text="I've tweeted on this subject many times and every time I do it gets Liked and RTd far more than most of my other tweets. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1575023277184937989&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Twitter should warn you that the link you’re about to click has a paywall and that all you’ll see is an offer to subscribe.&quot; Reminds me of a story I heard from a PR person I hired when I was miscast as the CEO of a software company in the 80s. I was paying them $5K per month, plus hourly fees and expenses. The $5K was due whether or not we used them that month. Since we were usually short on money, I was always thinking of cutting that expense, but I didn't because when we needed them they got us far more coverage than a little company like ours could command on our own. The CEO of the firm said to me once that I was not the customer, even though I was paying them so much money. The reporters were the customers. People like you come and go, she continued, but I have to keep the relationship with the reporters going no matter what. I think it's like that with Twitter and the people who click on links. Every time Twitter lets them use us this way, we hate Twitter a little more. We become more averse to clicking links. Just sayin, they don't have a business if they don't have our attention, and they're burning it, every time an advertiser wastes that attention, not to mention it's incredibly wasteful of the advertiser's money. This problem desperately needs a solution. The users want to pay money for news, but the offers the 8000 pubs that occasionaly have a must-read article are ridiculous." created="Wed, 28 Sep 2022 13:23:20 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/07/25/brienneOfTarthActionFigure.png"/>

						<outline text="Before blogging people used CMSes to manage web stuff. They were derived from print publishing software. You'd arrange something on the screen of a computer, until it was perfect, then hand it over to a printer who would put it on paper. That's how CMSes worked too. You'd edit in one place and deploy in another. The aha moment that made blogging real, the Holy Grail I was searching for was the realization that if there was just one place, you could dramatically simplify the editing process, so much that you wouldn't need a techie around to manage it.  It worked. The &lt;i&gt;aha&lt;/i&gt; was recorded in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, of course. If you put an Edit button on the published page, you didn't need another place to do your editing. All that was hidden beind the user interface. " created="Sun, 18 Sep 2022 17:28:32 GMT"/>
						<outline text="In the same way, before &quot;Frontier&quot; (and after, unfortunately) if you needed to store data from a program, you'd write it to a file. When your software was restarted, it would read it from that file. The innovation of Frontier is that it managed all that for you, in the language runtime -- so you never need to write anything anywhere. As with the blogging example, instead of two addresses, a piece of data only had one. I often wonder why no one else has stumbled across this incredible time- and complexity-saver. Bake storage into the runtime. My thought/guess is that language designers don't build apps so they don't know that this would be desirable. If they did, it &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be built into other languages." created="Sun, 18 Sep 2022 17:31:08 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I wonder, why I, as opposed to other developers am always striving to simplify, looking for a way to eliminate steps, and whole concepts. I think perhaps it's because I spent years in college studying mathematics, where that is the whole purpose. Looking for the unifying theory of everything. All science is like that, I wonder why this seems to have escaped software development. Every year we (as a profession) work to make things more complex. I think it's because most developers work for big companies who are rewarded by making things more complicated, not by pure programmers (like pure math) who focus on making software disappear.

Instead they'll groom their own superstars. There are so many good young prospects already playing for the Knicks. Quickley, Toppin, Grimes, RJ, Sims. This is team, the one they already have, is worth being patient for. And the current Knicks management, by hanging tough, remains a powerhouse for future deals and there will be more deals. Mitchell is a fine player, but far from the only one. " created="Fri, 02 Sep 2022 15:10:26 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/09/02/mitchell.png"/>
