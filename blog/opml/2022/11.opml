				<outline text="Today I'm testing a new Node.js app that watches a set of feeds (RSS, Atom, RDF) and posts new items to a Mastodon account. This one works with any Mastodon server. Requires some technical competence, but not much. The idea is to get the example code out there, for reading feeds easily and posting to Mastodon, again easily. I want feeds to melt into the fediverse, forming sort of a feediverse, which is maybe just a little bit bigger. I am so on board with decentralizing everything we do. My pitch for user-run servers goes back to the beginning of the web. Now having knocked down one of the biggest silos, all of a sudden lots of blue sky! Let's not give up our freedom this time. Anyway watch for a release later today or tomorrow. " created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 16:14:22 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/09/14/rssCoffeeCup.png"/>

				<outline text="Fixed a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; FeedLand bug" created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:38:10 GMT" type="outline" description="The problem was found only after hundreds of first-time users saw the app completely fail. ">
					<outline text="It happened for newly logged-in users at startup, as FeedLand loads for the first time." created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:38:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The first thing the app does is load the user's &lt;i&gt;appPrefs.json&lt;/i&gt; file -- it fails, of course -- it hasn't been created yet. It's not an error, although in the JavaScript console it looks like one. " created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:38:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The code as originally written allows for this, but I added something on Nov 8, as part of the &lt;i&gt;Your Feed&lt;/i&gt; feature, code that copies something from the place that doesn't exist yet to a place that does, without checking. Boom. " created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:38:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This meant that &lt;i&gt;the rest of the startup code didn't run.&lt;/i&gt; The app is sitting there waiting for the first-time user to do something. Everything is blank, none of the commands work, and yet two of them persevered, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; reported the problem. That in itself is kind of a miracle. " created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:40:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The second &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/132#issuecomment-1331894225&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; provided a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2022/11/30/jsConsoleScreenShot.png?nodialog&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; of the JavaScript console, which pointed me to the problem, almost by accident -- he didn't realize that was the problem, because there were two errors reported before it (as noted above those aren't real errors). If the screen shot had been slightly shorter, I would've been pulling my hair out looking for a needle in the haystack. Instead it pointed exactly to the problem, the code had a comment providing the date it was introduced (Nov 8), and sure enough the first report came after that change. We had tested this functionality at least a dozen times before Nov 8 without problems, so the first time I wrote it off as cosmic rays. Not a good call Dave, in retrospect. A very bad call actually." created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 14:03:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, since the problem cures itself as soon as they get a good logon, it simply wasn't repeatable. But this time, having a theory about where the error was, and I had a virgin Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/friendsofdave&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; ready for the test, one that had never been used with FeedLand -- I logged in and it was fixed, which I could see as I stepped through the code in the debugger. " created="Wed, 30 Nov 2022 13:43:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But -- I should have tried to repeat it after the first report. But I guess I didn't want to believe the problem was as bad as it was, and I didn't feel like searching for the needle. However if I had done it, presumably I would have looked in the JavaScript console and seen what the problem was and a few hundred more people would have had a good initial experience with FeedLand, instead of the really awful one they actually had.

I think they get angry, one or two have made fun of me, as if I'm a fool. It's not really very fair or friendly, even though these people may think they're friends. I can think of a dozen people who think I'm rude because I acted like &quot;FeedLand&quot; is a breakthrough. Or maybe they didn't like the way I said it? Hmm. I wonder how else you could. I've been through this loop over and over. As long ago as 1989 I was thought to be finished as a software dev. I wish it would get easier once. Just once.

				<outline text="Dear friends -- I got my right eye fixed today. Was it worth it? Well I had a good all-afternoon nap, so that was pretty good. Now my vision sucks in a new way, but the how-to guide says it'll clear up in a day or two, at most a week. At times the colors are intense, like I imagine an acid trip to be, and some light reflects off objects like a Fourth of July sparkler. I think this is just foreign material being assimilated into human material. Was it worth it? Hmmm. I'll let you know. But I'm pretty sure it was.

				<outline text="I was looking for links to prior eye surgeries, on the left eye. Not a good story. I started with decent vision, and a left-eye floater freaked me out. An eye surgeon said they could get rid of it, they did, but there was a new dead spot in the middle of my left eye. This surgery, in 2007, has given me crappy vision since then. Finally I had to get the lens in my right eye replaced, that's what was done today. After this, when the dust settles, my vision should be closer to what it was after the first surgery. The lesson: when a doctor says they can fix a condition, find out in advance if the cure is worse. A floater, I learned later, is harmless. Your brain gets used to and and factors it out, you stop seeing the floater after a while. The best thing to do is wait it out. Bigger lesson: if you can avoid surgery, avoid it.

				<outline text="Reading some stuff I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2007/02/14.html&quot;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2010/10/20.html&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, I was saddened by how much my blog changed for the worse in a few years, because I was trying to fit into Google Reader's idea of what a blog post was, which was not my own view. I wrote posts of all lengths, some with titles, on their own pages, and others just a sentence or two or a paragraph, many on the same page. They used to coexist in one flow, and it was great! All of a sudden there was a fork, on one side you had to use Twitter and the other side you could use blogging software, on one side you were locked in and in the other you had choice. We've been suffering this division since 2006 or so. But we're in a really good place now because we could rejoin the two flows, and let &lt;i&gt;writers&lt;/i&gt; decide how much writing each idea deserves, not a random limit imposed years ago without any clear idea of why. Right now please everyone think about what the world would be like if we had blogs and tweets flowing through one pipe. All kinds of new ways of visualizing flows will develop, the boundaries will melt. You can have it all, I promise, as a software developer. As a writer, we'll learn how to play with length without having to edit to fit an engineer's idea of how writing works. It's as if a geek said to a painter you can only create on a 140 pixel canvas. You could make good art that way, but think of all the art you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; make. I promise, you will be inspired by the new kinds of software we make. Most people using computers today have never been around for a blue-sky boom, where all the rules that were holding us back are gone in an instant.

When you do that, you invite all the other Jew Hate to come out and play. And once it's out, that means Jews are going to die. Once out, it might not be possible to stop it.

Today I couldn't figure out why all of a sudden items in a new kind of feed were getting link elements when there were no item-level link elements in the feeds. Okay so I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/reference-entry-link.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what I'm dealing with. My workaround which is ugly, is to consider the link element on an item to be a ghost (ie ignore it) if it has the same value as the guid element. It's bullshit. Nothing in the design of RSS allows me to infer this. But that's what happens with egregious hacks. To live with them you have to do more egregious hacks. And that's why, my friends, code never is done. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/blob/main/worknotes.md#111122-by-dw&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; the problem.

All I know is the one time I considered promoting a tweet, just to see if it worked, I ended up backing out after the first or second question. Instead, they could make it &lt;i&gt;easy. &lt;/i&gt;Ask for a credit card (assuming they don't already have it from some other purchase). Then ask which tweet the user wants to promote (unless they came there by clicking the &quot;promote this tweet button&quot; on the tweet they want to promote). Then ask how much they want to spend (suggest an amount, &quot;most people spend $18 the first time they promote a tweet&quot; for example). Click Submit and off you go. And please follow up with the user by email. Make sure they know how many impressions they got. And you might as well offer a money-back guarantee for the first few tweets. After all the whole thing cost Twitter exactly nothing. And make sure people get their money's worth. It'll be like gambling, fun at first, then addictive. And the money will just roll in. And you can forget about bullshit like paywalls and membership fees. That's nickel and dime stuff. Here we're talking about Google-like money!

				<outline text="Quick update on my eyes. A week ago last Friday I had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/28.html#a133050&quot;&gt;stop wearing a contact lens&lt;/a&gt; in my right eye so it could be measured for surgery I'm having late this month. The contact lens interferes with the measuring. I was very apprehensive about this, but it worked out rather well. I do see double in some situations, and depth perception is a problem that I have to always be conscious of, but driving is not a problem as I feared it would be, because all the distances there are far, and there's no problem with depth perception. A couple of days ago a wild turkey walked into my path and I was absolutely sure I was going to hit him, but swerved adeptly in an instant, and he took off at the same moment, and the turkey lived and I was impressed that my eyes and brain were able to work well together. But I do notice how small all the type is on the computer and how, if there are ways to make it more accessible, I sure don't know where they are. So I feel my way around while typing, and I'm sure I leave typos in there. This Friday I go for the measurement and then I can (I think) resume wearing the contact lens. But I kind of like not having to put it in and take it out every day. Maybe I'll stick with this approach. " created="Tue, 08 Nov 2022 13:16:41 GMT" type="outline"/>

In 2022, the ability to move simple documents around the net is limited to PDF and Word, both of which are designed for printing not online. What's stopping this? Agreement on what a document is. Twitter says it's titleless and limited to 280 chars. RSS readers say they must have titles (the readers are wrong, btw, nothing wrong with posts without titles). Blogging software, on which Twitter is based, arrived at a simple definition, and that's what I propose Twitter support because it has the simplest and yet most powerful distribution system, and basically everyone who writes is already hooked up to it. This inability of the best network to move documents around reasonably instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1588189183277166594&quot;&gt;as GIFs&lt;/a&gt;, is ridiculous in 2022. It's as if you had to carry a tank of gasoline in your electric vehicle just because they couldn't figure out how to design a car without a gas tank. Total bullshit. This is a feature they could charge for and it would be worth it. It would not be punishment for users for freeloading (as Musk seems to be positioning it).
