We should always be able to link to other stories, or enclose a podcast. Simple styling, &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;, standard features of our writing tools since 1984, should be present in all our publishing environments.

				<outline text="One of the nicest things about &quot;FeedLand&quot; is you can explore other people's feed lists, and see the world through their eyes, and how they are innovating with the product in ways you hadn't foreseen. For example, when we released FeedLand in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/10/&quot;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon wasn't a big deal yet, and we didn't even know about their excellent RSS support. Now, a couple of months later, of course FeedLand works with Masto, no mods necessary because &quot;RSS&quot; is a strong standard, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedland.org/?username=moosebegab&quot;&gt;users are innovating&lt;/a&gt;, again -- outside the boundaries of either product, using features in one to connect to features in the other. This is where &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop&quot;&gt;interop&lt;/a&gt; becomes art!

But it wasn't until today that I realized there is an equivalent to that in JavaScript. Not sure they even have a name, but if you create a function that's designed to be called via with the &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; verb in a certain way, it behaves just like a unit, if you know that. I wish someone had pointed that out to me earlier, but I doubt there are very many serious UCSD Pascal devs using JavaScript in the same way. On the server of course we have packages which totally are units, that was clear from the start.

I'm doing that now for the first time, and wish I had done it a long time ago. I think it's actually easier to write your own OAuth server than it is to use someone else's.

We're in a moment where we might be able to straighten out this huge problem with the web, that limits how we can integrate systems that support short and long posts. We've been divided since Twitter gave up on their RSS feeds, a long time ago. Mastodon required some convincing to stick to no titles in their feeds, rather than give in.

				<outline text="BTW, yesterday we paused new signons to &quot;FeedLand&quot;. There were a lot of reasons for this. First, I didn't want a lot of users. I think of FeedLand as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22fractional+horsepower%22&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower&lt;/a&gt; global feed management system. Not wanting in any way to compete with the huge systems, to create yet another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1602663488157089795&quot;&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt; like Twitter. I felt that we already had too many users for my liking. At some point the load on the server is going to be a problem, I wanted to stop well before we got to that point. Also, I want to do some development that would be harder with new users coming online. Remember this is not a corporate site. I am the only person working on the software and I'm responsible for keeping the service running at a technical level, and dealing with trolls, spammers and abusers, which thankfully have not been a problem yet, but I know from experience that it's just a matter of time.

I didn't plan on talking to feed reader devs on behalf of writers, but I think we all need to focus on who we're doing all this for, and it's primarily writers imho and then readers, and to the extent that programmers matter, it's just teeeny little bit.

				<outline text="No wonder the writing and reading environment of the web in 2022 is so awful. We ignore the writers and the readers.

It's as if they &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; me to hate them. They say the app is much better. Well, I don't want to do that, for good reason, and it's none of their freaking business but there's no way to turn this dialog off. I pay them a lot of money to read their articles. And every time I open one of their stories on my iPad I'm reminded how much they hate me, and vice versa. " created="Sun, 11 Dec 2022 14:06:23 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="With Mastodon supporting RSS, and Mastodon booming in popularity, feed readers should expect to see a lot more feeds with items without titles, unless for some reason Mastodon does what Twitter did many years ago, under pressure from Google Reader to add titles to items, and just withdraws the feeds.

						<outline text="Instead display the first words from the description element of the item where you would put the title.

				<outline text="Okay here we go. I don't know how to say this without pissing a bunch of people off, but I have to say it anyway. It's not ActivityPub that's booming now, it's Mastodon, which happens to use ActivityPub. The problem with ActivityPub is that it is basically incomprehensible. I don't know why it is that way. I could clear my schedule for the next three months and then at the end, I'd be able to tell you why it is that way. But I can't do that, because I have stuff to do with &quot;FeedLand&quot; and I want to get back to &quot;Drummer&quot; soon. I have users and I want to do stuff for them. As curious as I am to find out what's there, someone else will have to do that work. What we need is this. A simple package for Node, a lot simpler than the ones that are out there, that covers the basic functionality of things users do in Mastodon interactively, without using Mastodon, just ActivityPub. Create a new post, edit an existing post, boost a post, like one. Follow someone. Etc. Over on Mastodon a few people are talking about Bear Hugs. I didn't remember, but that's a term &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/15/the-bearhug/&quot;&gt;Steve Gillmor coined&lt;/a&gt; (I believe) for what I did with RSS. I basically kept building stuff with it, and getting content people on board until RSS on its own meant something. Then I let it go. We need that for ActivityPub. The people who won't like this are the members of the W3C. I'm afraid they think AP is done. Mastodon is already doing things outside of AP. I don't blame them. I would do the same thing. They have an API, they are using RSS, both of which are comprehensible. I think AP deserves to be comrepehensified, it deserves a bear hug. BTW, Steve Gillmor is to tech as Steve Bannon is to MAGA. Very much the same concept, imho. " created="Wed, 07 Dec 2022 20:45:47 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/07/bear.png"/>

					<outline text="Micropayments is such an awful term. Let's say I buy a Metrocard to ride the NYC subway. Every time I slide the card through a turnstile, what is that called? Is it a micropayment? Or I have an EZ-Pass responder on my car, so I drive through where the toll booths used to be without even slowing down. I don't know how much that costs, but I assure you there's nothing micro about it!" created="Thu, 01 Dec 2022 14:30:23 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/metrocard.png"/>
					<outline text="One of the reasons business people at pubs must be tired of this discussion is it's their job to get MACRO payments for their employer, not teeny little micropayments. As I envision it, I would probably spend $100 a month on various pubs, and maybe more and more over time. When fluidity is added to the economics, how can you help but pay more. It's only because of the attitude about this at publishers that we can't have more news (and they get more money)." created="Thu, 01 Dec 2022 14:30:45 GMT"/>
