I'm figuring things out at a whole new level, in the difference between who the Beatles were as people and how the Beatles were part of my personal foundation. I watched the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show. When I was in the hospital recovering from a ruptured appendix, She Loves You was #1 and played all the time on the hospital PA. And on and on.

				<outline text="My mind, when it comes to Beatles songs, is like one of those old computer monitors that's been sitting in a clerical office for 20 years, and the default prompt is burned into the screen so you can read it clearly even if the monitor is turned off. I never listen to the actual words of Beatles songs. When I first heard them, I'm sure I had no idea what they were talking about, and I played the songs so many times, as a child, and all through my life. It's like the Beatles are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS&quot;&gt;ROM BIOS&lt;/a&gt; of my music brain OS. Now that I've been reading about them as songs with meaning and connected to the musician's lives when they were writing them, the words all of a sudden are there. Fantastic.

It goes quite a bit deeper than just the financial tricks that inflated the bubble. What's so depressing that we not only didn't wake up from what we were doing and start to fix it, we've drifted further into the morass. It's hard to believe the United States has any foundation left. And the world is on the verge of telling us to fuck off, bigtime. I think that's what Putin is trying to provoke now.

I love the MX, it has a very nice feel and most important the keys are backlit. I like working in a dark room, so it's important for me to be able to see the keys, esp as my eyesight weakens as I get older. I got the new keyboard because I was unable to switch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Ctrl%20and%20Cmd&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;Ctrl and Cmd&lt;/a&gt; keys, so I could also use Windows and Linux on the same machine without breaking my brain. For some reason when I do the switch using the Control Panel or Karabiner, the mapping doesn't stick. I thought maybe the problem was with the keyboard, so it was worth $50 to find out. Sadly there's something wrong with the computer, this new keyboard has the same problem. If you have any ideas on what might be going wrong, or what I might try next, please send me a tweet or an email. In the meantime, I also got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072M4YLN6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;new mouse&lt;/a&gt;, an upgrade from the cheap-feeling Microsoft mouse I got because I decided to try using a scroll wheel mouse and liked it.

				<outline text="I realize that in a sense this whole blog, all 27-plus years, has been about coming to terms with being creative in public, and how hard it is to be true to yourself while doing that. Nothing can prepare you for it. I've known quite a few people who dealt with this in tech and know very few who were happy about it. Before you're rich and famous you think it'll all be great, but once you're in it, it just spins you around and you struggle to try to stay human, but if your fame gets big enough everyone wants to own you, some even tell you to your face they want to own you, but they don't need &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; if you get what I mean. I have walked away from the adventure a couple of times myself. But learning about the Beatles, and I still have a lot to learn, has opened my eyes wider than anything, because before this investigation started, all I knew about the Beatles was the one that the public owns.

After &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead&quot;&gt;yesterday's ode&lt;/a&gt; to the Beatles, I got three recommendatations for books.

Exactly what I was looking for. It's about how the legend of the Beatles grows over the years, long after the band broke up. What the Beatles (as people) ran away from is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1486178715503579138&quot;&gt;objectification&lt;/a&gt; that I find so fascinating, and disturbing in my own life. Can we have art and without destroying the lives of the artists?  It's a very emotional read for me because the Beatles loom so large, and it's why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE&quot;&gt;Get Back&lt;/a&gt; was such a revelation because it was about the people, not the legend, something that honestly had never occurred to me, that there was a difference.

						</outline>
					<outline text="It's so logical.

Just vote, and we all win. Yeah it could be shorter. Use the last three words. We All Win. Come on, that's what it's about. I would give the max to fund such a campaign and so would a lot of people.

Maybe not all of us, but I suspect a lot of Trump voters while they may be racist (face it, we're a racist country, so you have to work really hard to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be racist) what they really want is this: To make a difference. Trump filled a vacuum, the Democrats while they care about us in the aggregate, never get that we are individuals and we want to make a difference. We all want to know there's something we can do to help us all win. If you want to win, Mr or Ms Democrat, you have to bring the people into your marketing. And then, if you want to keep governing and not be completely obstructed, you have to bring us into governing too. The mistake that Obama made was not bringing the people into his administration. McConnell and his fascist Federalists wouldn't have been able to stand up to him if he had us behind him. No Democrat should ever try to do that again (though Biden is doing it too).

					<outline text="I have put out a format for interop -- &quot;OPML&quot;, but I've decided I don't want to wait for its broad adoption in the category to get interop.

Yeah but what if they break users, I kept wondering. How well do they test these instant universal updates before uploading? Well, of course -- they &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; test them. Duh. It's a Silicon Valley company and their fear of breaking users isn't the most important factor in their engineering effort, and that of course is an understatement.

					<outline text="I found out in the latest update. I had the temperature in the car set to 65 degrees, the same temperature I have my house thermostat set to. When I got into my updated car, the temperature was 72. It said so very clearly on the big display in the middle of the dash. So I did what I did before, touched the temperature, up pops the environment panel, but I couldn't find any way to change the temp back to 65. I know how to scan a UI from left to right and top to bottom to find the thing that should be big, in the middle the display. A slider that sets the temperature. It wasn't there. I sat in the car in my garage for a few minutes before I had a brilliant idea. Try doing it on the phone where the UI didn't change. Voila. Back to comfort.

In all this time, the heating controls, which are just a few knobs on the dashboard, obviously haven't moved or changed.

And I don't yet have a concise explanation. The difference goes back to ThinkTank vs Microsoft Word in the 80s. In ThinkTank when you moved an object out one level by pressing shift-tab, the node only took with it its own subs. In Word -- it could take some of its siblings with it. It depends on whether it views the document as a hierarchy or as a word processing document. The difference is also present between Drummer and LogSeq (and I imagine it comes from earlier products such as Org Mode). I'll keep coming back to this discussion, and I welcome input on what's the best way to understand the differences. I imagine in the end the difference will be similar to the difference between paint programs and draw programs, the former that deals with pixels, and the latter with objects.

					<outline text="I've been feeling a little under the weather the last few days so I decided it was time for a binge-watch of something familiar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Leftovers&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I had watched it when it came out, one episode at a time, over three seasons. " created="Sun, 02 Jan 2022 15:18:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think this is a series that was never meant to be binged, because it became harsh and ridiculous, but I remembered it had a great ending. It was one of those science fiction plots that actually makes sense. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that sputtered out at the end and never explained the mystery -- Leftovers very much does explain itself. And the crazy thing is that I didn't remember the plot until I watched the whole thing and it was explained in the last scene of the last episode of the final season.

					<outline text="So if you want to watch the show, here's what I recommend. Watch the first season in its entirety. Then watch the last episode of the last season. You might not understand some of the setup, but you'll totally get the punchline, and it's a good one and worth it. The rest of it is crap imho, and I'm surprised the show has held on to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-leftovers&quot;&gt;high rating&lt;/a&gt;.
