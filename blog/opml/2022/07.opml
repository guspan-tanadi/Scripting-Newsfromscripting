				<outline text="I heard yet another piece on NPR this morning wondering why Biden's approval rating is so low. First question, who has ever shown that this number means anything? Esp at the end of July, the middle of the summer two years before he's up for re-election. Second, the reason his approval rating is so low is that he's old and frail. On the other hand, I know he's in great shape. But when he's giving a prepared speech, the makeup is bad, or the lighting, but his eyes have the beady look of a very old person. And he is terrible at reading speeches. The intonation is all wrong. There's nothing human about it. I imagine they've hired coaches to try to improve this, but he hasn't gotten better. Funny thing is, when he's doing a press conference, which is very rare, he's great! His mind is sharp, he's an excellent communicator. You quickly forget how old he is. My guess is that his handlers think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/25/joe-biden-2020-public-gaffes-mistakes-history&quot;&gt;famous Biden gaffes&lt;/a&gt; are too expensive, so they play it safe with the prepared remarks approach. I don't think it's working. It's the source of &quot;he's too old.&quot; And ultimately who cares what NPR thinks anyway. Stop worrying. Let Biden be Biden.

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2022/07/28.html#a195125&quot;&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about Peloton's classes that take you places and how they don't work because the perspective is always shifting. Much better to have a constant first-person view, allowing your mind to zone out while your body works. An improvement beyond that -- have the speed correlate with how fast you're pushing the bike. And give me a boost, so if I'm going 10 mph, make it feel like I'm going 30. As if a strong wind was at my back. Often when you have the first person point of view in these classes it feels as if you're walking not riding, there's no feeling of speed. And you pedal harder and there's no change. I know that this would be hard to do and expensive, but (ahem) the bike and the classes are pretty freaking expensive too. Or better yet, let Nintendo write the software. :smile: " created="Fri, 29 Jul 2022 12:14:21 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/29/luigiOnABike.png"/>

				<outline text="Peloton has a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiSmnG6crow&quot;&gt;training sessions&lt;/a&gt; where they go some place interesting and record one of the teachers riding there for 20 minutes or 30 or more. You're supposed get the feeling that you're riding there, I guess, but it's terrible. I tried it a few times,  but yesterday I figured out why it's so bad. They keep changing the perspective. First you're seeing what the teacher sees. Then the camera goes off to the side, you're watching the rider. Then you're in a drone 200 feet above the rider, then the drone is looking down on the mountains or seascape or whatever. Then it goes back to the first-person perspective. I guess whoever designed these classes has no idea what it's like to ride? You only have one perspective and you get into the zone on it. But switching like that makes me feel sick! Literally makes me feel nauseous. I have to put my eyes somewhere else until the ride is over, but every so often I forget and there's that awful feeling again. Exercise is a meditation. Your mind does its own thing while your subconscious relaxes, just exerting and getting the body chemistry going to a nice place. And just when you're starting to zone out -- boom -- reality changes drastically. Again and again and again ad nauseum. Nothing in the real world works that way. Some free advice for Peloton.

I'm a big believer in following the spec, but if the spec is wrong -- that seemed to be what the devs were saying you have to do some more thinking. &quot;See what's out there&quot; is my motto, before making any assumptions. One of the reasons the only method for reading feeds in my project is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeder.scripting.com/?template=mailbox&amp;feedurl=http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;mailbox-style reader&lt;/a&gt;.

I don't doubt that #metoo contributed to more men voting for Trump. So there's another reason to regret forcing Franken to quit without any process, it was stupid politics. I think something similar contributed to Elizabeth Warren's failure as a presidential candidate in 2020. I enthusiastically supported her at first, but then I guess trying to get stronger women's support, she said some awful things about men. It didn't get any press, but I, as a man heard it, and as far as I was concerned it disqualified her. A president has to be for every American, regardless of gender. A woman president is also a president for men. And we can vote. We will I hope have a woman president someday, and when we do, she will appeal to all genders. Men can be feminists, but if you think that equates to attacking men for being men, you won't win. Men still have a lot of votes.

				<outline text="Programming note: September 18 is the 20th anniversary of RSS 2.0. After 20 years, there's a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of new stuff that wasn't there when RSS 2.0 was rolled out, that because RSS has been stagnating, hasn't been added to the mix. I never should have stopped working on it, but the environment then was crazy. Anyway, I decided, at the beginning of 2022, that I'd spend the whole year building a new RSS toolkit. A top to bottom review. Only constraint is everything must be compatible with what's out there. With lots of room for innovation and refinement. Anyway -- today is a big day in the process. A lot of stuff is working, very little of it is visible. But a bunch of stuff that will make your brain explode, a little, is now available. If you care about RSS, please set aside a little time to focus on what's here in the blog for today. It's not complicated, but it is new. :smile:" created="Tue, 19 Jul 2022 02:38:41 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2022/07/18/20.png"/>

They got some things right. The protocol was designed in a couple of weeks by four people, two at Microsoft and two of us not. The Microsoft people were from their networking group. They wanted a cross-platform protocol to do what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model&quot;&gt;DCOM&lt;/a&gt; does. It was and is a brilliant idea. I wanted it as a way of designing APIs for scriptable blogging systems. We were in the process of shipping a new Windows version of &quot;Frontier&quot;, we already had a Mac version, and I wanted the two Frontiers to work beautifully together on LANs and on the net. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/02/27/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it, when I figured out that it would be done with XML and HTTP. I then got an email from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft asking if I wanted to work with them on this. I always admired Bob and people like him at Microsoft, they had an excellent engineering culture imho, so of course I said yes. What followed was one of the most productive collaborations of my career. And as a result not only did Frontier get great cross-platform compatibility, all the early blogging systems has compatible APIs.

Podcasts are RSS 2.0 feeds with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/payloadsForRss.html&quot;&gt;enclosures&lt;/a&gt; that contain the podcast content. Anything that doesn't use a feed to distribute the audio isn't a podcast, and shouldn't use that name. Eventually Spotify will regret diluting the meaning of the name, the same way I'm sure Microsoft regrets trying to suck the web into Windows. When a new medium has so much momentum, it's best for the dominant company to just let it grow around them, and support it, and reap most of the profits. If you fight it, you'll get lost in the noise, no matter how big you are -- imho. This only applies if the new medium is very strong, as podcasting is today. For more, see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acookiecrumbles/status/1547323851985526786&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; started by Priyanjana Bengani of Tow Center, and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1547324953250463748&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Simply support the standard and develop whatever features you want outside of the standard.&quot; I'd also recommend looking to see if anyone did it before you and try to be compatible with it -- and if you do -- you just created a new standard. It's just evolution. A lot of things have to be right for it to happen, and when it does, please -- don't get in the way, it's a miracle. :smile: " created="Fri, 15 Jul 2022 12:41:25 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/01/10/loveRss.png"/>

Writing publicly on the net is about something other than being paid as a writer and funding a public writing space as Williams and Medium's outside investors did, shouldn't depend on whether Medium makes money. I just don't understand why someone who's worth as much money as Williams cares in the slightest whether his new (in 2012) blogging system made money. He didn't care if Blogger made money a few years earlier when he was broke! Now that he has an infinite amount of money all of a sudden he cares about making money? I don't know. Doesn't make any sense to me. It's okay to make software just because you love to make software, even if making money is not the motive." created="Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:53:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So now Substack has taken Medium's place as the default place of for-the-record-writing, and once again they've tied a business model to public writing, and that will make them do all kinds of contortions to restrict the movement of their writers and eventually readers, because at some point their investors will want to know how they're getting paid. And of course investors have every right to expect to make money, that's why they invested. " created="Wed, 13 Jul 2022 13:58:45 GMT"/>

It can include images and embedded tweets and links to offsite pages. The author uses some bold and italic styling. A story has a title. All this is good. Are there limits on what you can link to?

You can edit a note after posting it, unlike a tweet. They say they are still developing it. I highly recommend a different user interface on the Twitter timeline, that they present a note analogously to how they present an image, video, audio chat, etc -- that is, inline. I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/02/whatWouldAFatTweetLookLike.html&quot;&gt;mockup&lt;/a&gt; of how this would work in 2015.

Could they be that stupid or cowardly or are they just actors. My guess is that we're the ones who have been duped, and after all they are just actors and know exactly what they're doing." created="Fri, 01 Jul 2022 17:44:02 GMT"/>
