Then when I took a few deep breaths I realized, yes, of course, today's when the second quarter numbers for the economy came out. A bad quarter is when the economy only grows by 2 percent. This quarter the economy shrank by 33 percent. That's without precedent. We're in a depression now, unlike anything ever seen in the US. Even with all we know now about macroeconomics, there's no way out of this situation until we get the virus under control, and the government shows no interest in doing that. Trump is a distraction.

				<outline text="I've recently added a bunch of people to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; subscription list. Plenty to catch up on, but nothing as important as this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. The tech industry is trying to take control of the open standards of the web. They're doing it slowly, with a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html&quot;&gt;punishment&lt;/a&gt; for people and companies who don't comply. A perfect example of monopoly power used corruptly. Plenty of people noticed, but few want to cross Google. I don't care. I'll let them make my writing inaccessible, but I will never comply with their rules. The web is unique in that it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/04/coexistingWithPlatformVend.html&quot;&gt;no platform vendor&lt;/a&gt;. They're guests, as we all are. Guests don't make the rules. There are other issues. Facebook has knocked the legs from under the blogosphere. Every time I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; them to help, they've said no. So all progress has to flow through them and they never move. They don't support the most basic features of the web, linking, simple styles, titles, podcasting. The tech industry is as bad as it was when I started in the 70s. And of course it's much more powerful today.  " created="Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:52:21 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2018/01/03/stayPuffMarshmallowGuy.png"/>

The tests are imperfect enough that the virus can get into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble&quot;&gt;bubble&lt;/a&gt;, as it did with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29546814/sources-marlins-cancel-game-virus-spreads?linkId=95172830&quot;&gt;Florida Marlins&lt;/a&gt;.

They tried to destroy my people, forced my family to emigrate to the US (not a bad thing btw). We fought WWII against the swastika people. We won.

These are very good actors, and they do what they're told, so it's totally ridiculous. They make up for the ridiculousness by playing seriously dramatic music that makes no sense given the total mediocrity of the story and script.

Everyone else seems to sort the silverware on the way in. That doesn't feel right to me. First, who wants to handle the dirty silverware any more than you have to? Second, like everything in my kitchen, the dishwasher is not designed for a tall person. The silverware caddy is basically on the floor. So I save time by kind of tossing the silverware. I'd have to bend all the way down to get it into a specific part. And I do sometimes miss, but that makes life more interesting, I find. It's not really an issue for me, because I find that putting away the clean dishes and silverware takes less than a minute. By sorting the silverware on the way in how much could I possibly save? As a programmer I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; think about things like this. Even though it had never occurred to me before that you could sort your silverware in the dishwasher.

The one we used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; about not breaking things was “Don’t break the web!”  It’s a preservationist perspective.  Much of the human digital heritage of the last 30 years and for the foreseeable future is stored as unmaintained web documents. Every breaking change to a web technology (JS, HTML, etc.) is likely to make part of our heritage permanently inaccessible." created="Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:54:35 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/06/11/pizza.png"/>
						<outline text="Another slogan we used frequently while I was active in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.es/&quot;&gt;TC39&lt;/a&gt; was  “consider the complexity budget.”  The idea is that there are  limits (whose bounds we don’t know) to the complexity that a programming language can accommodate and still remain useable, learnable, comprehensible, fun, etc.  Every time a feature is added or a inconsistency is introduced we use up some of the complexity budget and it can never be recovered. So any such addition limits what do to the language in the future. Each proposed feature needs to be evaluated not just concerning its utility but also whether that utility is worth limiting future language design flexibility." created="Tue, 14 Jul 2020 15:55:18 GMT"/>

Not a good question, because that isn't what happened. Hippies were a very small part of the Boomer generation. George W. Bush is a Boomer, but not a hippie, then or now. And sure, some hippies didn't drop out, but then a bunch of them did. My uncle, for example. He really did live the dream of the hippies. As I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me&quot;&gt;Lies&lt;/a&gt; book, I come to appreciate that there are people applying the scientific method to history, and not accepting the simple and wrong stories of heroes and villains, weak and strong, the savages and the civilized. BTW, some of the hippies became programmers. That's a whole other thread to pick up. That's why the freedoms of the net and the web &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;persist&lt;/a&gt; to this day.

						<outline text="I applaud the rule of &quot;don't break existing code.&quot; We had the same rule in the RSS world. It was very controversial with some. They wanted to break it. That's what the big debate was about. On one side, mine, trying to maintain continuity, because I and others were developing and deploying software to users that built on RSS. We couldn't afford to change things just for the sake of change. And we had a lot at stake in preserving simplicity, because that kept the barrier to entry low. The more different ways there were to do something, the harder it would be to enter the market, and the leaders could become complacent.

						<outline text="We had the same rule in the &quot;Frontier&quot; world . We called it Rule 1, and it was simply this: Don't Break Users. As a joke Rule #1a was: Don't Break Dave. That was meant to tell the team this was personal. If my code was broken, I would probably raise my voice. The rule came about because the guy who was working on the core code would routinely break the upper-level code. To him, the core was never finished, and all the work we were doing at upper levels was just to test his stuff. So he didn't really feel it. I think that's true of many other developers. They don't get that the people who build on their tech are skilled in ways they can't comprehend (and of course vice versa). That's the power of layering tech. It becomes virtually impossible without the No Breakage rule. And you can see it in the market. Good ideas from previous generations are nowhere to be found in today's systems.

Postel says be conservative in what you send. I say one way is better than two. Applied to JavaScript, adding the arrow syntax was a mistake.

That was incorrect. A neighbor is having work done on trees. I live in a forest, where trees are a big deal. They're always falling over, and then you need to cut them up and haul the wood away or chop it into firewood. When you cut trees with a chain saw the wood burns, and it doesn't stop burning when the cutting is done. And that adds a stink to the air, like a fire that was put out with water. That's what I was smelling. I know this because I had some trees cut last year, and the stinky smell stuck around for a week. It's the sad smell of a dying creature. On the other hand, when you wake up on a summer morning with dew on everything, and a nice warm feel to the air, with a bit of residual chill, the forest smells like life. It's a wonderful smell.

But he uses the N-word a lot. And get this -- he uses it to talk about white people. Like this: You my &amp;lt;N-word&gt;. I've been told, not by Chappelle, that it's a term of endearment. To me, that's ridiculous -- it's a threat. Because if I use that term of endearment, a 10-ton weight comes down on my head. I don't like it. We're also told this is a word African-Americans use among themselves, and we wouldn't understand what it means. But many of the people in Chappelle's audience are white. We're his N-words. I'm watching it, and reminded every time I hear the world, and he says it a lot, that this is something I'm not allowed to like. The more I listen to him use the N-word, my inner voice, constantly yapping about nothing, repeats what he says, and I'm concerned that will eventually come out of my mouth, without thought because that actually happens in real life. It's a painful word, not just for African-Americans. I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jelani-cobb&quot;&gt;Jelani Cobb&lt;/a&gt; write &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jelani9/status/1278607474921267200&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; the other day about the possible capitalization of the word &lt;i&gt;black&lt;/i&gt; when used to talk about people of African descent. &quot;Does anyone feel strongly about upper-casing the B in black?

					<outline text="I think that's pretty straightforward. The only emotion I mention is &lt;i&gt;enjoy.&lt;/i&gt; It's true, when I'm writing a long post that organizes something I've had in my mind for days or weeks, and it comes out well, I do enjoy the process. I imagine people reading it, and thinking man this is a great idea or I don't know, I see a problem with it, and then either passing it along as-is, or expanding on it. Either way, I would be happy, because I made a contribution.  " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 13:55:20 GMT"/>

						<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/06/28/125635.html?title=ourOpportunity&quot;&gt;One which says&lt;/a&gt; let's not waste this moment of political action around BLM, at the same time the government is going to spend $10 trillion (a number I made up) to keep the US from collapsing. Instead of having the money go to the 1% which is the default, let's have the money solve the real problems that are behind #BLM, and in the process help everyone. It was a strong piece, and it contains ideas you never hear among pundits. " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:09:24 GMT"/>
						<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/07/01/152316.html?title=whatWouldCuomoDo&quot;&gt;The other&lt;/a&gt; was about the virus and what's in our immediate future, and how, if we eased up on some of the rules of how politics work, if Biden were to appoint Andrew Cuomo as his primary virus advisor, we could start to have a national response to the virus &lt;i&gt;before January 2021. &lt;/i&gt;That we're frozen, can't act, scares the shit out of me, both for my own existence, that of my friends and family, and my country, and honestly the world. The US is too important a part of the world for us to just let it go. We have to do something. I put my plan in writing. " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:10:02 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The response to both these pieces, predictably -- crickets." created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:00:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I may or may not be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/arts/gaslight-movie-afterlife.html&quot;&gt;upset&lt;/a&gt; about this, I didn't say, but that's not the point. It's not wrong to be upset. You don't have to talk someone down from being upset, assuming I was (I wasn't, it was more frustration). You know what would be better? Ask how you can help. If one person had asked that, I would have said, in glee -- &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: .9em&quot;&gt;READ THE FUCKING STORIES AND IF YOU LIKE THE IDEAS, PASS THEM ON WITH ALL YOUR POWER&lt;/span&gt;. " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:00:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the first case, let's try to steer the #BLM conversation to real political action, now, not in the future, and while the marches are great, we must do more. It's so predictable that we'll just let the moment pass and settle for a few symbolic gestures. Monuments come down. A black person is on the $20 bill. Maybe Biden nominates a black woman for VP. But that money -- that's where the power is, and it goes to the friends of Trump and McConnell, Pelosi and Schumer. " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:01:34 GMT" image="http://scripting.com/images/2017/09/01/mrFrog.png"/>
					<outline text="In the second case, obviously we need and can have, a national response to the virus. We do not have to wait for Trump to leave the White House. And you know what, combining the two, BLM and the response to the virus, there's real power in that, too. If putting these ideas out there resulted in real power and real change, your friend Dave would be over the moon. " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:03:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you want to know what I really think -- there's no point in continuing to write these pieces on my blog. They accomplish nothing and leave me with a lot of frustration. I can ride my bike, work on the garden, read books, and enjoy my retirement (I turned 65 this year). I don't want to do just that, but geez if nothing happens when I pour my best ideas into the blog, why bother." created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:04:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Let me try to put it in perspective. I think Andrew Sullivan is a great thinker and writer. I don't agree with everything he says, but every time I read one of his pieces in &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/author/andrew-sullivan/&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, I get lots of ideas. I feel compelled to act. I think I'm in that class of writer, and I think my talent and experience and ideation process are wasted in this space. " created="Thu, 02 Jul 2020 14:05:57 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I know a lot of people don't like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo&quot;&gt;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;, governor of New York. I had a sligntly negative opinion of him before the virus hit. My mom didn't like him. She said NY Democrats were really Republicans. I trusted her opinion on that.

					<outline text="Anyway somehow I've never engaged in state politics here, never understood why a city like NY isn't its own thing at a national level.

" created="Wed, 01 Jul 2020 15:24:06 GMT"/>

					<outline text="But then there's the rest of the country. Ultimately our health will be the same as the country's. So if the US doesn't get its act together, soon, we're going to be right back where we were in March. Except it will be much worse for a couple of reasons.

						<outline text="Wear and tear. In many ways we've used up the reserves we had, as people, as economic beings, in our relationships with other people. Rent is due today, it's a crisis for an unthinkable number of people. There's going to be hunger soon, on a scale not seen here in my lifetime, and who knows how bad it will get. It's here now, in March, it was just looming. School is scheduled to resume in a couple of months, but no one really thinks it will. " created="Wed, 01 Jul 2020 15:25:08 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Math. Based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/health/coronavirus-spread-united-states.html&quot;&gt;NYT study&lt;/a&gt;, the virus had spread much more than we realized by March, but now it's had another three months to push into every nook and cranny of the country. This wave is going to crest a lot higher than the first one, assuming we can manage to get it to crest before &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; is infected. The higher density means when you go to the supermarket instead of on average there being 1/2 of a Covid carrier with you, now there will be 3. And the load in the air you're breathing will probably be an order of magnitude more dense. Which means you and I will get it, where two months ago, we wouldn't have. Everything about the virus, math-wise, has led the curve straight up, vertical. We're there now. Exploring terrible new territory. It's like being cast out of a space ship in a vacuum with very little oxygen and no possibility of a rescue ship.

					<outline text="Cuomo, in his daily briefings, kept saying look at the numbers, look at the numbers. Okay.
