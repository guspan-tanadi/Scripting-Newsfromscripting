				<outline text="I did not watch the debate. I was watching the previews on CNN and MSNBC, and I could see where it was going. I went to sleep instead, as I did on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html&quot;&gt;Election Night in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't really understand what happened until I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/podcasts/the-daily/presidential-debate-election-trump-biden.html&quot;&gt;today's Daily podcast&lt;/a&gt;, just now, which included excerpts. Trump is dominant. He really practiced dominance. He's got a knack for it. About halfway through the show I realized this is what happens when you debate a troll. You never get to finish a thought, he always has another nit to pick, an annoying way to say something. He disrespects your dead son. He makes it about him, 100 percent. There's no room for anyone else. He was awful on his town hall a couple of weeks ago. A bluff? Anyway, I never thought Biden should debate him, or it should have been with rules that made it impossible for Trump to talk over him. Trump owned the stage last night. Glad I didn't watch, from what I can tell it was a nightmare. Also it was an incitement. The reporters say he &quot;targeted his base.&quot; Not really. He told his nascent militia to make a mess of the election, and he's setting up &quot;the left&quot; to get the blame. We gave him access to 100 million people so he could fuck us up the ass.

				<outline text="Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld&quot;&gt;Hello World web app&lt;/a&gt; for ES6 modules. It uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/module.js&quot;&gt;module&lt;/a&gt; that defines one function, secsSince. It then calls that from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/es6ModulesHelloWorld/blob/master/code.js&quot;&gt;another module&lt;/a&gt;, and displays the result on the page. It's as simple as I could make it and it works. Not sure I want to use ES6 modules, but at least now I know how to do it, and you do too. All the other tutorials were missing some information you need to understand how modules work. The most confusing thing about modules is that you can only invoke modules from other modules. That means all the JavaScript code in your web app has to be in a module. Not sensible imho, but also not much of a burden. BTW you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/code/moduleshello/&quot;&gt;run the code&lt;/a&gt; without downloading.

Barbaro never came to grips with a key idea: Trump is not a rich guy evading taxes. He's broke. He's a loser. That's his usual state, even though he's had two huge windfalls of cash, first from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump&quot;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and then from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;. Each time he's invested in marginal businesses and his management turned them into failures. Then he borrowed, failed to pay back his debt, went bankrupt. He's about to go bankrupt again with the $400 million that comes due in the term he's running for now. But we don't know who he owes the money to, but we can take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_mafia&quot;&gt;good guess&lt;/a&gt;. The big takeaway from the tax returns is &lt;i&gt;Trump is a loser. &lt;/i&gt;It's a shame they don't have a whole podcast series about what's in the returns. We've spent so much time speculating about the truth of Trump, now we have a huge load of data. Podcasts are the best medium for revealing it. Sadly only the NYT has this story, so it's not getting a deep dive.

It all works, in an unsurprising manner, except Google Maps on the Android has one feature that the iPhone version desperately needs. The map re-orients so that the direction you're heading in is always up and to the right. On the iPhone it's kind of random. Hard to parse. And the layout is much better for a driver, who can't spend any time puzzling out what the computer trying to say. If you have a turn in 2 miles, there's a box that says Right Turn in 2 Miles. And it counts down as you get closer. Next time I'm driving I'll try to take a picture (obviously with the iPhone).

				<outline text="When I was a kid, still in elementary school, my parents bought a new car. A Pontiac Catalina, perhaps. One year I was given the job of rotating the tires, something you do to even-out the wear. I had to look deep into the trunk, and I could see way in the back, a cutout in the panel under the rear window that had a speaker, and a pair of wires disconnected from the speaker. At the time a rear speaker was a high-value luxury feature, esp for kids who sat in the back seat. I hooked the wires up and asked my father to come out and turn the car and the radio on. The speaker worked. My parents, buying the car, had not opted to pay for the rear speaker, but I guessed that it was cheaper for the manufacturer to put the speaker in every car, and only hook it up if you paid for it. Never forgot that, it still influences my software design to this day. " created="Sat, 12 Sep 2020 14:08:37 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/09/12/catalina.png"/>

One is based on &quot;Concord&quot;, in an Electron shell. Its feature set is an almost exact copy of &quot;Little Outliner&quot;, with a few extra features to support my blog-writing. And I use &quot;Frontier&quot; on my Mac for writing JS code, because I have a well-developed code management system that runs in Frontier. I also write little utilities that are quicker to write in Frontier than they would be in Node, but I have hopes of tackling that job and making Node a real scripting system. I no longer use the server apps we developed in Frontier. Most of them have been ported to Node. Many advantages to doing that, unfortunately none of those compare with Frontier for server programming. What Node has is a huge community that writes lots of packages that I can use. As far as I can tell I am the whole community in Frontier. Eventually that had to give, and it did. I found a good teacher to help me get started in JS in 2013 or so, and boom off to the races.

				<outline text="A longtime &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; uses Mailchimp to send a periodic newsletter. They have a feature that allows the author to re-send the mail to people who haven't opened it. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/help/resend-an-unopened-campaign/&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt;. They don't say how they know it wasn't opened. I was under the impression that mail apps prevent this kind of invasive behavior. People used to use one-pixel images with search params, but I think the email apps now copy the image and replace it in the HTML, to prevent the sender from knowing. So I told my friend I don't think it's possible. Pretty sure that's right, but I guess it depends on the app you use for email. I use GMail. I think these days enough people use GMail to make the Mailchimp feature useless. BTW, I did open the first email, and it treated me as if I hadn't.

Not sure if there's a way to tell, especially when the people in a room are only fully available when you visit that room, and I don't always want to do that.

Isn't Covid-19 offering the chance to bring us together? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan&quot;&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; once asked his Soviet counterpart &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev&quot;&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt; if aliens attacked, would he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/reagan-and-gorbachev-agreed-pause-cold-war-case-alien-invasion-180957402/&quot;&gt;pause the Cold War&lt;/a&gt; and work with Reagan to fight them? Gorbachev said &lt;i&gt;hell yes&lt;/i&gt; he would. Isn't Covid exactly that kind of opportunity? Why isn't the Lincoln Project running ads that informs voters that if we had a merely competent president, one who got out of the way of the government, we would be doing a lot better. Not only would far fewer people get sick and die, but we could go out to dinner and a movie. We could take a vacation. We could have a party. We could have Thanksgiving dinner with our family and celebrate Christmas together this year. We could hug our family and friends. All that's standing in the way is our working together.

And the &quot;Raise Hand&quot; feature needs to be disabled for this. And people have to understand when their mike turns off and someone else starts speaking.
