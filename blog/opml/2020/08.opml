				<outline text="An idea! Everywhere across the country on one day, we all walk to our polling places. Singing happy American songs. We shall overcome. Wearing masks of course. Dress rehearsal for Election Day. At your local polling place, you ring a bell and salute the American flag, and go home. We all take turns. Then on Election Day itself we all know where to go, and we have it in our minds. You can still vote by mail if you want, assuming you trust it. We should make Election Day as much anticipated as any holiday. It wouldn't take a long time, but it would give every local TV station a place to send their cameras. The famous suburban parents with their kids on bikes and singing. Republicans too. Everyone join in. This is America. Doc Rivers. That would make it clear to everyone what's going on. Your country needs you now. It's important. " created="Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:27:56 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/08/uncleSam.png"/>

That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing.

I had two years to get back into fulltime programming after selling Living Videotext to Symantec. It was totally an iterative process, I didn't know where I was going to end up. Started by building components, then puzzled out how to integrate them. It's the way I've always developed, before and since. Made for an interesting but somewhat exhausting read. I had forgotten the details, for the last 30 years I've been &lt;i&gt;using&lt;/i&gt; the software. It's taken us to interesting places, blogging, podcasting, XML-RPC, RSS, etc. Lots of food for thought. :boom:" created="Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:52:57 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2019/03/13/michaelJackson.png"/>

On the other hand, I asked my fellow Woodstockers how they deal with mice and cars, and I have learned so much. I'm going to make a list of all the ways people keep the mouse damage to a minimum, and I'm going to practice it.

I guess this is what he’s like unchained from NY Mag. I didn’t read his stuff before he moved to NYM. He’s like a Fox commenter. Vile. And because he's smart, he must know what he's doing.

				<outline text="One more thing. Perhaps the Democrats should campaign on fear, just a bit. Think about what a second term for Trump might bring, specifically. I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1299622748130598913&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about that, a short one.  &quot;Trump wins second term, masks are now illegal. The virus is declared dead. We are forced to go to indoor centers, until we all get the virus, so the economy can reopen fully.&quot; I'm sure Trump unchained would try to bring his version of Hitler to the US, with serious advantages. Hitler didn't have nukes, America's wealth or an ally like &quot;Covid-19&quot;. He can and I'm sure will do a lot of damage. I think people should be confronted with that very specific vision, in all states, red and blue.

I suspect this has been going on all along, but now with the wide use of smartphones, we're actually seeing it, visually, as we couldn't have seen it before. Now it's not their word against a cop's. The video provides testimony that is impossible to refute."/>
				<outline text="If you were black, and you saw this happening, you might be inspired to do more than say something like Black Lives Matter. Your rage and fear might overwhelm you. So the first thing I would say to a black person who said Black Lives Matter is thank you for containing the rage you must feel, that I would feel if I were in your shoes, that I feel in a small way on your behalf, at the cruelty and callousness of our system and culture.

George W. Bush was so awful, we needed an antidote, and we liked Obama. We liked how sassy he was, and smart, and how well he spoke, his confidence and ambition. The whole package. It was his moment. Trump is the reaction because there were a lot of Americans who felt tremendous fear and resentment in having a young sassy (they'd probably say uppity) black man as president, no matter that he brought the economy back from the wreck that the Repubs left us.

					<outline text="Last night's DNC went by quickly. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1296681978029322241&quot;&gt;funny&lt;/a&gt;. The speakers spoke warmly of Joe Biden, including Bernie Sanders. Everything was great until the moment Biden stepped up to speak. His first few sentences were awkward, the words were vague and muffled. I started to get up from the chair, not wanting to listen. I thought I'd clean up and go to bed, but I decided that I have to sit through this, so I did, and I was quickly riveted and glad to hear him touch on all the important points, ones that no one had made through the week. " created="Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:28:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Until that point I thought Michelle Obama's speech was the best. I thought Barack Obama's was weak. I don't think the Constitution is the strongest appeal, it's the lack of leadership, we're all left to fend for ourselves against a virus that's killing huge numbers of Americans. We could deal with a little authoritarianism, I feel, if it was in the cause of saving our lives. The fear isn't rooted in the 170K Americans who have already died, it's the next 170K and the ones after that. We all want to survive this. With Trump in for four more years, our chances of not being destroyed by the virus are zero. I think that is by far the strongest appeal. And until Biden, amazingly, in four days of the DNC, no one had made it. He didn't quite make it explicitly either, but he came pretty close. " created="Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:30:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I often feel there's this divide between our leaders and the people. And I don't kid myself, the divide is there between Biden and us too. All the stories about how he gave people his phone number, or sat down and talked for hours with a random person, those are touching for sure, and even if they are real, I know he'll never call me. It was the equivalent of having a beer with Bush or shooting hoops with Obama. I wish one of these politicians had a practical vision -- of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1237.html&quot;&gt;political social network&lt;/a&gt; that mobilized us 365 days a year, every year, not just when there's an election. Biden is not that person, nor is Kamala Harris. When they're elected they will govern like Obama did, and will be vulnerable to the same Republican sabotage that he was. But. Biden was not awkward. His speech was more a fireside chat than a DNC acceptance speech. Yes, I am convinced he is on our side, relative to the current president. A low bar for sure, but it grabs me emotionally, also physically, cheering, sobbing. It would be such a relief, on Election Day, to find we had come together and elected Biden and Harris in such large numbers that everyone will see what a fool Trump is, even his most vocal supporters, and we'll tell him to STFU, with one voice, and just retire in disgrace to his bunker in Russia. It's a dream I allow myself to have. And it was supported by Biden's speech last night. That's political speech at its best. It was a good thing I sat my butt back down and listened.

So much information about the lives of the individual scientists. It went on and on. I skipped whole chapters. Now, I like a good story as much as anyone, but nothing about his tale made me care about them as people. And that isn't why I picked up the book. I want to learn as much as I can about influenza pandemics, because I'm living in the middle of one. To his credit, the book was published 15 years ago, long before Covid-19.

Certainly not when it came to mobilizing resources to fight a pandemic that was killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, as today. If we elect Biden and he delivers on his promise, and I don't see why he wouldn't, it would be history-making. An aside, Barry, who is a noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.tulane.edu/cov19-barry-video&quot;&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;, says it has been proven that Wilson got the 1918 flu. He theorizes that the terrible deal that Germany got was due to Wilson's flu, and if he had not gotten ill, maybe Germany wouldn't have gone fascist?

It's hard for me to see the connection between the two. In one episode in Season 2 Moira is frantically looking for nude pictures of herself taken when she was younger. For most of the show you think she wants to find them so she can take them down, but no. She wants to be sure they're there. She wants to still be, in some sense, the actress we knew as &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=delia+deetz&amp;t=hx&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&quot;&gt;Delia Deetz&lt;/a&gt; (Moira plays a former actress, btw). Her advice to Stevie, a super cute young supporting character, is to make sure to take lots of pictures of herself now when she's young. No matter how you think you're not very beautiful, when you're older you will see all the beauty you can't see now. I'm about the same age as Catherine O'Hara, the actress, and I want to say I totally concur. I can't believe how beautiful I was when I was younger, but of course I didn't see it then.

Then they shut down Google Reader. The people who were reading my blog and others before RSS, lost track of the feeds they were reading in Google Reader. There were other choices, but that doesn't change what happened. We are rebuilding slowly, because blogging is still a useful form of communication. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt; is the best way to get it, probably always was, even in the heyday of RSS.

(Note to the Substack devs, there should be permalinks on sub-sections of the web versions of newsletters, so I can point directly to the bit I'm talking about. Might as well put them in the email versions too.) Naughton says there was a point in human evolution when we decided we were above nature, and that's when things started to go wrong. It's why we think we can return to some kind of normal once the pandemic is over. But every time we try, we hit a wall resulting in more suffering and death. I've observed something similar. Our troubles with the environment started some time in the last 100 years when, through technology, we were able to make our presence felt on the ecosystem to the point where human activity could melt the polar icecaps. So in a destructive sense, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; above nature, but it's not a good survival strategy. In fact, we live infinitesmally short lifespans on an insignificant speck of dust in space, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html#3&quot;&gt;delusions&lt;/a&gt; of grandeur, when the best we can achieve, which is pretty good, is friendship, love and to a small extent, self-awareness.

But we were raised to believe it's the rest of the world that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/6967/why-off-his-rocker&quot;&gt;off its rocker&lt;/a&gt;." created="Sun, 02 Aug 2020 16:06:14 GMT" type="outline"/>

So many questions. What's his cut. Did Microsoft agree to limit criticism of Trump on the new TikTok. How does the US government control it vs China.

Will loyalty to Trump be part of the terms of service for a US-owned TikTok? I can't imagine China would object. " created="Sat, 01 Aug 2020 16:06:17 GMT" type="outline"/>
