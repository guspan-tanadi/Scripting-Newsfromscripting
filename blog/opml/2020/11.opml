Still, it had HBO production values, acting, that part they do so well. I don't know what it is but HBO has a look and feel and the artists know how to be part of it. The story was utterly unbelievably lame. They copied an interesting Law &amp; Order plot, it actually &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the plot of an episode of L&amp;O, and stretched it out to six fucking hours. There was one interesting plot twist, no spoilers. Also if they had cut the last episode off before it got ridiculous, I might have had a kind word for it. I've rated it a :fire: over on BingeWorthy. Only the second such show. Somehow they got me to watch to the end. I guess it was kind of relaxing. " created="Mon, 30 Nov 2020 15:20:02 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Trump never tried to get re-elected. He threatened so many Americans' sense of what's right, of what America is, it's remarkable he didn't lose by more. It's similar imho to the approach of journalism. They have no responsibility for their declining business. They insist, over many years, that the tech industry owes them money. Somehow it never occurred to them that what tech provides is what people want. They don't listen so how could they know? And they don't bend or they would have provided something better than Google, Facebook et al. Now they're doing what Trump is doing. Asking someone to undo their loss. Like Trump they could study their predicament and learn what they need to do differently. Unlike Trump they are still in business." created="Mon, 30 Nov 2020 20:21:19 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="There's a controversy on Twitter, a disagreement between tech and journalism as to whether people and companies should speak for themselves. The reporters generally say it's &quot;tone deaf&quot; to do so -- the reporters are going to nail you anyway. That's such nonsense. We do so many things, create so much good, and reporters' ability to judge it is so limited. Paul Graham, who I rarely agree with (sorry) said something I totally agree with, citing several founders. It's a familiar theme to readers of this blog. [%search: Sources Go Direct%]. Here's what I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1332591551508262912&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;My own experience supports Paul Graham's advice. If you depend on journalism to let you do the great thing you’re doing, if they didn’t think of it first it’ll never happen. By going around them I was able to make blogging and podcasting happen. Create the media you need.&quot; That last sentence may be another motto in the making.

				<outline text="I'm in the middle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undoing_(miniseries)&quot;&gt;The Undoing&lt;/a&gt;, an HBO miniseries. It's not terrible. After the second episode I wondered if it was worth it, so I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1332490159955308555&quot;&gt;asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and was told other people felt the same. But there's a quality to HBO dramas that you don't see elsewhere. The stars, acting, music, everything is first-rate, even the writing, even if the plot is just so-so. The series finale is tomorrow night. I expect there will be a surprise in the end, if not, the time won't have been totally wasted. Nicole Kidman is fun to watch, and Donald Sutherland, who plays her father, is still Donald Sutherland. I have a theory about who really dunnit, but no spoilers. :rocket:" created="Sat, 28 Nov 2020 14:17:22 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="In a way it's a shame the vaccines are coming, because if they weren't, we would have to learn to trust and work together, all of us, without exception. The virus would be like AIDS, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_HIV/AIDS&quot;&gt;transformed sexuality&lt;/a&gt; in the 80s and 90s. There wasn't much of a &quot;safe sex&quot; concept before AIDS. Back then, if we were as crazy as we are now, people would say &quot;it's my right not to wear a condom. You're infringing on my civil liberties!&quot; A condom to protect against STDs is fairly analogous to wearing a mask to protect against Covid. There is no vaccine for AIDS, roughly 40 years later. So we had to transform and learn new societal norms. We apparently will not have to do that for Covid-19. Shame. Because we really do need to learn how to work each other, for many other reasons. This is not the last crisis we're going to be facing collectively, and a new understanding of what our rights are is called for.

It's really weird but since the pandemic started, I've had this huge appreciation for what a fine bit of engineering it is. For a relatively big car it handles really well, esp driving on muddy dirt roads, which I do every day. It has more headroom than any car I've owned, which is cool because my torso is huge. In most cars, designed for normal-size people, I hit my head getting in, and have to scrunch my body uncomfortably just to fit. I sail in and out of the Forester, and I can sit any way I want. You'd be amazed how important this is. It also has technological flourishes which while not as flashy as a Tesla, still blow my mind. For example, the car likes to stay in lane. You could have a collision if you really insist, but you would know you were doing it. Very rational design. But the biggest thing is this -- for a civilization that is tottering on the edge of oblivion in so many ways, if this is the pinnacle, the highest point we ever reach, I have to say, well done human species.

Short version. Trump is repeatedly stinking up the room, hoping to negotiate a deal where he is able to walk away, rich and with his head held high (in his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/09/07/160755.html?title=trumpolini&quot;&gt;Trumpolini&lt;/a&gt; style), to live to fight another day.

But usually the impactful products develop over time, maybe that's because to be a great product you need a quiet period to adapt to how people use your product. Right now I'm thinking about the way ISPs are gradually moving away from the server model to the app model, as pioneered by Heroku. I still plan to look at Digital Ocean's new offering. I have used [%search: Glitch%] and of course [%search: Heroku%]. Glitch is free, can't beat that price, but you wonder if it's just an introductory offer? Heroku's per-app price was way too high, made it diseconomic, which is unfortunate because it was so much more rational a model than managing your own servers, which is what I've been doing since switching off Heroku. All this is part of a larger thread that maybe it's time to move away from static sites because net apps are being successfully commoditized.

Unlike my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomwatson&quot;&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who is beyond impatient for the networks to call the election, I'm glad that it's stretching out. I wish the 2008 election had been similarly extended so we could have had a chance to absorb the change gradually.

					<outline text="For example, Covid is raging. Growing exponentially. We're doing nothing to resist it. The example Trump set during the campaign, all those awful rallies, more awful because they were such good entertainment, is probably responsible for a good portion of the growth. I heard on the news that there's a high correlation between regions hardest-hit by the virus and those that voted for Trump. They see it as a conundrum, but it's obvious what the connection is. People who live in Trump Country don't see the virus as a threat. That's gotta be one of the biggest indicators. People who don't feel threatened by it are probably more likely to get it." created="Sat, 07 Nov 2020 15:20:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay so here's something people don't like to say out loud. But obviously the Trump election was a reaction to the Obama election. The yin to the yang. People who don't like uppity presidents (ie blacks) probably don't care for presidents who don't know their place is in the home (ie women). They thought Trump was the perfect way to say Fuck You Try Again Assholes. Let Trump drive them crazy. Smart. It sure did that.

					<outline text="Nate Silver is openly trying to figure out what happened with the polls. He seems glad that this is being drawn out too. Consider maybe the electorate was a moving target, and the polls, with all their heuristics couldn't pick that up. Things were seesawing with Trump in October. First he's in the hospital, looking frail, sick with Covid, possibly dying. That can't have been good for his polling. Then he recovers, is full of energy, pumped up on steroids, holding his normal now murderous rallies, and the Dems were holding drive-in embarrassments. &lt;i&gt;He juiced his base in late October, and it worked. &lt;/i&gt;It got people to think &quot;Hey hun, the old Trump is back,&quot; the virus didn't get him, look at the fun, and they switched their vote. They could, because Trump told them not to mail in their ballots. I think, net-net, people are being too hard on the polls, and too hard on the statisticians at the networks.

					<outline text="While the campaign was still on, I didn't want to criticize the Dems for their rallies, which were basically impossible to watch. They must've been even worse to be a speaker at. You take a gifted campaigner like Obama, who could get into a lovefest with an audience, he had so many good lines like Don't Boo, Vote. The crowd would boo just to get him to say it! Or he'd say &lt;i&gt;Fired up! &lt;/i&gt;and everyone would scream &lt;i&gt;Ready to go! &lt;/i&gt;Even watching the rallies on TV would get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin&quot;&gt;love chemicals&lt;/a&gt; to flow through your blood. But the drive-in rallies, while the idea seemed cute and innovative, as an idea, were, in practice, embarrassing. I kept wondering if the Dems could have done something like what the NBA and MLB did, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportscasting.com/theres-a-surprising-amount-of-tech-behind-the-nbas-fake-crowd-noise/&quot;&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/09/05/baseball-fake-crowd-nosie&quot;&gt;crowd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/the-invisible-crowd-inside-the-nfls-fake-crowd-noise-system/2381799/&quot;&gt;noise&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone knew they were fake, but you didn't mind. Even though a basketball game with no crowd noise is actually kind of nice, as at a small college game, not having a crowd cheering and booing at the right times during the NBA Finals and the World Series would have been awful.

					<outline text="So the Repubs cut the corner, and went ahead and had viral-spreading events in the form of end-game political rallies. And they were wonderful. Trump, like Obama, really is in his element in those rallies. Once, because of a stubborn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaaltv.com/rochester-minnesota-news/president-trump-campaign-rally-rochester-october-30/5911428/&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_Minnesota&quot;&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, he had to give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/10/30/trump-rallies-in-rochester-with-spillover-from-250-capacity-showing-support-outside/&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; to a socially distanced group of 250 people, and his heart wasn't in it, and he left early. So the Repubs cheated. I think that's where a lot of his votes came from. If the campaign had ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsGqrLkmFMU&quot;&gt;Trump on the balcony&lt;/a&gt;, febrile, gasping for air and weak, pulling of his mask, then we would have gotten the Biden/Harris landslide that the polls predicted." created="Thu, 05 Nov 2020 14:07:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The really awful part is that the pundits, idiots, one and all, are ignoring the context of this election. As if it were a normal election where the candidates were playing on something of a level playing field. They weren't. The Repubs sacrificed hundreds of lives, and thousands of peoples' health and helped spread the virus that was already spreading uncontrollably. They weren't rallies for the presidency as much as they were rallies for the virus. Come get sick, and btw, also see the president dance. The people would have come out, just as much, for Obama and his mantras, or him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzXcNgCr0nk&quot;&gt;brushing the dirt&lt;/a&gt; off his jacket, or just looking like the stud he is. Or Biden telling stories of his lost family, and how great America still is, and how it'll all come back as soon as he's in the Oval. But they didn't, and that was the right thing to do. And the pundits, who really do need to be fired, are ignoring the whole thing, and pretending the Dems are out of touch, when they were totally committed to the reality that there is a deadly pandemic that is happening at the same time as the election." created="Thu, 05 Nov 2020 14:09:45 GMT"/>

Very depressing. Oh shit. This feels like 2016, I said -- as did everyone else watching the returns. I started nodding off around 9PM and finally decided to go to bed at 10, and woke up at 1AM, and went looking to see how things had turned out and I literally screamed out loud when I saw Trump was ahead in Wisconsin.

No I didn't watch his campaign rally in the White House, and yes, I have heard it quoted, and yes, he is trying to be a dictator, and no doubt his voters will listen and believe him, and will drive their cars around running people off the road, and they might even kill people, but we're already dying in great numbers, so what the fuck difference would that make. Here's what getting rid of Trump means. Goodbye Bill Barr. Hello Paris Climate Treaty and let's get back together with the Iran deal. Let's start playing to win in international trade instead of just abdicating and sounding tough. And btw, let's get the babies out of those prisons, find their parents or at least get them into a home-like situation. And then think about all the things Trump won't be able to do if he's just a private citizen. Yes, he can be a first class asshole, and have rallies, but he will also be tried and probably convicted and go to jail.

					<outline text="So here's something I write every time a Republican wins, even though this time a Republican didn't win. We need to organize on a permanent persistent basis. It's not enough to ask for our money and phone banking at election time. We the non-elites have to be part of governing. You don't get to just ask for our money every four years and then say thanks now go away. We need to be part of this. Luckily we have this great technology that enables this, and we need to use it. Howard Dean was on the right track in 2004, but there was no follow-through (and of course he didn't even get nominated). Facebook and Twitter et al aren't the only models. We can create new media where people get to participate and where spamming means nothing. Today's networks are set up in a way that makes the most money for advertisers. We can set up networks that are great for governing and organizing. Until we do things will just keep getting worse. " created="Wed, 04 Nov 2020 14:42:38 GMT"/>

It took a real dive when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/us/politics/fbi-hillary-clinton-email.html&quot;&gt;Comey&lt;/a&gt; announced he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insider.com/lone-fbi-agent-reopened-hillary-clinton-investigation-2019-10&quot;&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; emails found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner&quot;&gt;Anthony Weiner's&lt;/a&gt; laptop. Nate Silver said, in the aftermath of the election, when people complained about the polls, that Trump had a greater than 30% chance of winning. A baseball player who hits .300 is a pretty good hitter. 30% ain't zero. That said Comey &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; it 30%. The odds were a lot lower before his announcement." created="Sun, 01 Nov 2020 15:09:52 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/11/hillaryClinton.png"/>
				<outline text="Trump is a troll, and trolls thrive on novelty. They always have to be increasing the rage. From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/trolls/&quot;&gt;Trolling howto&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Immunity to outrage builds up over time. What pissed people off six months ago will barely show up as a blip today. Luckily for Trump as he rises in stature, from poll-leader, to presumptive nominee, to one of two possible Presidents, his tweets automatically get more outrageous, because now they have half the weight of the office of POTUS behind them.&quot; Four years later his stature has not increased, and the tweets are just as crude. So his trolling juice doesn't work this time. No one cares.

				<outline text="I wish I had a big Pause button, let's just hold here for a while. I'm more comfortable living in limbo than knowing the outcome of Tuesday's election. I'm sure everyone feels the same. I don't have any advice. Maybe buy something sinful and consume it with wild abandon. Or maybe read up on emigration out of the US, or painless ways to end it all.

				<outline text="I finally understand what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; means in programming, and of course, I've been doing it from the beginning of my programming career. Get something working, try it out, learn from it, perhaps go in a different direction, but always checking what I'm doing by using it and listening to users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor&quot;&gt;Mitch Kapor&lt;/a&gt;, who I learned a lot from at Personal Software in the early 80s, worked this way. I ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext&quot;&gt;Living Videotext&lt;/a&gt; on these principles. Everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; did was developed this way. Now that I understand what it means, I might try to factor all the writing that's out there about it into a few words that explain the difference. I once encountered &lt;i&gt;anti-agile&lt;/i&gt; development in a company where the software was developed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://dod.defense.gov/&quot;&gt;DoD&lt;/a&gt; procedures. Their philosophy was design the whole thing up front and give pieces of the project to different groups of programmers, who never saw the full spec, so no one knew what they were working on. The company went out of business very quickly. The team went on to form the core of another company, which also went out of business, each time because the product widely missed the mark." created="Sun, 01 Nov 2020 14:54:08 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/11/01/lizLemon.png"/>
