				<outline text="Ultimately imho the only form of protest that works is what Killer Mike &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rapfJYfPU38&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in his speech. Kick their asses in the voting booth." created="Sun, 31 May 2020 14:52:49 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="We, and the world don't understand something really important. The United States is nothing like the country it was a few years ago. There's been so much change -- it's not reversible. There was still a little hope if nothing changed too much before the November election that we might possibly start to recover in January next year, but a couple of things happened that make that impossible now: 1. Barr. 2. Covid-19. We're way down &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...#Text&quot;&gt;Martin NiemÃ¶ller's list&lt;/a&gt;. It's not just people of color that are under attack. The other day the president tweeted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/28/trump-retweets-video-saying-only-good-democrat-is-dead-democrat/&quot;&gt;the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat&lt;/a&gt;. Life is very cheap now. 100K people died of a preventable pandemic in the last few months and more that number will die before the election. People who are alive right now. Some who are perfectly healthy, privileged, white. When he talks about dead Democrats, listen. Yes, most of the dead are poor people and people of color. But also enough whites and people of priviledge for us all to feel it now. That's a very profound change, it must not be overlooked. But we cling to the same news system. We value the opinions of people who are heavily invested in the pre-Trump-Covid world. People who naturally tell the story of how we will return to what we were. I just got a heavy dose of that watching just a few minutes of the Sunday news on CNN and MSNBC. But we will not be going back to anything like what we were. We need to get in the moment, and get into &quot;save my life&quot; mode for all of us. The protests of the last few days are an impossible dream, you can see that in the police reaction. If we're going not be completely devastated, we need new thinking. I thought the two speeches I linked to yesterday were an excellent start. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rapfJYfPU38&quot;&gt;Killer Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PabloPerezA/status/1266286333607071745&quot;&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; and one more, Atlanta mayor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g&quot;&gt;Keisha Lance Bottoms&lt;/a&gt;.

Click the button and I pay the price, read the article. No spyware, no ads, nice big font. It's in my story list so I can go back and re-read it any time. This requires a centralized payment system, it could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.com/&quot;&gt;Scroll&lt;/a&gt; or something similar to it. The tech is not a problem, the problem is the news orgs giving users what they want. Now questions come up -- what's the price? The news orgs set the price. They have to experiment. They could run specials. They could drop the price to $0 after a story has reached a certain threshold, giving readers a further incentive, to help a story they think is important to circulate. Lots of possibilities. We should get on this train asap. " created="Fri, 29 May 2020 13:56:26 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/29/train.png"/>

				<outline text="Old TV shows had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track&quot;&gt;laugh track&lt;/a&gt; that simulated audience applause and laughter.

As a little kid, I thought they must have little microphones in the TVs, maybe only some of them (not mine of course) and they could pick up the sounds made by people at home. The laugh track and other audience sounds were real, little Dave imagined. So you gotta wonder why they don't do actually that for &lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/2020/05/27/sports-poll-fans-prefer-natural-sound-in-telecasts/&quot;&gt;live sports events&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming seasons for basketball, baseball, hockey, football, etc -- when there won't be any fans in the stadiums and arenas.

The second season is nicely done, has a Mr Robotish feel, there's a constant stream of twists and surprises, it's fun and so far intellectually gratifying, and it reviews the plot of season 1 as it goes. We have an inkling of how it will end because the first episode is about how it ends, or so we are led to believe. I don't know otherwise because I still have a few episodes to go. But nothing in this show is a straight line, and as I said it's well done. I especially like the end of each episode. They end with a twist, but they stay wtih the scene as the credits roll.

						<outline text="&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular developer platform with set of common libraries called packages. It's based on JavaScript which is a very popular language. And its power comes from the very deep set of freely usable code you can build on. That part is the reason why I switched to JavaScript in 2013. I wanted to tap into the work of all the other developers using Node. That it was JavaScript was incidental, and honestly the Node platform had nothing to do with it, because at the time I switched I had little idea what it was." created="Sat, 23 May 2020 16:57:28 GMT"/>

The word &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html&quot;&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; implies stability.

But since Node is used to make servers and one thing servers do a lot of is call other servers to get information, and request is pretty much the only way to do that, you'd have to say even if it isn't the most popular package, it certainly is one of the most important. If you were to remove request almost all Node apps would break. And that is exactly what they're doing. It won't work. I'm sure of it. And they don't know it yet. But they'll find out.

						<outline text="Back in the late 90s when we were working on a new version of &quot;Frontier&quot;, we were generating a lot of new routines for developers to call. We had packages of routines called suites, and as we were generating them we didn't know which package an individual routine would go in when the new version was finalized. So we created a temporary package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+toys&quot;&gt;toys&lt;/a&gt;, disclaimed it would be deprecated before we shipped. We gave it a silly name so people would remember it was doomed. I said to devs, don't depend on anything in toys being there after we ship. Well, as promised, when it came time to ship, we sorted all the routines in toys to their permanent homes and deleted toys. Everything broke. Everything. The outcry was so loud and angry that we put toys back. The lesson is this, when you ship something to developers you're stuck with it, so be sure you can live with it when you ship. You have to live with your mistakes too. Clearly the Node developers think &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/request&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; is a mistake.

Well it was a huge setback for Font Awesome and it got users (like me) to fear upgrading to new versions. If they want to improve their product, Dave and his company learned, they would have to add functionality, they can never take functionality out.

Having a common syntax for programming cuts costs, makes it easier and therefore more likely to share ideas, and avoid the setbacks that come from reinventing the wheel.

It takes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;worse-is-better&lt;/a&gt; language to be the consensus.

This has gotten us into huge trouble over the years, for example with the buildup to the Iraq War, where they carried Bush Administration lies, unopposed, never retracted or apologized-for. Then in the 2016 election the fabricated story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy&quot;&gt;Hillary's Emails&lt;/a&gt; was born in the pages of the NYT, constantly repeated and amplified.

There's a new world still to be explored, try to create a great news product out of the net, jump in and stop pretending news works as it did before it went electronic. And get some fresh blood on the op-ed pages. Let's get some real criticism of the Times there, at least. We don't need royalty in the White House and we certainly don't need it in journalism.

In that case I knew the facts. So why not just report the facts, without so much attitude, and let us make up our own minds.

				<outline text="NakedJen and her travels from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali&quot;&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City&quot;&gt;SLC&lt;/a&gt; were a big topic on this blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/03/&quot;&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. I spoke with her three times on that trip, in Bali, Seoul and Seattle. She could have stayed in Seoul. There was some question if the flight she had booked to Seattle would actually go. There was a &quot;last flight&quot; feeling. It would be a different life if she went one way or the other. She decided to let Delta make the choice. If the plane arrived to take her home, she'd go. If not, she'd stay. She's finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nakedjen.com/nakedjen/2020/04/we-are-all-in-this-together.html&quot;&gt;written the story&lt;/a&gt;. She's an awesome writer. Highly recommended. " created="Fri, 01 May 2020 16:04:58 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Feeling really disoriented today. Or maybe the disorentation of life is catching up with me. I've been taking care of business, I'm more organized than ever, it feels more important for some reason. It's pouring rain out, steady downpour, for hours. Normally this would be relaxing, but today it seems weary. Maybe it's the aftermath of the humilty of the fight with Dropbox. But that did clear a lot of the fog about how I manage my apps. Or the despair of Maddow, last night -- and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Lollardfish/status/1256195816215261184&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; I read on Twitter this morning. &quot;The Trump Administration squandered April. As Americans sacrificed and far too many died, Trump watched TV and tried to direct cash to political pals.&quot;" created="Fri, 01 May 2020 15:13:46 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/05/01/pigeon.png"/>

						<outline text="The GitHub integration is still early. The problem is that when you update from a repo, it wipes out all the other files in the project. The data and settings. But that's going to be fixed, he says, and when it is I will be able to connect to a project through the GitHub version.  " created="Fri, 01 May 2020 17:18:53 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Also good to know is that you can change which files cause the app to restart by adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/edit/#!/watch-json?path=README.md%3A1%3A0&quot;&gt;watch.json file&lt;/a&gt; to the project. " created="Fri, 01 May 2020 17:20:53 GMT"/>
