It seemed every presidency had one or two of these, but it was looking like we might not pay the big price for having a child-man with a bad temper in the White House. Well, it's almost hindsight now and worth observing that we did not get away with it. The pandemic is still building, could still explode, and Trump is still playing Pretend President.

I have pictures from my father, of relatives going back one or two more generations, but don’t know anything about them. That’s it. There is no doubt there is privilege in being white. I see it in my own attitudes, inside me. But knowing your ancestors, well that's a very particular kind of privilege that very few people have, imho.

				<outline text="I've never been to Seoul, but thanks to modern tech, a dramatic moment of my life happened in the Seoul airport, earlier this year. NakedJen had gone on vacation to Bali, just as the virus was becoming a world catastrophe. I talked with her over Facetime in Bali and said Jen it's time to come home. She said I know I know. We talked at every step of the trip, from Bali to Seoul to Seattle to Salt Lake. At every stop, there was serious doubt as to whether there would be a flight home. Like Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. In Seoul, she made a wise decision. She'd defer and let Delta Airlines decide if she stayed there to wait out the pandemic or returned home. If there was a flight she'd get on it, if not she'd stay. Last night I had a dream that I was stuck in Seoul, trying to get home. I'd wait in a line, only to find I was no longer in the airport. Seoul was, in my dream, an ideal place full of happy playing children and huge pristine swimming pools. An enormous arcade of pinball machines. Why are there so many? Promenades with people in formal attire, out for a walk on a spring afternoon, with umbrellas, or reading old-style newspapers. All surrounding the airport. In the airport were people I knew in Silicon Valley in the 80s and 90s, familiar and friendly, as if we had been friends ever since. I don't usually write about dreams on my blog, but this one was so vivid, such a throwback to a tense moment from earlier this year, so what the f. :boom:" created="Wed, 30 Dec 2020 16:10:36 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/06/29/alice.png"/>

				<outline text="If you grew up with parents who acted crazy, having Trump as president seems somewhat familiar, even comforting. It could be worse, you think. It's a dysfunctional feeling, one you can spend years in therapy to uncover, because you bury it so well, as a child. You come to see things from the parent's point of view. You're a bad kid for thinking that your parents are wrong. Even when they were most definitely wrong. " created="Tue, 29 Dec 2020 15:35:51 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="A fallout is that if Biden wants to gain our confidence, he has to first deal with the fact that a substantial number of people, even those who voted for him, are unfamiliar with the idea of a family that is based on love and a feeling that justice is normal or even possible. We may &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; we feel this way, but that's intellectual, at a subconscious level, it just doesn't seem normal, like something you can trust. It'll be as if we're saying to the president, &quot;Look that's very nice, but no one believes you're actually trying to help us. That's just hype. We weren't born yesterday.&quot; It seems as if Biden may actually be someone who isn't totally corrupt. If so, how's he going to get anyone to believe that. A frontal assault is not likely to work. This may be why I'm reluctant to write about Biden, or even listen to him. It was okay when he was just one candidate, or just one senator, or even the vice president. &lt;i&gt;But it's hard to see him as president.  &lt;/i&gt;It's hard to trust that.

I saw that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.net/&quot;&gt;Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; now has a streaming option, with no set top box. I remember before I cut the cable, they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msgnetworks.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt;, which is the broadcast network for the Knicks. So I thought there was a decent chance they had it on their streaming app. " created="Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:31:05 GMT"/>

There was no other way to cancel the trial without calling. The operator was a jerk, raised her voice, tried to upsell, asked me to explain myself, I said I just don't want it, which is a legal reason for cancelling a free trial imho. All of it, the wait, the bad manners must be scientifically proven to drive people to keeping their subscription and even buying more, when they called to cancel. But I wouldn't discuss it.

I know lots of other people say they love it, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/movies/soul-review-pixar.html&quot;&gt;AO Scott&lt;/a&gt; at the NYT. It got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/soul&quot;&gt;85 on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, very high must-see.  One thing I did like is how they portrayed NYC. That was a technical achievement. Maybe they should do movies like that. Star a real-life place. Have normal people just doing stuff there. More mundane. Boy meets girl, perhaps. Pixar movies these days seem to have to bite off so much. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story&quot;&gt;Toy Story&lt;/a&gt; was nice. I liked the story of the old man, a kid, a dog and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)&quot;&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;, and the one about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E&quot;&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; who has to deal with post-apocalyptic Earth.

A message appeared after a while saying that the game was blacked out where I live. Presumably because they want me to pay for something that provides a way to watch the game on local TV. Except since i cut the cord with Spectrum earlier this year, and went with YouTube TV for local stations, I can't get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msg.com/&quot;&gt;MSG&lt;/a&gt; which broadcasts the Knicks locally.

So where I'm at now is paying $65 a month for YTTV and only watching MSNBC and CNN there. Seems pretty steep. Also if I get NBA League Pass, which I'm considering, I'm pretty sure they'd black out access for me for Knicks games too, even though I'd be paying $200 for the season.

One of these fellows is British and the other is an American expat living in Germany. I could respond by blaming the British fellow for Rupert Murdoch, who is enforcing Republican lunacy in the US and elsewhere. I suppose technically he’s Australian, but who cares. Or remind my German friend that Germany is where the Nazis came from, the same ones who menace my country now. He might say he’s really American so it’s not his fault. i won’t do it.

I do have respect for Mike D, and of course Amar'e. But I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/12/23.html#a175501&quot;&gt;feeling&lt;/a&gt; about the NBA this year that isn't too good. It isn't just the Nets, it's also the Lakers, who went from nowhere to champions. The Clippers. Harden. Etc. And Kyrie Irving who was too good to play for the Celtics, I guess. Basketball is a team sport, that's what's beautiful about it to me, but we aren't rooting for teams anymore, the franchises are the players. That's fine, I guess -- good for them, but the only player I've felt loyalty to in the NBA recently is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/12/18/jeremy-lin-signing-with-warriors-g-league-team/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Lin&lt;/a&gt;, and he's playing in the G league for Golden State this year.

I remember during the 90s, being at odds, publicly, with Microsoft. Bill Gates was still CEO. The company had risen to dominance in tech with Windows. Apple was on the edge of going under, or getting acquired and devoured for parts. The web was a source of great potential and optimism, but Microsoft was acting as predator. The web had no defenses. He had billions, and his software was the OS on all the world's computers, except for a few on the web (Mac and Unix machines were more common there early-on). He was going to encircle the web and cut off its air supply. You can read all about it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/index.html#y1996&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of my blog. All the while Gates says he's going to retire soon and spend the rest of his life giving away his money. Something seemed terribly out of balance. Why not start caring for the world now, why wait until the damage is done? So much more leverage now. Why not think bigger than creating a company, how about building a technical foundation that encapsulates all the good stuff we've figured out in the 80s (there was a lot of that) and not charge rent for it. Or at least don't interfere with the rest of us trying to do that. Nope, he persisted, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.&quot;&gt;case and a consent decree&lt;/a&gt;, and a new generation of tech monsters grew up in Microsoft's aftermath, and we're still living in a poisoned ghetto, only it's a lot bigger now. My plea is that once you're worth a billion, there's no value to making more money. Think bigger.

He's right, it is. The more tech owns media, the less truth we'll hear about tech. But I'm waiting for Ben to aim at the incumbent media companies, who we the public, never hear the bad news about, other than the bad news they want us to hear. I remember when this became totally clear to me. A friend who was a tenured reporter at the San Jose Mercury-News had a scoop. He/she was an insider to one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/archives/knight-ridder-newspaper-chain-agrees-to-sale.html&quot;&gt;biggest media buyouts&lt;/a&gt; in history (at the time). I wanted to know when he/she was going to write about it. Never. That opened my eyes to something I should have been able to see much earlier. We never hear about things the media industry doesn't want us to hear. They manipulate and control us. Yet they feel transparent to us, the mere conveyors of information, or so they would have you believe. We need &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/01/03.html#bringingThePressIntoTheStory&quot;&gt;triangulation&lt;/a&gt; here.

Like a lot of other people in tech, I hated Gawker, even though I admire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&quot;&gt;Nick Denton&lt;/a&gt;, its founder, a brilliant man with guts. We became closer when he was getting hammered by the Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan as proxies for Silicon Valley, and he eventually lost Gawker. But I still think Gawker crossed the line of propriety, often, in unnecessary and destructive ways. Occasionally their reporters made up events. And they missed stories that were right in front of them, stories that would have revealed corruption in tech. But. The idea that any billionaire has the ability to shut down any publication at any time -- that's unacceptable. So net-net, I'm in favor of telling the Gawker story. And Apple, btw is the perfect example of a tech company that should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; have a say in what stories get told. " created="Mon, 14 Dec 2020 15:05:09 GMT" type="outline"/>

An example from last night. Trump recorded an unhinged video that they distributed via Facebook. Something anyone can do. You can, I can, anyone. This feature has been used in some amazing ways. A woman recorded her boyfriend being &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile&quot;&gt;murdered by police&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis using Facebook's live video. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/10/1368.html&quot;&gt;remarkable&lt;/a&gt; and I think even a journalist Facebook-hater would have to admit, revolutionary. The whole point of &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; on Facebook is that &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; can do it. What Maddow said: &quot;Facebook would run it.&quot; Technically true, but irresponsibly misleading. She repeated it as she often does, with pauses and a look that was withering in contempt for Facebook. Her implication was that Fox wouldn't run it, Newsmax wouldn't run it, but Facebook, super slime that they are, would. There's an honest way to explore this, the way she does with other things she isn't expert on, have a discussion one night the tradeoffs of allowing anyone to post live video. But -- I what I really resent is that Maddow, who I want to believe is doing the best she can, in this case is misusing that trust and it makes me doubt the stuff she reports where I don't know enough to see through the bullshit.

I've never used Asana -- I don't qualify, but apparently it's used for managing projects the way I described. I have used Trello. What I described apparently is &quot;Agile&quot; -- which, to me, means paying attention to how your product is used and making it better based on what you learn. Scrum is where you apply what you learned when being agile. I've always done this, made software for myself first, paid attention as it was used by myself and then others, and devised methods to get users to tell me more about their experience. Interestingly the BTQ itself is a form of agile, I'm trying to learn how to evolve &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com/&quot;&gt;my outliner&lt;/a&gt; to make it better for people doing this kind of work, and to make its advantage more obvious." created="Tue, 01 Dec 2020 15:56:23 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/12/01/cloroxWipes.png"/>

				<outline text="OK, here's a free idea. I just read an audiobook written by a living author. I loved the book, and think he's a great writer. The author of the book could say what three books he recommends reading after his book and why they would be good choices. Having just read the book, I have an idea of what I'd like to learn about next. And the author's opinion would have a lot of value. I'd just spent a bit of time reading what they wrote. And of course the author could update the list, change which three books they recommend, and why.  " created="Tue, 01 Dec 2020 16:34:03 GMT" type="outline"/>
