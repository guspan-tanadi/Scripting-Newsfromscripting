				<outline text="Why work on &quot;Radio3&quot; now? I've had it on my list for a long time. It's long overdue for an overhaul. I wrote it when I was new to JavaScript and didn't really understand the rules, it's a weird language and the browser is a very weird runtime environment. But I always seem to find something sexier and more speculative to work on. Programmers notoriously hate to clean up their messes. I'm no different. Then I had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=come-to-Jesus%20moment&quot;&gt;Come to Jesus&lt;/a&gt; moment. I use Radio3 all day every day. I use it on my iPad and iPhone as well as my desktop. It does a lot of my Twitter posts, it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/?tab=links&quot;&gt;Links tab&lt;/a&gt; on scripting.com, and the links section of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/email/&quot;&gt;nightly email&lt;/a&gt;. It's an important piece of software. Staring me right in the face. Improving it could make everything better. And making it easier to work on the code means I could add improvements in the future.

					<outline text="Reading tea leaves and being a basically positive person, even when it might not make sense, I think what happened with Pence and masks is that the Repubs in the Senate are shitting their pants over the virus, and said to Trump you can keep trying to stoke race hate if you want, but Pence has to take over the virus and start actually trying to fight it and support the states, and stop undermining Repub governors. Trump said &quot;Whatever&quot; and Pence started, slowly, trying to do this job. Meanwhile get Governor Cuomo in there as a Guest President, and he can run the US effort against the virus, on loan from the Democratic Party.

				<outline text="In the meantime, I think I found what was screwing up my new server. &quot;nodeStorage&quot; has a feature, that by default is enabled, where it checks with the GitHub repository every 15 minutes and downloads changes. It doesn't restart the app, so you don't see the effect of changes until you restart. The apps are running in the new version of PagePark that has Forever integrated. The way it knows which JavaScript file to run is via the &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt; attribute in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/package.json&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how this goes wrong. At some point, the app checks with GitHub, sees that its version of package.json is different from the on the repo, and downloads it, replacing the one I customized. Ooops. That version does not have a &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt; attribute. So next time I launch PagePark, which I am doing a lot of these days as I debug it and add features, the nodeStorage-based apps don't run. Vexing little bug. The feature should probably default to off. Thing is, when you implement a clever feature like this you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; it to default true. Then, years later it bites you in the ass. That my friends is the way programming works, when it doesn't work. :boom: " created="Sat, 27 Jun 2020 17:53:26 GMT" type="outline" image="http://scripting.com/images/2020/03/19/beet.png"/>

It's exaclty what the CDC says to do. &quot;This is going to hurt,&quot; Trump reads off the teleprompter, &quot;but we'll get through it together.&quot; Then guess where his approval rating would be? 95%.

					<outline text="In most of the answers to &lt;i&gt;What Is It? &lt;/i&gt;you could summarize it by saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better&quot;&gt;Worse Is Better&lt;/a&gt;. In every category, given a choice between elegance and simplicity, performance and ease of use, JavaScript picks the worst of the options. And since worse is better, that's good! That's why it wins. It doesn't worry about being better, does it work, if so, let's use it and go forward. " created="Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:26:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Let's go back to the beginning when Marc Andreessen didn't (presumably) want Java to run away with the web. That's the position Java had, and they were pressuring Netscape to bundle it with the browser, and he didn't want to do it, but he had to have something to put in his place. Pretty sure that's why he asked Brendan Eich to write it,  the legendary &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/&quot;&gt;10-day project&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="I would have just called it Netscape. It's so central to everything the company was doing, you could have said -- this is the reason we created the company. The web is the UI, and that's important, but the real power is the network behind it, and that network is defined by the language, and this here is the language. It would have given Java a run for the money, probably would have pushed it closer to Microsoft (that's a whole other story) but long term, it would have worked.

					<outline text="I was asked on Twitter why I want this. There are all kinds of overhead, time, space, and intellectual.

				<outline text="I missed the anniversary again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#When:7:55:32AM&quot;&gt;18 years ago yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I quit smoking. The number of cigarettes I've had since, zero. Not one. Yet I still sometimes dream that I'm a smoker, buying packs of Marlboro Lights on the sly, feeling guilty that I'm lying to my friends when secretly I'm still a smoker. I quit smoking because the arteries on my heart were so clogged that they didn't work anymore. I had to get blood vessels from my legs and chest transplanted to bypass the blockages. These continue to work to this day, keeping me alive, riding my bike, writing software and blog posts that seem to make some people happy and piss other people off but are ignored by almost everyone. Makes sense. Anyway, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2002/06.html#smoking&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; on my blog a few days after I quit. &quot;I figured something out in the hospital. I'm the kind of person who likes to solve problems by smoking. How do I know this? Because every time my mind encounters a problem it says &quot;OK, I'll just have a cigarette then.&quot; I bet a lot of other cigarette smokers deal with problems the same way. Now that I don't smoke, I still have the idea that smoking will help me deal with problems. It's funny, one part of my brain has figured out that this is wrong (in fact smoking causes more problems than it solves) but a deeper part of my brain still believes it. This leads to some funny arguments inside my brain. But so far so good. I got to go through the worst of the withdrawal in a hospital where there was no possibility of smoking, and now the craving seems manageable. No doubt other people have smoking stories to tell. I was one of the lucky ones, I survived to tell my story.

PagePark has a very simple idea of what a website is, it's a sub-folder of the &lt;i&gt;domains&lt;/i&gt; folder. The name of the sub-folder is the domain that maps to that content. The aha was realizing that you could also put a Node app, to be managed by Forever, which is a package you can integrate into an app, in one of those folders too. Not only did it work at a technical level, but it also provides Frontier-like integration. It's very nice. I've been managing apps in this little world for a couple of weeks now.

Some people find promises more readable. There are some problems that are unwieldy with callbacks that are simpler with promises. There are already packages that have cast aside callbacks and only use promises in their APIs. If I need to use those packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/177#issuecomment-643828855&quot;&gt;I will use&lt;/a&gt; their promises-based API. No choice. My two cents. I wouldn't have supported this addition to the language. I much prefer tech that adds functionality in a clear understandable way. I would prefer if we could put our effort into (for example) making Dropbox work on Linux. Everywhere you look systems we depend on are in disrepair. It's like the way NYC worked when I was in high school. Burned out neighborhoods that people still live in. At some point you have to start thinking about the size and shape of the community you're serving and focus on making the language work better, not making it more complex. I still think there should be a JavaScript option to bury the synchronization functionality in the runtime, and let people write code in the natural way they do in pretty much every other language.

I contributed $25 so I could find out what contributors got. Did it ever amount to anything? TheC didn't make sense, didn't come close to earning the universal acclaim it got, or the money they raised from the people. They claimed they would open a new kind of news org in America, and when they met their money-raising goal said that was never their intention. The problem with snake oil pitches like The Correspondent, aside from the fact that they're dishonest, is that they suck resources away from ideas that might actually make news work better. This happened repeatedly in tech. A famous successful tech entrepreneur claims to have found a breakthrough, and the press gets all excited. It sucks up all the money and attention that might have gone to products that could really have helped, and then they do it again and again. People should be suspicious of grand claims, no matter who is making them. And if you, an analyst, really think you've found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUN1ClT9i9w&quot;&gt;The One&lt;/a&gt;, you should get opinions from friends before you stake your rep on it.

To me the process of writing on your blog, if it isn't fluid, it isn't doing its job. By fluid I mean this. I have an idea. Count the steps before the idea appears on your blog and how complex the steps are. The more steps the more likely you'll lose your way, and find it hard to get back to what you were doing. You respond by skipping it altogether next time, the idea is lost. You can engineer fluidity, the same way you can optimize for other attributes. But most blogging software doesn't imho even try.

					<outline text="Changing a core routine like pad is tricky. If you change its functionality, you potentially break code that calls it. If it's been around a while, who knows all the places it has been called. However in this case, that's not an issue, because any call that has undefined as the value of the first parameter is going to fail. So it's already broken, therefore you can't break it and therefore it's okay to fix it. :rocket:" created="Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:23:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then the question is if it's &lt;i&gt;desirable&lt;/i&gt; to fix it in pad, or in the place that calls it that causes the app to fail. For me that's a no-brainer. It would clutter up every call if we don't put it in the function. The whole point of factoring like this is to trade off a tiny bit of time for space and reduced complexity. Factoring is a good thing, and you should do it whenever it's responsible. Remember what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/X00063BF6/&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; said. Basically factoring is good, but don't do too much. " created="Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:24:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I call this coding technique &lt;i&gt;defensive driving. &lt;/i&gt;It's something you do in case the other driver (the caller) screws up. You want to prevent the accident. Most of the time it won't accomplish anything, but when it does, it saves you from a crash. One less thing to worry about." created="Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:30:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So here's the new version of pad, with the defensive driving code added:" created="Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:26:17 GMT" flCodeSubs="true">

He likens his publication to a huge battleship steaming along, and describes critics as swimmers throwing dead fish at the ship. Of no consequence. The ship will go where it wants to go, as fast as it cares to. Fast forward to the NY Times in 2020, being forced to listen to their reporters, a new class of critic. They say we might personally be hurt by this thing you did. And no one stops to notice that there are millions of other people who would be hurt, and the Constitution (which makes the idea of a news org possible), and a way of life. Not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediagazer.com/200607/p6#a200607p6&quot;&gt;all the tweets&lt;/a&gt;, op-eds, blog posts, no one sees the problem.
