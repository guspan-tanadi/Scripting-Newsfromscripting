It's a smart way to share your favorites, and it also helps spread the word about BingeWorthy, which is nice.

It somehow has retained all its stupidity through Trump's first term, and most voters still don't know this election is about autocracy. How can we depend on this idiotic elitist superior ridiculous industry to save our asses. Yet they totally control discourse in our political system. End of op-ed.

But nothing obvious emerged. Some were programs I had already tried, but didn't get far enough into to rate in my BingeWorthy &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;.

Yet, the inner child in both of them simply wants to connect. Age has many beautiful gifts but one we could live without is the pride and resentment we hold onto when we have conflicts with others. The forgiving, free spirit of children is our true nature. Remember this when you feel stubborn.&quot;" created="Thu, 29 Oct 2020 15:11:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't agree. Sometimes the right thing to do is to set pride to the side and renew the friendship. The child always wants to, but the adult also has a valid and important, not foolish, contribution to make -- safety. " created="Thu, 29 Oct 2020 15:00:57 GMT" flBulletedSubs="true">
						<outline text="The child can have the impulse to connect unconditionally, because there is an adult to put the brakes on if there is real danger. The child can't exist without the adult. When we are children, the adult must be external. Later in life we will be both the child and the adult." created="Thu, 29 Oct 2020 15:01:34 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The child, as the sculpture illustrates, wants to connect, but the adult isn't ready. It's possible that they've reconciled many times, and every time the same thing happens. That's also a pattern of humanity. So the adult is constrained by memory. The adult might narrate: &quot;I remember this person hurt me the last time I trusted them. Every time I trusted them. So as much as the child wants to reconcile, I can't. At some point it's wrong to trust.&quot;" created="Thu, 29 Oct 2020 15:02:22 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Respect isn't something you earn, respect is the default. Respect is listening to who the person really is, versus the story you've projected on them.

					<outline text="I understand this idea really well myself because I've always been projected on. I was raised by parents who judged me by their impression of who I was.

					<outline text="The world does it too, sometimes very openly. I spoke at a conference in 2019 where I was heckled as being a person of privilege.

When approaching an oncoming car on this narrow lane, at first, when I was a newbie to the neighborhood, I’d do the neighborly thing and move to the right to make room. Always, the other car wouldn’t budge, so I’d have to pull off the road and slow to a stop. I found this frustrating of course, an example of selfish, Republican-like behavior.  " created="Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:02:09 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Then I altered my procedure. When I saw a car approaching, I would still move off the to right, but if they didn't mirror my move, I'd veer directly into their path. This makes my car look bigger, and more of a threat to them. No need to honk my horn. The action is enough. Immediately, the other car &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; moves to the side, and I then move to my side, and we pass each other, both fully on the road, and going at normal speed.

				<outline text="Started a web and voice conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.andrewshell.org/rethinking-blogs/&quot;&gt;Andrew Shell&lt;/a&gt; about ideas for rethinking blogs and feeds. I found, as others have, that I need another kind of document to include in my personal CMS other than a story that's part of the blog. Everything about blogs are set up to be written, then lightly edited, and never touched again. Like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco&quot;&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt; painting. It's &lt;i&gt;temporal&lt;/i&gt; writing. But there are other things that I want to develop over time, keep coming back to, revising. A few years back I started this.how to hold those docs. It's worked out really well. I wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/googleAndHttp/&quot;&gt;Google and HTTP&lt;/a&gt; faq as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://this.how/&quot;&gt;this.how&lt;/a&gt; doc. We also had this in &quot;Manila&quot;, right from the start. We wrote, published and maintained the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for Frontier using the same CMS we used for blogging. In the end the data structures are the same, what was confusing is how we think about them. But once you make a decision to put non-temporal docs &quot;over there&quot; then things start working.

I've even given them an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2019/12/16/170209.html&quot;&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; for a very clever no-brainer DNS feature that no one else does, as far as I know. On Sunday I registered a new domain and wasn't able to access it. So I contacted their support, they said they needed permission to go into my account to see how I had it configured. By then the problem had cleared on its own, but it was puzzling why they would need permission. The DNS setup is, by design, totally public info. Anyone could look to see how my domain is set up.  I assumed they were doing that when there have been support issues in the past.

				<outline text="As a Roku user, HBO clearly doesn't want my money. I tried getting HBO as part of Hulu and it's awful.

There are plenty of other brands that have shows that I want to watch and would be willing to pay for, but there's a limit to how many packages I'm going to buy and how many UIs I can learn.

Do you think they're crying because you hurt their feelings? Is that what you're into? Do you also like to hurt yourself? Because the thing the libtard probably is crying about is how you're going to lose your health care, or job, or freedom, in other words how your injured dignity is going to hurt &lt;i&gt;even more.&lt;/i&gt; If you make me sad it isn't because you called me a name, it's because our once-great country has been reduced to jealousy as a popular form of political expression. I wish you were happier with your life, I really do, but I don't think trying to give your pain to others is actually going to make you feel better. I think if anything it'll make you feel worse.

There was a band playing, something lively and Texan, and I was thinking, I wonder if that tree even knows we're here. Can it sense the music, and the people, and the beers, and the relaxed mood? And if it can, what must it think is going on? So it's possible that our souls may not even be in another dimension, they may only exist in a manner that our senses can't detect.
