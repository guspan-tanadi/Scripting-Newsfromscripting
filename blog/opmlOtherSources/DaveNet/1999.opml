			<outline text="#title &quot;Welcome to 1999!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/4/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Getting Started">
				<outline text="This is going to be an incredible year. If there's anything we needed to get done before the new millennium, this is the last minute, there's no time to wait."/>
				<outline text="But I expect we'll also do a lot of looking backward. We've started discussing who the person of the millennium is, and this morning I came across a group of thinkers who are discussing the most important invention of the last two millennia."/>
				<outline text="http://www.edge.org/documents/Invention.html "/>
				<outline text="A summary of nominations. Calculus, hay, anesthesia, computers, the Internet, antibiotics, contraceptives, the spectroscope, the telescope, the theory of evolution, the steam engine, Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, the Hindu-Arabic number system, the scientific method, the printing press, the atom bomb, soap, reading glasses, the human ego."/>
				<outline text="But wait, there's more! Clocks, television, discovery of the unconscious, awareness of the universe, commercialization of electricity, secularism, the eraser, telecommunications, education, automobiles, the symphony orchestra, board games, double-entry accounting, the Gatling gun, the mirror, the number zero, sewers, probability theory, democracy, the airplane."/>
				<outline text="Congratulations to John Brockman and the people at edge.org. This is an incredible source of new thoughts. I highly recommend it to DaveNet readers."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="This year's to-do list">
				<outline text="Here are some of the things I hope to work on this year."/>
				<outline text="Mainly, I want to create a cross-platform writing environment that has the best features of the desktop and the Internet. I want to be able to jot a note on my website using a palmtop computer, and I want to write stories and specs from a laptop, and I want to install server software on machines running behind the more prevalent high-bandwidth fulltime net connected computers and popular desktop OSes such as Windows and Mac."/>
				<outline text="I see a bandwidth gap that needs software to fill it. The interface between web writing tools and web storage is still very low-level and cumbersome. We're going to challenge the assumption that web writing requires technical expertise. We want to deliver tools to the technical types and designers to create inverse portals for writers, places for ideas to appear and then develop, to flow in from all areas and flow out to all interested readers."/>
				<outline text="Further, we've noticed that the web has two primary interfaces: Time and Searching. I can't find another that works as well as either of these two. So we're integrating, assuming, verticalizing. When you can make assumptions, as a software designer, you can simplify. And that's what the web needs, simplification. And that's what we can deliver."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Adult play spaces">
				<outline text="I also hope for a more adult Internet. Sites like www.edge.org show what can be done when there's moderation and thoughtfulness and a little bit of editing. We can learn from each other. The world is not filled with bullshit. There are interesting new ideas, and new perspectives on old ideas. "/>
				<outline text="But it takes calm thoughtful expression to get ideas heard. That's the number one item on my to-do list for the web for 1999, to help more of that to happen, and to support it when it does."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;MacWEEK and Frontier&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/5/98; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="On the opening day of MacWorld Expo in San Francisco, I'd like to make a small Mac-related announcement, certainly nothing of the magnitude that Apple will announce later today, but in our world, it's an important development."/>
				<outline text="MacWEEK, a unit of Ziff-Davis Publishing, has adopted Frontier as its content management platform for its www.macweek.com website."/>
				<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/thea/MacWeek.html "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="There are so many lessons here! ">
				<outline text="First, as we went forward, we stayed customer-driven. Since many of our users are Mac people, it made sense to continue to move the Mac version forward as we moved the Windows product forward. "/>
				<outline text="Second, as a derivative of the above, even though our team is mostly using Windows NT machines to develop, we can move sites like www.macweek.com forward because of the unique cross-platform power that comes from working in a database and scripting environment that's truly cross-platform. When we add a feature to our environment it immediately runs on both Mac and Windows. This is a powerful place to be, giving our community real leverage."/>
				<outline text="And the third lesson is that history is not predictable. Last year many people thought Apple was headed for oblivion. Now the market is restarted. A big publishing company, Ziff-Davis, is making an investment in Mac publishing technology. And it's a good investment, because, as I've been saying for so many years, there are lots of important publishing-oriented things you can do on Macs that you can't do anywhere else."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Thanks!">
				<outline text="Finally, thanks to MacWEEK for trusting us with its web presence. This is an important milestone. We look forward to working with them for many years to come."/>

			<outline text="I could kick myself!">
				<outline text="Around the beginning of the year I almost wrote a piece with a formula for resolving our differences over the impeachment drama that was playing out in Washington."/>
				<outline text="Here's the formula. Everyone pair up with another person. You have to team up with someone who disagrees with you. No more talking to people who share your point of view. For example, James Carville and Ken Starr would have to talk, one-one, no TV cameras, no need to spin. They could yell at each other if they wanted to, but they wouldn't get to resume their lives until they agreed on what to do."/>
				<outline text="And it wouldn't just be the rule for people on TV. All of us would have to do it too. You can't say &quot;I wish it would go away&quot; unless you could say how it should go away. No more running away from this problem. Find someone to buddy up with, and talk and listen, be a juror and a negotiator, get involved and get into agreement."/>
				<outline text="This idea was an outgrowth of my summary statement for 1998. I said that we would never get anywhere in anything we do until we could focus on the things we have in common instead of focusing on the differences. It's as true for the software industry as it is for the US government. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="If not now, when? ">
				<outline text="A few weeks ago, everyone was looking for reinforcement, hearing what they wanted to hear, repeating the same things over and over. This is typical of dysfunction. You can't get anywhere until you really consider alternate points of view, and find a way to give to the other view, and be open to it becoming your point of view."/>
				<outline text="One of the US Representatives said it really well, I thought. The reason the Clinton impeachment was such a divisive issue is because it's gray. I can respect someone who thinks he should stay, because I could imagine myself having that point of view. So it should be possible for it to be a two-way thing. But at the time of the impeachment hearings and vote in the House, no one was listening."/>
				<outline text="Now that process has gone further I realize the issue is not impeachment or removal, it isn't even integrity. It's a wake up call. When will we ever work together? If not now, when? "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="George, Yogi and Carmen">
				<outline text="Yogi Berra is, and always has been, one of my favorite teachers. He and George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees baseball team, were feuding. "/>
				<outline text="Then, ceremoniously, Steinbrenner went to visit Yogi in New Jersey. He offered an apology and a handshake. Yogi took it, and made a joke, in true Yogi fashion. "/>
				<outline text="Quoted in the NY Times, Carmen Berra said: &quot;With the year 2000 coming, everyone is thinking about the future, about peace, about making things right.&quot; "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I took a TV hiatus">
				<outline text="It got very very busy here last week, so I didn't have time to watch the opening of the Senate impeachment trial on TV. But I did have time last night to catch up. I watched Larry King Live and a special report on ABC. An amazing thing has happened. "/>
				<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://graphics.nytimes.com/library/politics/010999impeach.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;"/>
				<outline text="In today's NY Times, a picture shows Edward Kennedy and Phil Gramm, a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican. They got into agreement. On camera last night, Republicans and Democrats were *glowing* in their discovery at how wonderful working together is! "/>
				<outline text="I get a super-charged very positive feeling that maybe, just maybe we're going to do something great. It's not about Clinton's underpants anymore. It's about what we can do if we focus on what we have in common. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's the calendar, stupid">
				<outline text="If you want to know what it's about, just look at the calendar. Out with the old in with the new. There's no reason it has to be business as usual in the new millennium. "/>
				<outline text="When the clock flips over we'll celebrate a new beginning. We're so lucky to be alive now, we have an opportunity to reinvent and redefine human nature, to become much more than we are now."/>
				<outline text="What a brilliant day in the USA! Savor it."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Let's Get Technical!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/12/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Only software politics">
				<outline text="When I write about US government politics some people wince. &quot;That doesn't belong in DaveNet,&quot; they say. Dave is a technical guy. What does he know about integrity and working together? Well, this is technical piece. I hope you're all happy!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="XML-RPC">
				<outline text="As you know, in early 1998 I started writing about XML-RPC, a way to build distributed applications using the standards of the Internet, HTTP and XML. We've had great success with XML-RPC, we deployed in March of last year, and have been building editorial groupware systems on it, routinely, ever since. The technology performs well, it's fast, easy, and very powerful. We also use it in push applications for updating our customers. They love it, and don't even know that they're using a revolutionary technology when they get the latest incremental updates from our server."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Working together">
				<outline text="So even if no other company deploys XML-RPC compatible software, we're happy, it's been very successful. But of course we'd like other developers to build compatibly so our customers can use our respective products with that elusive but much talked of concept -- synergy!"/>
				<outline text="That's why it's so disappointing when another small company comes out with an aggressive new technology positioned against ours and makes no attempt to be compatible with it or even acknowledge it!"/>
				<outline text="Now this silly kind of bickering goes on all the time in the top echelons of the software industry, but why should two small companies, Allaire and UserLand, do this? We shouldn't. It's wasteful and silly. Not a great way to compete. XML was supposed to prevent this kind of thing from happening."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What happened?">
				<outline text="I've been aware of Allaire's WDDX proposal for a few months. I certainly consider it competitive with our XML-RPC spec. When I first heard about WDDX, I thought it would be easy for us to be compatible with it, if it gained traction. No point making a big deal about it until they start doing some marketing. "/>
				<outline text="This afternoon I finally had a chance to read their site, and they attempt to answer the obvious question. How does it compare to XML-RPC? But instead of comparing it to our protocol, they compare it to the (much) more complicated WebBroker protocol from DataChannel. They said theirs is simpler, but that's true only if you ignore UserLand's XML-RPC."/>
				<outline text="We aimed for light-weight, Allaire had the same philosophy. Good idea. But now I want to know why they aren't compatible with our object serialization format? That seems like a reasonable question for them to answer on their FAQ page, but they side-step it, (I guess) hoping the reader won't notice that they don't compare WDDX against the only comparable object serialization format, UserLand's. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.wddx.org/ "/>
				<outline text="http://www.xmlrpc.com/ "/>
				<outline text="I think at least they should point to our spec, and make a statement about it, let people looking at WDDX see that there's an alternative and do a reasonable comparison. And actually, even better, I think we should get together and iron out our differences and come up with an object serialization format we both agree on. That would be powerful. I bet Microsoft and others would pay attention to that."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;To Give Or Not To Give?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/20/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="This passionately evangelical and visionary article, written by my longtime friend Dave Carlick, carlick@igive.com, is about e-commerce and giving. What a surprising combination! "/>
				<outline text="Dave sent it to me, asking what I thought. He probably knew it would resonate, and it sure did. It's a big What If? I asked if I could run it on DaveNet, and he said yes. "/>
				<outline text="I've known Dave for about sixteen years. In his former life as an advertising guy, he helped me launch and market my first company, Living Videotext, and has played an instrumental role in marketing numerous Silicon Valley companies including Netscape, Silicon Graphics, Network General and Synopsys. "/>
				<outline text="He was co-founder of DoubleClick, the first online advertising network, and is now an advisor to venture capitalist, VantagePoint, and a director at International Network Services, I/PRO, CustomerCast, and my latest company, UserLand."/>
				<outline text="The service he describes is http://www.igive.com/. "/>
				<outline text="So here's Dave Carlick on buying stuff on the Internet and its relationship to charity. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="To give, or not to give">
				<outline text="As this new Internet economy develops, markets are recognizing a fundamental gap between the cost structure of molecular (i.e. brick and mortar) businesses and digital businesses, with the advantage going to digital businesses."/>
				<outline text="The stock market has placed huge valuations on this potential differential. Amazon, for example, is valued at 200 times potential revenues in the year 2000, which is an enormous vote of confidence in the leverage these new margins represent. Similar valuations go for Yahoo, eBay, and countless others. It's new money."/>
				<outline text="So far, all the new money is going to the capitalists. Fair enough. They took the risk, they won the reward. And yet here is an entirely new opportunity for charity, enabled by the very technology that is creating all this wealth. These new margins can be, in part, directed to charity in ways never imagined before the power of the Internet. "/>
				<outline text="And we can realize not just the power of technology, but the power of technology to do good. We can build in a payback from this new technology through the cause motivations of the marketplace, rather than depending on the philanthropic benevolence of the wealthy. That is the issue that faces us when we consider these new margins: To give, or not to give."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Affiliate Economics and the New Margins">
				<outline text="There is presently 'price protection' around this gap between digital and molecular distribution channels. Brands do not want to destroy their traditional brick and mortar channels by cutting prices wildly online, so margins have an artificial protection for the time being.  Brands which are unfettered by molecular distribution, however, have flourished. Witness the explosive growth of online business at companies like Cisco, Dell, Gateway. They have forced competitors to respond to their online convenience and/or intense price competition."/>
				<outline text="In the consumer world, online sellers have their own problems connecting the consumer with the website, in order to generate these new electronic savings. There is a considerable new customer cost involved in getting people online to make a transaction with the merchant."/>
				<outline text="Hence the rise of affiliate programs, which are a temporal solution to the problem. Affiliate programs are 'commission sales' programs by online e-merchants. Rather than incur the 'risk' of advertising for new prospects and turning those prospects into customers, e-merchants are enabling virtually any website to get a commission on actual purchases by referred customers."/>
				<outline text="These affiliate commissions are less than the traditional retail distribution cost, which is fair, because the e-merchant is doing much of the heavy lifting, in terms of merchandising, transactions, stocking, transactional websites, and so forth. But the affiliates are also doing heavy lifting in terms of traffic and customer loyalty."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The birth of e-charity">
				<outline text="One interesting trend that has arisen from the fertilizer of affiliate commissions is that of splitting the commission with the consumer's chosen charity. A number of new e-charity firms have formed, all aggregating merchants and enabling consumers who shop those merchants via the e-charity to redirect part of the new Internet margin - represented by the affiliate commission - to a charity. Again, so far, so good."/>
				<outline text="Consumers appear to love the idea. Now, when they shop online for the things they need or want, a percentage of the purchase goes to a worthy cause. In many cases, to the individual's personal favorite worthy cause - the medical research that will help their descendants, or their kid's school, or the mission that is helping to educate inner city kids, or the pet rescue charity in town."/>
				<outline text="And merchants appear to benefit. Marketing statistics indicate that consumers have a strong preference for doing businesses with corporations that are good citizens, and that when the merchant is making a donation of part of the sale price to the consumer's cause, consumers see a very tangible demonstration of corporate citizenship."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Will affiliate commissions, and e-charities, last?">
				<outline text="In time, the economy is efficient, and drives prices toward cost. "/>
				<outline text="One cost is the value expectation of the consumer. "/>
				<outline text="At iGive.com, the leading e-charity, we believe we are in a race: Generate significant consumer expectations for support for worthy causes when they do business online, before the margin protection disappears and the opportunity is lost."/>
				<outline text="Here is the dream. Which side are you on? "/>
				<outline text="Our side: As the new economy evolves, consumers expect a big 'feelgood' component to their purchasing. We create a new behavior pattern that says that in a new, rich, electronically enabled world, there is margin to do good, and to help causes, and even better than that, to help the causes I as an individual care about. Margins drive toward cost, but we've created a new cost -- consumers expect online merchants to be terrific corporate citizens -- better than brick and mortar companies. I think this dream is possible."/>
				<outline text="This is the power of technology to do good. "/>
				<outline text="The other side: As the new economy evolves, margins will drive toward cost, and causes will be left to fend for themselves as before. "/>
				<outline text="I think this leaves a huge emotional and societal 'hole' compared to the vision of the former. It's just business as usual, instead of moving business toward good."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Trends support the side of light">
				<outline text="1. Social entrepeneurialism. Many are recognizing the inherent value of bringing competitive talent and in fact the forces of competition to bear on social problems. This competition means that e-charities will be driven to greater efficiency than governmental or even volunteer efforts."/>
				<outline text="2. Internet democracy. The new technology enables communities like never before, around interests as small as you can imagine. Hence the explosion of chat, personal websites, and other new forms of self-expression. It also enables individuals to participate in causes. The .org sites and activities are generating tremendous participation and enthusiasm. "/>
				<outline text="3. Guilt. Enormous new wealth is being generated, and someone should do better by the less fortunate, whether the less fortunate are kittens and puppies, inner city kids, our kids, churches, and so forth. We have a chance to 'bake' that support into the new margins, and enjoy the unbelievable efficiency that arises when those new donations are directed by the individual t the cause or causes they choose."/>
				<outline text="4. Innovation. Now we can build an entirely new kind of voluntary, line-item donation into the economy that actually lowers overall costs by motivating people to be digital, gives the individual, not the corporation or government, the choice on what to support. "/>
				<outline text="5. Competition. The news is not that we figured this out. The news is that this is happening, competitors are out there, and with lots of entrepreneurs going at this, it has a chance to succeed."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Our charitable bottom line">
				<outline text="We have a chance to commit a new kind of donation and do-good effort into the new Internet economy that bypasses traditional inefficient distribution,  and lets the individual pick the causes they care about for this new money. "/>
				<outline text="It is individualism, it is capitalism, it is democracy, it is entrepreneurialism. It creates an entirely new idea about what purchasing is about. We have the ability to create a future where our descendants come to expect the responsibility and ability to direct a portion of their merchant dollars to help the needy."/>
				<outline text="But it won't happen -- this transitory margin will drive to zero -- unless we create and build a consumer expectation that this margin belongs in our new pricing."/>
				<outline text="We need e-merchants who understand this, editors who are willing to open a dialog on the subject, and technology companies willing to make the effort to have technology stand for a new, better, and innovative kind of societal goodness that only technology itself could enable."/>
				<outline text="To give or not to give in the new economy? We can, in fact, make the answer, with every transaction, a definitive to give."/>

			<outline text="Good morning!">
				<outline text="A funny thing happened last Friday as I was writing an email on my Windows NT laptop. The U key stopped working! I didn't know if it was a hardware glitch or a software problem, so I rebooted the machine. This was a mistake because my password has a U in it. So I can get at the files on my stinkin laptop (file sharing is a &quot;service&quot; and runs even if you're not logged on) but I am writing this on the old &quot;Betty&quot; server which is now my main machine."/>
				<outline text="Oh how it hurts my head! I had gotten so used to that little laptop. Oh well, I guess new braincells are forming and others are dying. I don't like it, but it's giving me a new perspective and I think it's making me smarter."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Script Meridians">
				<outline text="Over the weekend the Script Meridian community list sparked up. It had been quiet for a long time, I don't know why, but it's definitely not quiet now. I took this opportunity to tell the Script Meridians, who are mostly users of Frontier, what UserLand has been doing in the latter part of 1998 and early 1999. "/>
				<outline text="Last fall was when *we* went quiet on our new direction. It's part of our slow-down-and-get-it-right philosophy. Well, some of the results are available now, and I outlined them for the Script Meridians and it occurs to me that DaveNetters might be interested. If so here's the link: "/>
				<outline text="http://developers.userland.com/stories/updateForScriptMeridians "/>
				<outline text="I'll be writing more about this for sure, some of it even in this piece!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="XML-RPC progress">
				<outline text="Shortly after writing my &quot;Let's Get Technical!&quot; piece, Jeremy Allaire got in touch, as did Esther Dyson (thanks Esther!) and we're now moving forward on bridging XML-RPC and WDDX. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayArchive.pl?/99/04/i06-04.57.htm "/>
				<outline text="I don't know if this is the reason why, but shortly after this piece, our interchange format, XML-RPC caught fire, and now there are full client/server implementations for Python, Perl, Java and a client for ShockWave."/>
				<outline text="I have hopes that we'll get an endorsement from a major platform vendor shortly, we're working on it, so things keep moving in XML-Land, and that's good! And we're looking forward to working with our new friends at Allaire to build compatible bridges with Cold Fusion and the other environments they support with WDDX."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Back to the Meridians">
				<outline text="At the same time on the Script Meridian list, Lynn Siprelle, who's a great conversation starter, asked a question that piqued my interest. &lt;i&gt;What I want to know is: HOW DID YOU LEARN TO DO THE COOL THINGS? Did you just wake up one morning and find you'd been injected with micro-organisms that implanted the information in your brain? Did a guy in a trenchcoat walk up to you at Starbucks one day and slip you a mysterious zip disk? Did you see the URL for the Super Secret Basic XML Cookbook written on a telephone booth wall? Are you married to an O'Reilly editor with inside information? WHAT?&lt;/i&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Injected with micro-organisms! Man I love that idea. Know where I can get some?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The rest of this piece is the answer">
				<outline text="Lynn, seriously, thanks for asking. I actually owe it all to Adam Bosworth at Microsoft. In 1997 he made two trips down to see me to show me what he thought XML was going to do. On the second visit we opened up the Frontier 5 object db outliner, and played around with building an XML tree in the database. It looked good. I made my decision right then and there."/>
				<outline text="As far as why it's important, and how I knew it would be (or why I believe it will be), it's simply that interchange formats are important. The first one I worked with was DIF, Data Interchange Format, which was the format that VisiCalc used. Then there was RTF, Rich Text Format, which was the format that Microsoft Word used. Then we did our own, called Dot-Head, which was the way of moving information between our outliners at Living Videotext. "/>
				<outline text="Even HTML can be an interchange format. Early versions of Netscape stored bookmarks in HTML and parsed them into a menu when it booted. That was different from using HTML as a display format, although you *could* display the bookmarks in a browser if you knew how to trick it into doing it. "/>
				<outline text="There's a long history of using text-based formats to represent information that's stored inside a program in binary structures. In a sense, this is what I do, take text and turn it into binary structures, and spit out text."/>
				<outline text="XML is a grand vision. It says that instead of having a billion incompatible text interchange formats, let's have just one. Did I understand the appeal of this immediately? Yes. Why? Because I know that users want to move stuff between programs. Did I believe in XML when I first heard about it? No. I thought it was going to fragment into a billion different dialects and that supporting &quot;XML&quot; was silly, because except for a few syntactic similarities XML was destined to be fragmented. Do I believe now that XML will unify into a single interchange format? Maybe. Human nature hasn't changed. People still like to blaze their own trails, and forget to look to see if anyone has gone down the path before them. Big companies think the world revolves around them, and little companies do too. This is how billions of incompatible formats come into being."/>
				<outline text="But there's cause for hope! What's amazing about XML-RPC is that it's catching fire *right now*, in a bunch of diverse communities. In the last week, Python and Java came on-line with both clients and servers. Yesterday a Shockwave client. And the Perl version was taken out of mothballs, and of course the Frontier version keeps on ticking."/>
				<outline text="What Bosworth showed me was that at least at part of Microsoft got the idea that they could take a back seat to defining the formats and support it with their software. He challenged me to overcome my objections and give it one more try. I decided to do it because I was 42 years old, and was pretty sure that in my career I wouldn't get another chance at doing this. "/>
				<outline text="I see XML as potentially the Ice-Nine of the software world, that if it's properly supported and understood, that lock-in disappears. I know that many Frontier users will get what they want, for example, a way to deploy dynamic Frontier-managed sites on various flavors of Unix. I think it will suck the greed out of the software business, and allow users to have real choice, and make the big companies relevant only if they produce excellent software. I admired Microsoft's courage at being willing to operate in such a world."/>
				<outline text="At least we'll have a way to move stuff between Frontier, Perl, Python, Java and the other environments that get servers. So it was worth it. Will we get IBM, Oracle, Apple, Sun, Macromedia and Adobe to care about compatibility with Frontier, Python, Perl and Java? Well, maybe, you never know. It ain't over till it's over, right? We'll see."/>

				<outline text="Lot's of things changing over here, sorry for not writing, I miss doing it, but it's been a bit hectic, with the growth of XML-RPC, new thinking on using computers in meetings, releases of alphas and betas of content management and workstation products, politics with a big platform vendor, and a visit from my Jamaican uncle coming thru San Francisco on his way to Thailand!"/>
				<outline text="It's all very confusing. Like Bill Clinton I'm trying to &quot;compartmentalize&quot; as best as I can. I don't like to write public pieces when I'm confused, but there's so much to catch up on, I have to start somewhere, so here goes!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Clinton Trial">
				<outline text="I've written lots of unpublished stuff on the politics in Washington, then I got a pointer to a piece in the Austin Chronicle and I threw all my writing in the bit bucket. The author, Michael Ventura, said it much better than I had. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.auschron.com/issues/vol18/issue21/cols.ventura.html "/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="Technography">
				<outline text="Switching gears."/>
				<outline text="I've reconnected in a very pleasing way with a longtime friend, Bernie De Koven."/>
				<outline text="Bernie is a game designer, he recently left Mattel, where he was part of the team that did the Barbie Fashion Designer software. "/>
				<outline text="We've been friends since the early 80s when he was a user of the bulletin-board that I operated out of my Menlo Park living room, running on an Apple II with a ten megabyte Corvus hard drive."/>
				<outline text="Between then and now, Bernie has had lots of game-designing jobs and has explored a new idea called &quot;technography&quot; in the late 80s and early-mid 90s. "/>
				<outline text="Technography is revolutionary. It's a new application for computers that's on the verge of being discovered by thousands, maybe millions of users. It's newly relevant in the age of meetings and net-connected executives and engineers. "/>
				<outline text="How does technography work? Add a laptop and a smart person to a meeting. Project the laptop so other people can see the screen. Soon the screen becomes the &quot;surface&quot; of the meeting. People start pointing at text and say &quot;Move this there!&quot; or &quot;This belongs here,&quot; and the technographer, with a few waves of the mouse, does what he or she is told. "/>
				<outline text="People can log into the meeting thru a web browser. Decisions are made, resources allocated, committments given and taken. Technography increases the value of the organization in substantial, even huge ways. "/>
				<outline text="The meeting can start on the web, days or weeks before the meeting, and extend days or weeks into the future. The meeting becomes a project, a process. Any conference or meeting, of any size, can benefit from technography."/>
				<outline text="A technography-managed meeting works differently from the meetings you go to today. No notepads. The purpose of the meeting is to create a document. One document, not twenty or two hundred. People who are shy are given ways to contribute safely. Technography is about tools for communication. And of course technology is central to technography."/>
				<outline text="I'm re-learning this from my friend Bernie. I've believed in the power of group idea processing since I started doing it with my team at Living Videotext in the mid-80s. Now fifteen years later, computers are widespread, the skills and knowledge are out there. The users are starting to do it, so it's time for me to tap my lovely friend Bernie on the shoulder and say, Bernie, let's have some fun!"/>
				<outline text="And of course, my walking buddy Bernie says yes! "/>
				<outline text="So here we go..."/>
				<outline text="http://technography.userland.com/ "/>
				<outline text="I'll be writing more about technography, and sharing Bernie's writing. We'll do how-tos and Technography for Dummies. I look forward to the O'Reilly book, Technography in a Nutshell. It's like XML, but instead of being geek-level, this is totally user-level stuff, and of course it's connected to XML, but let me and my technical friends worry about that. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Alphas and betas">
				<outline text="Along with our renewed interest in technography we've been making important progress in the core outlining software built into Frontier. This is happening in version 6.0, which is, in its various pieces, a workstation, a server, and a content management system. The kernel is in alpha, on the hard disks of our server testing group, and the core of the server, non-kernel stuff, is being tested more broadly."/>
				<outline text="One of the key features in 6.0 is borrowed from MORE, a product which many enthusiasts believe was the height of the art of outlining in the mid-late 80s. The new feature, fat headlines, allows Frontier outlines to be used for writing. I can testify to that, for the last three months I've been doing most of my writing in this outliner. Here's a screen shot.."/>
				<outline text="http://technography.userland.com/screenShot "/>
				<outline text="Finally, two groups are going to meet each other. People who write and think in structures. These are the technographers and idea facilitators. The other group are people who manage servers and websites, the people we've been working with since 1995, when we turned to the web."/>
				<outline text="Outliners meet webmasters. And vice versa!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="MORE files rescued">
				<outline text="At the same time, an engineer in the Macintosh division at Microsoft, Brad Pettit, has been working on a utility that extracts text from MORE binary files."/>
				<outline text="What? Why would a Microsoft engineer be interested in rescuing data from MORE? Well Brad is a generous fellow, and was one of the engineers who worked on MORE. Brad went to Apple, and then landed at Microsoft. Like me, he feels a bond with MORE users, and it's great that, thanks to Brad, there's now an easy way to get ideas out of MORE and into other text tools."/>
				<outline text="http://www.labmed.umn.edu/~john/more/index.html#MORE2Text "/>
				<outline text="Of course Frontier 6 will be able to read the files that Brad's utility creates."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Search engines">
				<outline text="The rest of this piece is about XML-RPC."/>
				<outline text="After gaining new implementations, in Java, Perl and Python, the next question was what to do with it."/>
				<outline text="Luckily, we had an idea waiting for this moment."/>
				<outline text="We do content management and group writing software for Windows/Mac. I see this as a single seamless platform, in our world you can intermix Macs and Wintel machines at will. You can have Mac servers or Windows servers, and any number of writing or content management workstations, all integrated thru HTTP and XML. We do the things that our host platforms are good at doing."/>
				<outline text="At the same time as Mac/Windows has been getting good at doing this stuff, Unix kept going, the Internet developed around Unix, and while the user amenities and tools on Unix are still behind those on Mac and Windows, they're better at delivering raw computing and storage power on the server side."/>
				<outline text="We've been working on a search engine that runs on Windows/Mac, it's perfect for the searching functionality of a large publishing site, or for a community composed of a several hundred smaller sites. However, I would not try to do an Alta Vista or Inktomi-level search engine with our software. It doesn't scale that high, at least not at this time."/>
				<outline text="XML-RPC to the rescue! We've documented the XML-RPC interface for our search engine, and hereby invite our friends in the Unix world to clone it. I envision a search engine running behind Apache on Linux, storing the info in MySql, all seamlessly connected to content systems, using XML-RPC. I put out this invitation to a smaller audience on Scripting News, and yesterday we got a bite! Stephen Judd, a webmaster at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, put up a search engine that supports our interface, and then I wrote a script in Frontier running on Windows that added my home page to his database. I then did a query, and my page showed up. All that happened in less than fourteen hours. "/>
				<outline text="Now I want to evangelize this idea more broadly. Here's a link to the message, pointing to all the information you need to clone this stuff on Unix. Please please clone it. There's lots of business we can do here."/>
				<outline text="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$2454 "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;core&quot;&gt;Microsoft and XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;">
				<outline text="Finally, I want to very briefly tell you a behind-the-scenes story about how XML-RPC came into being. It may appear to be a solo effort on the part of UserLand, but it's not. "/>
				<outline text="In February of last year I wrote a piece about using HTTP and XML to implement a cross-network wiring protocol. I write lots of pieces like this, here's an idea, does anyone think it's interesting?"/>
				<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/98/02/rpcOverHttpViaXml.html "/>
				<outline text="I got an email from Bob Atkinson, one of the lead architects in the COM group at Microsoft. I had met Bob many years ago at a series of Microsoft design reviews for OLE while it was in gestation. Bob was enthusiastic and asked if we wanted to work with them on the spec. Of course I said yes, and a week later I was meeting with Bob and a few other key people in the COM group, in a conference room in Redmond."/>
				<outline text="I did a little technography. On my laptop screen, projected, I brought up a Notepad file containing a sample RPC message. They said &quot;change that&quot; and I changed it. I learned from the messes at Apple that, if possible, agree with the platform vendor. These were smart guys. They let me keep some of my tags, I let them put in some of theirs. At the end of the day we had an agreement and a plan to proceed."/>
				<outline text="Over the next few weeks we went back and forth, and quickly the influence of the rest of Microsoft could be felt. I was surprised, my impression was that Microsoft moves in lockstep, that they execute quickly, but I found that this is not true. They interfere with each other, second-guessing and FUDing, internally, much more than they do with the outside world. As someone outside Microsoft I was much more empowered to move quickly than any of my collaborators at Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="So we decided to take a snapshot of the spec we were working on with Microsoft and make it public without putting Microsoft's name on it. This happened on April 4, 1998."/>
				<outline text="The spec worked. We were able to deploy, in Frontier 5.1, a robust underpinning for all kinds of distributed applications. Most of our users don't know that it's XML-RPC that keeps our search engine current or synchronizes their object database with the one on our support server. "/>
				<outline text="I stayed in contact with the people at Microsoft. In the summer they did a design review with a number of big developers. I attended the meeting and felt very well supported by the Microsoft people. They encouraged me to speak, to explain the ideas, to respond to the feedback. My name is on the spec they circulated at the meeting. As individuals they have been wonderful to work with, and as a company, I am sympathetic, but they have been very frustrating!"/>
				<outline text="As XML-RPC gained traction outside of the Microsoft-UserLand connection, we've had to face a tough choice. Do we negotiate with people developing on other platforms, or do we negotiate with our silent partner, Microsoft, or somehow keep trying to be the bridge connecting them? I eventually saw this as untenable. I already have a fulltime job, and I have certain strengths, but other people have other strengths. The system was highly inefficient and too centered around me."/>
				<outline text="So I privately lobbied Microsoft to join the public discussion group, to talk directly with the people implementing XML-RPC on other operating systems. I know that I made life difficult for people at Microsoft, but I also strongly believe it's in their interest to work in the networked development community. If they want Microsoft systems to be fully relevant in the new networking paradigm that they co-invented, now is the time to work. The train is leaving the station. It's happening now."/>
				<outline text="And here's a key point. I've been getting credit for excellent work done at Microsoft. Now I would like to correct that. There's a magic in that spec, the object serialization format, expressed in two simple tags, &amp;lt;struct&gt; and &amp;lt;array&gt;. It was designed by Atkinson and others at Microsoft. I am proud to have played a part in the design, and glad to do my part in promoting it, and happy that it's built into my product. But the design of XML-RPC is a gift from minds at Microsoft to the net community. Does this blow your mind? It should!"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, after much lobbying and internal politicking, Atkinson posted public responses to questions raised by an engineer in the Internet Imaging Operation at Hewlett-Packard and a developer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Institute of Robotics and the lead architect at Allaire. You can see how far this stuff has spread, and Microsoft's involvement surely can help it spread even further."/>
				<outline text="I would like to stand up and cheer. Microsoft is doing what few would expect them to do. They're working within the confines of a delivery-oriented networked working group, developing a communicaiton protocol that's equally valuable to Windows, Mac and Unix. Because our spec is already deployed, there's no FUD possible. This is why, when we first started working with Microsoft on this last year, I sent a memo to Bill Gates, congratulating him for having more courage than I had ever seen in one of the gorillas of the computer industry."/>
				<outline text="Think of it this way. If I develop a search engine running on NT, it can be replaced by a search engine running on Solaris or Linux with a simple emulation of an open protocol. XML-RPC is far simpler than COM, CORBA or Apple Events. Time to deployment, from scratch, is measured in days, not years. We can move very quickly. And customers get choice. "/>
				<outline text="In 1991 Gates said there's no value in plumbing. At the time he was lobbying Apple to let others build networks compatible with Macintosh networks. The great thing is now, with the shoe on the other foot, Gates and company have been living up to that promise. Out of deference to our working relationship, I've not said anything about this. Now that their involvement is public, I can."/>

				<outline text="Hello and welcome back to my narrative. This week I've been working more with Microsoft on XML-RPC, and working with Marc Canter and his team on a new connection between servers and web browsers that lets each do what they do best. The server stores and computes and schedules, and the browser is the user interface, it presents, simplifies, learns, interacts and delights. "/>
				<outline text="Our first target is the ubiquitous free email service that all portal sites offer. We've already implemented an HTML-only interface that works with 2.0-or-above level web browsers, but this is just for completeness, the true innovation will come when the higher-bandwidth interface comes online."/>
				<outline text="The Canter team assumes that there's a broadband pipe connecting the client to the server. Their interface is a set of reusable object classes in JavaScript that run on the client. The server keeps information for each user, a deep and extensible set of preferences that allow the user a lot of say in how the service appears. "/>
				<outline text="Imagine the Internet Cafe of 2000, or the broadband-connected home or office of 2002 and you'll see the target environment we want this software to run in. Not surprisingly, this involves XML-RPC, more on that later, and of course more on the Canter demo project as it comes online."/>

				<outline text="Flipping channels around dinnertime last night, I came across Larry King's interview with West Virginia Democrat Senator Robert Byrd. Along with Pat Moynihan of New York, also a Democrat, Byrd is the senior Senate Democrat and a Constitutional historian. As Richard Stallman is to the Open Source world, Byrd is to the Constitution. A purist, a visionary, a zealot. Previously silent, he's just the right guy to talk right now, as the Senate looks for its exit strategy from the impeachment process. "/>
				<outline text="Last night Byrd said something new and stunning. He has no doubt that Clinton did what he was accused of, and that in his opionion the accused acts are sufficient for removal. How will the White House respond? They can't point the partisan finger at him, he's a Democrat, of the same party as the President, and the legislative authority on the Constitution, at a time when all the power is with the legislature. Today's events will be very interesting to watch. Will the Democrats close ranks behind Byrd? Does he offer a compromise with the Republicans? What does Moynihan say?"/>

			<outline text="Politics of Plumbing">
				<outline text="One of the reasons I'm so fascinated with the US political process is that I'm personally involved in a political process myself, the evolution of a cross-platform wiring protocol known as XML-RPC. However it happened, thru luck, vision, patience or effective compromising, I have become a pivotal person in the evolution of the protocol. "/>
				<outline text="I used to say I live for plumbing, but now I've refined that, I love the *politics* of plumbing. It's the working together that I find fascinating; having been immersed in the lack of working together in the past, that was just preparation for the day when people would work together. (I'm still a member of the Church of Murphy.)"/>
				<outline text="This has been a week of negotiation, there's measurable consensus forming inside Microsoft that it's now time for them to move on XML-RPC, to get our work in synch, and to develop a way to go forward with other parties involved, the Python, Java and Perl implementations, along with the new MSIE 5 implementation, released yesterday, and the Netscape and Microsoft/Mac browser implementations, released earlier today."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Brief history">
				<outline text="Here's a summary of how we got to where we're at right now."/>
				<outline text="In February 1998 I wrote a DaveNet piece with the germ of the idea of XML-RPC. We released a prototype that could be used for Frontier-Frontier communication. I got an email from Bob Atkinson at Microsoft, asking if we would work with them, and we said yes, and went forward."/>
				<outline text="We co-authored a spec, it was called Simple Object Access Protocol, or SOAP. We wanted an even simpler subset, that became XML-RPC, released publicly in April 1998. Our protocol was a compatible subset of SOAP, with the idea that any XML-RPC app could be compatibly upgraded to support the full SOAP spec when Microsoft was ready to release it."/>
				<outline text="In the interim, there was minor spec-drift, small differences at the XML-RPC level. Microsoft kept us in the loop, but we didn't move the public spec along with them, our plan was to wait until they were closer to deploying, and then do one rev, if possible, to get us back in synch. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Co-ownership">
				<outline text="Yesterday in a conference call with Microsoft people I said the biggest win was for them to support the XML-RPC spec without changes. However, I respect their opinion as much as I respect the opinion of the others who have played a role in the definition of XML-RPC, and if they have needs that we share, it would be bad practice to not support change. "/>
				<outline text="An example of that process was the introduction of the &amp;lt;base64&gt; tag, as proposed by Fredrik Lundh, who has been instrumental in the development and deployment of non-Frontier implementations of XML-RPC. He's an important and respected person in this process. Fredrik posted a message to our discussion group saying that they had added a value type, &amp;lt;base64&gt;, to the Python implementation. My leadership challenged, here's the process I went thru."/>
				<outline text="Does Lundh have the right to add a new value type to the spec? I side-stepped the question, and instead asked myself if the idea was good. After a little thought I realized that it solved a problem we had encountered, it made text-or-binary representation of information an issue that could be handled at the plumbing level, something we had not been able to achieve in any other way. The idea is great! So I quickly updated the XML-RPC spec to include the new &amp;lt;base64&gt; type."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The role of Microsoft">
				<outline text="Should we view Microsoft in the same way? Yes, absolutely. First, the history is important here. There was a time, not long ago, when we were doing daily back-and-forths with the Microsoft people. The process worked, it yielded a spec that many are saying is elegant and simple and useful. Every bit of praise that XML-RPC has gotten equally belongs to Microsoft. Now we have to go more slowly and carefully because there are compatible cross-platform implementations."/>
				<outline text="Reason #1. Microsoft is a collection of developers, many of whom do fine work. Their vision is compatible with ours. By choosing to work with Microsoft we empower the people within Microsoft who want their company to embrace change. We were able to easily get into agreement with them in the past, so I'm willing to continue investing in that premise."/>
				<outline text="Reason #2. Microsoft has hundreds of products and hundreds of millions of users. Compatibility with their users is a huge carrot."/>
				<outline text="Reason #3. Microsoft, like it or not, is a leader. The spec they implement will be the spec that dozens if not hundreds of other developers will implement. Having them publicly support a spec that we co-designed will surely bring us prestige and attention, and probably get the involvement of a few of their competitors, who so far have either ignored XML-RPC or signalled that they plan to implement their own format."/>
				<outline text="Reason #4: I've been briefed on the changes they want. They are reasonable, pass the good-idea test I used in evaluating Lundh's idea, they do not invalidate the current spec, so won't add FUD to the mix. I'm very sensitive to that. We have forward motion, and will protect that motion with all my power."/>

				<outline text="It's going to hit the fan soon. Most newbies incorrectly assume that the email they send to friends and business associates is private. If you think they can't monitor your email, think again. The technology exists now. All they have to do is capture the text (easy) and run it thru a search engine looking for key words and phrases (also easy). "/>
				<outline text="Computers are really good at storing lots of information for long periods of time, so if you're sued or arrested in 2003 you may have to explain things you said in 1998 and 1999. If you don't like Ken Starr, think about it this way, the work he does will become a lot easier and may be more broadly deployed in the future if the encryption laws don't change."/>
				<outline text="People who think are concerned about this one. Spread the word, make it an issue, raise the awareness of the potential for abuse in the power we've given to the government and its partners."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Free speech">
				<outline text="What about free speech on the Internet? It seems to me that's the people's business too."/>
				<outline text="As I've said before, impeaching the President for wildly attacking the First Amendment would have been the right thing to do. I didn't get much support on that. But the Constitutional arguments were clear, as was the threat, and the courts agreed"/>
				<outline text="I think free speech is the major defining attribute of our form of government. Attacking free speech is the ultimate offense and both the President and Congress committed that offense."/>
				<outline text="I wonder how Henry Hyde, who would like to be remembered as a defender of the Constitution, voted on that one?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No more killing people">
				<outline text="One more thing, you might not agree, but I think the people's business also includes eliminating the death penalty. We kill more blacks than whites, more men than women, and even worse we kill innocent people. It's a hypocritical practice, it's impossible to administer in a fair way, and it's just plain bad karma to kill your own people no matter how horrible they may be. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="That's it">
				<outline text="Those are the three priorities I'd add to the President's to-do list post-impeachment. He could change his position and get on the right side of these issues, and do something historic and create a great legacy. That would be an excellent use of his high poll numbers. He doesn't have much to lose here! He won't do it. Right? Of course. What the heck."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;What a Month!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/22/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I can't believe it">
				<outline text="I can't believe it's almost over but it feels like it just started. But we've moved so far, software-wise, in the last month, I have not wanted to stop and write, because the next turn of the next corner in the software trip has just been too intriguing and rewarding."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Control panel">
				<outline text="We're working on a new breed of content management software, putting the editorial tools right where the writers want them, in the web browser. When they're looking at a bit of text it's just a matter of clicking on a button to edit it. As a writer, this is what I've always wanted when working on the web. Remembering two locations, one for the browser and one on my local desktop, is too taxing for my mind. The flow stops, I have to use my brain to find the stuff to edit, and you'd be amazed how many times that extra work makes me forget why I was going there in the first place."/>
				<outline text="So the next motion is in the direction of making the content *come to me* and then go back to the server, and I never have to type or paste a URL or see a File-Open dialog. When we fully crack this we'll have a great GeoCities-like strategy, the web will open up in ways I can only see a glimpse of now. Of course people will still push forward with just as much energy, but much less of the energy will be wasted doing things that computers do much better than people. (Compute and remember.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Screen shot">
				<outline text="So here's a screen shot of the current work-in-progress:"/>
				<outline text="http://www.scripting.com/gifs/controlpanel4.gif "/>
				<outline text="Things to note. The page links to the members of my workgroup. When they move to a new project they send a signal to all other members of their workgroup. When I click on the link I go to the detailed todo-list page, which they edit using an outliner. "/>
				<outline text="I can also edit the link panel. And since I'm a word guy, I included a dictionary on the page. It's real. It connects to a dictionary server running at Princeton University called WordNet. It's a great feature, I can't believe I've spent all these years writing without having a dictionary always on-screen."/>
				<outline text="And that's the key concept. You want to cram it all into one page and link it into the browser's Home button. When you want to further complicate the page, you should just have to click on one button. The more HTML you know the fancier it can be, but if you know no HTML, it still looks really nice. And from there you get to every other page you authored, and every workgroup you're a member of."/>
				<outline text="The browser becomes a portal not just to the Internet but also to the apps on your desktop. The browser is a bridge. You make quick edits without leaving the browser, and it links to your favorite writing tools for more focused writing (like writing a DaveNet essay, which I'm doing in our outliner). "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers">
				<outline text="We can do this kind of software because we have something no one else has -- a powerful scriptable object database and outlining software that runs on the most popular writing platforms, Mac and Windows. And we can do it because we invested in a concept called Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers starting three years ago, and now the vision has been realized and it's as cool as I thought it would be."/>
				<outline text="http://davenet.userland.com/1997/09/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe "/>
				<outline text="Where will this software be used? Workgroups. For example, a division of a company, a small number of designers and programmers to support up to several hundred writers, organized into groups and sub-groups, producing content, a web presence, some for internal use and some for the public."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Observations">
				<outline text="To support this activity we need all the basic features of a portal, specialized for content management. Searching, time, and hierarchy are the primary ways to locate stuff. Server-based preferences, and scalable content thru XML. "/>
				<outline text="I think the lines between portals and desktop applications will blur over the next few years. I also think it's a key strategy for the desktop software makers, Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia, Symantec, to link their stuff up to the web browser, that's the cleanest path to the server, because the browser, of course, is fully empowered to talk to the server, and most important, the users already understand this."/>
				<outline text="One more thing.. This is how the Network Computing idea promoted by Larry Ellison is going to be realized. It will happen, it was the right model, but it will involve skills and habits that desktop computer users already have."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Flies in the ointment">
				<outline text="Right now I'd say the number one problem is the lack of good text editing tools in the web browsers. I'd like to see a real text editor, something on the level of Microsoft's WordPad, debugged and optimized, to replace the &amp;lt;textarea&gt; editor in today's web browsers. The better the web browsers become at editing text, the more we'll be able to rely on them for that. Task-switches are costly in terms of user comprehension. The more work we can do right in the browser, the better."/>
				<outline text="Another wishlist item, it may sound trivial, but it's not -- I'd like the screen-shot functions in Mac and Windows to put a GIF on the clipboard, not a PICT (Mac) or a BMP (Windows). That would help teams of people who are documenting software. Imagine if a user could take a snapshot and shoot it right to the server without even opening a Paint program. Again, the idea is to optimize task-switches."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Anyway...">
				<outline text="As you can see I'm in software mode. God bless our President, hope the Y2K thing works out. I'm playing with my ant farm and having a grrreat old time."/>

			<outline text="Shinpaugh">
				<outline text="Yesterday I got a phone call from David Shinpaugh, a developer at Broadband Mechanics, a web development company that we're partnering with. Shinpaugh's main computer crashed on Monday morning, and in putting it back together he needed to download a new copy of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0b2/Win. "/>
				<outline text="We chose this as our initial deployment envrionment for the high-bandwidth interfaces for our new software primarily because it has excellent XML support and access to an HTTP client from JavaScript, in other words we chose it for technical, not political or legal reasons.We really can't do the project if Shinpaugh doesn't have MSIE 5.0b2."/>
				<outline text="So, when he went to http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ he found, surprisingly, that there was no link to download the public beta of 5.0, which I had downloaded myself just a few days eariler after a fiasco installing a new version of Netscape Communicator, but that's another story."/>
				<outline text="I checked it out myself, and there was reference to the upcoming final 5.0 release, in mid-March, but no way to download the beta! Wow. I figured there must be an interesting story behind this, so I asked David to post  a message on our discussion group, knowing that a fair number of Microsoft people read our site, hoping that we could get to the bottom of the problem. "/>
				<outline text="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3132 "/>
				<outline text="This morning we got to the bottom of it, it involves a small company Blue Mountain Arts, who sued Microsoft, and got a restraining order and that's why our development project is in trouble! "/>
				<outline text="Here's an email from Will Friedman explaining what's going on. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Friedman">
				<outline text="Hi Dave!"/>
				<outline text="There were several issues discussed in the thread you linked to."/>
				<outline text="The first question is, where is the IE 5 beta?"/>
				<outline text="I'm afraid the answer to this question isn't the one I'd like to give. The short answer is that there is no way for developers to get IE 5 until our release on March 18th.  However, this has nothing to do with the web distribution mechanism - we can't provide new CD's of IE 5 beta either."/>
				<outline text="The reason for this is that we are complying with a preliminary injunction in the Blue Mountain Arts lawsuit, which requires us not to distribute Outlook Express.  "/>
				<outline text="Outlook Express in the IE 5 Beta contains a junk mail blocking feature. Because this feature is based on a software algorithm which attempts to determine what is junk mail and what isn't, sometimes it inadvertently deletes content that is not junk mail.  Blue Mountain Arts mistakenly believes that this optional junk mail filter (which is off by default) has been engineered to target them in particular."/>
				<outline text="We have been issued a preliminary injunction which requires us to not distribute the junk mail feature, which is in the Outlook Express Beta. Because the Outlook Express beta is part of the IE 5 Beta, we have had to pull the IE 5 beta from our site to comply with this order.  The final release of IE 5 will not contain the junk mail filter feature (which I personally think is a shame for end-users.)"/>
				<outline text="It's not feasible for us to build a new version of the IE beta without the OE beta at this point, since we are so close to shipping and our developers are focused on getting IE wrapped up to meet our announced ship date.  I'm sure you are familiar with the measured frenzy that precedes any commercial software release."/>
				<outline text="Therefore, unfortunately, there is no way to get the beta at this time, and that's why it's gone from the site.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this and I will do my best to answer them."/>
				<outline text="Will Friedman, Technical Evangelist, Internet Explorer"/>

				<outline text="Hey, if you know Gary Reback at Wilson Sonsini Godrich &amp; Rosati, please forward this to him. Gary, who I met briefly at an Upside party in the Cole Mansion in Belmont a couple of years ago, please can you ease up on Microsoft for just three weeks, and let them distribute the betas? "/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="Blue Mountain Arts">
				<outline text="Yesterday, in &quot;Blue Mountain Arts&quot;, I carried the Microsoft party line on their three-week withdrawal of MSIE 5.0b2/Win. Now, ignoring the Blue Mountain connection, because as a developer it's mostly irrelevant to me, here's my view."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I chose MSIE 5">
				<outline text="Last fall Microsoft went on a press tour to pump up MSIE 5. I took a look, the surface-level features seemed useful but not essential. I chose to switch to this browser for the simple reason that it understands XML. When you open a file or web page that's formatted in XML, they show it in an outline where you can see it roughly as the author wrote it. I chose it for this reason alone, in my daily web work I come across a fair number of XML files. I need to read them. MSIE 5 is the best choice for that."/>
				<outline text="Later, we were able to use other XML smarts in MSIE 5 to hook it directly to our server thru XML-RPC. This has revolutionized our use of the browser. We're exploring territory that no one else is. I like that! As a developer this is what turns me on. I may be alone in a discovery. But, can I depend on Microsoft? I used to think so, at some level, talking with their developer exec, Tod Nielsen, I thought I understood what they would and wouldn't do."/>
				<outline text="Look, I'm not an idiot. I know Microsoft could upload the bits so Shinpaugh and others could get their MSIE 5 beta. Let me explain why we need this level of safety, and why it's irresponsible of Microsoft, if they want developers to trust them, to delete the safety net."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="MSIE got trashed">
				<outline text="Last Friday I trashed my copy of MSIE 5 by downloading and installing Netscape Communicator 4.5. Something went wrong, Netscape renamed my NT Administrator account and de-installed MSIE. They made themselves the default browser and emailer without asking. They turned on the Smart Navigation feature, which is a sniffer, sending my net travels back to their database. I think Netscape 4.5 is a virus, the worst kind!"/>
				<outline text="Anyway, after installing Netscape, MSIE wouldn't run. My desktop reverted to its initial (awful) Active Desktop view. My bookmarks were scattered over the desktop, which had turned black and hurt my eyes. All of a sudden my computer didn't work! It was jarring. If you use a computer I believe you can imagine what this is like."/>
				<outline text="I had to reinstall MSIE from a CD because Netscape crashed on the Microsoft download site. Then I used the old browser to  suck down the latest 5.0 beta and installed it. All of a sudden things started working again. One day later I had everything restored to normal and my workflow continued. The whole process is documented on my website."/>
				<outline text="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$3043 "/>
				<outline text="The moral of the story is that the net doesn't work if I can't get fresh copies of the software I use. It's especially important when applications like Netscape 4.5 are out there. It's irresponsible of Microsoft to not keep the beta in distribution *and* be in compliance with the court order."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What happens when Microsoft loses?">
				<outline text="Microsoft lost a court case. Now, if I were a betting man, I'd bet that they're going to lose a lot more. How rough is the ride going to be for developers? This experience is a clue."/>
				<outline text="In the bigger picture, I think Reback et al got more from Microsoft than they could have hoped for. Why should they back down? Is Microsoft self-destructing? I think Reback would be wise to kick back and wait and see."/>

			<outline text="***Chris Nolan and the SJ Merc"/>
			<outline text="First a little rebutting to a columnist with a big heart who I've butted heads with a few times over the last couple of years. The columnist is Chris Nolan, who last week took some shots at me in her Talk is Cheap column in the San Jose Mercury-News.&lt;p&gt;http://www.sjmercury.com/svtech/columns/talkischeap/docs/cn022599.htm "/>
			<outline text="I'm not mad at Chris even though she trashed me in her column. It's spring and a full moon. My feelings of love are genuine. She doesn't like the idea of a big man who has a heart and doesn't mind sharing it. That's one of her problems. I'm an uncle, a team leader and community leader and a CEO. The people I relate to with my heart seem to like it. That one columnist in an important paper has trouble with this has to be OK, because she's just one person, an important one, but still just one person."/>
			<outline text="Chris also said that my stories are sales pitches and marketing presentations. That's true. They are sales pitches and marketing presentations. This doesn't condemn me as a dishonest writer, as she would have you believe. It speaks the truth that I have spoken myself many times. I am a product developer with a voice. That's one of the great things about the Internet, it's like the op-ed pages of newspapers like the Merc, there's space for people to talk, alongside disinterested employees of publishing conglomerates, such as Ms. Nolan."/>
			<outline text="Anyway I've never been a journalist and never have claimed to be one. I run a small company and I make software and I carry those interests with pride. They color my writing, they even at times provide the substance of the writing. I think everyone who reads DaveNet knows this, and if they don't, they do now."/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;superhonker&quot;&gt;SuperHonker&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Last night, to celebrate spring and the full moon, I ordered myself an early birthday present -- a dual-CPU 500Mhz Pentium III with 512MB RAM and a 19GB SCSI hard drive. "/>
			<outline text="By my math it should be about 8 times faster than the top-of-the-line &quot;honker&quot; I bought 1.5 years ago. This is going to allow me to dig some new holes, it's going to make quite a nice Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server. "/>
			<outline text="I'm going to use the SuperHonker to develop a new kind of content management server, one that serves a small set of friends who are running weblogs, as I do. The new machine arrives on March 18, until then I'm counting the days."/>
			<outline text="***Comparing Broadband and HTML"/>
			<outline text="On to a different topic, some new ideas relating to where the Internet is going. Here's a snapshot of a development process going on between two companies, UserLand Software and  Broadband Mechanics.">
				<outline text="At UserLand we do content management systems, multi-user databases that are accessed thru the standards of the web. Broadband Mechanics does user interfaces in Dynamic HTML, using JavaScript and connecting to our servers thru XML-RPC. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Another way we connect is thru my longtime friendship with Marc Canter, who is the lead developer at Broadband Mechanics. Our friendship goes back to the early days of the Macintosh when I was doing outliner presentation software and Marc was bringing videogame technology to the desktop in the form of (what's now become) MacroMedia Director. "/>
			<outline text="It's been a long winding road, now we are doing the software that takes the place of Director's Lingo language, when combined with DHTML and JavaScript and the Internet, it's a very powerful combination."/>
			<outline text="Today we want to give you a window into that power, a window that's visible in any browser. Later this week we'll open up a live demo of the new stuff, which will only be usable in MSIE 5.0b2/Win."/>

			<outline text="***Why broadband?"/>
			<outline text="The pictures show that you can have a much more software-like experience if you access a server thru the highly graphic interface that Marc and his team have developed. This is the way the world is going. The Excite and @Home merger show that Kleiner-Perkins and TCI and AT&amp;T are ready to make a bet there. Cable modems are becoming commonplace as are xDSL connections, and many corporate Intranets are also high bandwidth environments. So if you have the extra bandwidth, what would you use it for? That's the question Marc and I are answering."/>
			<outline text="We're still in development, working on a prototype, our goal is to build a much more interactive, customizable and participatory workspace in the web browser. It'll probably still be a few months before our content developer portal will be ready for public use, but when it is, I think it will turn our industry around."/>
			<outline text="Right now we want these screen shots to be topics of conversation in board rooms, analyst and product planning meetings. Our bet is that as the industry turns this corner we can launch some new services and develop productive relationships with other companies that are investing in higher bandwidth net connections."/>

You just keep a turning while I'm playing in the band.&quot; This could be the theme song of the web, at its best. I point to you, you point to me. We relinquish control and bet that the reader will remember who made the introduction. I give you flow because you're excellent, and you give it back when I am excellent."/>
				<outline text="That's how the web will surround and eat the print press's lunch. Long lead times? Go for it. Being pals with the Washington politicians? Better hope the economy stays good. Be a tool? Not me, I'm just playing in the band."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Unix envy?">
				<outline text="We've been having some very useful band-like talks on discuss.userland.com, and I had a revelation a few days ago, coming from being a Unix guy who turned to CP/M, then the Apple II, IBM PC, Macintosh and then Windows. The last few years have been about getting the standards of the Internet deployed on the popular desktop systems. Now I think we're there. "/>
				<outline text="You can browse the web, read and write email, maintain a website, as easily and powerfully on a Mac or Windows desktop as you can on a powerful Unix honker. Those strange-looking things, URLs, are commonplace. What many people don't realize is that those URLs are Unix file names! So Unix has shown up on our desktops whether we know it or not."/>
				<outline text="But has Unix returned the compliment? In other words, have they adopted the best that desktop systems have evolved to be in the last twenty years? I think not. If they were, instead of complaining about our we-aren't-on-Unix-yet story, they'd look deeper and find a way to leverage what we do to the advantage of the net, not just their favorite operating system. In fact, we'd already be on Unix if there wasn't all this confusion about which desktop is going to be *the* Unix desktop."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Gnome vs KDE vs X">
				<outline text="Unix needs a desktop, not two or five. It needs one, one that has the polish and finish of Windows or Macintosh, and has the support of tool and runtime software developers. To gain that support, one of the desktop metaphors for Unix has to jump out in front of all of the others, to become the &quot;consensus platform&quot; and then, and only then, can Unix *start* to challenge Windows and Macintosh on the desktop."/>
				<outline text="Put another way, the desktop software developers, people like me, have fully embraced the web, and in doing so have brought Unix culture onto the desktop. We already work with Unix! Now it's time, after years of saying this, for Unix to return the favor. "/>
				<outline text="Unix needs to do two things. First get its desktop act together, so it will mean something to put Frontier on Unix. And second, it needs to embrace the popular desktops, Windows and Mac and stop complaining that so many people use them. It's a fact, just a fact, not a threat, not a problem. The more we work together the less of a problem it is. "/>
				<outline text="We'll have some concrete proposals in the second area, soon, and we have no choice but to wait patiently while the desktop situation sorts itself out on Unix, or fails to be sorted out. Stay tuned, as I am."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="An editorial portal">
				<outline text="Onward.. We're getting ready to ship Frontier 6, and in doing so, we're going to be running not only on the content management server and content developer's workstation, we'll also be putting software onto the desktops of writers, editors and contributing editors, building around the tools they use. Can you imagine editing a news-oriented home page in an outliner or spreadsheet? I think it would be very neat, and quite do-able in the Frontier 6 cross-platform environment. "/>
				<outline text="Most of our time in the last year has been spent in getting the server component of our software solid and 24-by-7. If you're reading this on the web you're using it right now. But we've also invested in a new writing environment, and that will roll out over the next year in various forms, customized to the needs of editorial teams. "/>
				<outline text="We're developing an editorial portal, which we will sell to customers. The goal is to deploy a flotilla of compatible editorial systems and see what happens. That's what the next level of Playing in the Band is all about. I think we can challenge highly centralized editorial systems with this approach. In my dreams, we do to the New York Times what Amazon did to Barnes and Noble. The assumption has been that the web can't get its act together to take power from the East Coast press establishment. I wouldn't count us out yet. In some ways we're just getting started. We'll do it by being distributed and uncentralized, the zig to their zag. Playing in the Band!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="whois.userland.com">
				<outline text="As we start to open up our writer's portal, we're deepening and modernizing our developer's portal, userland.com."/>
				<outline text="This weekend we rolled out a new twist on the old standby, Who Is? It's a game many of us play, let's find a new domain name, brainstorm to see what's taken and what's not. Like other web developers, I've spent much time at rs.internic.net, playing the Who Is game. It's fun. It's also amazing what's not taken! For example a few weeks ago I noticed that both featureRequest.com and featureRequests.com were not taken. We grabbed them quickly. Then a friend suggested a portal for doing seances. I checked it out. contactthedead.com isn't taken. We grabbed it. For this project we'll partner with a new kind of technologist. It'll be lots of fun! But I digress.."/>
				<outline text="I love Who Is, but it could be a lot better. It could remember what I had looked up, keeping a notepad for me, a history of the lookups I had done. Otherwise I have to switch between a browser and text editor and paste in the names that I found while brainstorming that were available, or interesting for other reasons. So that's what we built, and today we're opening it up for public access."/>

			<outline text="A big news week">
				<outline text="This is already turning out to be a big news week. Today Netscape announced a new syndication format called RSS. Also today, we are rolling out a new service, a special-interest search engine. Tomorrow Apple is announcing something related to operating systems and on Thursday Microsoft is shipping Internet Explorer 5.0 for Windows and various flavors of Unix."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Netscape's announcement">
				<outline text="Earlier today Netscape announced a new low-tech format for syndicating web content called RSS, for RDF Site Specification. It's a more realistic spec than the one proposed by Microsoft several years ago, called CDF, or Channel Definition Format, because it reflects the dynamic nature of news-oriented sites."/>
				<outline text=" It's not as far-reaching or complex as the ICE spec promoted by Vignette. It's most comparable to the scriptingNews format we've been promoting since late 1997, and the &quot;ultramode.txt&quot; format being implemented by Slashdot.org, and presumably other sites."/>
				<outline text="We are supporting RSS with our content. Over the weekend we put together a script (of course!) that generates a Netscape-compatible rendering of our site. "/>
				<outline text="http://news.userland.com/scriptingNewsToRss.xml "/>
				<outline text="Compare this to scriptingNews format, which includes more contextual information:"/>
				<outline text="http://news.userland.com/mostRecentScriptingNews.xml "/>
				<outline text="Congratulations to Netscape for getting this out. There are still improvements we'd like to see in RSS, they should be obvious in this comparison, and we've communicated them to the people working on this stuff at Netscape."/>
				<outline text="Further, we'd like to see how people are using Netscape's format. If you have a RSS file on your server, please send me a link so we can have a look. Thanks!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Specialized search engines">
				<outline text="These syndication formats are mildly interesting as ways of flowing my content thru your website, but where this gets really exciting is when you use this information to seed the contents of a search engine. Did I fail to mention that except for Slashdot's format, all the syndication formats are XML-based? They are! "/>
				<outline text="Like many others, we felt that when critical mass was achieved, there would be an opportunity to build an infinite number of XML-based special-subject search engines. Now we're there and today we're announcing the first such search engine, one that indexes three sites that support scriptingNews format:"/>
				<outline text="http://newssearch.userland.com/  "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A search engine with an editorial voice">
				<outline text="This search engine is different from any you've used before. Think of it as a search engine with an editorial voice, the combined voices of Lawrence Lee who edits Tomalak's Realm, Wes Felter of Hack-The-Planet, and mine, wearing the hat of editor of the Scripting News website."/>
				<outline text="Every night between midnight and 1AM Pacific, our crawler reads the news for the previous day on each of the three sites, and breaks it up into individual bits. Each bit is separately indexed. Usually the bit also links to an article on another site. We index that as well, but our crawler stops there. That's where the editorial voice comes in. If Wes, Lawrence or I thought it was worth presenting to our readers, it makes it into the search engine."/>
				<outline text="What do these three sites have in common? We all cover the web for web enthusiasts, people who develop for, invest in, or make decisions regarding the web. We have different perspectives, but when you put the three of them together, as we have in the search engine, you get a good cross-section of what's happening in web technology, marketing and politics."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Vertical search engines">
				<outline text="This raises the next question. What about the search engine for intellectual property attorneys? Or the search engine for high school math teachers? Or the search engine for people who love Grateful Dead music? "/>
				<outline text="Now that we have learned how to cover web developers and investors, we're ready to start branching out and provide tools and server software, editorial tools and web hosting for people whose expertise lies outside the web. We think this is a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, so the vision is keeping us *very* busy! "/>
				<outline text="We're hitting milestones on a daily basis, our editorial and indexing software is easly deployed on other people's servers, and the workstation software runs on Windows and Mac, which is where the people with the knowledge work. Whew. Now I have to get back to work on my software.."/>

			<outline text="Apple announces">
				<outline text="This morning I went to Apple's announcement of Mac OS X Server."/>
				<outline text="You can get most of the facts from other reports that I will point to from the Scripting News home page."/>
				<outline text="They made performance claims that were impressive, but with respect to Windows NT, incomplete. They compared to Apache running on NT, not to IIS on NT. I have no idea why they didn't compare to IIS, which is a highly optimized server. However the combination of Mac OS X and the new G3 desktop appears to be an inexpensive alternative to Sun's servers."/>
				<outline text="The open source aspects of the announcement were not momentous. All the components they are releasing as open source already were open sourced. "/>
				<outline text="Eric Raymond (Cathedral and Bazaar) and Brian Behlendorff (Apache and O'Reilly) were there, praising Apple."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's not a Mac!">
				<outline text="Mac OS X Server server doesn't run Macintosh software. This will surprise many Mac server sysops. They touted the ease of installation, but having freshly installed a server on NT (Frontier, of course) I recognized the process. Sure it's simple, as simple as possible, which is to say not as simple as setting up a Mac, but simpler than setting up a Windows machine and far simpler than Apache."/>
				<outline text="Raines Cohen of NetProfessional says it doesn't run Mac software (in the Blue Box) because they wanted good benchmarks, and the Blue Box slows down software running on the machine. When I asked Jobs the question, he didn't volunteer this explanation. However, he did say that the Blue Box was available for the Mac OS X client."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Jobs">
				<outline text="Steve Jobs is, as always, a polished presenter. Confident, showing appropriate understatement, and clearly on a course different from many people who develop for the Macintosh. His pants were ripped, wearing old sneakers, he looked tanned and healthy. "/>
				<outline text="I tried to talk with Avi Tevanian after the presentation to find out why they didn't build on Linux, rather than going down a different track, but he rushed off quickly. "/>
				<outline text="That's about it. If you have any questions let me know."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Winer">
				<outline text="PS: I love Apple. Even after all these years. They can get under my skin like no one else. Now, I know it's not healthy, they keep saying goodbye and I keep thinking they don't mean it. But they do. I would love to be able to compile my Mac apps for Linux, I was hoping that's what Apple would announce today. But there's hope. The rumor mill is churning on this one. Our Mac code base may yet have strategic value! Ye-hi. Stay tuned."/>

			<outline text="A big news week">
				<outline text="As predicted, it turned out to be a big news week on the web. "/>
				<outline text="We're taking another close look at web browsers and portals, thanks to announcements from both Microsoft and Netscape."/>
				<outline text="And this morning Microsoft released Internet Explorer 5.0, now installed on my main system, and it's working much better than the betas, yet there are still major areas that need work, notably the use of the browser as a text editing environment. "/>
				<outline text="I hereby offer to work with people on Microsoft's browser team to get better text editing into the browser environment for 5.1, 5.2, etc, and make the same offer to Netscape or any other browser vendor who sees the browser as a two-way environment, for reading and for writing. There are a range of options, we have flexibility, but we need improvement in this area as we move forward with our content management software. I'm sure our competitors could benefit from such improvements as well."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A surprise">
				<outline text="There was only one surprise in the Microsoft release, unfortunately they're matching Netscape's What's Related feature in MSIE5. This is disappointing. What's Related is an invasion of privacy on a mass scale, and users don't even know that they're sending information about sites they visit back to Netscape's server. The page describing the feature, on Microsoft's site, does not warn users about the privacy issues."/>
				<outline text="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Ie/Features/Related/default.asp "/>
				<outline text="Predictably, Microsoft spins this as Alexa's problem, and refers us to their privacy policy. But I'd much rather see the feature left as an choice that an informed web user makes by visiting the Alexa site, rather than have it pre-installed in the browser by Microsoft or Netscape. We've already seen Netscape breach their promise to inform users, I have no faith that Alexa will keep their promise, there are all kinds of reasons for promises to be broken, such as an acquisition, change in management, or dishonesty on the part of current management. All that stands in the way of misuse of this feature is the integrity of a management team. In this world, that's too thin a safeguard."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Apple's half-truths">
				<outline text="A side-note, I'm glad I decided not to go to Redmond today for the Microsoft announcement. My experience in Cupertino on Tuesday was that I'm the only person who asks tough questions. I'm tired of playing that role. Reading the reports that came out after the Steve Jobs/Eric Raymond marketing pitch, almost all the reporters just regurgitated the Apple party line. If I went to Redmond I probably would have been the only one asking Microsoft people how they sleep at night when the users are unknowingly sending private information to Alexa's or Microsoft's databases. "/>
				<outline text="In Apple's case, the obvious question was, what about the people who use WebTen, which is Apache for the Mac OS? They were touting Apache as if it were a newcomer to the Mac world. That's not true. And what about sysops who run WebSTAR or Quid Pro Quo and (shudder) Frontier on their Mac web servers? What would they like to say to those people, other than &quot;Convert to Apache and WebObjects?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Another interesting question that wasn't picked up by any press (correct me, please, if this is wrong) is that Apple chose to compare Mac OS X Server to Apache running on NT, instead of IIS on NT. There's only one obvious explanation, yet no one raised the question. Is NT really that bad a server? No, of course it's not. Silly. Why does the press let Apple get away with this? "/>
				<outline text="I'm asking reasonable questions that executives should be prepared to answer. The reporters don't ask or don't care. I honestly don't understand how or why the system works this way. There should be more rigor applied to the claims that industry execs make. It's not their fault if the press lets them be so slippery. If the press changed its ways, the industry would reform itself at a higher level, I'm sure of it."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Netscape's lawyers">
				<outline text="OK, now let's switch back to Netscape's announcement on Monday."/>
				<outline text="With the my.netscape.com channel technology, Netscape is heading into some very interesting water, from a content management point of view, this is fertile ground. But their lawyers got into the middle of it, and put a legal agreement in the way of this new publishing system, that, in my opinion, would keep anyone with integrity from providing content on their system."/>
				<outline text="http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/terms.html "/>
				<outline text="On the Scripting News home page, on Monday, I said: &quot;Netscape's agreement was too one-sided and restrictive for us. Unless their agreement changes, you won't see our RSS file displayed on my.netscape.com. Be sure to read the agreement carefully before registering. You're giving Netscape's attorneys a lot of power over what you say on your website. Be sure there's something in it for you.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="One of my readers, Dave Aiello, asked me to explain the reasoning process, and here's a lightly edited and amplified version of what I posted."/>
				<outline text="Dave, we felt that they could reasonably have the right to terminate the syndication at any time without cause, and we would indemnify them against any claims that we had misbehaved, and leave it at that. That seemed reasonable. Add a disclaimer for their users that this window contains content that is outside of their control, and claim the same kind of lack of responsibility that an ISP is entitled to on the email messages that flow thru their servers, and leave it at that."/>
				<outline text="Instead of looking at it from their point of view, look at it from mine. I would have to disclose this agreement in practically every DaveNet I write, further I would have to have them reviewed by attorneys to be sure there isn't some way I'm violating the agreement with Netscape. It's taken me a while to understand what I can and can't do, under the laws of the United States, and I'm comfortable with that, except when they pass vague laws that abrogate the Constitution. But even there, I trust the courts to provide a sensible backup. However, the Netscape agreement would open us up to litigation under terms that are far narrower, and since it could be argued that we were compensated for agreeing to these constraints, there would be a lot of ways Netscape could win."/>
				<outline text="Of course they wouldn't really be concerned about the content if they sued, because we run a tasteful service, and I don't really do any of the things they say they're concerned about. It's much more likely that they would sue us as a competitive tactic. We're in a lot of the same businesses they are. And if you think I'm being paranoid, I am, with good cause. We once got into a legal jam with a competitor who was also a platform vendor, and they used a very old irrelevant legal agreement to delay shipping of a product that was embarassing because it was so much better than theirs. The thing to remember is that lawyers have databases, and it's really easy for them to do a query to find out what &quot;tools&quot; they have to get you to ease up on them in the marketplace, and sometimes product managers ask for that kind of help."/>
				<outline text="I asked for no agreement with them to syndicate my content. I see them as being as neutral as an ISP. Further we have a track record they can examine, and as soon as there's a problem they can pull the plug. I don't see why they need to get into concepts like &quot;pyramid schemes&quot; or &quot;grossly offensive&quot; and what if someday I want to run a contest on Scripting News? Geeeeeeez."/>
				<outline text="Think about how zealous the open source guys are about legal agreements about source code. Well, I'm just as zealous about legal restrictions on what I can and can't say. The whole reason Scripting News is good is that I can say whatever I want in whatever way I want, within bounds that I think I understand, and no one can tell me otherwise. "/>
				<outline text="Thanks for asking, clearly I had a lot to say about this!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="We will compete">
				<outline text="Netscape has a good idea, and the RSS file format, though imperfect, is open. So the clear answer is to compete, which is what we will do. We've already registered my.userland.com, and have an application running there that allows people to register RSS files and verify that they're correctly formatted."/>
				<outline text="http://my.userland.com/ "/>
				<outline text="We will implement syndication without overly restrictive legal agreements with the information providers. We will syndicate that content in a form that any portal can pick up, without having to do the simple content management that Netscape is doing. We will fill the role they intend to fill, without restraining speech, and trust the legal system to understand that we're just carrying the bits, not editing them. The content will be available, as HTML snippets stored on a publicly accessible server, to Yahoo, Xoom, Deja News, Microsoft, TheGlobe.com, Geocities, or Mr and Mrs Smith's Portal Company, at no charge. When we have the server running, probably by the end of this weekend, I'll send out a DaveNet with our proposition to the industry."/>
				<outline text="This is where I have the most power. Sitting in the second row at press conferences asking tough questions is uncomfortable to me. Netscape is letting their attorneys screw the industry. That's not my problem. I see it as an opportunity. I hope others in the Internet industry see it that way too. Let's fix this problem and keep Netscape's attorneys out of this business. They don't belong here."/>

			<outline text="Submission">
				<outline text="Hey. I've been thinking about submission lately."/>
				<outline text="Submission. Compliance. The act of submitting, surrendering power to another."/>
				<outline text="A few weeks ago a friend said that I didn't do it. It's true. Submission is not my nature. In a way I live my life to prove that I don't have to submit to anyone or any thing. As I look at my values from this perspective I realize that everything I do is circling around this issue, on both sides. I wasn't even aware of it."/>
				<outline text="In &quot;Earth's Website&quot;, 11/20/98, I said: &quot;I believe in science, and I think there is a science of humanity. We're the puzzle. We can't explore the depths of space, but we can explore the depths of ourselves.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="So there's a clue, this is deep within me, the resistance to submission. And then I wondered if everyone else was the same, and I realized they are not. In fact, the vast majority of people submit every day. They have jobs! They take orders. Most of them, most of the time, do their best to submit. But guys like me resist."/>
				<outline text="But submission is inevitable, even for people who hate to submit. Why? Because we die. And that's the ultimate act of submission. Wheeee! That's what I imagine death is like. You take your hands off the rail, unbuckle the seatbelt and go for the ultimate ride. "/>
				<outline text="So, following this trail of logic, using my intellect, it makes sense to start submitting as soon as possible. This is the mathematics I believe in. If you've got a losing strategy, the best tactic is to admit defeat asap and get on with it."/>
				<outline text="I offer no other further conclusion at this time. I don't know if I recommend submission. I'll let you know how it goes."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="My.UserLand.Com">
				<outline text="In my last piece, &quot;Everyone's Equally Nasty&quot;, 3/18/99, I talked about Netscape and RSS files and promised to let you know when we got our syndication/aggregation site, My.UserLand.Com, on the air. It's up now."/>
				<outline text="http://my.userland.com/ "/>
				<outline text="If you have a news site, a weblog, I encourage you to put up an RSS version of the content so we can flow it thru our templates and out to readers' desktops. "/>
				<outline text="There's no legal agreement, I see the inclusion of a channel on our site as equivalent to pointing to a website from Scripting News. It's not that big a deal. You're letting us know where a publicly accessible resource is located. It's no more significant than signing a guestbook, or sending me an email pointing to a site you just put up. That's always welcome. You never know when a Dancing Hamsters site is going to pop up (or what kind of music they're going to be dancing to). I like to look at new sites and I like to point to them from my site. It's just that simple."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Opting">
				<outline text="On the other hand, at any time, I can disconnect the link. And you can opt-out simply by removing the file or sending me an email from the account you were using when you registered. We keep our distance. What you choose to say to your readers thru my interface is between you and them. But it's also at-will. Either of us can opt-out at any time. That's the fairest formula in my opinion. It allows us to relax and try out a new idea and be prepared to learn from the experience without risking too much."/>
				<outline text="So that's my proposal. If you run a site with a news flow, consider producing a RSS version and link it into my.userland.com and sites that are compatible, such as my.netscape.com. This is how updraft is created, how we make a new standard happen. Along with Netscape we've taken care of one side of the equation. Competitors are welcome. Now let's get the content sites working on this stuff. They're the other side."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="XML">
				<outline text="All this comes under the banner of XML. When it gains critical mass we will also link these sites together in a search engine. We will also offer web hosting for people who do news sites, with a high-level writer's interface, and scalable flows on the other side (broadband, palmtop, XML, plain old HTML). We're now entering the commercialization of XML. I'm still optimistic. Let's go!"/>
				<outline text="All this and more will happen when I get back.. Let's leave the bookmark right here."/>
				<outline text="In the meantime, I'm going to do some more writing, so expect a couple more DaveNets in the next few days."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;MSFT Stock Glitch?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/30/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Financial news">
				<outline text="Lots of financial news yesterday. Computer Associates buys Platinum for $3.5 billion. Microsoft reorganizes. The Dow closes over 10000 for the first time in history."/>
				<outline text="And late yesterday afternoon, a friend who reads DaveNet called and pointed out something interesting about the Microsoft two-for-one stock split that happened on Friday after the markets closed. With this split, MSFT crossed a threshold, for the first time, the number of outstanding shares no longer fits into a 4-byte number. This opened the possibility for computer error, similar to the Y2K problem that many people are justifiably concerned about."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The 4B Glitch?">
				<outline text="Let's call this The 4B Glitch, or any situation where a computer is being asked to store a number greater than 4294967294, or 2^32, or roughly four billion, and fails to. "/>
				<outline text="In these situations a very large number can look to the computer like a very small number. Computer engineers call these &quot;boundary conditions&quot;, and this is often where software fails. When you design a system you always know that *some* data will make your software fail. In the 1950s, engineers thought 2000 was too far away to worry about. And a company with over 4 billion shares must have been unthinkable to some people who wrote trading software. The key to good system management is to know what assumptions you've made and stay conscious as the world changes and renders your assumptions invalid. "/>
				<outline text="There was a lot of talk that the Dow crossing 10000 would be one such event. Apparently it wasn't a big problem. But at the same time, MSFT crossed another boundary (Murphy strikes!), and on this one, the trading systems may not have handled it gracefully. The problem may be compounded because Microsoft is part of the Standard &amp; Poor 500, so computers that miscalculate Microsoft's numbers may also have miscalculated the S&amp;P numbers."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A couple of examples">
				<outline text="The split was announced two months ago, and my friend, who is a software developer, wondered if the computer trading systems would work. "/>
				<outline text="On Monday he watched the websites of the major stock services, and based on what he saw, he believes that they weren't handling the change. Quote.Com, Schwab, MSN, even the Nasdaq site, all had serious errors, in billions of dollars of missing shareholder value, and some of them still have the errors as I write this on Tuesday morning, three days after the stock split."/>
				<outline text="Last night if you went to www.nasdaq.com, you'd have seen grossly incorrect numbers for the number of outstanding MSFT shares, for market capitalization and for P/E Ratio. They will of course eventually fix this, so I took a screen shot."/>
				<outline text="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/nasdaqerror.gif "/>
				<outline text="The numbers are incorrect by a factor of two. They have Microsoft's market cap at half what it should be and its P/E ratio also at half the correct amount."/>
				<outline text="And this morning, Quote.Com also has the incorrect off-by-a-power-of-two value for MSFT's P/E ratio."/>
				<outline text="http://206.204.24.3/snImages/quoteComError.gif "/>
				<outline text="Now I don't know if the errors are due to the 4B Glitch, I've checked with people who understand trading software, and I am told that software generally records the number of thousands of shares, not the actual number of shares. But right now the web isn't doing a good job with the value of MSFT. Is this unusual? Please let me know."/>

				<outline text="Switching gears.."/>
				<outline text="Is one of the things that comes with Open Source is Open Resignations? It seems so. Early this week Eric S. Raymond, perhaps the most visible open source advocate, publicly resigned, and then a day later, changed his mind. I understand, I go thru those kinds of loops, sometimes several times a day!"/>
				<outline text="Then today, Jamie Zawinski, the leader of Mozilla.Org, the open source group managing the former Netscape browser, resigned, with a public statement that revealed problems with the development process for the only browser that's (currently) taken seriously as an alternative to Microsoft Internet Explorer."/>
				<outline text="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html "/>
				<outline text="Zawinski exposes problems that were obvious to the informed outsider. For many reasons, the open source project, now a year old, didn't gain traction. Now with Zawinski leaving, the doubts are publicly visible to anyone, such as myself, who cares about having an alternative to the Microsoft browser. If you've got an investment in the web, it's time to think. What's the future of the web if Microsoft has no serious competition? Think think think."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Future of browsers?">
				<outline text="It would be great to get a clear statement from Netscape/AOL on where they're going with their browser. The rest of us, I think, have a clear interest in an alternative to Microsoft. I've had doubts about that being the Netscape browser for quite some time. "/>
				<outline text="It's kind of like Hillary Clinton getting in the way of New York Democrats. Until she decides one way or the other if she's serious about running for the Senate, no other candidate can gain enough support."/>

				<outline text="It's *conceivable* that there will be updates to the Scripting News home page while I'm traveling, I can update it thru a web browser, but don't count on it. This is my chance to get away. I never know what that means, every time it's different. "/>

Everyone else seems to have missed this, that there's a position between personal webservers and the honkers that can run Yahoo, Excite or Lycos. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Jakob Nielsen">
				<outline text="Jakob Nielsen wrote about this subject today! In a very eloquent piece that I couldn't agree with more, he says: &quot;&quot;An intranet should have a single home page that integrates a directory hierarchy, search, and news. Most intranets are chaotic, under-funded, and lack design standards, causing huge losses in employee productivity.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="The trees and the forest">
				<outline text="All the necessary components are there. Robust HTTP client/server, a full content management system, Edit this Page functionality, a solid network computing model, editing and development tools, and a high level programming interface. Remember, this is scripting, not low-level stuff. "/>
				<outline text="My friend Marc Canter, a very wise man, shared some of his thoughts on this at his Passover seder on Wednesday night. &quot;Now you're writing an operating system in a scripting language,&quot; he said. I had lost sight of that. It's true. We made a bet ten years ago that personal computers would get faster and bigger and stay cheap. The bet was that script code would perform like C code. It's a good time to reflect on that. We got there!"/>
				<outline text="Everyone who's working in Frontier now, whether they know it or not, is using a new kind of operating system. It's reasonably platform-agnostic, it runs on Mac OS and Windows, but in a real sense, the services those systems provide to Frontier developers are commodities. A file system, interface to the screen and keyboard and mouse, a TCP stack. Most of the juice is supplied by scripts. Thousands of lines of script code are running every time Frontier does something; code that is unique, that does stuff that the lower-level OSes don't do."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Moore's Portal">
				<outline text="Moore's Law will push us forward even further into uncharted territory. There will 8-CPU machines, then 16-CPU machines, and so on. RAM will continue to get cheaper. Megahertz and disk space will get cheaper too. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,14751,00.html "/>
				<outline text="As that's going on, more web users will become web authors. Full-time net connections will become more commonplace. Our software will distribute, now running primarily on a content management workstation or server, and soon on the desktops of people who write for the web. Imagine a portal that not only aggregates the brain power of thousands of people, but also gives them powerful tools to connect with other people whose brains and experience are available over the web. That's our roadmap."/>
				<outline text="Today's users are web browser users. They usually are not using the same machine that the code is running on. When they are, this is the unusual Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server concept that's going to be very big, I think. Apps that can be moved off your desktop to a server and back again, whenever you want."/>

			<outline text="How you can participate">
				<outline text="OK, that's the pre-vacation vision. There's no doubt that my perspective is clouded by eight months of intense development work. When I come back I will have the next steps outlined, and be ready to build some more Internet applications. That's where I want to work, for the forseeable future. In applications."/>
				<outline text="So, I hope while I'm gone that the lions of the Frontier community will dig into the sample apps we've created and explore some of the directions they suggest. Think in terms of guest databases that have code and templates, and other guest databases storing data and user profile information. Assume you know every person coming into your website. What can you do to make the experience more useful to them? "/>
				<outline text="The best way for you to participate is to figure out ways for your users to participate. That's how we all get onto the growth curve. Think about the wishlists of your users. How many of them can you address now that the base software has grown so much more powerful? "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="My.UserLand.Com">
				<outline text="Our vision is unlike that of any other company, rather than have a small group of invisible people behind an HTML interface, we have a large group of autonomous developers, some of whom use our tools, and others who don't (thanks to XML-RPC we work together). Many of them run their own servers, many are capable of producing excellent content and helping thousands of less technical people share their thoughts thru the web."/>
				<outline text="People often ask the question &quot;Does Frontier scale?&quot; My answer is &quot;Unlike anything you've ever seen before.&quot; The old vision of a web server being monolithic and mysterious and hard to access will melt over the next few years. Now web servers are simple. People are complex. Having software meet the people is the real game in web space, that's the tricky problem."/>
				<outline text="When Netscape announced RSS I knew almost immediately that it was something we were waiting for. The idea of a distributed writing system is one we've been building around since the early days of AutoWeb and Clay Basket, it actually predates that, going all the way back to LBBS in the early 80s. "/>
				<outline text="The importance of RSS is that it marked a moment when the market was ready to go that way, towards a distributed writing environment. We solve so many more problems than RSS, but many if not all of them fit neatly behind RSS. We see the web as a two-way medium that evolves. News, search and directory, for today, who knows what else in the future? You can see the beginnings of this on my.userland.com and newssearch.userland.com. Where ever it takes us, we're going there, and RSS is definitely on the path. If you do content, or content management software, I strongly encourage you to get up the curve on RSS and see if you can be compatible with my.userland.com."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Distributed responsibility">
				<outline text="When software is centralized, as we've seen in the Melissa problem, it encourages people to be irresponsible. They have an illusion of separation. In fact, we are all connected now. And our responsibility is connected too. "/>
				<outline text="This is where the biggest juice is. More powerful distributed ways for people to connect at points of responsibility. It will allow more informed opinions. That's why I'm interested in the Internet. That's why we're developing the software we're developing."/>
				<outline text="I know that only one tenth of one percent of the people on the net today will understand what I'm talking about. But that's cool. Those are the people I want to talk with."/>

				<outline text="Now I'm ready to take on the world's problems again. What to do about gunfights in high schools? Easy. Stop making guns so easily available to teenagers. Get guns out of the homes, get them off the airwaves, and repeal the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution. A new slogan. Guns don't kill people, high school students in suburban Denver do. "/>
				<outline text="We've put up with metal detectors at airports, and no one seems to consider it unreasonably invasive. I'm in favor of making guns totally illegal in the US. Metal detectors everywhere. Everyone disarms now. That's the strong medicine that we need to take to get rid of disasters like the massacre in Littleton. In the future we're going to want to know where all the guns are. Let's start cleaning up now."/>

			<outline text="Bombing Yugoslavia">
				<outline text="And what to do about the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia? End it now. It isn't going to work. Offer the Kosovans new homes elsewhere, and generous and humane treatment so the young people of Kosovo don't grow up with huge axes to grind. "/>
				<outline text="And if anyone is passionate about solving the problems in Yugoslavia, let's move there and help them rebuild. Instead of sending ground troops, let's send our politicians, reporters and business leaders. Tony Blair and Al Gore, Ted Koppel and Wolf Blitzer. I'd like to see interviews with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton at the airport in Tirana. If we aren't willing to make a personal committment to peace, then let's stop kidding ourselves about our will to stop despotism. War is serious shit. "/>
				<outline text="And let's stop kidding ourselves that bombing other countries is a solution to any problem we have. All we're doing is creating new generations of people outside the US that hate us, and rightly so. Long after Clinton is gone we'll be explaining to the rest of the world why we stood by while our country turned to massive violence over intelligence."/>
				<outline text="Further, the country to be worried about is Russia, not Yugoslavia. We've humiliated them, they adopted our economic system, trusted us, and now we've abandonded them. If we work out a political solution with Moscow, Milosovic and the Serb private militia will not be able to stand up to us. NATO is a fine alliance, but a US-Russian alliance would be truly powerful."/>
				<outline text="Remember, they still have all the nukes they ever did. There's a lot of power there. We must respect it. Study history. Milosovic isn't the next Hitler, he isn't that powerful, Yugoslavia is a tiny country, and he doesn't control it. There are dozens of armies in Yugoslavia. More likely, the next world-class despot is going to be Yeltsin's successor. We'll pay attention then. Better sooner than later. "/>

They switch so easily to extremist hyperbole about the monsters of Belgrade and the monsters of Littleton. How to prevent one? How to prevent the other? Gore says we have to get images of violence off TV. Good point. Now, who's putting most of the violent images on TV? Bombs falling on Belgrade. That's mass-scale violence, and it's real violence, not imaginary stuff. Lots more people are dying in Belgrade than in Colorado. King fails to ask the obvious question. What kind of example are you setting for your high school students? "/>
				<outline text="Gore and Clinton preach love, understanding and healing, while they bomb and kill people in Yugoslavia. We must be stupid to fall for this crap over and over. Here's what we go for. The idea that we're innocent. We're not. In the last few years we've bombed four countries, Afghanistan, The Sudan, Iraq, and Yugoslavia and maintain an occupation force in Saudia Arabia. I warn you now, it's going to come home to roost. I believe that what goes around comes around, you reap what you sow. Soon we'll be expressing horror at bombings in US cities. It'll be harder to think clearly then."/>

Get them out of there as fast as possible, and then build a wall around Yugoslavia in cooperation with Russia. Use our alliance to be unified, not to drive down the road to contradiction.

			<outline text="What I learned">
				<outline text="There may be a reason to keep the 2nd Amendment. A common response -- as soon as you repeal it, you'll get concentration camps. I'm not sure I agree. I've never owned a gun in my life, and I'm not in a concentration camp. My parents and grandparents didn't own guns either, and they were all refugees from real fascists with real concentration camps. "/>
				<outline text="When I was in New Orleans as a college student many of my roommates had guns. I didn't feel safer with them around, in fact once one of my roommates threatened me with his gun. We didn't need guns to protect us from criminals or oppressive police. I also think having guns in a house gives people extra power we might not want them to have. "/>
				<outline text="Some point out that gun control wouldn't stop people from making bombs. I don't know about that. Airport security has stopped hijacking. Occasionally airliners are bombed out of the sky, but they have new techniques that spot bomb residue on luggage."/>

			<outline text="Why Littleton?">
				<outline text="Have you ever been to a suburban American town? It's as if they were all stamped out of the same mold. It's been going on for a long long time. Imagine if you were a young person raised in such a town. What would you have to look forward to? Why did your parents move there in the first place? What did that say about their expectations of you? What's their vision of perfection? How yielding would they be to your originality? These towns look a lot like the suburban towns of the 1950s, except now they've got it right, with Burger King, Starbuck's cable television, it's all flattened out, all the same, a perfect template for teen rage. "/>
				<outline text="I think the problem is that many young people have no hope. No one tells them the truth, we drift into a war where they'll be the ones fighting, and guns are everywhere, and videogames give them the skills they need to use them. Shrugging our shoulders isn't going to fix things. Blaming individual parents won't solve anything either. It appears to be a problem because we don't understand what's going on. The only way to figure it out is to ask the kids, and as much as it hurts, listen to them."/>
				<outline text="Then the next thing is to stand for something as adults, to set examples, to add substance to our lives and give them hope for substance in theirs. And substance means using your mind, challenging assumptions, thinking instead of reacting. View the world as if you deserved a bright future. Find the passion you once had so you can look your kids in the eye and tell them that you stand for something. Many young people have passion and courage along with their rage. What are they saying? It's simple.  &quot;I want to create my own future.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="Let's have a panel of young men and women convene to discuss the war in Yugoslavia. Let it be an international body. Let it be made up of the people who will fight the war, and who will have to live with its aftermath. Let's create a new process that incorporates the wisdom of young people. We make an assumption that they don't have enough experience to make the right call. This assumption is totally wrong. In fact, they haven't learned how to lie as we have. And they still have a residue of hope for a bright future that most older folks have lost. We say we want a bright future for them, but we are mistaken if we think it's the future we design. It never is. "/>
				<outline text="Now, believe it or not, with the Internet, things will change. When we look at the Internet we see huge dollars being made in Silicon Valley and Wall Street and most importanlty, in places like Littleton. But we've overlooked, for the moment, the political power it gives to people who know how to use the medium, and the people who grok the medium are young. Time has a way of hurrying things up at a rate 40-somethings can't perceive. Today's 18 year old was only 6 years old in 1987 when the PC revolution was booming. They were young when the web was young. We forget how fast young people grow. There are a lot of producitve hours to fill between age 6 and 18. These people are deep, and they have various levels of frustration, and a different yet spookily familiar kind of frustration. "/>
				<outline text="It all comes back to the &quot;I want to create my own future&quot; thing. When there's no avenue for creativity, frustration develops, and allowed to fester long enough, it explodes. That's the message of Littleton. And the solution is easy, empower them to channel their energy in efficient ways, open the door for their future and get out of the way. Perhaps the baby boomer generation will reliquish power to the next generation without going to war with them?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What young people do">
				<outline text="It's perhaps a sad truth that none of us live long enough to really figure it out. We all start with the assumption that we will do things differently from our parents' generation, but do we really get there? We look at the young people and think we see the distance we have traveled, we see all that we learned between then and now. "/>
				<outline text="We think their words are silly and immature. We know so much, wouldn't you like to teach them? Yet the only way that young people can learn is to make their own mistakes, which they are entitled to do. We share this frustration with our parents, they felt the same way about their children, and they were just as wrong as we are. "/>
				<outline text="We remember so much, but have we forgotten the rage we had when we were young? Our hope to live great lives? Do these things go away because we want them to? They do not. A new generation comes along, and as much as we think we did a great job of setting the stage for them, they disagree and want to do it their way, because that's what young people do."/>

			<outline text="Stuck with old browsers?">
				<outline text="Last week independent web columnist Jakob Nielsen predicted that we'll be building websites primarily for pre-5.0 browsers until late 2003. "/>
				<outline text="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990418.html "/>
				<outline text="The message is unmistakeable. The rapid growth in functionality that rose around HTML and HTTP, the web, is over. Now the changes come slowly because the market has become slow at adopting change. There are so many reasons for it, everywhere you look, from any angle, the development of new features has stagnated, the new features that *are* being delivered are boring, there have been serious reliability problems in new versions, and when this happens, the market settles down, people upgrade slowly and carefully. The cost of breaking systems is too high because too much has been invested in working around the bugs in the installed base, each upgrade requires more careful transitions. "/>
				<outline text="I also agree with Nielsen that there's a silver lining to this, web developers can use the slower pace to fill in new content management and serverside features such as searching and navigation directories and easier authoring. But don't miss this, as history teaches us, this kind of stagnation opens the door for a breakthrough, which just as inevitably follows the stagnation. It's a constant stream of flip-flops. Moore's Law keeps driving, and new generations of developers learn about things that were tossed out in the last generational flip."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="History repeats">
				<outline text="We've seen this many times. The Apple II became a cluttered mess of upgrades and add-ons, which begat the relatively wide open spaces of the IBM PC. I remember thinking that 640K of RAM was enough for eternity. Four years later Lotus 1-2-3 had filled the memory, and the PC floundered with incompatible approaches to overcoming the memory limit."/>
				<outline text="Along came the Mac, with its linear address space and a non-Intel processor, it took hold, and it was time to convert character-based software to the graphic UI that came with the Mac, and later, Windows. Many leading products, including WordPerfect, dBASE and 1-2-3 were left behind in this transition."/>
				<outline text="Then in 1993, the web caught on and rewrote the rules. The graphic UI was thrown out and then hasitly and unsuccessfully added back (Java). Individual operating systems took a back seat, and HTML replaced the more expressive screen display technologies on Mac/Windows. "/>
				<outline text="With the web, we took a big step forward, networking became part of the user interface, but we also took a big step backward as lineto-moveto was replaced with HTML's more clumsy &amp;lt;blockquote&gt; and &amp;lt;table&gt;."/>
				<outline text="So, in this context, Nielsen has, in my opinion, devised the math that proves that we're about to make another of these transitions. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Visions">
				<outline text="So if the web browser is Visicalc, what will its Lotus 1-2-3 look like?"/>
				<outline text="One easy bet would be to take another look at the GUI desktop and look for creative ways to connect that to the net. In fact, Microsoft is doing that in Windows 2000, in the integration with WebDAV; while not a complete emulation of the local file system, it's close."/>
				<outline text="But I think there's more promise in navigating from the opposite direction. Assuming that something like the web browser is the future platform for readers and writers, how would you navigate, from a software development standpoint, to something that did to the current web what Lotus did to Visicalc, or what the Mac did to PC-DOS?"/>
				<outline text="Interestingly, net-aware games, notably Quake, and chat clients such as ICQ are paving the way. As they build out and people create SimCity-like browsers for network-based desktops, we won't need what W3C is developing. Just as the file format for 1-2-3 became a standard, the formats used by these apps to transmit their information will become the standards of the next decade. If Yahoo isn't running the servers behind these networks, or AOL or Microsoft or Excite, CNET, TheGlobe, Tripod or Xoom or whoever, they aren't going to fully participate in the next wave of growth. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Musical chairs">
				<outline text="Musical chairs, a great name and a great game. Six kids, five chairs. The music starts. Walk around the circle of chairs. When the music stops sit down on a chair. If you can't find one, you lose!"/>
				<outline text="The same thing will happen in high-flow portal sites. It's an easy extrapolation that web browsers will be tied to specific websites in the future. We see this happening at Netscape (now owned by AOL), and for sure Microsoft will follow suit. Will Yahoo buy Opera? Looking five  years out, I think it's a no-brainer that consolidation will occur around sites that also control their browsing technology. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="W3C">
				<outline text="Now you may not like this, you may think they all have to support the W3C standards, but they don't. Standards bodies can't make the kind of transition that's sure to come in networking in the next few years. To me, the activity around W3C looks like the stuff that goes on while the real transitions are happening in the market. The fights over expanded versus extended memory. Various mail APIs that were being pitted against each other while SMTP and POP were taking over the desktop mail systems. "/>
				<outline text="Exciting software is what drives transitions. The IBM PC didn't go anywhere until 1-2-3 came out. And the Mac didn't boom until they erased the artificial 128K limit making way for Pagemaker, Photoshop, Excel, Director and other graphic apps that did something fun and useful with the memory."/>
				<outline text="Periods of openness are followed by periods of closedness. To assume that servers will be licensable, that the protocols will be discoverable, is naive. The software business is played nasty. Did you ever try to reverse-engineer the Excel or Word file formats? No matter what the standards-zealots say, the high ground belongs to the one who provides the software that excites users. In retrospect, Netscape blew it bigtime by yielding to the hype of the standards proponents. (Is it any surprise that Microsoft lead the parade?) Netscape could have, and should have, locked Microsoft out. Too bad they didn't have an architect with deep experience with software industry nastyness. They were led by a lamb and the sheep. It didn't work, at least the first time around. (AOL gets the nasty side of the business.)"/>
				<outline text="The one that gets the best bet down, and manages to promote a client app that has greater appeal than their own server, will be the high-riser of the next decade. As 1-2-3 was derived from Visicalc, as the Mac had much in common with the PC, the next generation will look a lot like a web browser, but it will also look a lot *better* than web browsers, if you get what I mean. "/>
				<outline text="Nielsen says it's going to be quiet in browser-land for the forseeable future. Who gets to make the noise that fills the silence? If history and human nature are any guide, that's where the next Mike Markkula, Ben Rosen or Jim Clark will place their bets."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Ben Rosen">
				<outline text="I'm thinking about Ben Rosen these days. He's back in charge at Compaq. Rosen is a smart guy. I met him first in the early 80s when I was associated with Personal Software, the company that produced Visicalc. Rosen was an analyst and newsletter writer and smalltime investor. He was watching and listening carefully, waiting for his opening, and when the IBM PC came, he pounced, starting Lotus with Mitch Kapor to challenge Personal Software, and starting Compaq to provide an alternative to IBM."/>
				<outline text="I had a psychic Ben Rosen experience last week. Walking down a street in suburban Washington DC, I had a thought. I wonder what Ben Rosen is doing now. A couple of days later I got my answer on the front pages of the Times and the Journal. He's shaking up Compaq, where he's still Chairman, which is no longer just a PC maker. Compaq is DEC, Tandem, AltaVista, and the original desktop business. Rosen's creativity should be quite a force. I'd love to chat with him now to hear how he's thinking. Like I said, he's a smart creative guy. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Software">
				<outline text="Flipping it around, if I had Rosen's ear, here's what I would say."/>
				<outline text="&quot;Get thee into software.&quot; (Traveling in the east has brought out my inner-Quaker.)"/>
				<outline text="There's never been a better time to have strong plays in clients, workstations, servers and portals, and Compaq has strong positions in clients and servers and portals. What's missing is an offering for creative professionals, people who write, draw, animate, design and develop systems, in other words, developers. They surely sell the hardware that such people can use. But they can, in ways others can't, tie all those systems together. "/>
				<outline text="We've gotten a big lift from having industry standard software, but that direction has run its course. Now I think it's time for experimentation, without the oversight of the standards bodies. Entertain creative people with more options. The path is totally clear, just add back the power the web took away. There are lots of excellent starting points. Macromedia's Flash comes to mind. Work with game developers and encourage them to link their interfaces up to productivity aggregators and connectors running on Unix servers. Encourage Apple to port QuickDraw and the various user interface APIs on the Mac OS."/>
				<outline text="What about Microsoft? NT didn't displace Unix, and some believe it didn't even displace Novell. They have no rabbit to chase in web browsers. Can Microsoft still strongarm the cloners? I don't know, but Rosen would. Microsoft still does the best job of responding to developers, but they haven't covered all the territory they need to. It's a good time to challenge Microsoft. There's room."/>
				<outline text="The open space is user experience. Cast a thousand seeds and let the developers lead. Microsoft probably will never really do this. It's the option that Apple had and failed to grab. But Rosen knows the history. He saw first-hand how the cart could be upset, now can he do it again?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A few more hints">
				<outline text="A door can open, maybe a couple of them. The first door is the migration path for Win32 apps to Linux. The second door opens Linux to Macintosh API-based apps. This is a door we want to walk through. This path should be well-groomed, I wish it were, but it's not; I bet 1000 other developers feel the same way."/>
				<outline text="Linux needs a GUI, so does the web. But this is the small picture. The big picture, the software industry needs leadership. The conventional wisdom that we don't need software is incorrect, in fact it's always been software that new directions are formed from. Right now it looks like portals drive the industry, but if you believe that portals will leverage ownership of client and content development standards, it'll all come back to software eventually."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Reassurance">
				<outline text="Another lesson of transitions is that the old way persists for a very long time. The 4.0-level browsers will be with us for the forseeable future. They will be the broadest least-common-denominator platform. There's still a lot of room for deepening tools and work environments for the existing web, just as there was new ground to explore in the Mac after Windows 3.0 shipped. Transitions require steady hands. Be ready to move, but also be prepared to continue in the same direction."/>

				<outline text="Dave, you've been fooled.  Those companies are not competing with NSI. Those companies are competing to *send business* to NSI.  The actual domain service will be provided by NSI.  They cannot make NSI's service any better than the screwup you experienced this week; they can only make it worse."/>
				<outline text="Under this scheme, the companies will handle the billing, but pay NSI $9 per year to provide the back-end database.  From personal experience with CORE, which built one and operated it for months, I know the back-end database can be provided for well under $1-per-domain-per-year.  NSI may make more money on the $9 domains than they do on the $35 domains, since billing costs probably eat a good chunk of the $35."/>
				<outline text="Real competition that would improve your service and/or make NSI accountable (you could take your business elsewhere) would involve either, whole new domains other than .com, which NSI would have no role at all in administering; or a shared process to create the .com domain database daily, which would not place NSI at the center of that process."/>
				<outline text="I hear that ICANN is working their way toward something like this (probably the first sooner than the second), but it's a very slow process.

				<outline text="We haven't created competition for NSI in toto, but for the *service* of registering domain names - i.e. its *registrar* business.

				<outline text="There's another facet of this NSI stuff that I've encountered which is really bad.  It appears that NSI does not protect their web site from some kind of snooping or sniffing or whatever it might be called. Speculators can grab domain names.  Here's what happened to me."/>
				<outline text="I attempted to register a domain name, but made a typo (both the primary and secondary DNS names were the same instead of being different).  The registration couldn't go thru and I got a message back to that effect. When I saw the e-mail the next day, I attempted to register the name again, but it was taken.  I looked up who had taken it, went to their web site, and there was the name, for sale (www.ideatrade.com).  "/>
				<outline text="In fact, this guy did this to me twice.  The first time, Nov of 98, I just used some web site that I'd discovered to check the availability of the name and thought it was coincidental that the name was taken a week later - at that time I wasn't serious about anything and had just been idly looking at names.  When I got serious and searched again in Feb, I was pleasantly surprised to see the name available again and tried to register it."/>
				<outline text="This guy grabs names and puts them up for sale.  He registers them, but does not pay for them.  After about 90 days they get released again.  I sent an e-mail to NSI complaining about this and asked for them to release the domain name.  I never received a response by e-mail.  I was able to get an NSI support person on the phone about two months later and was able to verify that the domain name had not been paid for.  But she said I would have to call InterNIC about the issue.  "/>
				<outline text="When I tried to call InterNIC, all the circuits were busy all day long and I gave up on that.  At Internet World I got the name of a person to call at NSI, and it took three days to get her on the phone.  I told her the story, and included the facts that I had the .org and .net versions of the name and had filed for a trademark.  Nothing.  This was about 75 days after the filing.  She said that there was nothing she could do (I was asking that the domain name be released right then), and that I would simply have to wait.  I now have about 10 days left, and the new business has been on hold for weeks."/>
				<outline text="My beef with NSI is that they are not protecting information flowing on their site and that they are totally unresponsive to customers.  I'm the customer, the other guy isn't going to pay them for the name.  You know, I could see something catastrophic happening because that one company put their profits ahead of making sure that the whole system is bullet proof.  Why haven't they protected the communications on their web site?  This is a ludicrous situation."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Who Owns .Com?">
				<outline text="I misunderstood, as I think a lot of people have, that this situation could improve because NSI is now getting competition. "/>
				<outline text="Anyone who is seriously maintaining a .Com domain name will just deal with NSI. The other companies, unless they *pay us* to register with them (it's thinkable in this crazy world), will achieve an installed base of zero. "/>
				<outline text="So to answer the question posed by this piece, Network Solutions owns .Com, for the forseeable future. That should clarify the situation, a simple statement. If you're proud of your domain name, as many of us are, know that you share ownership of that name with a company that's become famous for super-bad customer service, who also controls every other domain name from aol.com to yahoo.com to joesDiner.com."/>
				<outline text="Esther poses the possibility that we could have another Internet, one that wouldn't be based on .Com names. At first I thought this was unthinkable, now I want to give it some thought. What if we could start over? Let's see how this shapes up. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/5/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Swimming upstream">
				<outline text="The music industry is dragging its feet, bitterly investing in the Internet. (Is that possible?) The artists, at least some of them, want to distribute their work thru the net, but the executives, locked into a certain kind of thinking that I understand (been there myself) want to put the brakes on. "/>
				<outline text="If they had their way there never would have been an MP3, there never would have been a public network. But that's water under the bridge, there is a non-copy-protected format, and there is a public network that's good at distributing the format, and hard disks are big and fast and cheap, so there's a market developing around the new technology, and that market is going to happen, I know it at an intuitive level."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Software copy protection">
				<outline text="Lessons learned in my former life as a software industry exec.."/>
				<outline text="In the mid-80s we tried to copy protect our software. Disks had special tracks that looked bad to the operating system. If you tried to copy the disk, the OS would complain that the disk was bad. When the software started, it would look for the bad block, read the bytes it contains using low level techniques and if the bytes were correct it would run, if not, it would not."/>
				<outline text="This went on for a few years, until the users got smart and made a stink. They argued that copy protection only penalized honest users, that pirates could easily figure out how to work around the tricks. "/>
				<outline text="Eventually companies went into business producing utilities that would &quot;back up&quot; programs with such copy protection. It got so bad that users would report bugs if one of the copy utilities failed to copy your software. "/>
				<outline text="And the letters! The users fumed with profanity. Letterheads like Ford, Boeing, NASA and MIT, even record companies, they weren't pirates, they were the customers we wanted to buy and be happy with our software! "/>
				<outline text="As a software company president it was hard to digest. On one hand, we believed that no one would pay for the software if it wasn't protected; on the other hand, we were interfering with a process we wanted to be easy. (It's unsafe to use software without being protected from disk failure, especially in those days when disks were less reliable, but that's exactly what we were advocating for our users.)"/>
				<outline text="Eventually the copy protection came off, one by one, all the software companies realized that they couldn't be so hostile to their customers and hope to stay in business."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Embrace MP3 as-is">
				<outline text="So when I lecture the execs of the music industry I come from experience. I had to deal with a similar quagmire. "/>
				<outline text="My advice: Get over it and get on with it. "/>
				<outline text="Embrace MP3. The first big label who does will reap huge rewards. The musicians must want it. Most of the customers are honest. We will pay for the tunes we use. New channels can develop. Focus on the honest customers, make product for them, the dishonest ones will get a clue. "/>
				<outline text="(They aren't buying your product anyway.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Lo-rez scans?">
				<outline text="I think there's a simple solution to the problem. Now, it may be naive, I'm just a user, albeit a passionate one. I love music. I almost always have music on when I'm writing and browsing. As the editor of a community site, I'd love to have a song of the day, in fact I do sometimes, but we let the lyrics stand in for the tune. The lyrics of almost every song is on the net somewhere, Alta Vista can find them, and I link to them, and I don't worry about royalties for the record companies, any more than the users of Visicalc and 1-2-3 worried about the profits of Personal Software and Lotus Development."/>
				<outline text="My solution for the record companies -- distribute low-resolution scans of your libraries thru the Internet. On the page where I download the song, include the lyrics, and a One-Click button to purchase the high-resolution version of the song. It arrives on CD a few days later. Each song has an official web page. The pirate sites will wither and go away. The theory is that if I love the music, I'll buy the music. Just give me a reason to buy it. If the hi-rez versions sounds more beautiful, I'll buy it. I like to spend money on the things I like, especially if they're cool. I hate spending money on sticks in the mud, but spending money for courageous leaders, that's easy."/>
				<outline text="I can hear the response. Why should we do that? The answer is what we all know, an informal piracy network already exists. I can already get your song if I look hard enough. But I'm honest and I don't look, yet."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Embrace the web">
				<outline text="All is fair in love and war, and the users are going to war with the record labels and they love the music, so they lose on both counts. And the artists must know, in their guts, that they want to make this transition. (Think of the music they'll create for the new medium. Lead times go to zero! Wow.) "/>
				<outline text="That's why the first label to fully embrace the Internet model will get the support of the artists. In this transition, there will be a leader and bunch of followers. The industry cartel will eventually break because the Internet as a distribution system is way too powerful and opens huge new possibilities for creative people (the musicians)."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Trust the web">
				<outline text="The future is bright, your shareholders will be happy (spin out your Internet brand and IPO it), your customers ecstatic, there will be many ways to profit, and the record stores won't close, at least not for a few years, giving you time to study, listen and learn, and figure out what comes next. The web happened, making much writing free of charge, and it didn't make writers homeless, at least not yet. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Winer">
				<outline text="PS: Software developers are creating great software for managing all those songs on all those hard disks. I downloaded RealJukebox yesterday, and while I couldn't get it to scan my audio CDs, it has a nice outliner-style browser for my music catalog. It's ready for me to start copying songs there. I have a 19 gigabyte hard drive with lots of empty space! Perfect timing. BTW, they're an honest company, they aren't pirating the tunes, but they are making it tempting to do so. There's the market window for one of the big labels. Thanks to Rob Glaser for pressing this issue. The music industry will eventually thank him too, I'm sure of it."/>

				<outline text="I expected Mickey to take odds with my point of view, but, to my surprise, he said the pitch was good, and he saw a win-win coming. This would be incredible. I hope the logjam breaks. Wouldn't it be great if all of a sudden the big name artists of all the big labels were available on the Internet? I think it would make almost everyone happy. In an instant the whole networked music world could grow by a billion percent! "/>

			<outline text="Money on the table">
				<outline text="Back to music.."/>
				<outline text="Lawrence Lee, the editor of the fantastic Tomalak's Realm news site, sent me a pointer, in response to yesterday's piece, that changed my thinking about this music stuff.&lt;p&gt;http://www.phillynews.com/daily_news/99/Apr/30/features/FLOC30.htm "/>
				<outline text="If you're investing in music, media and/or the Internet, read every word of this piece. If their point of view is true, here's the opening. The music business environment is ripe for exploitation by the Internet."/>
				<outline text="A quote. &quot;Where once there were highly competitive radio stations desperate to be the first to play the coolest new releases, now there are a half-dozen massed broadcast groups that barely compete at all. Taking a conservative tack, many have narrowed their pop station playlists to just 15 or 20 songs to build a fat cumulative audience that only has time for a couple hits. To boot, these broadcasters are demanding 'promotional' funds from labels in payback for every song on their short playlist.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="And the labels are cutting down the number of artists they promote. &quot;If I were starting out in today's environment, I don't know if I'd make it,&quot; said Sheryl Crow, one of the few survivors of the recent A&amp;M records consolidation into the Universal Music Group that reduced her label roster from 90-plus acts to eight. &quot;Given today's fragile, singles-driven mentality, I might get so frustrated I'd quit the business..&quot; "/>
				<outline text="If Sheryl Crow almost didn't make the cut, what other big name acts are floating, looking for a way to distribute and sell their music? Flipped around, the record labels, even if they fully embrace the Internet, are leaving a lot of money on the table. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Internet Music Label">
				<outline text="To the high-tech VCs, here's your business model. Start the Internet music label. Contract with the big name performers that the current labels are leaving behind. Give the artists stock options proportional to the number of page reads they generate. Give them a shot to hit the moon. Work around the airwave distribution system. Use the artists' name recognition to build credibility for the Internet Music Hub, which in my humble opinion, does not yet exist."/>

			<outline text="Final note">
				<outline text="I've been switching gears again. "/>
				<outline text="My last eight months were spent with my head down working on the server side of our content management system. After taking a vacation, a very good idea, I've been getting out more, I've been talking with people in the financial community in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, to get an idea of what the world looks like from the financial point of view. After four years of assumption-ripping growth (who would have predicted HotMail or GeoCities?), I wanted to know what their priorities are now, looking forward a few years. "/>
				<outline text="I've learned something very simple. If you show up with an ear and ask questions, even very direct ones, people will tell you what they know and how they're betting. The eyes are burning bright here in Silicon Valley these days, very high energy. People are doing big things. All kinds of unusual people are joining VC firms. Stay tuned, there are going to be some very interesting stories to tell."/>

				<outline text="But what if I got what I wanted? Would I be happy? Read on.."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Money on the table">
				<outline text="I got a great response to last Thursday's piece about money left on the table in the music industry. I've been forwarding some of the more interesting responses to people I know in the music business. "/>
				<outline text="Just to let everyone know, lots of Silicon Valley people would love a shot at the Internet Music Label. There is a consensus that it would rise, would IPO and would make jillions of dollars. Which is, after all, the goal of the labels, to return value to the shareholders?"/>
				<outline text="I know the music business is complex, but I see it as simple. As a user of the product I don't care how it gets to my ears. I want maximum convenience. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A web that sings to you?">
				<outline text="Viewing the business as simple because the user sees it simply is consistent with the many axioms of business. You know, the customer is always right. That's why I named my company UserLand, to remind me what's important. It's a dream I lose for a time then it comes back into focus. &quot;It's the Users Dummy!&quot; could my constant slogan."/>
				<outline text="To a user, music is about inspiration, emotions, memories, revelations and aspirations. You can't have a party without music. A song from childhood brings you back to the feelings of childhood. Music is a trigger, it opens windows inside ourself. With music comes security and revolution. It can jar your assumptions (Reggae), challenge your fears (Rap), and warm you like a snug blanket (Motown)."/>
				<outline text="And music is international. I might not understand a foreign people when they write, but their melodies can tell me what's inside them that crosses language barriers, but not cultural ones. Learning a culture thru its music destroys neural pathways, breeds understanding and defeats war. "/>
				<outline text="To the user the music business is simple but the content is complex. Today we're using the Silent Web. I can't wait for singing and talking sites. The Dancing Hamsters were just the beginning. Music can charm and music can arouse. Music is simple and music is complex."/>

				<outline text="And I have conditions on success. It's only interesting if I do it without the need for the usual trappings of corporatia, no need to market or sell or support the product. The product is so sexy the cash starts rolling in and everyone says &quot;Dave Winer is a smart guy!&quot; They keep giving me money to fund all my new ideas. I get to rewrite the rules of the industry. Everyone is happy because I am such a benevolent leader."/>
				<outline text="What a dream!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The stories are not the people">
				<outline text="I can be forgiven for believing this myth because everything I've ever read or heard about the heroes of creativity focused on the individual accomplishment. "/>
				<outline text="A short list of famous individual accomplishers. Steve Jobs, Mitch Kapor, Bill Gates, Bill Joy, Larry Ellison, Marc Canter, Marc Andreessen, Jerry Yang, Kim Polese, and now Linus Torvalds and Eric S. Raymond; and in a different way, behind the scenes people like Ben Rosen, John Doerr and Jim Clark. "/>
				<outline text="But the stories aren't people, they're just stories. Myths. Familiar stories like the songs of childhood. Usually David versus Goliath. Our heroes are dragon-slayers. We love to hear this story over and over. It's warm like a blanket, and inspiring in a nervous kind of way. But all the same it's a lie, not sustainable on a personal level. The traditional story doesn't have a happy ending. "/>
				<outline text="The key point is the separation of the myth from reality. Stop for a moment and let it sink in. The stories are not the people. The stories are not the people. You can achieve the story, but you can't live the story. When you wake up in the morning you still are yourself no matter who the world thinks you are."/>

				<outline text="You might actually *be* smarter, or not. After all, they are just people. A skeleton, a brain, flesh, blood, chemicals. A limited lifespan. Sometimes I think Bill Gates might be twice as smart as I am. That means he's worth two Dave Winers, not ten billion. There's only so much growing a single human being can do."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A single human?">
				<outline text="Why one entrepreneur hits a home run and another languishes has more to do with the times, and how the team of people behind the front-person executes. All companies are dysfunctional. Part of the dysfunction is the  idea that the company is realized in a single brain. "/>
				<outline text="I still believe some brains resonate with the world more effectively than others, and some brains can teach other brains how to resonate. Yes it matters, very much, who is leading a company. But after that, is the person attractive and is the pattern their brain sees in harmony with the way the world is going? Luck plays a big role too. "/>
				<outline text="Most of the heroes we look up to were good at picking up other people's ideas, not synthesizing their own. Some of them have no ideas at all, they just are good at sensing where the world is going. And others play the game by covering every bet."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Teams">
				<outline text="So, after you reach the limits of a single human being, what comes next..?"/>
				<outline text="A blind spot, but it was easy to debug for a couple of reasons. First, I already knew the hero myth was a lie (but I forgot to apply it to myself), and second I asked people who start new companies what they're looking for. It's like putting a printf or writeln or dialog.alert statement in a program to debug it. If you don't know what the problem is, just ask."/>
				<outline text="The startup guys, the VCs, are not short on ideas. There are so many open spots as the new e-commerce system builds out. Whole industries are up for grabs. New twists on old industries, like the music and book businesses, even garden supply is being revolutionized by new technology. And whole new industries remain to be created, ones that connect people in ways that take advantage of the new power of the Internet, things you couldn't do over the telephone or TV. This used to be called groupware. It's still a good way to describe what's going on."/>
				<outline text="The startup guys aren't short on ideas, or cash either. What they need are *teams* of people who work well together, who are fresh, smart, fearless and crisp, who move instead of worry. A little bit of experience, but not so much that they get paralyzed. Build a big company quickly. Add another essential ingredient, a hero to meet with reporters, to stand on stage, to rally the users and other developers. But that's just one part. "/>

			<outline text="I see it in my friends">
				<outline text="A friend of mine has an idea. It's a good one. An application for the Internet that no one has thought of? Presumably. Unlikely though, almost every idea has two or three or twenty-three people working on it. My friend is an &quot;idea guy&quot; not a &quot;business guy&quot;. He needs to find his other half. But that's just the beginning of the problem. If you want to win, you need a management team. He asks for help finding a business guy, but I can't help him. I urge him to find a management team he can join, where his ideas and his resume would help launch the company to the stars. It'll be an uphill battle to hire a management team in competition with the VCs, who can offer what every member of a management team wants, the probability of getting rich."/>
				<outline text="Another friend, three years ago, was struggling as the CEO of his own company. An offer comes along to join a management team. A high-flying Internet company of the highest pedigree. He accepts the job. Three years later the company is public and he's a millionaire. No doubt he had to swallow his pride many times in the process. No doubt he's not making progress in his personal competition with the icons of Silicon Valley. But he now has the money to fund his own ideas. He has a nice house and no longer has to worry about money. Do I think that's an accomplishment? Yes I do. It's a huge accomplishment, because he had to overcome the hero myth and be satisfied with being disgustingly wealthy."/>
				<outline text="Accepting this is on the path to happiness. We are all part of something that's much bigger than ourselves. That may be the big lesson of life, it certainly is the lesson of business. In a previous piece I recommended submission. Now I recommend joining. Same thing. Go with the flow. Don't wait for the world to discover your brilliance. Join a team. Make it work. Now, as never before, that formula works. "/>
				<outline text="Seeing this in my friends has helped me see it in myself. No longer am I wanting to be the next Marc Andreessen or Bill Gates, nor am I trying to recapture the glory of my past life as a software entrepreneur. I want to be part of the machine. I want to make happiness and money. I am not the hero. I am not good or bad. I am an average guy who can help. That's all. And that's not bad."/>

				<outline text="My newbie impression is that it could be just like Windows or a Mac. There are too many choices, now the challenge is to further narrow the choices, provide a one-one mapping of functionality that a Windows or Mac user would expect.

				<outline text="I love Linux because it's new and old. On the surface it's a loopy klunky thing, but below it is Unix, an OS that I learned over twenty years ago! It takes me back to good old days in Madison, I had a great time there as a grad student, and part of the wonder of those years were the clean lines and wide open spaces of Unix. "/>
				<outline text="But Linux is new. It's rapidly becoming the serverside of the worldwide web, my middle-aged love. I believe Linux is key to building network apps that can scale to millions of users. So there's a new wonder with my new love! Why not? It's always a good time to fall in love, right?? Can't teach an old dog new tricks? Yeah sure!"/>

				<outline text="I know it's been a long time since I wrote a DaveNet piece. I've been busy working on a new product whose codename is Manila. As they say, I could tell you more, but then I'd have to shoot you! And then I'd be a war criminal, and that would be the end of my career as a software developer and user interface designer. But I digress. Back to Manila."/>
				<outline text="Actually back to the beginning of the Mac, in 1984, when Steve Jobs came up with a brilliant way to describe the difference between the Macintosh and all computers that came before. He called it the computer for the Rest of Us. What a brilliant way to say it. And now given the weird loop that the web created, we're right back there where we were before the Mac."/>
				<outline text="In the last few weeks I've gone all the way back, I became the user interface designer I was before I turned to scripting and web software. Now I'm working on the other end, the complex content management stuff tucked behind interfaces, now it's time to deliver the good stuff to the Rest of Us. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Writing for the web">
				<outline text="Writing for the web is too damned hard. It turns you into a bookkeeper. I've got files all over my hard disk and their counterparts on the server. I can't keep track of them! When I'm reading a web page that I wrote, if I spot a mistake, I have to execute 23 complicated error-prone steps to make the change. "/>
				<outline text="I can't handle it. It's too much work, too much to remember. That's why my website sucks, and yours too. Because I look at the wrong words on my screen and decide that it's too much trouble to get it right."/>
				<outline text="What's needed is a way to put the right software in front of the right keyboards, so people who love to write for the public and who do it well, have an easy way to do it. A place to be heard. A place to teach and learn. A place to be powerful and feel the power of others."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Easy to Use">
				<outline text="Easy to Use used to be a big selling point."/>
				<outline text="Let's make it so again."/>
				<outline text="&quot;Easy easy easy&quot; is my new motto."/>
				<outline text="Just let it be easy."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="User Interface">
				<outline text="Let's study User Interface again. "/>
				<outline text="We did it once. In the 80s there were great books by people like Bruce Tognazzini. We had user interface conferences where people who thought carefully and seriously about making things consistent and easy shared their ideas, much as the people of the Open Source world do with C and Java code. We had user interface guidelines. We worked at making things easy, and that's hard hard work. But it's worth doing. "/>
				<outline text="The world of the web is now familiar enough so that it's not impossible to do an elegant interface in HTML. I know because my team is doing it. I'm teaching my young team members about user interface. And I realize that they're starting from scratch. They've never learned the basic lessons we learned in the 80s. They're not stubborn, they want to make things easy, they just don't know how to do it!"/>
				<outline text="And I barely know how. For the last two weeks I've been coddling and nursing a new piece of software, the Manilla thing I talked about at the beginning of this piece, and now I feel its user interface is about at par with the software I did for character-based PCs in the early 80s. This is quite an accomplishment! It's not exactly the same, because there's a network between the screen and the place where the stories are saved. And it's better because computers can play music and display color photos and animations. But we've now mastered the network, it's out of the way, we understand how it works."/>
				<outline text="And I think I see how to connect the desktop apps to the network, but it requires a radical re-think, and a lot of courage. You get something new, but you have to give something up. Read on.."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="I believe in Network Computing">
				<outline text="I criticized Larry Ellison for promoting the Network Computing idea a few years ago, and I would like to retract the criticism. He was right. I didn't look closely enough at the idea. I didn't have a way to make it work, as a software designer, but now I do. And I'm using it, and I find it every bit as exciting as the Mac was in 1984, and the Internet in 1994. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Edit this Page, Everywhere">
				<outline text="When I'm writing for the web, and I'm browsing my own site, every bit of text that I created has a button that says Edit this Page when I view it. When I click the button, a new page opens with the text in an HTML textarea. I edit. Click on Submit. The original page displays with the change. Three easy steps. The essential element is that *every* bit of text has this button. There can be no exceptions."/>
				<outline text="This is like Undo, a very hard command to implement, it was a small part of the standard Mac User Interface. The guidelines basically said the user would be able to undo everything. Of course that was never really possible. But the principle was hard-ass anyway. The users would like the computers better, and therefore would use them more, if every step could be undone. So we swallowed hard and did the work. From that point on all desktop software was harder to write, but the users wouldn't want it any other way. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="No more FTP">
				<outline text="A few years from now we'll talk about FTP the same way our ancestors talk about punch cards. &quot;Remember the old days when we had to FTP our files up to the server?&quot; Oh we had it tough! Just like the people who used spreadsheets and word processors that didn't have Undo. "/>
				<outline text="We are now deploying Edit this Page sites for people who will *never* learn how to FTP. I love it! They love it. It's cooooooool!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Meet your new File menu!">
				<outline text="Now while this revolution is happening we'll ask you to throw out your old word processor (Sorry!) just like you threw out HyperCard and Visual Basic and Director when the web came along. Why? Because its File menu is wrong. &quot;Such a simple thing,&quot; you might say, &quot;Why do I have to throw out my word processor?&quot; Because it doesn't work on the web, I say. Writing for the web is different from writing for your printer. Your File menu thinks your world revolves around printing. There's the disconnect."/>
				<outline text="Right now the only writing tool that really understands the web is the web browser. Even though it's a very awkward writing tool, I've been using MSIE to write the Scripting News home page for six months. It's got advantages over other writing environments. Simply stated, web browsers understand HTTP at an intimate level. No other writing tool does. That's what makes it worth putting up with its awful text editor. (It's truly an abomination.)"/>
				<outline text="If I owned Microsoft's Word or even WordPad, here's what I would do. Take a snapshot of the codebase, pull out the code behind the File menu and replace it with code that speaks to my server. Let's call this product Corazon (it's close to Manila). When I choose New from Corazon's File menu, it creates a new Untitled window. I type. When I choose Save from the File menu, a dialog appears asking for the Title of the document. It then shoots the file over the net, where it takes its place on the content server that holds my website. Again, no FTP. The computer remembers where my content belongs. It talks to another piece of software that knows how to render the text as a page on the website. It does all the messy complicated work for me. That's how computers are supposed to work."/>
				<outline text="All the remaining commands fall out from there. The File menu which used to work with the local hard disk and network now no longer knows anything about the local environment. It just knows about the Internet. Nothing more. No more Novell, Appletalk, or Microsoft LAN. Goodbye! Just HTTP, nothing more."/>
				<outline text="Now of course I don't own Word or even WordPad, but I do own an excellent writing tool that's a descendent of a tool that was loved by tens of thousands of people in the 80s, and many of them are still out there. My vision of writing for the web is a beautiful outliner, a text tool that understands structure and can easily hide or reveal detail. And has a File menu a web writer would die for."/>
				<outline text="Microsoft may produce a word processor that has this new kind of File menu, and I would welcome it with open arms. Because then we can get on with it. I know not everyone will love my vision of the perfect writing tool. That's OK. Microsoft, do it. Or don't. We're onto it here. We know how to make the web grow. Dumb web hosting -- goodbye. Soon web writing takes the turn for The Rest of Us. Then watch out. It'll be big."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Closing words">
				<outline text="I often open DaveNet pieces with a quote from Jakob Nielsen, a man who has taken many rides on the Cluetrain, who gets it too, and this time I'd like to close with a Nielsen quote. On his website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/&quot;&gt;www.useit.com&lt;/a&gt;, he said yesterday:"/>
				<outline text="&quot;The vertical portal opportunity is screaming at us and nobody is picking it up. A 'just-add-domain-expertise' platform provider could be worth billions.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Jakob, that's the flipside of our vision, and they are equivalent visions. Once we get the software out of the way, provide a server structure that makes an excellent website, with a news page, a calendar, a search engine, and a browsable hierarchy, all editable with easy fun tools that work the way the domain experts want them to, your vertical portal vision will be realized."/>
				<outline text="Easy easy easy!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Winer">
				<outline text="PS: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cluetrain.com/&quot;&gt;ClueTrain.Com&lt;/a&gt; is a great site launched by two of my spiritual brothers, Christopher Locke and Doc Searls. I was an early endorser of the site. It's great stuff."/>
				<outline text="PPS: A new style for typing domain names, combines the best of the OldSoftwareWorld with the dot-com rage. Use MixedCase and throw a .Com at the end. ClueTrain.Com, BucksWoodside.Com or my own hub, UserLand.Com. It's the new style. Be hip. Do it nice."/>
				<outline text="PPPS: It would be a piece of cake to hook Emacs or Vi to my Manila server. And BBEdit too! It'll happen for sure."/>
				<outline text="PPPPS: The Manila name came to me as I was thinking about folders. And Corazon is the name of Corazon Acquino, the first elected leader of the Philippines after the revolution that ousted Ferdinand Marcos. Corazon is a beautiful word, in Spanish it's the heart. "/>

			<outline text="I love Salon!">
				<outline text="Scott Rosenberg of Salon has a wonderful piece that appeared this morning at:&lt;p&gt;http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/1999/05/28/weblogs/index.html "/>
				<outline text="&quot;On the Web, with its unspannable abundance of chaotic and ill-organized information, pointing people to good links is a fundamental service -- a combination of giving directions to strangers and sharing one's discoveries with friends. All of which explains why a phenomenon known as the weblog is one of the fastest-growing and most fertile creative areas on the Web today.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="In April 1997 I started one of the first weblogs, Scripting News. It's grown, it's one of the few weblogs that generates its own content. And we've also been developing software to bring group writing for the web to a much larger audience."/>
				<outline text="The web is maturing and growing. It's becoming easier to create websites. As time goes by it will become much easier. We'll look back on this period, before 1999, when creating a website was a difficult arcane thing. That's why Amazon looks so good. But what happens when *anyone* can have such a website? Right now a very small percentage of web users have websites. That can and will change."/>
				<outline text="I'll make a prediction. What Amazon did to Barnes and Noble will be done to Amazon. Right now they have a lock on the technology, but that will shift. The web's a very very big place. As Amazon shfits their focus away from books they will have to compete with the web itself, as Yahoo and AOL do, and the cursor will move on. Eventually the monolithic portal will be as big a liability as brick and mortar is today. "/>
				<outline text="Weblogs will enjoy their day in the sun, which looks like what's happening now, but even weblogs will disappear, will go the way of the portal. The PCs we run will be able to capture the diversity of the web in new ways, using software running on your home computer, not on a server in Silicon Valley."/>
				<outline text="We'll keep decentralizing. Salon (justifiably) brags that they've matured to the point where they could send a reporter to Yugoslavia. But the web was already there. People on the ground all over the world. Some of them are great writers and have passion for the truth and aren't serving the same masters that the bigtimes at WSJ, NYT and CNN. And most of them don't have websites, yet, largely because it is too complicated and expensive to have one. When this bubble bursts we'll get a new burst of diversity in thought and vision on the web. I look forward to that day."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Concluding the Microsoft Trial&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/3/99; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Greetings!">
				<outline text="And good morning DaveNet readers!"/>
				<outline text="I've been following the Microsoft trial from a distance, waiting to pass judgment on the issues until it was closer to conclusion. Now the thinking is over, and it's time to start writing. Your comments are appreciated. Let's figure this one out."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="HTML in the OS?">
				<outline text="From my point of view, HTML rendering very much belongs in the operating system. Microsoft's argument that the dividing line between applications and the system is fluid matches my experience, not just with Microsoft's system software, but with Apple's and other systems too, including Unix. If you compared today's Unix to the one I used when I was a student in the 1970s, you'd see clearly how time makes an OS bigger, and over time things that were applications inevitably become features of the operating system, again, not just with Windows, with all OSes."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Browser war">
				<outline text="I have also been an observer of the &quot;browser war&quot; between Microsoft and Netscape between 1995 and the present day. Now that Netscape is part of AOL, the war seems to be over. I wrote frequently about the war while it was raging, urging Netscape not to go into a direct faceoff with Microsoft, and pleading with Microsoft to leave Netscape alone for fear of limiting the growth of the web. I exchanged private emails with Marc Andreessen, the public spokesperson for Netscape. I talked with Netscape officers and board members. I emailed and spoke with Microsoft people from top to bottom. I feel very strongly that Netscape defined the terms of competition with Microsoft, they were overly confident, picked a poor strategy, and lost because of that, not because of bad character or practice at Microsoft."/>
				<outline text="I also appreciate the opportunity to see the emails that Microsoft people exchanged over this subject. Clearly Microsoft could use an attitude transformation. They are far more destructive and negative than I would like them to be. I have also publicly urged Microsoft to learn to be more statesmanlike, to behave like the great company they have actually become. "/>
				<outline text="I predicted that they would get mired in legal hassles like this, not because of their strategies, which are reasonable, but are obfuscated by their tactics. I was visiting Microsoft the day their trick on Judge Jackson became public, and on that day I said to the people I was visiting that I was ashamed to be part of the software business because of what Microsoft was doing. It was a game they couldn't win. Jackson is like a customer. You don't want to see customers humiliated in public at the hands of a mere software vendor. "/>
				<outline text="But we can put that behind us. Clearly Microsoft will be more careful in the future. I think they got the message here. And I don't think AOL management will engage Microsoft at the level that Netscape did. I think either the browser war is over, or it's moving to a new more subtle level of sophistication."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Concluding the war and trial">
				<outline text="So, as a software developer and a person with a sense of right and wrong, and a stake in its outcome, here's what I'd like to see come out of the browser war and the trial that resulted from it"/>
				<outline text="First, I do not want to see Microsoft penalized for the demise of Netscape. It's impossible to know to what extent Microsoft is responsible for that. Netscape played stupid and dirty, if they had executed even reasonably well, I believe they would have established a niche that Microsoft would not have been able to undermine."/>
				<outline text="Further, Netscape blew a major opportunity with independent web developers, a powerful body of talent, who as a group did not and still do not see themselves as Microsoft developers. The opportunity that Netscape abandoned is still there. AOL would do well to stop disclaiming any interest in the browser, and get busy with the real work of building systems designed for web developers and their users. The court has encouraged irresponsible behavior on AOL's part, and as a member of the web developer world I do not appreciate this!"/>
				<outline text="Further, the HTML renderer, the software at issue in this case, definitely has a place in the operating system. As Microsoft has built software that depends on this, so have many developers, including my company. It helps the simplification process, both for users and for developers. The same skills apply no matter what software they're using. And the same code can run either from a remote server or from server software located on the user's hard disk. To force removal of the HTML renderer from the OS would be a major setback to the growth of the web, both as a medium for e-commerce, but also as a literary and journalistic medium. "/>
				<outline text="As a developer of software for both the Mac OS and Windows, I strongly believe that the Mac OS is at a disadvantage because it doesn't have system-level HTML rendering. To me this is the key test. I would prefer to see HTML rendering in the Mac OS, not have it taken out of Windows."/>
				<outline text="So I think the best most positive conclusion is to require that Microsoft open up HTML rendering to other software, including Netscape's, but also to software from other developers. I want an API in place, and a system-level &quot;Control Panel&quot; that allows the user to choose his or her favorite rendering engine. Hardware OEMs must have a choice about how that is configured, and Microsoft must learn how to ship and support systems that allow the OEMs basic branding choices. "/>
				<outline text="To argue otherwise, on Microsoft's part, is disingenuous. Of course they can support systems that use Netscape's rendering engine. This is a responsible thing to do for their customers, many of whom would prefer to use Netscape's software over Microsoft's. Microsoft claims to be customer-driven, so let the customers drive. They want choice. Give it to them."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Real steps to reform">
				<outline text="Further, I would like to see Microsoft unilateraly concede that all future &quot;assumptions&quot; of functionality in the OS will provide a similar control panel and customer choice. It's a fact that Windows is the dominant OS and that their practices have served to limit customer choice. They must correct this, and in order for it to work the solution must be self-imposed and real. Microsoft must learn to restrain their own power. I believe that's what the case is really about. Connecting with Microsoft at this level. "/>
				<outline text="It's time for Microsoft to act in favor of the big picture, not just in Microsoft's limited perception of its self-interest. This is what has gotten them in trouble, and this and only this is what must change. The world has grown outside of Microsoft's reach. This is good! There's nothing Microsoft can do about this. And there's nothing the government should have to do that Microsoft can't do for itself. Gates is right, it's a fluid business. Now he's got to realign with reality. "/>
				<outline text="He wasn't powerful enough to erase Netscape, he needed Netscape's help to do that, and it's not even over yet, nor will it be if AOL does a reasonable job of managing Netscape. And Netscape is just a small part of it. There are lots of leaks in the Microsoft boat, if their goal is to dominate all software-related activity. The world wants some of what Microsoft offers, but they want to buy from others too. That won't change. It's time for Microsoft to open itself up, join the rest of the industry, learn how to work with others and stop being so obsessed with its own process. This would be good for Microsoft, not bad. "/>
				<outline text="So, to me, as an independent software developer, I'm looking to Microsoft to overcome its own history and the history of the software industry, to assume a position of true leadership, not to wait for a decision to be handed down by the court. I want Microsoft to take real steps to reform itself, some reasonable rules that they must operate under. To start conversing with the industry they lead, as a leader would."/>
				<outline text="Thanks for listening!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Dave Winer">
				<outline text="PS: To conclude is to &quot;decide by reasoning.&quot; A conclusion is &quot;a judgment reached after consideration.&quot; To reform is to &quot;change for the better as a result of correcting abuses.&quot; To obfuscate is to &quot;make obscure or unclear.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="As you may know, in March we started a new syndication server called My.UserLand.Com. Along with Netscape's My.Netscape.Com, we are operating compatible servers that support a new web content syndication format called RSS. Our servers have been operating for three months, aggregating popular news channels and weblogs to each of our respective audiences."/>
				<outline text="There was an initial rush of new channels following Netscape's press release, followed by steady growth, three or four new channels every week. In the meantime we've been working on the other side of the equation, browser-based editorial software to make it easy to create vertical portals managed by potentially large teams of writers and photographers. Our attention shifted to the authoring and content management side. "/>
				<outline text="Well, today our attention was forced (in a good way) to focus on the server side of the equation again!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="An amazing day for syndication">
				<outline text="With absolutely no coordination, today four new channels came online, all of them from prestigious net news sources. "/>
				<outline text="The channels are ZDNet UK, The Register, Dr Dobbs Journal and MacWEEK. What's remarkable about this group is that each of these services use different content management software yet they plug into our Frontier-based content system thru the magic of XML. "/>

Each serve audiences that are high up the curve of computer sophistication, ranging from the highly technical Dr Dobbs, to the designer and graphics-focused MacWEEK.

				<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://206.204.24.3/bucksimages/jamissmall.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;2&quot; vspace=&quot;2&quot;&gt;BucksWoodside.Com is the web forum for my friend Jamis MacNiven, the owner of Buck's, a very creative and warm-hearted guy who can write and has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buckswoodside.com/pictures/viewer$114&quot;&gt;digital camera&lt;/a&gt;. His restaurant has grown to become one of the central gathering places of the entrepreneurial community in Silicon Valley. We call the site &quot;Silicon Valley's premier see-and-be-seen networking and gustatory hotspot,&quot; and like Buck's itself, the position is a little over-stated, but accurate. You never know who you'll run into in Buck's, what historic deal is hatching at the next table. Some people believe that on a typical weekday morning $20 million in business is done over the bagels and Chorizo Scrambles and cafe lattes."/>
				<outline text="Jamis is a collector and a social butterfly. His restaurant has airplanes and spacesuits hanging from the ceiling! And 1950s pocketbooks and a talking buffalo. Like Lee of Siam Garden in Menlo Park, Jamis greets his customers, sits down and tells you what the world looks like to him. And with all that goes on at Buck's every day, he tells quite an interesting story."/>
				<outline text="Anyway, I'm a regular at Buck's, and I've always been saying that Jamis should have a website. In February of this year I was having lunch there, and said it again, and this time he said yes, and I could tell he meant it. In the interim we met many times, and two weeks ago, the Buck's website went live. I am so proud of what we've accomplished, with our technology and Jamis's stories and pictures. So many big ideas have hatched at Buck's. Our job is to bring them to you on the web. I hope you'll all check it out!"/>

				<outline text="I'm about half-way thru Alan Cooper's excellent &quot;The Inmates are Running the Asylum&quot;. "/>
				<outline text="http://cooper.com/design.html "/>
				<outline text="It's such a good book, and very timely for me. I'm deliberately seeking more input on user interface issues, as a refresher, to help my team do better work, and to catch up on what I've missed while I've been exploring web development software. Cooper, along with Tog and Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, have been my teachers."/>
				<outline text="One of Cooper's theses is that the reason the web is so popular is that software that you run on the web doesn't require installation. Before the web, all software products required complex installation, and users and system managers rightly hated this error-prone and time-consuming process. But Cooper points out that it's a sham. He says &quot;The only reason non-browser programs require installation is that's the way programmers have always done things.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="He makes an excellent point! The web is simpler for the user, it gave them a feature that the software industry would never have thought to give them. But what a step backward! I have so little control as a software designer, after five years of working in the web, I'm only now feeling like I'm not stumbling around in the dark, and now that I can see what's going on, it's like GUIs never happened!"/>
				<outline text="I predict a loop-back, that we can bring the simplicity of the web to desktop tools, marry the two, and live happily ever after. (Until the *next* revolution!)"/>

			<outline text="Office 2000">
				<outline text="Later today I'll attend the Office 2000 rollout in San Francisco, and meet with Microsoft people on some of the issues above, and perhaps others."/>
				<outline text="As an introduction, there was an excellent article in Saturday's SJ Merc on the web authoring features of Office 2000. &quot;In any Office 2000 application, you can select Save to the Web from the File menu at the top of the screen. You can then open Web Folders and put the Office 2000 document directly onto the server, with Office 2000 automatically handling the chore of translating the Word document or Excel spreadsheet or PowerPoint presentation into HTML.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/testdrive/docs/ml060699.htm "/>
				<outline text="Sorry Microsoft, but this is a klooge on top of an old paradigm. The users are going to screw it up and lose documents at an even higher rate than they do now. It can be much simpler for people who choose to write only for the web. Microsoft must (or chooses to) do a balancing act, they serve the installed base, and make it easy for them to write for the web, while not taking away any features that relate to writing for printing."/>
				<outline text="But Microsoft's disadvantage is everyone else's advantage! We don't have to serve the installed base, we can create a new one. When it's all done, only a complete rewrite of the File menu will work. The more I focus on UI design, and the more we experiment in our own development at UserLand, the more sure I am of this. Only when you forget about the local file system can you make web writing truly easy for writers and system managers."/>

				<outline text="Good morning!"/>
				<outline text="As promised, I went to the Microsoft Office 2000 rollout yesterday at Sony's new Metreon complex in San Francisco."/>
				<outline text="SF Mayor Willie Brown introduces MS President Steve Ballmer. The big names were there, reps from all the bigtime pubs, but the content of the event, Office 2000, was disturbing to me. I wanted to know if this would be the last version of Office. I wondered if Office is really relevant, or if this is the last generation's last gasp before succumbing to the new way. "/>
				<outline text="I wanted to ask questions, but I didn't. I consider this a tremendous act of restraint on my part. The last time I was invited to a big industry press conference I couldn't help myself and it resulted in me not being invited back. This time I saved my questions for this DaveNet piece. "/>
				<outline text="So here are the questions I would have asked.."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Questions">
				<outline text="1. This appears to be a battle between Office and the web, and of course Office won, or so Microsoft says. Office embraces the web, but is Microsoft's web the same as The Real Web? "/>
				<outline text="2. If the browser is part of the OS, is it also part of Office? I see MSIE as something separate from Office. Is this correct?"/>
				<outline text="3. Does Microsoft leave features out of the browser to encourage people to buy Office? "/>
				<outline text="4. Can I use Netscape's browser to be part of Microsoft's web? What about Mac users? Palm Pilot users? What if I like Linux? Can I be part of Microsoft's web?"/>
				<outline text="5. Does Microsoft have any competition in the app suite market? If so, are they trying to embrace and extend the web too? If there is no real competition, where does Microsoft get its ideas from?"/>
				<outline text="6. Does anyone really need all these features? Does anyone use them? Can one mind comprehend three CDs worth of software? Would today's Office make any sense to someone who had never used an Office suite?"/>
				<outline text="7. What is Office? One or two sentences please."/>
				<outline text="8. If Office was a good idea in the 1980s is it still a good idea for the 2000s? If you were going to start developing a new Office now for shipment in 2002, what would it look like? Would it in any way resemble what we saw yesterday? "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The penguin was there">
				<outline text="Like a scene from Microserfs, there were a couple of reps from Penguin Computing outside the event being young and enthusiastic and handing out leaflets. One was dressed in a penguin costume! "/>
				<outline text="The SF police kicked them out. I asked the cops if this was legal, they said it was private property. But I saw homeless people selling street newspapers. "/>
				<outline text="I felt sad for the Linux youngsters, but sadder for Microsoft. In the old days they would have enjoyed this. Microsoft used to be this scrappy. Gotta love the Linux attitude."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Me and Office">
				<outline text="Even though I've had Office installed on my system for two years, I still don't consider myself an Office user. I switch computers too often. I've never set aside any time to learn how to use it. I'm too busy creating content and software for the web!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Office takes no risks">
				<outline text="Yesterday I decided that Microsoft is like Merrill Lynch, Barnes and Noble and The New York Times. Doomed to be overcome by the web. "/>
				<outline text="Office shows development muscle and a tremendous coordinated resolve to overcome challenges, and this it does very well. But its imagination is missing in action. It takes no risks. There's no sweeping vision, no possibility of doing something powerful and new. "/>
				<outline text="Office 2000 is not fun. I think even Microsoft would admit that. Office doesn't really embrace the web because the web isn't just about HTTP, HTML and XML -- in a larger sense the web is about fun!"/>

				<outline text="Just a brief piece today to correct something said in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/byteAndTheMerc&quot;&gt;last piece&lt;/a&gt; and to get some new ideas out there about fear and software and Microsoft."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="You don't need Office">
				<outline text="First, a loop to close. Jakob Nielsen said you gotta have Microsoft Office or you won't be able to read the Word, PowerPoint and Excel files people send you via email. A couple of comments on that one. "/>
				<outline text="1. There are reader apps. Microsoft provides them for Windows users. And the Linux guys are happy to point out that they have reverse-engineered all of Microsoft's file formats, so you don't even have to use Windows to open those files."/>
				<outline text="2. Maybe you don't want to open them? Opening email enclosures is the number one way for terrible viruses to enter your system over the Internet. This week a new virus came along, Worm.ExplorerZip, a very bad one, and yup it gets into your system thru email and propogates via email. It depends on people being fooled into opening something that appears at first to be a WinZip file (which would be harmless), but isn't. And the Melissa virus was just a Word document with macros. So be very careful what you open up thru your email program. Clicking on URLs is harmless, double-clicking on enclosures is something to do only after a lot of thought."/>
				<outline text="In summary, you don't need Office to open Office files that come via email, and you should think twice before you do."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Message to Microsoft">
				<outline text="My &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/office2000&quot;&gt;Tuesday piece&lt;/a&gt; got a brief email exchange going with a few Microsoft people about the role of Microsoft Office vs Microsoft Internet Explorer. It's also getting me to rethink my position on the regulatory loop that Microsoft is in with the courts. "/>
				<outline text="I'm trying to parse my confusion. Did they snooker me into becoming an Office developer? I never wanted to do that. I like the web. But now the only browser with installed base and momentum and support from the owner (theoretically) is Microsoft's. This, to me, is like the fox guarding the hen house. As a web guy, this is very uncomfortable. The release of Office 2000 raises all my fears."/>
				<outline text="To Microsoft, I'm not sure it's possible to answer all the questions. Office is a huge piece of software, and along comes the Internet and screws with everything that Office does. Office 2000 is remarkable for the breadth of its embrace of the web. But in doing so, it alters the web, and that's pretty sacred turf, for me and for many other people. So Microsoft is scared, and in expressing that, they evoke my fear! This is not a good place to be. "/>
				<outline text="My pitch to Microsoft, maybe not to the Office team, is to invest in the browser, independent of Office. As a developer who has made a substantial investment in MSIE, I don't like that all the good editing features came in Office. The browser is definitely a writing environment. I don't know if MS realizes this. Leaving the writing environment so barren in MSIE while building out so much in Office is a big problem for the web. That and the disappearance of Netscape. "/>
				<outline text="We're in an awkward mode now. If you want to get out of a place of fear you have to lead a little. This means improving MSIE without tying it to Word. It's pretty simple. "/>
				<outline text="If you doubt that the browser is a writing environment, try using Hotmail as your exclusive email interface for a week. It'll open your eyes. I think if you care about your users you'll generate a two-page feature and bug-fix list. Such improvements will allay much of the fear you hear in my piece, and would engage Microsoft in the web in a way that Microsoft knows how to engage -- feature requests and bugfixes. This is the culture, right?? "/>
				<outline text="Stated another way, the key is to embrace the *users* of the web, not just the technology of the web. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Male bashing">
				<outline text="Last week there was a conference on women in computing, so there were quite a few articles on the web about women and their use of computers. That's cool, but it seems every article includes one or two sweeping negative statements about men. The following article has three. Can you spot them?&lt;p&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/07/BU11357.DTL "/>
				<outline text="There are so many ways to say this is wrong. The Golden Rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, two wrongs don't make a right, what goes around comes around, you reap what you sow. Here's what I have to say. I'm a man and I don't like it. "/>
				<outline text="Male bashing makes it difficult for people who happen to be men, like me, who want to do the right thing by women, to be respectful, to have fun with them, and enjoy the species we share. Sure, it was bad before we were born, and it's bad now, for some, but if you use your new power to hurt men, no matter how they are with women, you lose. "/>
				<outline text="The best way to express your new power is thru love, not fear. And male bashing, that many women think is fun, is fear, the opposite of love. Be inclusive not exclusive. The women are just as bad as the men they complain about. And if you think men don't care, think again. We're people, we're not that different from you."/>
				<outline text="So if you're serious about being in your power, lose the snicker. If you want respect, give it. You'll be amazed what comes back to you."/>

			<outline text="A format split">
				<outline text="As I've written previously, when Netscape came out with their web syndication format in March, it was too good an opportunity to pass on. We had been working in this area for over a year, on two of three sides of the problem, as a content developer, publishing an XML-syndicated channel; and as a tools vendor, providing software to organizations that develop web news channels. The third side, operating a syndication hub, was something we hadn't explored yet, because there wasn't enough support among web developers to do so. "/>
				<outline text="Enter Netscape. With some fanfare, in March they introduced RSS, and quickly there were a hundred compatible channels. We quickly shifted, did three revs of My.UserLand.Com, and now we're operating an RSS content server on the web, and are covering all three sides of this equation. "/>
				<outline text="But RSS is woefully inadequate. It's missing the key thing web writers and readers need. A channel is not a series of links pointing to articles, it's a set of paragraphs that point to one or more articles *per paragraph*. We told Netscape this, and they said they would work with us on the next rev of the spec. "/>
				<outline text="Now, being an experienced commercial developer for twenty years, I know that such promises mean almost nothing. And with all the departures at Netscape, it's not surprising that they went forward with the next rev without our help. When I became aware of this, we immediately tooled up a new version of our format, and addressed the issues needed to bring it to parity with RSS. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="An A-B Comparison">
				<outline text="Here's the Netscape-compatible version of the Scripting News channel:"/>
				<outline text="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/channelskinny.gif "/>
				<outline text="Now here's the &quot;fat&quot; version:"/>
				<outline text="http://206.204.24.3/snimages/channelfat.gif "/>
				<outline text="I think it's pretty clear that the second one is better. Writing happens in paragraphs. Web writing allows links to be anywhere. To limit channels to one link per paragraph is not good! Technology serves writers and readers, they shouldn't be limited by technology."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Outcome">
				<outline text="I hope Netscape will now work with us so this world doesn't have to fragment. I think we were generous by holding back on our format to see if we could work with Netscape. We published our format publicly in 1997, long before Netscape entered this area. We informed many Netscape people about it. Unfortunately most, if not all of them no longer work at Netscape. To the current management at Netscape, whoever they may be, let's work together."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;6/18/99; 8:30:01 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A new website">
				<outline text="This morning we are rolling out a new website and a new partnership."/>
				<outline text="The website is Linux.UserLand.Com. We think of it as our laboratory for development on Linux. Our goal is to connect editorial tools and content management software running on Windows and Mac with fast scalable server software running on Linux and other flavors of Unix. "/>
				<outline text="The partnership is with Digital Creations, the company behind Zope, the leading content management software on Unix."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="An A-B Comparison">
				<outline text="The first step was to do a Linux clone of one of our NT-hosted membership-based sites. "/>
				<outline text="We chose WhoIs.UserLand.Com because it's a simple site, but it's dynamic and keeps a list of remembered domain names using membership and preferences. If it performs well on Linux, it's reasonable to assume that our other dynamic membership-based sites will perform well too."/>
				<outline text="It makes for a great A-B comparison. How do the two operating systems compare at deploying a functionally identical site? The answer is pretty clear. Linux runs faster. That's good, because that's what we want from Linux. A reasonably robust feature set so our sites can compete with the best sites at Yahoo, CNET, ZDNet, AOL, Netscape, etc. And high performance so our sites can scale up to serve millions of users."/>
				<outline text="http://whois.userland.com/ (The Windows NT version.)"/>
				<outline text="http://linux1.userland.com/whois/ (The Linux version.)"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="XML-RPC for Linux">
				<outline text="The second step was to be able to send XML-RPC messages to software running on Linux, basically turning Linux into a scripting environment that could plug into compatible environments on other operating systems. "/>
				<outline text="We chose to go with Zope (more on that later) because it gave us the best performance and easiest programming. We have this working now, and the source code is released and you can do anything you want to with it, with or without giving us credit. (How's that for a no-nonsense open source license?)"/>
				<outline text="http://linux.userland.com/stories/storyReader$18 "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Zope">
				<outline text="In doing this work we had to make a lot of choices. What database to use? What scripting language? Which web server? We tried working in PHP, but found that its interface to databases isn't uniform, and it's relatively low-level compared to the server environment we're accustomed to on Windows/Mac. PHP is comparable to WebSiphon on the Mac and ASP and Cold Fusion on Windows. Thru this lens we could see clearly how much more Frontier is doing for us on Windows. We want to build on something comparable on Linux."/>
				<outline text="That led us to Zope. More than anything else available on Unix, Zope is closest to the rich runtime environment of Frontier. And Zope is built on Python, the Unix scripting language that's closest in philosophy and design to our own scripting language, UserTalk."/>
				<outline text="And Zope is open source, which made it easier to invest. After all, we own it just as much as anyone else does. So we asked the Zope people if they would include our code in the standard Zope distribution and they said yes. Excellent! This is more proof that collaboration is possible, not only across operating systems, but across economic systems. "/>
				<outline text="I like the way this is going. The net result is that Zope will soon speak XML-RPC, and that means that it will be easy to build distributed systems that leverage the advantages of all three operating systems, Mac OS, Windows NT and Linux. This will be historic when it's delivered."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Mac/Windows">
				<outline text="So now I have stuff to say to our current users and developers."/>
				<outline text="First, we believe Windows/Mac make an excellent high-performance workgroup server, or even a public web server for a moderate-flow, membership-based dynamic site, serving up to 50,000 Frontier-rendered pages per day. However, if you want to deploy a public dynamic site handling more traffic, neither Mac OS or Windows NT, running on today's hardware, can handle that kind of load."/>
				<outline text="Also, the Mac/Windows platform provides the richest base of tools and browsers, far richer than Unix. Further, most computer users use Windows, with Macintosh a strong second. So the fact that we already have strong tools on these platforms is an advantage we fully plan to leverage with future products. The goal is to simplify the web-writing experience. As I've said before, having strong content management software on servers is critical to making that work, but it's also important to have easy-to-use software running on the popular desktop platforms."/>
				<outline text="Second, we are porting Frontier to Linux. As we take these first steps, there's nothing existing Frontier developers have to do, other than watch, or if you want, get involved and make a contribution. Our goal in getting Frontier to Linux is to create a high-level web writing system that can scale up to Yahoo or eBay levels of traffic. The first step is to start porting sites so we learn from others which issues to push and which to hold back on. Even Linux has its limits. We don't know how high Zope can scale. We're going to hop around quite a bit, try out lots of ideas, quickly, and see what makes sense."/>
				<outline text="We're opening this process because that's what makes sense to us. We're investing in Linux because that also makes sense. We're investing in Zope and Python because we're kindred souls, we have compatible philosophies, so it's easy to make our software compatible. We're publishing source code and tutorials to show people how to use their Mac and Windows skills to deploy scalable applications on Linux. Our focus is on building systems that leverage the advantages of all platforms. We don't have an allegiance to any individual platform. We don't want to see Microsoft or Apple lose. We just want to make great servers and web writing environments and help others do the same. "/>

			<outline text="Bulletins">
				<outline text="I've been trying out a new feature, it's still not quite sticky (a Macromedia term when applied to websites, and a good one). The feature is called Bulletins and if you're a UserLand.Com member, you can opt-in to receive Bulletins, via email, either plaintext or HTML. About 200 die-hard Scripting News fans have signed up, and to them I send two or three emails a day, often a small idea I'd like people to focus on, or something new or newsworthy. It's been going for about two weeks, we're still learning how it works."/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="Changed writing style">
				<outline text="It has changed my writing style. I now have something between a Scripting News item (a lightweight thing) and a DaveNet piece (relatively heavy). And it yields succint statements that are off the top of my head, but sometimes one of them stands the test of time, like the one following. It's just a little bit of advice to Microsoft  as they try to digest the Internet. It's based on email exchanges with a few Microsoft people over the last week. I don't want to say who because the exchanges have been very different and very frank. It seems Microsoft as a collective is doing a lot of thinking now about next steps to take and they all involve the Internet in some way."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Advice to Microsoft">
				<outline text="View Linux as you viewed the Mac in 1983. It's a puzzle and a curveball. You don't own it. Find out what developers want to do with Linux, then provide tools that make that easy. Create bridges from Microsoft desktop apps to servers running on Linux. Invest in WINE so Windows developers have a clear path to Linux without creating new source code bases. "/>
				<outline text="I can hear Bill Gates now saying &quot;Never!&quot; But until he embraces the Internet, in its latest incarnation (Linux), without trying to own it, he'll keep losing. And yes, they are losing. Ownership of the browser is worth bupkis. There will be a dozen browsers in two years. The Internet game is about flow and money, Microsoft has attracted very little of either. MSIE is free, and their portals have been disasters."/>
				<outline text="They can't focus on the Internet as long as they're protecting Office and competing with other companies. This is another dual-disaster. Office has run its course. They keep looking for a company to compete with. But the Internet is not a company."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The Internet is not a company">
				<outline text="It's too bad Silicon Valley turned Netscape into a company. It would have been much more successful as a cause. There are more and more developers who do not want to be Microsoft developers. That's what Netscape was a marker for. That, and Java, and now Linux."/>
				<outline text="Microsoft, in its DNA knows how to exist in such a world. It's a 23 year old company. Only three or four of those years were spent being dominant in the developer world. They have a lot of experience thriving in a world where they are not the only game in town. That's the way the world is again. That's why it should be easy for Microsoft to give in, say uncle already, and let the Internet swarm all over them."/>
				<outline text="In other words, instead of Embrace and Extend.. Embrace and Support. Or Embrace and Get Over It. Or Embrace and Relax. Seriously, Microsoft is a bundle of energy. Why?"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Doc">
				<outline text="Saturday morning I had breakfast at Buck's with Doc Searls and Phil Hughes of Linux Journal. A snippet from the conversation. Doc says he admires Microsoft for being able to &quot;turn on a dime&quot; to embrace the Internet. I realized that Microsoft had not turned at all. What's actually been happening is that Microsoft is exerting tremendous energy to stay right where it is. Such a waste, they could be kicking back and stay right where they are. (And of course nothing stays where it is. The world is revolving at 1000 MPH. We're all getting older. And new people are being born. And some of them are growing up and want more options than IIS, VB and ASP.)"/>
				<outline text="In the end, the turn of the earth has more effect on the position of Microsoft than anything Microsoft does. I've read the history, I've watched up-close for five years as Microsoft has struggled and then struggled again with the Internet, and they never overcome it, and they never will. It's a fascinating show of hubris. The answer is so obvious, just ask what the world wants, and do your best to give it to them. Microsoft keeps trying to rephrase the questions and the world keeps saying &quot;No, that's not what we meant.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Hey all this is from my point of view. A student of Microsoft and the Internet and a proud Internet developer who supports Windows because it's an excellent operating system that lots of people use. Can Microsoft be anything else to me? Probably not. But that's not so bad!"/>

				<outline text="A beautiful party last night. Wired hosts. Po Bronson signs his new book. The venue, my favorite Silicon Valley hangout, Buck's. Yes, it's party season in the valley. It's summer. The weather is so disarming. So is the cry of love! (Oh Bonnie.)"/>
				<outline text="The people were so beautiful last night! I love parties with happy people. After the party a small group gathered at my house, I only knew a few of them, but it turns out that some of them knew me. One of them, a business development guy, a hired gun for big companies, is a regular reader of Scripting News, the website I run. He's a smart guy. We cross paths in other contexts, but I had no idea that such a person would be a regular at my website."/>
				<outline text="It's for people like this that I do Scripting News. I look for cross-over. We already have an international technical audience. As a group we can tackle almost any problem involving bits and nets. It's an embrace of the Microsoft spirit of loving a technical challenge, without the killer bite. It's been my bet that the net can do positive, even loving things, without sacrificing the technology. So far so good."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Back to Buck's">
				<outline text="Now, I can explain why I wanted to participate in the BucksWoodside.Com site. It's part of the cross-over. Buck's is our attempt to understand the culture of the financial community in Silicon Valley."/>
				<outline text=" I want the rewards to flow both ways. Our scripting guys do great technology, all over the world, 7-by-24. This is what the financial people are looking for -- we want to learn to speak their language so we can do great business together. Last night's party was a step in that direction."/>

				<outline text="The best line: &quot;I felt like I was living in NYC once again.&quot; What a great way to sum it up. That's what I'm looking for from Silicon Valley too. So many great people live here now. We need more parties, where the person standing next to you turns out to be someone who you can be creative with. Last night's party was a milestone in that way."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Syndication">
				<outline text="Hey the same thing is happening on the web!"/>
				<outline text="Every day more people and organizations start news sites like Buck's and Scripting News. These news sites are also known as &quot;weblogs.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="There are all kinds of weblogs, some covering the MP3 music world, others for Linux and open source development. Wired News is a news site, as is The Motley Fool, Linux Today and Mozilla.Org. The list goes on and on. Tomalak's Realm, XML.COM, CamWorld, Robot Wisdom, Internet Alchemy. A Boy and His Basement and PyrAlert. I can't drop all the names in a DaveNet. There are too many!"/>
				<outline text="Lately there's been a wave of standardization in this world. The hot weblogs are supporting various XMLizations, one proposed by Netscape, and one proposed by my own company, UserLand. "/>
				<outline text="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11 "/>
				<outline text="There are sure to be other syndication formats that follow. The one thing they have in common is that our aggregation server, My.UserLand.Com, can read them. Once an hour our robot visits all the registered sites, we read their XML, and compile the articles into a database of stories. That's called Aggregation, it's the other side of syndication."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Aggregation">
				<outline text="It was a little bit of a puzzle to figure out what to do with all the news the robot was gathering! There's so much of it. But it's easy to turn an embarassment of riches into a dynamic fast-changing news site, which is what the readers of news sites want."/>
				<outline text="http://my.userland.com/newstories "/>
				<outline text="Every hour we list all the new stories and point to the sites that generated the links. We share the flow. If you like what one site is saying, you know where to go for more. There's the motivation for registering your XMLization with our aggregator. Every interesting link is a subtle advertisement saying &quot;Come here, I have something interesting for you.&quot; That's why it's a win-win. One site aggregates it all, and each site offers focus, and the things that come along with it, community, development, creativity and fun."/>
				<outline text="Some organizations use syndication technology to scatter stories all over the net. This is a fine idea, for sure, but we're zigging to that zag. I like to check the net every hour for news. Now I have a service that does it for me. It brings the stories to my desktop. "/>
				<outline text="Hey who said Push was a bad idea? Not I. "/>

			<outline text="NT versus Linux">
				<outline text="On Friday PC WEEK released the results of its benchmark tests between Microsoft Windows NT Server and Linux.&lt;p&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,1015266,00.html "/>
				<outline text="PC WEEK presents an inaccurate picture. They make it seem as if Microsoft is leading the web server market. Microsoft actually has problems to fix, and could be trailing in the areas that matter most to system managers and developers. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Issues">
				<outline text="Here's a list of the issues I have with the PC WEEK benchmark."/>
				<outline text="1. Price-performance.They chose to run the two systems on identical hardware, but Microsoft's server software is far more expensive than the Linux software. Hardware prices have dropped so much that the cost of software is now significant. Would they compare spreadsheets without considering price? Further, what does NT Server actually cost? I looked for but couldn't find a pricing page on Microsoft.Com. This information is required for a meaningful comparison. It should have been included in the PC WEEK analysis."/>
				<outline text="2. Who cares about static pages? The only kind of site that runs in comparable volume to those in the test are super-high-volume sites like Yahoo or AltaVista or Microsoft.Com. But these sites don't run static pages now, if they ever did. Today static page performance is irrelevant. You can get great performance for static pages from hardware that is essentially free. The obsolete 486s and 68Ks of the past make excellent static page servers."/>
				<outline text="3. Dynamic performance is what matters. PC WEEK didn't compare the environment most system managers care about. How does it perform serving script-generated, database-stored pages? Ask your favorite webmaster if you don't believe me. This is where we're looking for performance."/>
				<outline text="4. Options. Linux is starting to swamp NT Server with different pricepoints and options. I have a Cobalt Qube, it costs $1000, it runs Linux, it's trivial to set up. There's versatility. Can you get it from Microsoft? Put another way, if I have $15,000 to spend on new server hardware, would I do better with Linux or NT? That's a fair question for a benchmark to address."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Helping the users">
				<outline text="If PC WEEK wanted to help its readers they'd design dream systems for each operating system. With a budget of $5,000, and a full-featured site to run, figure out what configuration of each system would make such a site run beautifully on today's hardware. That would be far more positive than declaring one system a winner and the other a loser."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why Linux Will Win">
				<outline text="The editors at PC WEEK will hopefully remember IBM's OS/2 Presentation Manager. It was IBM's windowing system, co-developed with Microsoft, and introduced in the late-80s, while IBM was at the pinnacle of power. Even so, Windows won, it became the defacto desktop system, not Presentation Manager."/>
				<outline text="Linux will survive for the same reasons that Windows survived. It's more practical, the platform vendor is less powerful, and therefore the opportunity is greater for developers, and users will have more choices. Further, Linux has the advantage of being much less expensive than its competition and is free of licensing restrictions."/>

			<outline text="Crush Linus?">
				<outline text="Ask 29-year-old Linus Torvalds what if Microsoft crushes his Linux. He doesn't care, he'll just keep working on it. "/>
				<outline text="I learned this lesson more than ten years ago. Lotus was constantly launching attacks on ThinkTank, which was our mainstay. Every time they barked, I changed my strategy to get out of their way. Then in 1986 I had what I believed was an unqualified winner in the pipe. I ran into Philippe Kahn, CEO of Borland, on the floor of MacWorld Expo and he told me, as a friend (hah!), that we should get out his way because they were going to launch something on the Mac that would blow us away. I looked him in the eye and told him to suck my dick. They never shipped anything, and we went ahead and shipped the Product of the Year."/>
				<outline text="To Philippe, who has mellowed over the years and is now on his boat sailing to Asia, all is forgiven, and thanks to contributing to my personal folklore. Bygones are gone. Throw away the memories, keep the lessons. Onward!"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Another crusher">
				<outline text="A few years later, again on the floor of MacWorld Expo, an Apple program manager says &quot;We're not trying to crush you.&quot; I walk away in disgust. No bravado this time. And of course he named their tune, they did crush us (famous last words!), and we let them do it. Yes, attitude counts. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;I found myself down at the dockside, thinking of the old days of Liverpool and Rotherhithe. The transparent people who live on the other side, living a life that is almost like suicide.&quot;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Poetry">
				<outline text="Lately I've been writing poetry to Linus on news.userland.com. I wrote a piece on Saturday, and a beautiful discussion followed. Earlier I compared Linus to Gandhi and Martin Luther King, even Buddha. I understand that it's the persona of Linus that I'm writing to and about. He's just a human being. But much more than earlier software icons, Linus has the power to lead and he doesn't give it up. "/>
				<outline text="He doesn't blink. He looks Microsoft in the eye and tells them what I told Philippe. I admire that. And I know it's going to work! It's fun to watch the Microsoft machine rumble into position for a battle that ain't gonna happen. They post bug reports about Linux in the Wall Street Journal and PC WEEK. After a bit of hand-wringing and groveling, what does Linus's community do? They fix the damned bugs. I love it! Whistle while you work."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Don't blink">
				<outline text="If you have a winner, the ones you leave behind will always make barking noises. The trick is to know when you have the winner, and stick with it and ignore the barking. "/>
				<outline text="Last week, talking with Victor Raisys, Microsoft's guy watching Linux, a heated conversation -- they were playing the &quot;There have always been a lot of Unixes&quot; tape for me, and I said emphatically, Linux is not Unix. Linux is Lotus in the early days. Linux is Apple. Linux is a bright hope that millions of young programmers have for an independent and free future. In the past it was independence from IBM that mattered, now it's independence from Microsoft. "/>
				<outline text="Linux is an insurance policy that Microsoft will not control us. For me it's a throwback to the bright past where we met the future with open arms. Remember what the first Mac said? Hello! That's all, and that's all it had to say."/>
				<outline text="At the end of the Microsoft conversation they asked what I would do about Linux if I called the shots at Microsoft. Here's what I told them."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Match Linux's price">
				<outline text="Come out with a low-priced version of NT Server that installs in 15 minutes, and comes up ready to blow dynamic pages out port 80, and does nothing more. No hooks for Office, no FrontPage Express, I even want them to leave out IIS. Just bare-bones fastest-possible NT, no socket limits, Between $0 and $300 retail. One CD. Allow OEMs to customize to their hearts-content. This would enable many Qube-type products to be built around NT, and would keep the pressure on Linux to keep moving."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Hands off">
				<outline text="Do absolutely nothing to interfere with Linux. This time around, if Microsoft screws with it, it'll backfire. There are no VCs controlling Linux to make the same kinds of mistakes Netscape did. Alan Baratz has nothing to say about the future of Linux. There are now millions of developers who do not want to be Microsoft developers. Ultimately Microsoft is going to want the support of these people, I'm sure of it. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="To the developers">
				<outline text="As long as we carefully analyze what Microsoft says for nuggets of truth, and know what the relative merits are of NT vs Linux, we win. There is no threat to Microsoft, unless they want us to support their now-inflated pricing structure. I imagine that Steve Ballmer knows this, and the pricing of NT will change to meet Linux squarely in the market, which is where it counts. "/>
				<outline text="Net-net, force Microsoft to market to us, based on our intelligence, not ignorance. The Linux community has done admirably in this way so far, and I see no signs of it changing. It's incredible to see the earnestness and bright eyes. A long time ago, I remember when Microsoft had that kind of brilliance. "/>
				<outline text="Having witnessed the Internet turned into a battlefield, and assessing that at least half of the blame for that belongs to Microsoft, I am in no mood for another contentious, irrelevant do-or-die battle. This time around either Microsoft grows up and learns to be the statesman of the industry that it could be, or we'll do a Linus, and keep doing the work we love, revolutionizing the communication media of the world. "/>
				<outline text="If Microsoft won't give us the server platform we need, it's sitting right here on Linux, ready to go, for a very reasonable price, without any lock-in. (None of the analysts include that in their reasoning, how many dollars is the lack of lock-in worth?)"/>
				<outline text="Finally, I am an Internet developer because it's the platform without the platform vendor. There's enough energy in the  platform to make it thru all the turmoil that's sure to come. "/>

			<outline text="I've been sick since Sunday, bed-ridden with something flu-like, or maybe cold-like, it doesn't matter what you call it, it's kept me offline, coming in and out of consciousness, feeling miserable, but in a way, enjoying the break from the pace of mind-activating work on websites and editorial tools and keeping my servers running and fielding numerous complaints from well-meaning people who are losing patience. But sickness comes first, and I relax in the luxury of just tuning out. "/>
			<outline text="Jesse Berst, in his AnchorDesk column today, says that working stiffs just call in sick when they need a break. This is half the story. The other half is that bodies get sick when the spirit needs a rest. When I get sick I ask that question of myself. Are you really happy with what you're doing? The answer is absolutely no. I want it to be a lot better. I want more help, more reliable servers, more talented and responsible people to work with, an easier path, a more loving life, more contact with my own and other people's humanity."/>
			<outline text="Hey on Friday at a BBQ, the Bees are back. Every year I write about them when they reappear. Every year they teach a different lesson. This is *my* holiday, one I share with my fellow Silicon Valley outdoorsmen. It's not like Christmas or the death of a prince or princess, or a war in the Balkans, you won't see the Bees on the cover of Time, or on Larry King. They are my issue, and mine alone. This feels good! The Bees are personal. Thank you."/>
			<outline text="Anyway the timing of my sickness was perfect to tune into the national hand-wringing over the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. It's just the right kind of story for my numbed-out mind. Breaking news? Hardly. It's been an exercise in no-news. Synthetic grief. How could anyone who didn't know the guy truly feel grief? Where is that coming from? A sense of collectivism, that Barbara Walters and John Glenn are somehow members of our family, but listen to the words they use. Stop and think, at the end of every sentence they utter, how much truth is there in what they're saying? None. It's all just a dream, no reality."/>
			<outline text="And it's also the 30th anniversary of the moon landing. The same talking heads speak in hushed reverence of the deep feelings they experienced when Neil and Buzz walked on the moon. What bullshit! Hey I was alive in 1969, I was fourteen years old. At the time, watching the moon men on TV, I tried to conjure up a sense of history, but I realized even at that tender age, that all I was witnessing were some lines on a cathode ray tube. Nothing actually was happening. Hey I believe the story, I believe there were actually men walking on the moon that day. But did I experience it? No way. I was at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Here's what was real. I made out with a beautiful young woman, both of us at the breach of puberty, and experienced the high of huge amounts of testosterone and endorphins, and the sweet smell of youthful femininity. To me, that was much more real than any supposed walk on the moon."/>
			<outline text="At the same time, there have been a spate of articles on the web about how the web isn't really making that many people rich. Wired had a great article yesterday categorizing Internet people into thirteen different classes. All this followed a hardware failure last week that has me using a defective laptop that has a broken shift key. All my hardware vendor can say is &quot;Use the other shift key.&quot; Oh sure, reprogram my 20+ year-old neural pathways so they can save $49 on a junky piece of plastic. Hey, remind me never to buy another Dell product. No need to remind me. After buying eight expensive systems from them over the last two years, I've learned my lesson. They break, and they waste huge amounts of my time to fix them. I'm looking for a local dealer who cares. Good luck! When Computer Plus of Sunnyvale closed umpteen years ago, that was it. All we have in the way of local computer stores is Fry's and I know for a fact that they don't care. I was in there last weekend shopping for a wireless LAN. I tried an experiment. I asked one of the sales people if he knew anything about the products on the shelf I was staring at. Very politely he said &quot;No sir.&quot; I smiled and said &quot;Of course, I knew that.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hey I'm having a great time writing this piece. It's turning into quite a rambler. There's something relaxing about getting it off your chest. And I can be thankful that I'm not this sick when there's a heat wave like the one we had last week. Then there would have been no relief. Now I have tea and a hot tub and central heating to get my temperature back in the normal, even comfortable range. And I'm not even minding that the shift key is making me backspace over words to correct capitalization errors. It's not so bad with prose, but try working on code when the compiler is barfing over 0's that were really supposed to be right parentheses."/>
			<outline text="Which brings us to the case of Chris Nolan, columnist for the San Jose Mercury-News. She's been suspended over what appears to be a trivial and well-handled tiny conflict of interest. Chris and I have had our differences, but it's always been in the domain of two opinionated people, wanting to deliver the best value to our readers. I like reading her columns. If the Merc doesn't reinstate her I'm sure some other publication will pick up her column. Will the Merc be able to look down at them? Nah. They've made their point. They care about integrity. This is good. Now they should show care for their readers, who appreciate Chris's biting commentary. You never know who she's going to go after next! I speak from experience, being one who has been so honored by Ms. Nolan. It's fun being trashed. (Sort of.) Bring her back. Let's get on with it."/>
			<outline text="I already feel better. Maybe I'll make a few phone calls, maybe I'll write some new scripts. I have a blank new server here, a dual CPU 500 Mhz Pentium III, 512MB, with a freshly installed NT Server 4. Unlike my other servers this one is fast (it's not carrying a load right now). Nothing like a big blank machine to get you going in the morning."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;7/21/99; 8:27:39 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I lamented the lack of wireless networking at retail, and it's as if Steve Jobs read my mind, or at least my essay. This morning Apple announced the AirPort wireless LAN,  developed in conjunction with Lucent Technology. Great idea! It goes so well with the new iBook consumer laptop they also announced today. Now the next question, will this help sort out the wireless LAN market for all kinds of personal computers, or just Apple's?"/>
			<outline text="The answer can be found on Apple's FAQ page for the new product:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.apple.com/airport/faq1.html "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Can I use a PC notebook in an AirPort network? Yes. Because AirPort is based on the IEEE 802.11 DSSS standard, there are a number of companies with products that allow a PC to be used in an AirPort network.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Now of course I want to know what those products are. I want a wireless LAN, I'm way way ready for it, and I imagine a bunch of other people are too. But I run a heterogeneous LAN, with Windows, Macs, and Linux machines, so we need a solution that works across all operating systems. "/>
			<outline text="But it was really smart for Apple to take the lead here. Packaging and ease of use are central to this market. I want something that works easily out of the box. So.. good move Apple!"/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="My health is returning and with it comes the optimism of a body rebuilding itself. Something healthy is flowing thru my veins. It's nice, I like it. "/>
			<outline text="DaveNet played a role in my recovery. Having a sick body can be lonely. A laptop with a net connection and a big mail list and a &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude can make great things happen. Or they were going to happen anyway, probably so, but it's nice to believe that they're my doing."/>
			<outline text="***Apple's AirPort"/>
			<outline text="I like where Apple is going! Yesterday, the more we learned about Apple's wireless LAN, the better it sounded. AirPort is built on an IEEE standard that's well supported on Windows and Linux. People at the Expo tested it and reported that it works and is fast. "/>
			<outline text="And Apple's iBook consumer laptop looks pretty good too, although with only 32MB memory it will be a slow machine. Apple laptops have always suffered from too-little RAM. Some advice to Apple, get ahead of the curve this time, add more RAM. 128MB at least."/>
			<outline text="***Perl.Com syndicates"/>
			<outline text="Next topic.. "/>
			<outline text="Scripting and syndication are flipsides of the same coin, and there is no bigger scripting language or community than Perl. "/>
			<outline text="So today we welcome Perl.Com as the latest My.UserLand.Com channel!"/>
			<outline text="http://my.userland.com/viewChannel$1115 "/>
			<outline text="Excellent!"/>
			<outline text="***Killer Channels?"/>
			<outline text="Someday we'll talk about Killer Channels, just like Killer Apps, and Wireless LANs and Sticky Websites. And when that day comes, we'll think of channels like Perl.Com as necessary early adopters, making a bigger world of syndicated web content possible. "/>
			<outline text="The first audience we want to serve is the one that's going to get us more new channels in a few months when this stuff rises to the top. We want to make sure that the technologists are up the curve, and there's no better way to reach these people than coming in thru the scripting languages that keep their websites working."/>
			<outline text="So thanks to O'Reilly Associates and Songline Studios for believing in the power of XML-based syndication. It's really cool that it's happening now."/>
			<outline text="***What about Push?"/>
			<outline text="Push Technology was a good idea in 1996, but it was a solution in search of a problem. Today the problem is apparent. There's not enough news! Amazing, isn't it? The problem ended up stating itself the other way around. Back in the first push to push, people figured they needed new technology because there was too much news. In fact, the most active news portal sites, ZDNet or News.Com or SlashDot.Org, give you (at most) three or four new articles per hour. Hardly enough for the news junkies that the web has created. "/>
			<outline text="A new friend from Oracle wasn't really familiar with our site when he said &quot;You gotta have something new every hour.&quot; Yes yes yes. There are millions of people who check the web when their job bores them. &quot;What's new?&quot; they're asking. As more channels come online, we can answer that question in more detail and with more variety and with more consistent results. We *can* give you something new every hour because our XML-based wires are reaching into more and more corners of the web."/>
			<outline text="***My inner-news-junkie"/>
			<outline text="When we first opened the story list on the home page of My.UserLand.Com I knew we were onto something hot. My inner-news-junkie was totally happy! Twenty or thirty new links every hour. 200-plus editors contributing to the flow, worldwide people, so even at 2AM in California there are interesting links coming from Europe and Asia. It's something to behold."/>
			<outline text="http://my.userland.com/ "/>
			<outline text="So Push isn't dead -- it's a website. Aggregation. Learn that word, it's going to revolutionize the way we use the web. Each story is a bit. It fits in somewhere. It finds the people who are interested. Yes, it can promote a product, but it can also inspire and inform. This is the web I want. "/>
			<outline text="***Brick and mortar isn't dead either"/>
			<outline text="In the rush to electronic media we may have forgotten that people like to meet and touch and eat with other people. Just because we have websites and 24-hour news feeds doesn't mean we don't get lonely, hungry and horny. We do, and for that, the brick and mortar establishments serve an important purpose. I learned this when I became a chat-addict on CompuServe in the early 80s. As soon as a cybercommunity gets established the next thing to do is to have a way for the people to meet face to face."/>
			<outline text="That's where Barnes and Noble has an advantage over Amazon. Community takes on a new meaning when people can meet each other. So don't count out Brick and Mortar, like Push it will make a comeback. It won't be long before the Silicon Valley VCs will be falling over themselves to invest in places where people can really meet."/>
			<outline text="***Newt at Buck's"/>
			<outline text="I'm having fun exploring the intersection between cyberspace and the real world. My laboratory is Buck's the website and the restaurant. Yesterday I called in to talk to Jamis, he wasn't there, but the manager, Ron Brunson, asked if I could help find him. &quot;Why?&quot; I asked. &quot;Newt Gingrich was here this morning,&quot; Ron said. The former Speaker of the US House of Representatives. Wow. Ron, who wasn't a website reporter until this moment, was prepared, with digital camera and an eye for a story. A couple of hours later Newt is on the web too."/>
			<outline text="http://www.buckswoodside.com/stories/storyReader$214 "/>
			<outline text="It's working! Valley VC Steve Jurvetson has a strategy. He's building a brand, and we are too. It's a win-win. He brings Newt to Buck's, the brick and mortar version, and we bring you Newt on Buck's, the cyberspace version. There's the synergy. You can't get a omlette or coffee cake on the website. But you can dial in from anywhere at any time. "/>
			<outline text="The next step for us at Buck's is to develop it as a commentary platform, to let people in the high-tech community of Silicon Valley use it to get ideas out to similar people, not just in Silicon Valley. To let others bring us ideas, and to spread our creativity over the globe using the most modern technology. If you'd like to get in the loop, please send us mail. bucks@userland.com. We like to showcase technology and wacky interesting ideas."/>
			<outline text="In a few years you'll see similar stuff happening at every Hard Rock Cafe and Denny's. The event horizon of cyberspace -- the intersection between media and our bodies. Our lives will be richer. The possibilities will be more endless. The potential for gratification more realized."/>
			<outline text="Dave"/>
			<outline text="PS: Here's an idea for a killer website. A web-based spell-checker. Enter the URL of a page you want to check. It displays a list of words that are possibly mis-spelled. Advertising supported. Over time it gets an idea of what you're interested in by indexing the stories you have checked with the service."/>

			<outline text="Yesterday I reviewed a draft of a report on syndication by Kevin Werbach for Esther Dyson's RELease 1.0 newsletter. The report covered all aspects of syndication and aggregation, ranging from content management systems, distributed computing protocols, and syndication formats and servers. Kevin did a very thorough job, he talked to a lot of people, including people who read DaveNet and who participate in discussions at UserLand.Com."/>
			<outline text="I had one longish phone talk with him as he was researching the piece. I always wonder how my story will come through, and this time it came through clearly. I hope they post this piece on their website, or allow us to post it. I understand that this isn't always possible, since the newsletter costs $700 per year. I think everyone involved in this area should read the report. I feel so strongly about this that I will now link to their subscriber page."/>
			<outline text="https://gromit.edventure.com/release1/subscribe.cfm "/>
			<outline text="How's that for an economic model!"/>
			<outline text="***The value of intermediation"/>
			<outline text="Since Kevin spoke with many of the companies we're working with he was able to carry messages between us. Very interesting! Reading the piece I learned more about how the market is shaping up. His piece closes a few loops that have been opened in earlier DaveNet pieces about Allaire, Netscape, Microsoft and others. "/>
			<outline text="***Netscape"/>
			<outline text="One thing I can report now with some certainty is that we're working productively with Netscape again. "/>
			<outline text="There's a new version of their syndication format coming soon that embraces almost all that's in our syndication format. This is excellent! "/>
			<outline text="We will continue to work with Netscape with the goal of reducing both formats to a single compatible format."/>
			<outline text="***Allaire"/>
			<outline text="Also from Werbach's piece came a reminder that we need to bring WDDX and XML-RPC together. Allaire is moving into content management, and we're branching out too, producing editorial tools that could benefit from connecting to Allaire's software. Working together we arrived at a plan early this year. Both companies have been busy developing other software in the interim, but we intend to implement our plan to bridge the two most popular Internet-based object serialization formats and to give Allaire developers a way to call procedures running on Internet servers written in Python, Java, Tcl, Perl, PHP, Visual Basic, and of course Frontier."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="At the same time, yesterday, came an InfoWorld story by Bob Trott quoting Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer at a financial analyst meeting talking about this developing market. The report was quite confusing. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? I couldn't figure out what they were saying, but I definitely want to know more. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?990723.piballmer2.htm "/>
			<outline text="This week we also saw Microsoft move aggressively into the Internet chat space in competition with AOL. My contacts at Microsoft had given me a heads-up that fireworks were on the way. I doubted it. Now I've seen their technical/PR team in action in Summer 1999. I'm a believer. Microsoft can still command a full share of mind. "/>
			<outline text="***Dave the Disintermediator"/>
			<outline text="I've never seen anyone try, to the extent that I do, to be both an analyst, writing for the public, and also working behind the scenes as a technologist and entrepreneur with product (actually four now, in various stages of development). "/>
			<outline text="My algorithm remains the same as it has been since we restarted UserLand in Spring 1996. I am a software developer who writes for the public. I talk about what I can publicly, and I don't talk about what I can't talk about. The web made this kind of entrepreneurship possible, and to varying degrees other people are doing similar things."/>
			<outline text="The closest examples are the venture capitalists writing for Fortune, Bill Gurley and Stewart Alsop; and Guy Kawasaki writing for Forbes. Their points of view are interesting because they are in some of the most interesting business meetings happening in 1999. I am very lucky to be in the loop on what I think is the most interesting technology of our time. I think I can help it move forward productively by chronicling the experiences in DaveNet and other places. "/>
			<outline text="I also know, and you should too, that I help my company's cause by writing publicly. Everything I say should be taken with the grain of salt that I represent a certain set of interests, but I try to be clear about what those are. If we're developing in a new area, I tell you about it as we enter those areas. I don't want a competitor to be blind-sided working with us if we're going to be offering choice in a market they consider important. (For the record, we're active in four areas: consumer-level content management; net-based writing tools; Frontier, which is a developer platform for content management; and a web-based aggregation engine.)"/>
			<outline text="On the other side, I have always felt that the technologist's point of view has been under-represented in business publications, and now on the web. Details often gets lost when a technologist talks to a business analyst. The ongoing purpose of DaveNet continues to be &quot;disintermediating&quot; the flow of information from the mind of a developer to people who are interested in knowing how that mind works. That's why I point to Dan Bricklin when he writes about spreadsheets. It would be great if every person leading a development team would do the same -- narrate their work as they go along. Then software development becomes a teaching environment, people don't have to relearn the lessons if people are open about the lessons they've learned. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: You might not find &quot;disintermediate&quot; in your dictionary. It's a verb. To disintermediate is to eliminate an intermediary. When you talk to a reporter and that reporter explains what you said, he or she is intermediating. You disintermediate when you write your own piece and publish it on the web. The word has usually applied to commerce, buying and selling of goods, where disintermediation eliminates a distributor or retailer."/>

			<outline text="Lots of links in this piece."/>
			<outline text="It begins with an editorial written by John Dvorak in PC Magazine:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/stories/opinions/0,7802,2301976,00.html "/>
			<outline text="&quot;When you see some guy pulling an iBook out of his backpack a few months from now, tell him his little computer looks delectable and see what he says.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The key word here is delectable. It'll show up again later in this piece."/>
			<outline text="***Janelle Brown"/>
			<outline text="Then Janelle Brown, an editor at Salon, rebutted him, intelligently and powerfully:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/07/28/barbie/index.html "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Women use computers, women run computer companies; equating them with busty plastic dolls shows that no matter whether we've come a long way, baby -- not everyone has kept up.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Polly Sprenger"/>
			<outline text="Then this morning an editorial by Polly Sprenger on the Wired website:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/20982.html "/>
			<outline text="&quot;'I am computer geek!' he is yelling, 'hear me roar!' Dvorak, secure in his elderly, white male punditry, understands this in a way that sandal-wearing, veggie-munching Steve Jobs doesn't.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Ooops!"/>
			<outline text="***Letter to the editor"/>
			<outline text="I wrote this letter to the editor of Wired."/>
			<outline text="I try not to take offense on matters of principle, but referring to Dvorak as an &quot;elderly, white male&quot; is far beneath Wired and I do find it offensive, even if it is written in rebuttal to a piece that crossed well-accepted lines of political correctness. "/>
			<outline text="I am not many years younger than Dvorak, and I am white and male and a pundit. What does that say about someone and their beliefs and attitudes? Do two wrongs make a right? Wired, get a life, get over yourselves, you're worse than Dvorak, at least he's willing to promote beliefs that are not so &quot;correct.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I wrote that too quickly. Let me explain.."/>
			<outline text="***Walkman at 20"/>
			<outline text="This morning I read a NY Times article on the Walkman turning twenty. It's a great piece. It turns out there are Walkmans designed for teens and for women and for athletes and one that's modeled after the iMac. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/circuits/articles/29walk.html "/>
			<outline text="So what could be so terrible about designing a computer that fit the sensibilities of almost-elderly white male pundits? I actually think that makes a lot of sense. I can tell you this much, I am not going to own a computer that people call &quot;delectable&quot;. I laughed when I read this in Dvorak's piece. "/>
			<outline text="Wired may make fun of us, but I have my own self-image, and it's none of their business, any more than I could tell a middle-aged white female pundit how she should express herself thru products she chooses. Further, people marvel at the economic clout of teenagers, but what about the purchasing power of mature white males? There's money to be made in appealing to us, obviously."/>
			<outline text="***What is delectable?"/>
			<outline text="BTW, when I quit Wired a few years ago, they were complaining about a section of a piece I wrote about Jean-Louis Gassee. Some thought it was sexist. &quot;Extend your right arm. Pull your pinky to your palm. Same with the fourth finger and your thumb. Extend your index and middle fingers and pull them together. Move your arm so that these two fingers are directly under your nose. Sniff shortly three times.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/10/07/welcomebackjeanlouis "/>
			<outline text="To me, a soon-to-be-elderly white male pundit, this is what delectable is all about. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="***Thank you Elvis!"/>
			<outline text="I saw a great show on the History Channel last night. We just got it on our cable system a few weeks ago, their programming is excellent, I've seen shows on Lindbergh and the Chinese Cultural Revolution.  Last night's story was about Elvis, how he opened up teen culture in the US, and how this forever freed teens from having their sexuality (openly) controlled by their parents. "/>
			<outline text="All those girls screaming, what were they screaming about? They were horny! That's definitely something worth screaming about. That's what Elvis changed, and thank you Elvis! The young girls might have liked dreaming about Barbie and Ken, but they also had fantasies of loving Elvis."/>
			<outline text="When Ed Sullivan, the Minister of Culture in the US in the 50s said Elvis is a nice young man, he passed the torch to the new generation, and it's never passed back."/>
			<outline text="***Male style"/>
			<outline text="So what does this have to do with Wired and Dvorak and delectable iMacs? "/>
			<outline text="Just this, we mature men might want something warm, with leather perhaps, no guns please, but something rugged that fits in a carry-on bag, and fits our style. To think that today's laptops somehow are designed to appeal to male style is to underestimate male style."/>
			<outline text="I just bought a new car, a Lexus RX300. I want something like that. Not delectable, but cool and modern, stylish and comfortable. Easy on the eyes. (The older you get the more you value comfort, it's true it's true.)"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Instant Messaging&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/1/99; 6:10:46 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="I've been following the public battle over the last week or so between Microsoft and AOL over Instant Messaging. So much has been written on this subject, it's so confusing! "/>
			<outline text="I think I've read it all, and asked questions of the people involved, and gotten some answers, and the issues are actually fairly simple, because we've been here before, it's just a loop. But first, a little background.."/>
			<outline text="***What is Instant Messaging?"/>
			<outline text="It's a way to send messages from one computer user to another, instantly. "/>
			<outline text="I open my Instant Messaging client and double-click on your name in a list of contacts or &quot;buddies&quot;. "/>
			<outline text="A window opens. At the top is a big blank area. At the bottom, a three-line text area, and a Send button."/>
			<outline text="I type in the three-line text area. If you're watching, a message appears on your screen saying &quot;Dave Winer is typing now.&quot; When I click on Send or hit Enter, your computer chimes, and the text I was typing appears in the big blank area, on both our computers."/>
			<outline text="Then you can reply, and I can reply to you, we go back and forth until we're finished. You can leave the window open, and if a thought occurs to you later, you can type it in, and if I'm still there, I'll see it right away."/>
			<outline text="***How is this different from email?"/>
			<outline text="Instant Messaging is a close cousin of electronic mail, but.."/>
			<outline text="An Instant Messaging client knows more about the people you communicate with. It knows when they are using their computer or not, but only if they choose to tell you, or if they remember to. This can be a problem! Sometimes I leave my computer and forget to tell the Instant Messaging client that I'm leaving. If you send me an instant message at that time you may think I'm rude, but I just forgot to log off. This is different from email. People are surprised when they get an instant response to an email message, but they expect an instant response with Instant Messaging."/>
			<outline text="Another difference is that Instant Messages are presumed to be short. I tried an experiment the other day with Microsoft's new IM client. I pasted a copy of a brief email message into the IM window, but it truncated the message, sending only the first few lines."/>
			<outline text="I was surprised to see that Microsoft's client didn't understand little bits of HTML included in the messages. I tried enclosing a bit of text in italics, and the characters passed thru without interpretation. I found this surprising because Microsoft says that HTML belongs everywhere. Why not in the IM client?"/>
			<outline text="Another difference is that the protocols for email are ancient and standardized. The protocols for Instant Messaging are in flux and are not standardized."/>
			<outline text="***You can chat with me"/>
			<outline text="If you want to try it out, and if you use Microsoft's system, you can reach me at davewiner@hotmail.com."/>
			<outline text="I'm not promising an essay in each conversation, but I leave it turned on while I work, for now at least. If you have a thought to share or a simple question to ask, send me a message. "/>
			<outline text="***At least two flavors"/>
			<outline text="However, if you use AOL's instant messaging system, you probably will not be able to send me a message. This is because there is no standard protocol for IM. There is no agreement between Microsoft and AOL to allow them to reach users of the other's instant messaging system. This has been what the fuss was about for the last couple of weeks. Microsoft believes it should be able to talk to AOL's server, and AOL isn't sure whether they want to let them do that."/>
			<outline text="***Who pays for the servers?"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft must be just as reluctant to allow open access to their servers. When I asked this week, I was told that there were no APIs that would allow developers to write software that interfaces to Microsoft's servers. It makes sense, after all, what's in it for them? The only space that's considered to have any value is the client, because that's where the ads appear. If I use Microsoft's server to feed messages to and from my IM client, then Microsoft does all the hard work and I get all the ad revenue. In other words, the eyeballs are mine and the headaches are Microsoft's."/>
			<outline text="However, unless I'm missing something, that's exactly what Microsoft wants AOL to do for them. This is the disconnect. They're smart people up there at Microsoft. They must have considered the possibility of opening their servers to other clients. So far they've only whipped up a frenzy of religious zeal about open protocols (of course everyone supports open protocols), but they have steered the discussion away from the bigger issue -- who pays for the servers?"/>
			<outline text="***A common discussion"/>
			<outline text="Believe it or not this discussion is happening in other corners of the Internet industry."/>
			<outline text="For an example, consider stock quotes. Right now I can log onto a variety of different public and free servers to get real-time stock information. But if I want to write a script to implement a trading strategy, watching for certain events and triggering a trade or a pager message when they happen, I'm basically out of luck, unless I want to confront thorny copyright and intellectual property issues. (It's possible to parse the HTML text returned by the public servers, but this clearly wasn't the intent of the information providers, and is possibly outside their license agreement. And it's an unreliable approach, the website you're parsing can change its format at any time, and that would break the application.)"/>
			<outline text="The economic problem is that scripts can't read ads. So no one will provide the service for free, as they do for the ad-sponsored service. We've discussed this at length on UserLand.Com, and our conclusion is that to crack this nut we'll have to wait for an open stock exchange, one that competes with NASDAQ and the NYSE and others, one based on freely available, real-time, public trading info (probably formatted in XML). "/>
			<outline text="When this develops, there will be an explosion of interesting software. Given the pace of innovation in the Internet industry, especially as it relates to the stock market, I expect this to happen within months if not weeks."/>
			<outline text="***Another example"/>
			<outline text="The Domain Name System -- another confusing economic quagmire. This is the fight over who owns .Com."/>
			<outline text="http://davenet.userland.com/1999/05/01/whoOwnsDotCom "/>
			<outline text="Instant Messaging is like DNS in many ways. It's a name system, it binds a person to a computer. If you have control over the DNS, as Network Solutions does, you have control of the core of the Internet."/>
			<outline text="Similarly, in the struggle for Instant Messaging, the winner, if there is one, will control real-time access to Internet users. "/>
			<outline text="***A race for developers?"/>
			<outline text="Justifiably, neither AOL or Microsoft want to operate ad-less servers for the other's clients. What's in it for them other than eBay-like headaches. Keeping a huge server farm running 7-by-24 is an expensive thing to do. AOL and Yahoo (another contestant) have more experience at this, but Microsoft may be catching up. (Hotmail appears to be running on Windows NT now, not Unix,as it was when they acquired it.)."/>
			<outline text="And in all this, there's a developer question. There are a bunch of interesting apps to be built off Instant Messaging. I could see an outliner used to manage multi-tasking and chat-based projects. Integrate chat with project management and web development. Transcripts of chats on websites hosted by Yahoo or Tripod or Xoom? Another ad opportunity. More community plays. AOL with a developer community of specialized apps building off their service, competing with a similar developer community around Microsoft. Realistically, based on all we know about the software industry, how likely is it that Microsoft will share its developers with AOL and vice versa? It's not likely, and therefore &quot;open standards&quot; are not very likely either."/>
			<outline text="How are the Instant Messaging giants thinking about this? I don't really know. The public statements so far have been about small things.The real question is who will be first to decisively open up their services to other developers."/>
			<outline text="***A role for public servers?"/>
			<outline text="It could be that the only way to sort out all this stuff is for there to be publicly owned, non-profit servers that provide free information and connections, and scale up as the Internet grows. Perhaps the only way to do this, and I know this is a radical idea, is to have an Internet property tax, like real estate property taxes. "/>
			<outline text="Both AOL and Microsoft would pay a large share of the money to keep such servers operating, as they pay taxes in Washington and Virginia to provide transportation, education, police and fire protection, all the public services, in the non-cyber world."/>
			<outline text="What do you think?"/>

			<outline text="***Brickin and Visicalc"/>
			<outline text="Today's story starts with an email I got from Dan Bricklin on 7/15/99. He had been working privately with Lotus to re-release a 1983 version of the app he created, VisiCalc."/>
			<outline text="Bricklin's program is only 27K (smaller than most GIFs). I downloaded it and ran it on my NT4 machine, and it worked! And I found I still know how to use it."/>
			<outline text="http://www.bricklin.com/history/vcexecutable.htm "/>
			<outline text="The old neural pathways relight.There were some great, highly-influential ideas in that 27K program. And some crucial ideas missing, to be supplied later by 1-2-3 and Excel. You can see that in just five minutes. "/>
			<outline text="Where else on the web can you find such an interesting distraction, if you're a spreadsheet user. Visicalc is smaller than Solitaire, and almost as easy to learn how to use."/>
			<outline text="***Intersimone and Turbo Pascal"/>
			<outline text="Then last week, David Intersimone at Borland did something just as interesting. He packaged up early releases of Borland's Turbo Pascal and C along with some early Borland advertising (Philippe at his best!) and put it on the Borland &quot;museum&quot; site:"/>
			<outline text="http://community.borland.com/museum/ "/>
			<outline text="***Ritchie and C"/>
			<outline text="Then on Sunday, Dennis Ritchie released an early version of his C compiler 1972-73. "/>
			<outline text="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~dmr/primevalC.html "/>
			<outline text="This is the compiler he used to implement the first versions of Unix! To me this is especially significant because it was from reading Ritchie's source code that I learned how to program in the 1970s. He's my teacher and role model. And now, viewed again, this gives me a way to explore my roots as a programmer, a way that was not open to me before."/>
			<outline text="***My own antiques"/>
			<outline text="Also on Sunday, Symantec gave me permission to release my own antique software, ThinkTank, Ready! and MORE. We've begun to work on the website, and now have the first release, MORE 1.1c (8/2/87), ready for historians and Mac enthusiasts to download and play with."/>
			<outline text="http://www.outliners.com/more11c.html "/>
			<outline text="This is going to be fascinating, not only because I can retrace my steps in outlining software with a new community of users, but we can also see how Mac software evolved in the period between 1984 and 1991, starting with Thinktank 128 and leading to MORE 3.1. I learned a lot just in preparing MORE 1.1c for re-release. "/>
			<outline text="***Thank you Symantec!"/>
			<outline text="First, a very hearty thank you to Symantec! "/>
			<outline text="They were incredibly generous to let us do this. It's great that many of the ideas in our early outliners will get a chance to be seen again, in the context of all that has happened inbetween. There are some neat ideas in these products that can influence software design, and showing the evolution of an idea this way, both the wrong turns and the ideas with lasting value, could leave an interesting trail for people who want to study software evolution as a process. Symantec, thanks a million times!"/>
			<outline text="Second, there's a big disclaimer on every download saying in red and boldface that these products come with no support and that Symantec can withdraw their permission at any time for any reason."/>
			<outline text="***Apple ][, Apple ///"/>
			<outline text="I've sent emails to software pioneers from the early days of the Apple II, PC and Mac. For example, I am emailing with Steve Wozniak about setting up a web server on an Apple II so we can test out and run and serve antique Apple II software from an Apple II. "/>
			<outline text="I hope to reconnect with gems like the first release of 1-2-3 and early BASICs. Excel, FullWrite, PageMaker, Word, Director, PhotoShop, dBASE, Wordstar, Javelin, Topview, Agenda and Jazz. Where are they now? "/>
			<outline text="***The lost art of user interface design"/>
			<outline text="There are pragmatic reasons why it's a good idea to get another look at these programs in their early releases. I find on my own development team, with most of the people in their 20s and early 30s, that there are important user interface lessons that have not been passed on. "/>
			<outline text="For anyone running a development company who is concerned about keeping their new web-based products and services competitive, a look back to the user interfaces of the eighties is worth doing. It would help us chart the next steps in the evolution of the web."/>
			<outline text="Universities and schools should also find this interesting because it opens new avenues for research and for teaching."/>
			<outline text="***Software speaks for itself"/>
			<outline text="The people who created these products are colorful, intelligent, passionate, and have big integrity. They've also been educated, many of them, in the School of Hard Knocks. Good interviews! "/>
			<outline text="Now with the benefit of time, we can see the products that truly had influence. And now with the web as an inexpensive distribution system, the old software can speak for itself, and once again teach lessons, now with the benefit of hindsight."/>

			<outline text="And we didn't know that Microsoft was going to make a dramatic entry into the Instant Messaging market dominated by AOL. Both of these are in the scope of DaveNet, and they're happening at the same time."/>
			<outline text="***Microsoft on Instant Messaging"/>
			<outline text="On Monday I received a response from a Microsoft representative on the Instant Messaging piece that went out on Sunday. You can read the response here:"/>
			<outline text="http://news.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$9028  "/>
			<outline text="In my counter-response I re-focused the discussion: &quot;If the goal is open systems, why is Microsoft's Instant Messaging system closed? I'd like to be able to write apps that run on top of it. Why can't I? Or can I?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The Microsoft response: &quot;At present, there are no plans for a formal SDK. Microsoft will work with licensees of the MSN communications platform to customize their versions of MSN Messenger Service. The partner clients will still interact with MSN communications servers and be fully interoperable with all other MSN Messenger Service clients. In the future, should there prove to be sufficient developer interest in creating solutions on top of Messenger, Microsoft will certainly evaluate doing an SDK.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Parsing the Microsoft response"/>
			<outline text="They didn't answer the first or second questions."/>
			<outline text="They said no to the third question. "/>
			<outline text="***A big loose end"/>
			<outline text="I still want Microsoft to explain why they think AOL should open up their Instant Messaging system. "/>
			<outline text="***Gates must not be paying attention"/>
			<outline text="This is silly beyond belief. "/>
			<outline text="The number-two in a market has to offer something that the dominant vendor doesn't. Often this is a lower price -- the new competitor tries to force the leader to respond by doing something unnatural, usually something that breaks the leader's economic model. This is healthy, it forces the leader to keep the price low, and in the age of the Internet, to keep lock-in minimized."/>
			<outline text="It also helps keep the market fresh. If something changed in the economics or in the user base or in technology, if there's something the leader missed, the new competitor can introduce an idea, grabbing the cursor from the leader. Microsoft knows how to do this. Look at how Office cleared the business productivity landscape. They burst a price and functionality bubble, and won the market."/>
			<outline text="This time around Microsoft wants to force AOL to open up their Instant Messaging service -- they want to take their share of Instant Messaging without bursting any bubbles! Amazing chutzpah. By complaining in a confusing way they hope to force AOL to burst their *own* bubble. It's as if, playing chess, you run a press release saying your opponent should give up their queen, and somehow you expect this to happen?"/>
			<outline text="My theory is that Bill Gates isn't paying attention. He's too smart to leave this kind of hole. "/>
			<outline text="***The historical view"/>
			<outline text="Hey, my frustration isn't exclusively with Microsoft, it's also with the reporters and analysts (Eric S. Raymond pay attention) that let them get away with this kind of two-faced double-talk. The press, to this day, has a very low-quality Microsoft-noise filter. If the filters were better I'm sure Microsoft would respond by putting less noise out there."/>
			<outline text="Some day we may get smart or have the courage to ask the tough questions. Since the web is doing a perfect job of recording this discussion, just like the ancient software that has so much to say, these twists and turns in the continuing software wars will someday be compared against reality and logic. "/>

			<outline text="***Good afternoon DaveNet readers!"/>
			<outline text="Late last week, rain! Summer rain is so rare here. Big New Orleans thunder clouds in our little desert. In its aftermath the air is left bright, as if all the colors were turned up, like seeing with new eyes.&quot;Everything's so pretty!&quot; I said so many times."/>
			<outline text="***Deep linking"/>
			<outline text="As I was driving around the Bay Area this weekend, I thought about the &quot;deep linking&quot; issue raised in a lawsuit by Universal Studios, and reported by Wired News last week:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.wired.com/news/news/politics/story/20948.html "/>
			<outline text="What is a deep link? It's such a new term, there is no accepted definition. So I'm going to offer one. A deep link is a publicly accessible HTML &quot;anchor&quot; tag that points to an off-site web page that is not the home page of the site being pointed to."/>
			<outline text="So, for example, the link to the Wired story above is a deep link. "/>
			<outline text="***Wired probably won't sue"/>
			<outline text="I am fairly sure that Wired will not sue me for linking to their story. In fact, I imagine that they are pleased to have their story pointed to because the page contains several advertisments that they make money from. "/>
			<outline text="Their whole purpose, from a business standpoint, is to get eyeballs to see those ads. Further, the page contains links to other Wired stories, and to the Wired home page, if you want to know more about them, or even bookmark them."/>
			<outline text="In the web world this is called &quot;flow&quot; -- and it's good for business. "/>
			<outline text="Flow is good, and therefore in this context so is deep linking."/>
			<outline text="***When deep linking may be unfair"/>
			<outline text="Universal's website is different from Wired's. Among other things, they use their site to serve movie trailers, short segments of video that promote their movies. It's a form of advertising. But they are huge files, often several megabytes, and serving them costs a lot of money because you need really big pipes to carry all that video."/>
			<outline text="***Movie-List"/>
			<outline text="Enter Jean-Pierre Bazinet, the owner of the Movie-List website, which he calls &quot;the net's most updated movie trailer site&quot;:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.movie-list.com/ "/>
			<outline text="Movie-list is a very simple weblog, a news oriented website. People who want to keep up on the latest movies, or research older ones, tune in to Movie-List. He filters out the corporate stuff, and just shows you the product (this is what Universal objects to)."/>
			<outline text="Bazinet was pointing to the Universal trailers directly, without pointing to the Universal home page, or even the page with the description for each movie. Universal says this is unfair and illegal."/>
			<outline text="It's difficult to understand why Universal is objecting, since the trailers sell tickets and video rentals of their movies. However, the trailers are their intellectual property, so they certainly have the right to raise the question. And it's an interesting question because there is a technical solution, this does not have to be resolved thru a lawsuit."/>
			<outline text="***robots.txt"/>
			<outline text="In the early days of the web the Robot Exclusion Protocol became the accepted way for a website to declare its willingness to be scanned by a search engine or other kinds of web &quot;crawlers.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="http://php.iupui.edu/~lzick/l505/sre.htm "/>
			<outline text="If you don't mind being crawled, you don't have to have the robot file, robots.txt. But if you have one, all robots are supposed to read it and and thru the honor system, respect it. If they say they don't want to be crawled, then don't. "/>
			<outline text="Robots.txt is like a big &quot;People Only&quot; sign."/>
			<outline text="***deepLinks.txt"/>
			<outline text="The Deep Linking issue can be settled in a similar manner."/>
			<outline text="I propose a file called deepLinks.txt. It says whether or not links are permitted into the website, and further, if linking is permitted, it says which sub-directories may be linked to. "/>
			<outline text="It's a clear statement of intention -- anyone linking into a not-permitted location is clearly wrong. Further, the policy could be implemented by software running on your server. With a few technical tricks, Universal could make it impossible for Movie-List users to watch the trailers. But the deepLinks.txt file would be the professional and respectful way to let the outside world know that you don't want their flow."/>
			<outline text="If you don't have a deepLinks.txt file, then any and all linking is permitted. This would allow the web, by default, to retain its current open-linking tradition, which is essential if the web is to retain its charm."/>

			<outline text="The title of the page is &quot;Using copyrighted material from InfoWorld&quot;."/>
			<outline text="***Quote"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Like most online publications, InfoWorld Electric has a policy regarding links. When we refer to a link, we mean a hypertext link, where you post the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of some content on our site to your site. This can be simply including the link in text form or attaching a URL to one of our logos for the reader to click on."/>
			<outline text="&quot;To link to an article on InfoWorld Electric, send an e-mail request to Meera Srinivas with the URL of the InfoWorld content you want to link to. If your request is approved, we will ask you to confirm back to us the exact URL of the place on your site where we can find the link.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Why this is a problem"/>
			<outline text="After reading this page, I posted this notice: &quot;We have been linking to InfoWorld.Com since the inception of Scripting News. We're going to keep doing it until we hear otherwise from InfoWorld. I assume their linking policy is an old not-updated page explaining an old not-enforced policy. However, if they object, we will stop linking to them in the future.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***The policy is serious"/>
			<outline text="I received an email from an InfoWorld insider, a friend, who said that the policy is serious. My correspondent asked not to be identified, and I'm respecting that. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Dave, there's a strong feeling here that allowing other sites to link to us would draw people away from our home page.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Questions"/>
			<outline text="Do they have facts to back up that belief? Do they know for a fact that if I link to an InfoWorld story that there will be fewer reads of their home page?"/>
			<outline text="Would the readers of my site read the InfoWorld piece if I didn't link to it? I don't know, do they?"/>
			<outline text="If they read an article a second time because I link to it, does that harm InfoWorld? How does that deprive them of a view of their home page?"/>
			<outline text="And why are views of their home page so important? Isn't there a link to the home page on every article? (There is.)"/>
			<outline text="And finally does InfoWorld require that search engines get permission before linking to an InfoWorld article? (I checked with a few search engines, they link to InfoWorld, completely disregarding their policy.)"/>
			<outline text="***Irony"/>
			<outline text="Isn't it ironic that the rest of the web is looking for ever-more-creative ways to get other sites to link to them, and a supposed leader in the web has a policy that turns away linkers?"/>
			<outline text="***Why I link to InfoWorld"/>
			<outline text="Every week InfoWorld runs a couple of stories that I think my readers should see. Occasionally I link to them because they mention my product or some cause I support. But the links always come with an implicit endorsement: &quot;Read this because I think you will find it interesting.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Why they should revise their policy"/>
			<outline text="If InfoWorld's management pauses to think about this seriously,I think they will realize that the web makes them stronger, allows their point of view to be more widely disseminated. Linking builds the value of their brand, and thereby builds value for their advertisers. "/>

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;On 7/17/98 I sent an email to a bunch of DaveNet readers asking for their view of the column and the Scripting News website, and what role they play in their thinking. &lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I got back some very interesting emails, and posted them on a website, as a slide show, one every few days, and let a story play out from there.&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, I brought the comments back, as part of the DaveNet site, and here they are. &lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;DaveNet and Scripting News are among the &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; few favorite bookmarks I check every single day. Reasons include:&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Complete &lt;b&gt;honesty and a finely tuned bullshit detector&lt;/b&gt; in Dave's analyses of current industry events, coupled with an emphasis on long-term trends than you rarely find in most other news coverage. Whenever I have knowledge or personal expertise on a topic covered by Dave, I usually find myself in 90% or higher agreement with his comments: this bodes well for trusting what he has to say about things I know nothing about.&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The Scripting News homepage helps &lt;b&gt;fight the Dark Side in the struggle for the soul of the Web&lt;/b&gt;. Many other sites try to entrap users inside their proprietary content and rarely link to the outside world: if this continues, the Web will stop being a &lt;i&gt;web&lt;/i&gt; and turn into a set of disconnected medieval fortresses, each behind its own moat. Let's maintain linking and open flow of information, as practiced by Scripting News. I visit the site &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; often because of its outbound links: instead of struggling through the unfriendly navigation mazes at certain commercial news sites, I can rely on Dave pointing me to anything important they have to say.&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;minimalist design&lt;/b&gt; is a joy to use (and not coincidentally, fully consistent with my own design principles): no wait for bloated downloads; full focus on delivering value to users.&lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Dave calls it absolutely as he sees it in his columns; he was passionately faithful to his own core beliefs when he talked about the death penalty, in some of the best columns he's done. Not enough people take these kinds of risks.&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;DaveNet is proof of the Net's power. In another era Dave would have written a newsletter with not a tenth of the reach, and not a hundredth of the impact.&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="Bill Gates">
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Dave has a good grasp of the technical issues and challenges the industry faces. He's been around the industry long enough to qualify as an observer; at the same time he is still close to the things that really matter to developers.  This is an important perspective that often gets lost in other discussion and commentary.  This experience also gives him a perspective that is tempered by experience but not out of touch.&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I agree with him and sometimes I disagree with him; sometimes he's defended Microsoft and sometimes he's taken us to task--but I always know his perspective will add to the industry dialogue on a given topic. He saw the power of communication using the Internet very early on and has been very effective in using that medium to have interactive discussions on a wide variety of both technical and human topics.&lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I have been a DaveNet subscriber going back to my days as VP of Advanced Technology at Apple Computer.  Back in those days, much of Dave's focus was on the trials and tribulations of Apple.  &lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;As many of us have &quot;gotten a life&quot; after Apple, it has been very interesting to see Dave's vision of the software industry broaden, as his business and technology focus has broadened.  The rise of the Web, the (literal) trials and tribulations of Microsoft, the role of the Mac in a Windows-dominated world, the migration of Dave's software base to Windows, and the ever-broadening role of scripting technology, including new technologies such as XML -- all have been chronicled through the years in DaveNet.  &lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of an exclusive audience. This may be a little controversial.  It seems that when columns or people get more widely known, they become less controversial or less outspoken.  I hope that doesn't happen here.

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;This guy had something else in mind, I suspect, since the very possiblity of such a thing as DaveNet arose long after he descended. Nevertheless, his phrase applies here.&lt;br&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The reason it applies is that despite of Dave's feigned curmudgeonliness - or perhaps because of it - he is a smart man with a big heart (already a rarity) who is fearless and free enough to tell the &quot;truth&quot; as he sees it. He also has no economic incentive to do otherwise. (Unlike practically everyone else I know these days, with my own possible exception.)&lt;br&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Thus, his pronouncements on the nuts and bits on The Great Work are conveyed by a medium of embarrassingly naked veracity. His method is his medium.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/24/99; 7:51:18 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead1&quot;&gt;Good evening!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I just got back from the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in Monterey, and I had a wonderful time. So many interesting things to say, my mind is buzzing. There's been a change in the Internet software industry, in a way this was a coming out party for it. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The O'Reilly conference was like an Apple or Microsoft developer conference, but there was no Apple or Microsoft. Yes, each open source community has a dictator, Larry Wall for Perl, Guido van Rossum for Python, John Ousterhout for Tcl, Brian Behlendorf for Apache, Eric Allman for Sendmail, Linus Torvalds for Linux. But the fascinating thing about this conference is that the dictators only got a slice of the time on stage, the rest of the work is done by developers, and get this, they have a lot of independence. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Independence is what I wanted, sitting in the audience at Apple's developer conference, year after year in the 80s and early 90s. A chance to pitch my peers on a new idea. Ask the people who know me from the Macintosh community, this is what I never liked about being captive to a platform vendor. They do all the talking, you're supposed to listen, and a lot of good ideas get flushed down the toilet.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I'll certainly have more to say about this, but having just returned from the conference, before eating dinner and retiring for the evening, I wanted to scoop the rest of the news sites, because Ted Nelson did something surprising and historic at the show, and very few people tuned into it.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead2&quot;&gt;Ted Nelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I ran into Jon Udell, the veteran technical columnist for Byte.Com, on Monday evening. He said he had just attended a very strange Birds of the Feather meeting, led by Ted Nelson, one of my mentors in my formative years as a software developer. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Nelson wrote a classic book that had huge influence on my generation of software engineers and designers. The book was Computer Lib/Dream Machines. For me, it was confirmation of what I suspected -- that computers were part of the hippie revolution of the 60s and 70s. He said that computer power didn't have to reside exclusively in the corporate world, that they could be used to foster free expression and empower people where earlier forms of communication, TV, radio, and print, were largely one-way,  hierarchic, and disempowering.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;In those days these were radical ideas. Today, they're not as radical, the web opens up the technology, but they're still out of the box, not the norm. Real communication is rare, but not as much as it was, thanks to computers and networks of computers.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Ted Nelson was and is the prototype for all computer visionaries. He had the vision that computers could be an area where vision could be applied. He described the strange world of hypertext that I understood, in my youth, at an intuitive even visceral level.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead3&quot;&gt;Nelson makes history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;After writing his book, where he talked about a hypothetical system called Xanadu, Nelson recruited a team of believers to actually implement it. Now, twenty years later, and ten years after all work on the system had ceased, Nelson and his band of believers have released the source code to the Xanadu system. And my friend, Udell, had been one of a small number of people present for the unveiling, the only other reporter was from Upside. (I bet they have a longish lead time, even for their website.)&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;This morning I asked Jon to write the story. He clearly got the scoop. So we went to the machine room at the Doubletree where he wrote the story and I accumulated historic background links on the Scripting News home page. While we were doing this other people in the room discovered what we were doing and started refreshing the Scripting News home page. Then Jon posted his story and I linked to it:&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;http://www.byte.com/nntp/joncon?comment_id=1701 &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The Xanadu software can be downloaded from this site:&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;http://www.udanax.com/ &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Go get it!&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead4&quot;&gt;The golden age of journalism?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Even though Jon and I get our paychecks from different sources, we worked together as I imagine people in the golden age of journalism (whenever that was) worked together. Get the story and pull out all the stops. Damn the torpedos. Whatever. It's an energizing attitude. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Let's get the story out! I kept saying, in a good-natured way of course. We were trying to beat the imaginary competition. And now, many hours later, we still have the opportunity. The web moves s-l-o-w-l-y at latching onto a news story that isn't fed to it via a big corporate press release from a big corporate PR firm. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Eventually they'll get a clue and they'll be scouring the web for hot new stories. You just watch, over the next week this very curious story will percolate its way into your life. Remember where you heard it first.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead5&quot;&gt;Roger Gregory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Later in the day I talked with Roger Gregory, the lead developer of Xanadu. I had met him a few times before, he's a good guy. I asked him if the software really works. He said it does. I asked what his goal is. He wants to see the ideas out there. I recognize the sentiment. I promised to help.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;You can help by spreading the word. Let people know that the Udanax site exists (Udanax is Xanadu spelled backwards.) Let's crawl thru this bit of history and see how they did.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead6&quot;&gt;Antique software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that Dan Bricklin's release of VisiCalc, and our release of the antique outliners in July were not directly related to Nelson's release of the Xanadu code, but it surely follows the trend. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about it. Do we still listen to music created ten years ago? We do. Should we look into software ideas that were explored and then abandoned ten years ago? Of course.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead7&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Compaq DOA, Microsoft NT setup cruel and unusual punishment&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/26/99; 1:29:09 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead1&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday it was time to buy a new desktop computer. If you want to stay on the leading edge these days, as I do, you have to buy a new computer every six months or so. There's been a steady climb in price-performance, and when much of your software is implemented in an interpretive scripting language, as mine is, every performance boost makes new wonderful synergies possible.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this has meant that I have had to become a frequent customer of PC clone vendors, and a frequent installer of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. It might just be my hardware karma, which has always been bad (I'm a software guy) or it might be that the industry is incapable of dealing with customers on a professional level, and that Microsoft's operating system suffers from a lack of attention to ease of use. It's a withering experience, as the title of this story indicates.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after some horrible struggles with Dell that lead to outages both in productivity and service to my customers, I vowed I would never buy another Dell product again, which left me searching for a PC vendor who deserved my business, so I tried Compaq.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead2&quot;&gt;Inauspicious start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I found that Compaq had trouble even taking the order.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;After entering my order on their online store website, they called two days later saying that my credit card had been declined. This was embarassing! I read the numbers off the card over the phone and the guy resubmitted it, and it went thru (I have good credit and  a high charging limit). &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I asked how this had gotten screwed up, and he said that his computer printout was missing four digits from my credit card number. That's clearly their problem. I almost certainly entered the numbers correctly. I have a lot of experience doing this! And I would be surprised (and they should be ashamed) if their online ordering software accepts incorrectly formatted credit card numbers.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I asked if this would change the arrival date of the computer, since this was one of my criteria for selecting Compaq. I wanted the computer to arrive before I left for the O'Reilly Conference, not while I was at the conference. The representative (who was not a Compaq employee) said it would be delayed until Thursday or Friday of the following week, and there was nothing he could do about it. As it turns out this was a lie. Later in the conversation he said he would pay for shipping and get it to me on Tuesday. I hate being lied to, there's nothing more humiliating, especially when I'm a customer.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;That's the background, now the saga continues, it got worse, if you can believe it.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead3&quot;&gt;The saga continues!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The Compaq arrived Wednesday morning a couple of days late, and I happily cleared off the desk space for it and started the install, but it tripped up when it started to install Windows NT networking. It would loop over a dialog saying certain files were missing on the hard drive, it asked me to click on OK, but when I clicked on OK it just brought the dialog back up again.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;So I called Compaq. We spent 1.5 hours wasting time because the service tech didn't listen to me explain what was going on. Another 1.5 hours later my wireless phone ran out of batteries and we got disconnected and I had to start over with another tech.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;We pulled the networking card and did the setup and this time NT completed the install. We waited while NT restarted no less than six times during the setup, each time getting slightly closer to a running system. I watched it reboot twice to install IE4, all the time realizing this was a total waste because I run IE5, not IE4. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Finally the system was up, but there was no networking. We went to Compaq's FTP site and downloaded a 7 megabyte file, which doesn't fit onto a floppy of course, so I had to do a makedisk and move it across to the other machine. Choose Properties from Network Neighborhood, yes I have the disk, install, bad disk, go back and make another disk, try again, it installs, but still no network. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Basically the machine doesn't network, and without that it's completely useless to me. The next step was to escalate it, to have a service tech come to my workplace and fart around with the system, but I decided instead to say goodbye to Compaq and their misery. I called my credit card company and cancelled payment. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I lost the best part of a day on this bullshit. I wonder if Bill Gates and Ben Rosen have the time to screw around at this level. My time is valuable. I have a life I like. In this exploration I had to open the box three times and do things that I swore I never would do. This is a ridiculous way to run an industry. I paid good money for this stuff. They clearly have no respect for that.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead4&quot;&gt;Two complaints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I have two complaints, one for Compaq, who can't take an order and can't deliver hardware that works. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;My second larger complaint is with Microsoft. I finally figured out that they don't produce an operating system that a mortal human being can set up. I have some advice for Microsoft. Every executive should buy a machine for themselves, from one of the clone vendors, and struggle thru the process their customers have to go thru. They're horribly vulnerable. Compared to this process, setting up Linux was a breeze. If they really want to be humbled, go buy a Mac. Turn the mother on, click on a few control panels, and you're on the net. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Where do I want to go today? I want to be able to spend $2000 and get a computer that works! None of the clone vendors can do this. They all point the finger back at Microsoft. I think they're right.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead5&quot;&gt;Why I wrote this now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I always forget how humiliating the NT setup process is. I always fail to write it up. I wanted to do this now, while the experience is totally fresh, so I won't forget.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead6&quot;&gt;Imagine if cars worked this way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I just bought a new car. They took care of the whole installation. It was ready to drive the instant I gave them the check. Any car vendor that made me go thru this kind of hell would be out of business in an instant. It will be that way with computers. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, check this out. You have less to fear from Sun, Netscape or AOL. Your worst enemy is in the corridors of Redmond. Go set up one of your own boxes. Do it all yourself. Your eyes will open.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead7&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;PS: DOA stands for Dead On Arrival.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;PPS: Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited by the US Constitution.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;PPPS: Windows NT Workstation is a fine operating system once you get it set up. It does what an OS is supposed to do, it fades into the background, and I can focus on my work, which is why I use computers. I don't find the boxes interesting, at all. If the box could shrink further, and become nicer to look at, and more closed, I would be quite happy. When they said I had to open the box I said &quot;This is unfair!&quot; And I meant it.&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead1&quot;&gt;Good morning DaveNet!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;It's been almost a week since I last wrote, I've been working on  Frontier, that's been taking almost all my working cycles, except for the time I've been enjoying with the company of our membership on discuss.userland.com. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;This last week has been incredible on our servers. The goodwill and intelligence and positive spirits have been amazing. We've tackled some difficult issues, and have stayed on track, no flames, very little invasiveness, mostly just happy people being smart. In their power, not whining about how someone let them down. OK. Let me correct that. At least not *all* of the messages have been whining and powerless. (I've even posted a few of these, expressing my frustration at wanting to buy a new PC that works and being powerless to do so!)&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;In the background I've had a DaveNet piece in progress about syndication and aggregation. It's a very long piece, and it's been difficult for me to ship it because the issues are so complex. So instead I'm going to break it into smaller pieces and hope to have the whole area covered by the end of the month. There's something new going on, and it touches on some sensitive issues like who owns your home page -- you or the web?&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead2&quot;&gt;Closing loops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;These days when I expose an issue it gets better coverage than in the old days. Three recent examples:&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;1. The missing Microsoft Instant Messaging spec was first reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/08/04/whyShouldAolOpenUp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in DaveNet. While the other news sources focused on the real-time battles between AOL and Microsoft (a legitimate story) we focused on Microsoft. Their story had a huge gaping hole. They were calling for AOL to open up their servers, but Microsoft's servers weren't open! A few days later, an announcement came from Microsoft that they would provide the specification in two weeks, and this morning it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-movva-msn-messenger-protocol-00.txt&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;. Loop closed. From here it will be interesting to see if any compatible software is offered from other developers.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;2. We reported on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/08/09/deepLinking&quot;&gt;deep linking&lt;/a&gt; issue in general, and InfoWorld's deep linking policy &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/08/12/infoworldAndDeepLinking&quot;&gt;specifically&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result, InfoWorld reversed their policy, giving us credit for having raised the issue and bringing about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9908/31/link.suits.idg/index.html&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;3. And finally, we've been reporting on antique software, the re-releases of &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/07/15/danBricklinsVisicalc&quot;&gt;VisiCalc&lt;/a&gt;, Dennis Ritchie's C compiler, the early Borland languages and the Living Videotext &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/08/03/more11c1987&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/news.html&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; from the Washington Post, the London Sunday Times, the San Jose Mercury-News, and continuing coverage on the MacInTouch website. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I mention these things because it's important to note success. It's not always like pissing in the wind. Sometimes when an issue is raised there are next steps and (in my humble opinion) good things happen.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead3&quot;&gt;Who owns your home page?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;So, in that spirit, I raise a question for all people and organizations who run news oriented websites. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if other websites continually read the HTML of your home page, break it up into individual headlines and links to stories, repurpose the URLs to point thru their servers, and distribute those links to people who want to read your news, along with news from many other sources?&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;This is not an idle question -- because there are several sites, some operating out of public view, that are running &quot;story scraper&quot; agents, that do exactly this. The sites they visit are the most popular news sites. To my knowledge, few if any of them have asked for the permission of the sites the scrape.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead4&quot;&gt;There's a line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;We've engaged in discussion with some of the agents, some of the discussion has been respectful and positive, and some of it hasn't. I don't have much doubt as to whether it's fair or legal. I think it is unfair, and while I'm not a lawyer, judge or jury, I also think if one of the target sites objected and sued, the scrapers would be forced to stop. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there's been very little awareness of this issue. If the scrapers sent a request for permission, would the question get any consideration? It's my hope, with this article, that that process can begin now.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it's clearly OK to link to a story on another site as it relates to a story I'm writing, or a subject I believe my readers are interested in. For example, it would be fair for me to point to the InfoWorld article where they reversed their position on deep linking, or to the Washington Post article about antique software. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;But, again in my opinion, it would *not* be fair for me to write a script that reads the home page of the San Jose Mercury-News, pulls off links to all the articles and the headline text and emails them, mixed in with links scraped from the New York Times home page, to a list, unless the Mercury-News and the Times had given their permission. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The collection of stories on a home page, in my opinion, is a creative work. It's intellectual property, and is protected if there's a copyright notice on the home page. That's why the copyright notice is there -- to claim ownership, and to claim the right to determine how the information and ideas on the page, as a collection, are used.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;There is a line here, on one side of the line, we're quoting legitimate sources. On the other side, it's theft of intellectual property. It is my belief that at least some of the current scraper engines are on the wrong side of the line.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead5&quot;&gt;It's not an easy problem!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Now the proponents of scraping point out that what they're doing is exactly what the search engines, Alta Vista, Excite, Google, et al, are doing. And they would be right, up to a point. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;On the search engines, they don't present complete works. They take the links and invisibly store them in a database, and when a search is submitted, they send the links back to interested readers. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;I use search engines, I depend on them for my work, it would be difficult for me to say they're doing anything wrong.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead6&quot;&gt;Why I don't scrape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Enter RSS, an XML-based format for delivering to agents exactly the information that the scrapers are deriving from the HTML source of the websites. I've written about RSS before, my company has made a substantial investment in it, we co-designed the format with Netscape, and we've built software on both sides of RSS, a content management system that generates RSS, and an aggregator that collects it. I believe RSS is the right way to go for the following reasons.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;First, I prefer to build on a format that's used solely for syndication, so the webmaster's intent can't possibly be misunderstood. If you have an RSS file that's registered with my syndication engine, you clearly want me to aggregate it. There's no other purpose for an RSS file.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Second, by storing the information in RSS, there's no mistaking a non-news link for a news story. Have you ever used a search engine to search for a story on one subject and have it return twenty hits because they contained links to the story? With a separate syndication file, again, there's no mistaking what a link is about. Only news stories belong in a RSS file, not links from the template for the HTML rendering.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Third, we can extend RSS in the future to include other important information. For example, The Motley Fool, which covers publicly traded companies, wants to include a set of ticker symbols with every story. This makes perfect sense for their kind of content, but would not be needed for a site that covers a set of open source development projects. By starting fresh with a new format, just for syndication, we'll have more room to expand the format in the future to respond to opportunities in the market. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead7&quot;&gt;An example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of an RSS file, one that lists four stories that are available on The Motley Fool website:&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;http://nirvana.userland.com/misc/foolDemoChannel.xml &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;The full file which is updated whenever they add or change a story on their site:&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;http://www.fool.com/xml/foolnews_rss091.xml &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead8&quot;&gt;Excellent tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Netscape has an excellent tutorial on RSS on their website.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/mnn20/quickstart.html &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;mainHead9&quot;&gt;The solution is simple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;If you run a popular website, it's now time to think about the automated deep linking question. &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;My recommendation, if you want to disseminate links to your stories thru the new channels that are developing, make a small investment by producing a parallel version of your home page in RSS format and let us know where it is:&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;http://my.userland.com/register &lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;Our channel list is public, so any competitive aggregation engine can read the list, and churn your links thru their engine. We may profit at some point in the future from an economic system that rewards us, and our affiliates, for bringing traffic to your site. We already have competition, from Netscape, and there's sure to be more of that, because this is a valuable service and there's lots of room for diversification.&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;p&gt;So here's the summary. If you run a popular site, you're probably being scraped right now. This is not a someday issue, it's a right-now issue. If you want your links spread far and wide, consider supporting RSS. If you don't want that to happen, make your intent clear.&lt;br&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Zig-zag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>
			<outline text="The thing that's so wonderful about the web is that it's so easy to put up a website. And the thing that's so frustrating about the web is that it can be hard to get people to come look at your stuff."/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Concentrators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>
			<outline text="That's why, in the early days of the web, so much attention was placed on &quot;concentrators&quot;, or web sites that sucked in the web, and then directed people to the places they wanted to go."/>
			<outline text="There are two basic forms of concentration -- search engines like AltaVista and directories like Yahoo. Directories provide a structure for the web, and search engines suck the web into a soup. One is like the table of contents in front of a book and the other is like the index in the back of the book, but neither is exactly like their print counterpart. "/>
			<outline text="The concentrators are far from ideal because the search engines don't pick up new stuff quickly and only cover a small portion of the web; and the directories must be edited by human beings, who often lack what usability expert Jakob Nielsen calls &quot;domain expertise&quot; or even an interesting opinion. Further, directories rarely address the issues of cross-referencing, offering a single hierarchy and listing a site only once. And it can be difficult to get a site listed at Yahoo. I suspect you have to pay them money, but where is this discussed or disclosed on the Yahoo site?"/>
			<outline text="These are the thorny issues that web entrepreneurs and technologists spend a lot of time thinking about. There have been a wide variety of attempts to tweak and recombine the search engine and directory formula, including Alexa, About, Ask, Deja, Google, GoTo,  Netscape, Third Voice, to name just a few.There are dozens if not hundreds of well capitalized companies trying to nail this one -- to find the formula that makes the web coalesce around a single site. Some have had stunning success but most have struggled to find an audience.  "/>
			<outline text="I think the smartest business strategy is to embrace the distributed nature of the web, and build businesses that profit from this. Otherwise it's like fighting City Hall, swimming upstream, or competing with Microsoft. Longterm you end up in jail, being eaten, or testifying in Washington."/>
			<outline text="It's the old win-win thing. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Why concentrators suck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>
			<outline text="All concentrators have one thing in common, they like to point in, not out. Economically they are incentivized to capture flow, not distribute it. It's against their interest to point outside of their sites, but guess what, that's their whole purpose! So they're at odds with their purpose? My philosophical brother Jakob Nielsen calls this the &quot;dark side of the web&quot; and I agree!"/>
			<outline text="Here's a paragraph Jakob wrote when I asked what he thought of my website: &quot;The Scripting News homepage helps fight the Dark Side in the struggle for the soul of the Web. Many other sites try to entrap users inside their proprietary content and rarely link to the outside world: if this continues, the Web will stop being a web and turn into a set of disconnected medieval fortresses, each behind its own moat.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Feeding the concentrators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Dark side or not, the concentrators have grown enormously, at least in stock value, so much so that there's a software and services company, Vignette, that has grown to serve them. Initially Vignette offered a content management system, StoryServer, that's somewhat like the software my company sells, Frontier. They helped large content sites like News.Com, ZDNet, Pathfinder, build systems to pour lots of stories out to the web. But the portals, Yahoo, Excite, etc, generally cooked their own content management software. And they bought stories from sources that didn't use Vignette, sources like AP and Reuters."/>
			<outline text="So Vignette went the next step, and took the lead in what was then a new technology for the web, syndication. Last year they released a specification thru the W3C called ICE. With an ICE-compatible server, ZDNet could now publish their content, without ads, and sell republishing rights to portals. It was a clever business for Vignette, because it furthered dependence on their software, and if it caught on, it would create new customers for their software, the portals."/>
			<outline text="Focus on the flow here. A story begins its life on the desktop of an editor. It enters the StoryServer system. It appears on the home page of the site that the editor works for. And shortly after that it appears on a dozen other sites, repurposed, with different ads and different links, but otherwise the story is exactly the same."/>
			<outline text="Now focus on the cash flow. The portal puts an ad on the page. They collect revenue for the ad. A percentage of the revenue flows back to the company that the editor works for. Money flows from the source of the hit to the source of the story."/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;What if value flowed the other way?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>
			<outline text="My company, UserLand, has been working with Netscape and others on a reversal of the Vignette philosophy. Instead of being a flow concentrator, we propose to be flow distributors, with value flowing in the opposite direction, from the source of the content to the source of the click."/>
			<outline text="Our aggregation engine, My.UserLand.Com, gathers new links from the web and flows them for free to anyone who wants to pick them up. We are working on open source &quot;affiliate&quot; software that makes it easy for anyone who operates a web site to tap into this flow, offering a wide variety of news sources to readers. Everything you need to participate in the syndication flow will be free and open source. It's designed to run on the LANs behind the firewalls at all the major web sites, on all flavors of Unix and eventually on NT and Mac OS. It'll be tough competition for Vignette."/>
			<outline text="Focus on the flow. A story begins its life on the desktop of an editor. It appears on the site the editor works for, linked into the home page, and it is also linked to from the XML version of the home page. The aggregation engine reads the file every hour, notices that there's a new story, and pumps it out to all subscribing affiliates. It appears on the home page of an affiliate. A reader clicks on the link, opening the page on the editor's site. A payment is generated, from the content source, the editor's site, to the source of the click. "/>
			<outline text="The more you pay for a click, the more incentive there is for people to link to you. It's a way of turning cash into flow. You're betting that a visitor that comes to you this way will like what they see and become a regular visitor. You're betting on the stickyness of your template, basically."/>
			<outline text="In our system, each story has a *single* location, the site where it originated. We think this is the way the web was meant to work. Stories can live and grow while new information is obtained. Comments from readers can add new facts and ideas and link to other related stories. And the portal sites, the ones with the huge flow, can play a big role, because in this model, they get paid for many (but not all) of the hits they deliver. It's a micro-payment form of what they already do so well on a much larger scale."/>
			<outline text="In fact Excite, one of the more innovative portals, already has such a program in place, affiliate.excite.com. They pay sites that deliver flow in &quot;award points&quot;. We'd like to see flow delivery sites to be paid in real currency, because people who run sites that direct flow, also known as weblogs, need to buy groceries, and for that you need cash. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;The role of content management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Regardless of whether our approach is better than Vignette's, we're incentivized to make it work. Vignette sells a high-priced content management system for big publishing organizations. UserLand makes content management software aimed at a larger market, with an under-$1000 pricetag, for everything, not just to get started. (Vignette's price isn't publicly posted, but installations commonly go for between $50K and $2 million.)"/>
			<outline text="Content management is key to the next architecture of the web, on both sides of the syndication connection. If processes aren't automated, the job quickly becomes too complex for human beings to manage. However, if you have stories flowing thru content management, you can hook in payment systems in lots of different places, and the web can grow economically, without sacrificing the thing that makes the web unique -- a low cost of entry into the publishing business."/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;An end to the Uber-Operating System&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/12/99; 9:12:03 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Good morning!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="On Monday morning, along with Microsoft and Developmentor, we released a specification called the Simple Object Access Protocol, or SOAP. It's available on www.xmlrpc.com. The URL follows later in this piece. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="SOAP, as its name implies, is an object access protocol. It is more complex than the XML-RPC specification, which is deployed on a wide variety of operating systems and scripting languages. The purpose of both specs is to enable scripted web applications to cross operating system boundaries.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I am an author of both specs, along with Don Box of Developmentor and a small group of Microsoft architects and engineers, including Gopal Kakivaya, Andrew Layman, Satish Thatte, and for the earlier spec, Bob Atkinson and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="SOAP is a milestone in a process that started for me in the mid-80s on MS-DOS, and continued into the 90s with interapplication scripting on the Macintosh, and onto the Internet with the release of the XML-RPC specification in April 1998. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="SOAP is a milestone for Microsoft because it is the opening of DCOM, the protocol for connecting applications over Windows networks.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Why worry?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="So what does this mean if you're a web developer, web investor, a writer, or just a person who enjoys using the Internet? That's the purpose of this piece, to explain the philosophy of XML-RPC, updated, factoring in all that we now know, explaining where it can go and what it makes possible.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;A new front-end for web developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="There's a big opportunity to connect desktop tools, text editors, spreadsheets, graphic programs, to powerful content management systems running on servers. Programs like Word, Emacs, Dreamweaver, BBEdit and PhotoShop are connected to collaborative systems such as Zope, Vignette StoryServer, Allaire's Spectra, and UserLand Frontier.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Writing and designing for the web is too hard. If we can use the know-how that already exists on the desktops we can turn the desktop into a powerful and easy-to-use web content creation workstation. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The back end of the web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Further, there's a behind-the-scenes, mostly invisible Internet-based network that pushes information  between servers. It's the &quot;back end&quot; of the Internet, and today it's a hodgepodge of incompatible, weakly supported and mostly isolated worlds that, even though they are quite powerful, can't work with each other. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;The goal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="The goal, simply put, is to create a high-level way for machines to call other machines, with the Internet as the wire that connects them. This is as far-reaching a vision as Sun's Java, but it's even bigger than Java, because it includes Java and every other programming language running on any operating system that can connect to the web and understands XML, which is to say everywhere that there's life today.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Uber-operating system?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="While Sun, IBM and others wanted to turn Java into the &amp;uuml;ber-operating system, UserLand and Microsoft worked to flatten the differences between operating systems. The latter approach is based on an appreciation for diversity, the former, was an attempt  to suck the whole world into Java. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Today's Internet is built out of Java, yes indeed, but it is also built on Python, Perl, Tcl, Basic, COM, AppleScript, Cold Fusion and PHP. And there's some C and C++ in there too. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Ironically, the only way to move forward at full speed is to slow down and support diversity, embrace it, let it be, even celebrate it. The more inclusive you can be, the more powerfully you move. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It would be a mistake to try to change all computers to a specific kind of operating system. For some users Windows is the right choice. For others it's Unix or Macintosh OS. There is no single operating system, nor is there a single programming or scripting language that suits every developer or every application.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Is Windows the &amp;uuml;ber-operating system?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Windows is not the only OS that matters, however I am not sure if Microsoft would agree with this statement. At some level I think they're still struggling to get everyone to be Windows developers. But part of Microsoft thinks they can compete even if people develop applications that don't run on Windows.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Give Microsoft credit for getting SOAP out the door. There was a lot of resistance. If SOAP gains traction, it allows us to build networks that connect to Windows networks without using Microsoft operating software. There's courage! Thanks to Microsoft for taking a chance and opening up.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Is Linux the &amp;uuml;ber-operating system?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Linux is not the one true operating system either, however I'm not sure if all Linux advocates would agree. People who use spreadsheets and word processors and web browsers and email programs choose Windows in droves, and rightly so. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Linux is still in its infancy as a desktop OS, and that's fine. It's a rich and reliable server. Linux can be even more useful more quickly if it embraces Microsoft, and extends its capabilities for Windows users who can benefit from Linux as an inexpensive and reliable server operating system. Later, when Linux can help people design and edit their web sites and do their business plans, people will remember the compatibility it had when Windows was their choice for workstations and clients.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Once again, this time with confidence, I pitch the Linux community to work with us. We've made it easy to build networks out of all flavors of systems and applications. If you adopt XML-RPC, if you take ownership of it, your networks can participate as peers and your advantages will shine in new light.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Is Mac OS the &amp;uuml;ber-operating system?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I don't think anyone, even Apple, thinks Mac OS is the one operating system for all applications. In that way Mac OS is ahead of all the others, because it must co-exist and it knows it. With the XML-RPC connection, Mac applications already connect to servers on Unix and NT, allowing designers, writers and graphic artists to contribute powerfully to net applications with maximum ease-of-use.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;10&quot;&gt;The purpose of XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Therefore, the purpose of XML-RPC is to erase the lines that separate applications, to allow developers to bring the power of the Internet to the desktop and in the connections between back-end applications, no matter what operating system they run on. The more standardization there is, the more powerful the applications and the faster we can move.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="More concisely, the purpose of XML-RPC is to end once and for all, the idea that there can or should be one operating system for all. No more &amp;uuml;ber-operating systems, and no press releases claiming &amp;uuml;ber-ness! Thank you very much.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Two levels of XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="So there are now two levels of XML-RPC. Here's a pointer to the specification for the simple protocol:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec&quot;&gt;http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And here's a pointer to the new specification:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/soap&quot;&gt;http://www.xmlrpc.com/soap&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's your choice. Either spec will work. We support both. Let's have fun!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Why I'm interested in XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="My goal is to empower Frontier developers and users by giving them an easy way to connect and integrate applications running anywhere on the Internet, no matter what operating system they're running on, whether it be Windows, Mac or Unix. We're much closer to fully achieving that vision today than we've ever been before.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Expect wiring-level incompatibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Finally, every big company will probably launch their own specification. Implementors should be aware of this, and should plan their software interfaces accordingly. Expect wiring-level incompatibility and you won't be surprised. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Once again XML-RPC is moving. I hope developers give it serious consideration. We want this stuff to move into all corners of the Internet as fast as possible. We're going to listen and learn, and work with everyone we can, to build out the system of interconnected cross-platform net applications.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Let's (all) have fun! (Together.)&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Thanks to Microsoft there's new support for XML-RPC. This is great! Recalling the early years of DaveNet when I asked Apple to tune into the Internet, contrast that with what Microsoft has done. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It was really simple, we made a proposal, publicly, thru this column, they accepted it, and now Windows networking is open to scripting from other platforms. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="As far as I'm concerned this is the best model for working together. No non-disclosure agreements. A simple proposal, a timely response. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Microsoft didn't have to work with us. No one would have asked Bill Gates &quot;Why don't you work with UserLand?&quot; No analyst or venture capitalist would have ever asked the question either.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="So now that we have an agreement on bridges between scripting environments, the next question is what kind of traffic do we send across those bridges?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There will be lots of answers to the question. It's like asking what kinds of software do you want to run on your desktop, or what kind of website can you create with HTML. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What kind of cooking to you like, Italian, French or Chinese? All three require kitchens and tables, waiters and utensils.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The browser interface is important so that members of the editorial team can add a story or comment from any web-enabled desktop. The text editing interface, which depends on XML-RPC, is for real writing. The goal is to bring the web to professional writing tools, to eliminate complexity and to empower writers. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="With support for XML-RPC in Windows, we'll be connected to the most popular writing tools. We're working with other developers to build the same capability into the Macintosh OS.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We released the specification for this protocol in August, and encourage all developers of content management systems, discussion group software, and desktop editing tools, to join us in implementing this interface:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$181&quot;&gt;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$181&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Further, we're learning that this interface has applications in instant messaging. Imagine checking an option to record a conversation to a website, where you can then use convenient editing tools to tweak it up for publication. This application is definitely on our horizon now.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Distributed preferences flow thru XML-RPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="This weekend we released an XML-RPC interface for preferences flow. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="To understand where this is useful, imagine you're running a website across several machines, not necessarily on the same local area network. Further, they might not even be running the same content management software.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text=" If some or all of the servers are churning out dynamic content according to user preferences, you run into the problem of preferences flow. We needed this on UserLand.Com, as does the developer of every site with more than modest flow.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I imagine that every application server vendor is building their own solution to this problem, but at UserLand we chose to be open, our purpose is to not just create an important feature for our customers, but to have our software play well in mixed environments.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Users should want standards because they protect their investment. Say you spent $2 million on a content server, but next year a more powerful system comes along, priced more reasonably. You'd probably want to be able to flip a switch and start using the new system, while still running the old one. By building on standards, all vendors can offer that kind of compatibility. Users should be asking the question of their vendors. &quot;What if something better comes along? Do I have to stay with you?&quot; Listen carefully to the answer.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="At UserLand we have so much confidence in our product that we offer open interfaces at every point of connection. This means you could use PHP to do the preferences management and use Frontier as an affiliate server. Or deploy Frontier as the preferences hub and render content with Cold Fusion, ASP, Zope or whatever you like. If we agree on how to make customization features configurable in a standard way, users get more choice. That's the strongest selling point any vendor can offer -- choice.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So, if you like this idea, please send the following pointer to your favorite application server vendor and ask them, for me, to consider supporting open preferences flow thru XML-RPC:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$496&quot;&gt;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$496&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Story flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="In the next two weeks we will do a similar treatment for syndicated story flow thru XML-RPC.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is the other end of the pipe in content management software. Once a story has appeared on the web, how do interested people find out about it? This is RSS, the syndication format we're working on with Netscape.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The story flow interface defines how an affiliate site hooks into the flow of new stories. From there, they can use the flow to add headlines to their home page, or flow the text thru a search engine, or combine the flow of several sites into a single site (this is especially valuable on corporate intranets and in education). And there probably are dozens of other useful ways to flow the links to interested readers.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Search engine interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Another very valuable area is XML-RPC-based interfaces that allow content management systems and search engines to work together at a higher-level. We could tell a search engine a lot about the documents we manage. For example, we could eliminate the confusing template information that the search engines receive when they crawl our sites thru HTTP and scarf bits of information about our content by reading the HTML. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thru XML-RPC we can feed them the content itself, and update them whenever it changes. In 1999 much higher-level search engines are possible. In 2000, it will get higher still. We already have working technology in this area, and in the next few weeks we will formally and openly show how it works.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Evangelism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="With Microsoft's support we can ask for more support. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I want XML-RPC to be owned by the Internet, not by any set of companies. It's too good to just have Microsoft, Developmentor and UserLand behind it. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I want Red Hat and Caldera, VA Systems, Novell and Sun, IBM and Apple, O'Reilly, Allaire, Digital Creations, WebMethods, DataChannel, Netgravity, Carmen's Headline Viewer, Conxion, AOL, Amazon, eBay, Excite, Google and Yahoo, Gomez and Epinions, IETF and W3C, Stanford and Dartmouth, Deja and WebCrossing, Jakob Nielsen, Linus Torvalds, Eric S.

				<outline text="And I'll not forget Microsoft, our friend, and a diverse multi-national company with lots of users. To everyone who is reading this at Microsoft, let's wire up your applications to the web. The specifications are on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-box-http-soap-00.txt&quot;&gt;IETF&lt;/a&gt; website and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec&quot;&gt;XML-RPC.COM&lt;/a&gt;. The more cross-network connections your software has the more possible uses it has too.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is far too big a market for UserLand, and I believe, too big for Microsoft as well. Let's build services that connect our net-based offerings at higher and higher levels. Let's turn the Internet into a powerful Turing Machine. Microsoft has helped. We don't need everyone in the loop, just the most visionary, ambitious and entrepreneurial  developers. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Let's go!&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="PS: The Turing Machine is a mathematical model for computing defined by British mathematician Alan Turing in 1936 at Princeton.

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Investing in Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I'd love to see Microsoft make an investment in making Windows apps run smoothly on Linux.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It would take a big headache off my list. It would allow my development team to focus on what we do best, building new servers and workstation interfaces for web publishing.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're working towards a Linux version of our software, but what a waste of resources. It would make more sense, to me, if Microsoft did this for us.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I see it as the logical next step after SOAP. The networking interface is open now. No undocumented APIs, open sockets between apps. This is why SOAP is so important. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now, if Microsoft had a true partnership with developers, we could keep working together for the forseeable future. Once we're supporting a Linux version, and Mac and Windows versions, the relationship will be different. Not just with UserLand, because all developers must be feeling the pull to Linux.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I've been having this conversation with MS in various forms for five years. First it was about HTTP and web browsers, then it was Java. I tried to get this point across, MS was blowing off developers when it blew off Sun. I didn't blame MS for hating Sun, I hated them too -- but ignoring the developers who legitimately wanted write once run anywhere (WORA) was an almost-fatal mistake. It was just what Apple did when Mac developers wanted to make Windows apps. No respect. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It wasn't fatal because Java was a smoke-blow. But Linux is for real. Now is Microsoft going to make the same mistake? The smart thing to do, IMHO, is to fully embrace Linux. Let's work together to make Windows apps run beautifully on Linux. It'll be good for Microsoft. The only other choice is to be at odds with developers because the pull to Linux is economic and inexorable. &lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;PC WEEK on SOAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="&quot;Why was Microsoft flying SOAP under the radar? It looked much like a pre-emptive strike against the established distributed object interaction standards of CORBA, a vendor-neutral option currently favored 2-to-1 over Microsoft's COM, according to Forrester Research.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/columns/0,4351,2338122,00.html&quot;&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/columns/0,4351,2338122,00.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This article is key. I'm glad they're tuning into the significance of SOAP, but it doesn't have to be a Microsoft-vs-Everyone thing. MS anticipated this problem, I think that's why UserLand and Developmentor are so closely in the loop. They didn't have to include us in the process, and of course PC WEEK is negating our role, but let's take this opportunity and solve the problem.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The information was available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="First, with all possible humility, if the editors at PC WEEK paid attention to Scripting News and DaveNet, they wouldn't have been blind-sided. The information was out there. Microsoft's involvement was also reported in InfoWorld, last summer. &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980710.whsoap.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980710.whsoap.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="They should not be allowed to point the accusational finger at Microsoft without getting a clear response. The information was available. A curious analyst or reporter would have read the InfoWorld article, at least, and followed up.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;CORBA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Forrester says people want CORBA, but where is it? It's not baked into Windows or Mac. And that's where the users and content developers are. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And if CORBA is such a strong standard, where are all the CORBA apps? Why do people implement one-off RPCs that are compatible with nothing, when CORBA theoretically offers the opportunity to be higher-level and compatible?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The answer, I believe, is that CORBA is complex and ever-evolving and not widely deployed. A moving target, it doesn't run where the users are or content developers, or on many servers.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Two forks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I want SOAP to be deployed as widely as possible *before* it gets mired in a standards process. There are only two forks in this road. SOAP could become CORBA, or it could stay simple. It's already simple, so let's go, before it gets complex.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We couldn't have done this work without Microsoft's involvement, few would have paid attention. Now to go the next step, the industry has to take Microsoft's invitation seriously. Take ownership of SOAP, deploy it as-is, and let's get started defining the next-level-up, which is where the interesting stuff happens.&lt;p&gt;"/>

The new stadium is supposed to have soul. A downtown baseball stadium in San Francisco could change baseball and San Francisco. Let's have fun!&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Want a vision of where the web is headed? Check out Desktop.Com. Launched in beta a couple of weeks ago, this stunning site changed my point of view on what can be accomplished with JavaScript, ActiveX and whatever other kinds of mysterious code-doo-dads they're using. I haven't investigated. But when I played with the site it gave me the kind of goosebumps that the web used to give in the early early days. A new idea, a powerful execution -- my competitive spirit is raised!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Desktop.Com says the web is a desktop, just like the desktops on the Mac and Windows. Icons down the left edge of the browser window, menus at the top of the window, double-click to open a directory, double-click to edit a file. They have a very small set of editors, as the Mac and Windows did when they first launched.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="They are also going to have an API to allow other apps to connect to their servers. This is a great idea. I want those APIs to be compatible with the ones we're developing so we can connect to their server from the popular desktop apps on Windows and Mac. The win here is compatibility. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We've been in touch with the Desktop.Com people, but it can't hurt to broadcast the invitation for compatibility, since there must be competitive systems in development in lots of corners of the industry.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="It's the most frustrating idea to come onto the web in a long time. On one hand, they've done an excellent job, as Desktop.Com has, in pushing the limits of web browser software. Third Voice adds a layer to every website you browse, allowing readers to become writers. I *want* the web to become an easy two-way medium, and I could see the Third Voice software playing a big role in collaborative content management software, an area I care a lot about.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But all the good they can do is overshadowed by the negative net-effect of what they actually do. Anyone can post a comment on any website, and in doing so, to the untrained eye, they appear to be hacking the website. The company encourages this view, saying &quot;Third Voice is a free service that lets you post public, group or personal notes on any Web page.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Hmmm. The thing I like about the web, that makes it different from mail lists and newsgroups, is that it takes a little bit of committment to start and maintain an interesting website. But all that is overshadowed, by obscene and immature post-its that cover up the text when people who use Third Voice scribble on the site. Now this isn't an immediate problem for the rest of us, because Third Voice is not very popular among people with emotional ages in double-digits, but what if Microsoft takes this as an invitation to add this feature to Internet Explorer? They would hail it as a revolution, now the web is two-way! Oh boy. We'd have to invent a new web to get away from the obscenity and immaturity of an open two-way system.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So please, Third Voice, let's figure out a way to let webmasters work with your software so our messages can get thru without comment, and let people comment in places where people who want to see comments can easily find them. A negotiation should be possible, a little leadership please, let's preserve what's good about the web without disempowering your company or people who use your product.

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Sun is OK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="On Friday, in a report in the Wall Street Journal, Sun CTO Greg Papadopoulos said that Sun would release source for their mainstay operating system Solaris, but would not allow others to build and distribute competitive operating systems using their source code. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="After being harshly critical of Sun's Uber-OS strategy with Java in the mid-90s, and being indifferent to Jini, now I'm thankful to Sun for doing something different with Solaris, by providing source code without throwing their hands in the air and giving up responsibility for thinking things through. So much of the euphoria about open source has been just as unrealistic as the euphoria about Java a few years back. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now we can open a useful dialogue with Sun. The way they parsed the open source challenge is exactly the way we parsed the Java challenge. We have an eleven-year investment in code written in C. It wasn't that long ago that people believed that software implemented in C was obsolete, that everything had to run in Java, or die. Sun helped breed that belief. We resisted, at substantial expense, it was nonsense, and like all industry nonsense, it takes a couple of years to run its course and then things flip back the other way, towards reality. What an irritation! Starting in 1995 no one wanted to look at C code, as if the language you use has anything to do with the marketability or usefulness of a software product. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Linux isn't threatened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="It's simple, by  providing the source to Solaris, Sun is responding to feature requests from their customers. Linux isn't really threatened, it's the ideal operating system for OEMs, developers, embedded systems. Eventually if it gets a solid desktop and can scale to support the big iron that Solaris does, Linux can change the economics of the Mac/Windows market and provide an alternative to Solaris customers.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Predictably the Sun announcement caused an outcry in the open source community. A quote from a Reuters report on the Solaris announcement. &quot;'Sun has tried this scam before with Java and Jini and we are not going to buy it,' said Eric Raymond, president of the Open Source Initiative and one of the leaders of open source community. 'They are trying to use us as free labor, without making us a partner. Sun retains all the rights. These terms are therefore unacceptable.'&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But it's OK for Raymond and the open source purists to reject this offer. It wasn't designed to please them. It was designed to please Sun's customers. Look at it this way, Solaris is the perfect operating system for Sun customers. It's a live and let live answer. Sun says they don't have to be Linux, and it leaves room for Linux to find a multitude of niches that Solaris can never occupy because of its economics and how it's developed.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I thank Sun for responding to the euphoria with thought and care. As a software developer with a substantial investment in web-based software written in C that runs on Windows and Mac, I like to see short sensible steps. For the last couple of years we have been pelted with threats from the crowd that Raymond leads saying we would be dead if we didn't cough up our source on their terms. Well, we already have a good thing going here. Why should we panic? No way. I decided to let things settle down before we move. And Sun's decision is a sure sign of things settling down.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Software takes time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I like change, but I have a long-term plan that I'm executing and wild fluctuations in fashionability crowd out the realistic steps we can take year-by-year. This year we're working on ease of use and integrating the web with desktop apps and flowing news stories thru XML and distributed computing protocols. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="To make this work we have to have healthy respect for the way things are done. Linux advocates are in a hurry to rip up the pavement, the way the Java zealots were a few years ago, but there are already good roads and bridges in existing operating systems and applications. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Our plan is to use those connections to lift the net to the next level, to add an architecture that includes all that has been accomplished by Sun, Microsoft, Apple, et al. We are excited about Linux because it opens so many doors and forces us all to rethink a lot of assumptions, and in that rethink there are opportunities to undo wrong turns taken many many years ago. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But it's still true that most people do not use Linux. &lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="In the last piece I asked how we should celebrate the five year anniversary. I got back a bunch of interesting answers, the neatest was to write a script that would choose a random soundbite from a random DaveNet piece from the past.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I groaned at first -- anything that requires me to read all the back issues is too much work. But the suggester had a neat trick. &quot;Choose paragraphs with fewer than 100 words.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Interesting idea! I like it because it combines scripting with a little quirk in my writing style. I tend to start a new paragraph with the conclusion of the previous paragraph.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I find a funny way to say something. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I want to make sure you don't miss it!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="However, I suspect we'd get a lot of Cooooools and maybe some fussing over how Netscape was killing the web, how Apple doesn't get it, and Microsoft is mean, and Sun is selfish. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="No, I don't want to look back. I want to look forward. &lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="However, there *is* one piece that says it all. It's a little strong, a bit of parental advice, you might want to read this at night, when it's quiet, and you can't sleep. It might help.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="This is a milestone site for me. It makes me want to give him the whole DocServer site and let him work on the site itself. It's a sign of maturing in our community. It's also something anyone could do with DaveNet.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="I'm reading Tim Berners-Lee's autobiography, Weaving the Web.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="TBL is the inventor of the web. Reading his story lets me know that there's a mathematics to the web. He understood then what I immediately understood about the web when I started working on it in 1994. The web is an expansive medium. Anything  that tries to make the web contract is anti-web. And the expansiveness is expressed in a brain-dead-simple idea. A link from one place to another. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's something that Jakob Nielsen understands. And Jon Udell at Byte.Com, and Dale Dougherty at O'Reilly and Mohsen Al-Ghosein at Microsoft. We could have dinner together and build a new web out of the web, one that achieves Tim Berners-Lee's vision for a powerful two-way medium. Someday I hope to have that dinner. Sparks will fly!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Until recently I thought Linus Torvalds got this too, but his recent comments about Sun and Microsoft make me think his confidence is wavering. His operating system only has a chance if it welcomes all, even those who don't use it, with equal generosity. Linux belongs to the universe, it's bigger than our whole planet, if it adopts that view. It's the closest OS in philosophy to the web. I'd like to see it go all the way.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I had lunch with Mohsen earlier this week, and I half-jokingly asked why Bill Gates doesn't launch a working NT 5 machine in a rocket to Alpha Cenauri. I wasn't joking because he has the power to do that, and in a few years, so will Linus.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The walls that IETF culture puts up are well documented in the TBL book. They didn't believe in the web when it started up. The old-timers of the Internet may have missed something that TBL didn't. There are strange cultures here sharing our net. They want to do things with the net that we  didn't think of and don't understand. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Like TBL, I want to use the Internet to Communicate, with a capital C. The way they taught Communication in college. I want a convergence of writing tools and file systems -- give me one place where I can write for the web, or email or chat, or send a pager message. A place that's mine, with a part that I share with the world, and another part I only share with my friends, and a part that's all mine, that I share with no one. Get the old stuff out of my way, but let me search it when I want to find a piece I wrote in 1997.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're not writing for printers and bookshelves anymore. Our words and ideas flow electronically and are saved on websites and search engines. But it's so chaotic and unmanageable and unpredictable and complex. I think I see how to get it all to hang together. This is the problem I want to solve. I want the best features of the web and email in a single customizable writing environment.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The format is wide open on both ends, we now have a spec that allows any net-connected server running on any operating system to hook into our aggregator and receive a dozen or more fresh stories every hour. It's free and new and powerful.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="A quote: &quot;Dave Winer's XML-RPC is a sign of things to come. It's a bad sign that Microsoft knows more about this than the leaders of the Linux community. They've already incorporated it into a new protocol that they are calling SOAP.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Thanks Tim!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="It's great to have someone of O'Reilly's stature in the Unix, open source and scripting worlds, echoing what we've been saying. XML-RPC-based interapplication communication is too big a thing to be just for Microsoft. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="UserLand comes from Windows and Mac, the commercial world, with our hands open. To the leaders of the Linux world, help us by competing with us. Our vision is much larger than any single software product. We want to build a new more powerful web out of all kinds of software. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's frustrating that the Linux world focuses so much on Microsoft, and so little on working with us. The most powerful business model possible is working together. That's the lesson of the web. A link is such a big thing. Now let's make the links work between our software. What a revolution that would be.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Where we go from here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="These days the most exciting stuff in XML-RPC is cross-network applications that run &lt;i&gt;on top&lt;/i&gt; of the RPC layer. We've been doing interfaces connecting desktop writing tools to the web, for content syndication, and search engine integration with content management systems. There's a lot more that needs to be done in business-to-business interfaces, calendar applications, electronic mail and conferencing.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The connection between O'Reilly, UserLand and Microsoft is just beginning. When it's done, my goal is that the walls between each of the components of the technology industry will be way down, if not all the way down. I want the energy of the web to flow beteween all our platforms and environments, with the Internet as the transport. Open interfaces and plug-compatibility at an application level. This is bigger than any single operating system or scripting environment, it's nothing less than the next level of the Internet. &lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="PS: An important correction. XML-RPC is not mine. It's a spec that was created 1.5 years ago by Don Box of Developmentor, Mohsen Al-Ghosein and Bob Atkinson of Microsoft and myself. But it doesn't belong to any of us, it belongs to the web, in the same way Linux belongs to the web. If I ever had any ownership of XML-RPC I divest of that here and now. &lt;p&gt;"/>

I thought it might be worth a comment because they played the usual tune, more fear of Microsoft. I just want to shake the Linux community until they hear me. You don't lead a revolution with fear. It's OK to be scared, but if you want to win you have to go thru it. "/>
				<outline text="They may be the last group to figure out that the world no longer revolves around Microsoft. Microsoft gets it. That's why they did SOAP. But Microsoft losing dominance doesn't mean that Linux rules the world. The vast majority of people don't use Linux. As one of several non-dominant OSes, it's in Linux's favor if other OSes are open to it. That's what SOAP is about. It's an invitation, an open door, but the Linux voices only see a threat. "/>

				<outline text="But the Mets, that's a whole other story. I have to stop programming and write about what I'm experiencing. The Mets are doing it again! Those charmed boys of Flushing, down and almost out, they're digging deep into a huge resevoir of love, and against all odds they're doing what the Linux boys aren't -- they're winning. *This* is worth pausing for."/>

				<outline text="Casey Stengel knew it when he called them The Amazins. Yes, they're the team from NY, but in a larger sense, they are the team from God!"/>
				<outline text="Did you watch the game on Sunday? Oh man. Fifteen innings. Sitting on the edge of my chair for the last six. The Mets are the home team. In any at bat, a single swing could have put the Braves away. "/>
				<outline text="Two rookies on the mound. In the top of the fifteenth the Braves score. Down 3-2 in a best of seven series, if they lose this game, they're out. Now the Mets *must* score to stay alive. "/>

				<outline text="In our discussion group, Jacob Levy, an engineer at Sun who was born and raised in Israel, asks where the American fascination with baseball comes from. "/>
				<outline text="To Jacob it looks like fascination. For me, an American thru and thru, it goes deeper. I thought I could stop being a Mets fan. I thought it was in my past. What do these strange young people have in common with Ed Kranepool, Cleon Jones, Ed Charles, Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, Bud Harrelson, Jerry Grote, Art Shamsky and Tommy Agee? These were the heroes of my youth, the people I looked up to as a child for a clue about being a man."/>
				<outline text="When I was a kid, baseball was about looking forward. Now as a middle-aged man, baseball is about looking back. Today's players are all much younger than I am. Can they teach me anything? I found out that they can, in a very profound way. What they teach me is the same thing the old old Mets did so many years ago, they allow me to tap into my own sense of amazement. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Baseball is ours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="So to Jacob, I like baseball because of the metaphysics, synchronicity and improbability of it. It's a puzzle. How does it work? God speaks to me thru baseball, at least *my* god does. I grew up in walking distance of Shea Stadium so I could properly attend my religion. I went to Shea when I was nine years old. I thought they had built the stadium just for me. I'm not kidding! It just made sense to me that it would be that way."/>
				<outline text="That little boy is still alive, and he's still amazed by the Mets. And what's great about baseball is that, especially with a heart-centered team like the Mets, *all* our little boys are still alive. So Jacob I think that's it for me, and I've heard others say it too. Baseball is about continuity. We're a very young country, and baseball works as a link to our past and something we share across all generations, but most importantly, with ourselves."/>
				<outline text="I remember how my father got crazy watching the Mets beat the Red Sox in 1986. My dad doesn't let go very often. I'll never forget how he rolled around on the floor in utter amazement at Mookie's antics that won the 86 series. Rolling around on the floor, while an undistinguished thing to do, is the totally appropriate response to a vision of God! How else could the Mets have won? Not thru talent, that's for sure. ;-&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The Cubs have their stadium and beer and whatever else they do. The Red Sox have The Green Monster. The Yankees have stature and tradition (say this with an impressed voice). Who cares about these teams? But the Mets, it's like that Harry Nilsson song where he says God must live in NYC. Close. God lives in the Mets."/>

				<outline text="Last Friday I had a chance to meet one of my heroes, Tim Bray, co-inventor of XML."/>
				<outline text="We went to lunch and I got a demo of his new service, which is still confidential."/>
				<outline text="On the way to lunch I told him that XML 1.0 was solid, we were using it to simplify our own spec, XML-RPC. When questions come up, very often the answer could be found in Tim's spec. This is the highest endorsement I can give. A spec that's good enough to use. And one that was timely so that it *could* be used."/>
				<outline text="We talked about lots of things, including the IETF. I complained about their complaints about my work. Typical comment: &quot;It won't scale.&quot; Oh. I think there's a disconnect. I never wanted XML to be a substitute for DNS, or a protocol that would be understood by routers. I see XML as an interchange format that allows different environments and operating systems and applications to plug into each other at a very high level."/>
				<outline text="Speaking for myself only, the IETF is behaving like a platform vendor, jealously guarding its right to control what we do. My message is the same as it's always been to jealous platform vendors. &quot;Get over it.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="And to Tim Bray, a creative guy with bright eyes, the best of luck in his new venture. It involves XML, of course. We're going to work with Tim, and build some stuff off his stuff. Of course!"/>

				<outline text="http://www.ietf.org/ "/>
				<outline text="I know this is malarky. Of course there is an IETF. And I totally respect what the IETF has accomplished. "/>
				<outline text="I played no role in the Router-DNS-Email-MIME-NNTP-FTP level architecture of the Internet. While they were doing that work, I was a grad student and then a software developer and entrepreneur during the 70s, 80s and early 90s. Many thanks to the IETF for managing these protocols and the magic they made possible, while I was busy doing other things."/>
				<outline text="However, while I was doing all those things, I was also inventing stuff that's now part of the Internet, as much a part as all the stuff that IETF did."/>
				<outline text="To whom it may concern, I was the first to do the expand-collapse outlining interface that's now commonly used in software from presentation tools, FTP clients, Java hierarchy navigators, you name it. With all possible humility, I think this contribution was as important as Doug Engelbart's or Ted Nelson's, perhaps more so, because we released commercial software for our &quot;idea processing&quot; vision, where others just did prototypes or wrote visionary essays about this stuff. When you see an expand-collapse display think of me, because I invented that, and I didn't take a patent, so that every engineer who needed a hierarchy browser would be free to use my design. And they have done that. Outliners are *everywhere* these days."/>
				<outline text="Is this part of the Internet? It depends on how broadly and ambitiously you think. Frontier, our mainstay software, is nothing but an outliner with an object database, scripting language, multi-threaded runtime, HTTP client and server, and (yes!) XML, behind it. We connect outliners to the Internet in ways that are so natural and obvious you'll wonder why no one did it before. Hierarchies *are* the Internet, and where hierachies show up, outliners can't be far behind."/>
				<outline text="So, the IETF, which I believe *does* exist, may have a small view of the Internet. It would be helpful if they could expand their vision, and not get in the way of necessary next-steps."/>

				<outline text="I have another gripe I want to bring to DaveNet readers."/>
				<outline text="Earlier this year a new service and website came online with a very confusing name:"/>
				<outline text="http://www.davenetics.com/ "/>
				<outline text="At a party a few weeks ago, someone asked what I do. I gave my usual rap, which includes saying that I write online essays called &quot;DaveNet&quot;. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;Do you mean DaveNetics?&quot; the other person asked."/>
				<outline text="Arrrrrrrrrrrgh!"/>
				<outline text="When this site first surfaced I asked my lawyer to tell me what I could do. &quot;This is confusing!&quot; I said. &quot;What they do is quite close to what I do. Think about it, what if I started a software company called Microsoftics. Would that be confusing? Would that be fair?&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I don't want to sue these guys. But I'm still angry that this happened. I've been using the DaveNet name since 1994. These guys are newcomers, and are taking advantage of my goodwill. I don't like it."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Another loop-close&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;">
				<outline text="In &quot;Sun is OK&quot;, 10/4/99, I hinted at Marc Canter's new project: &quot;I gave them a quote for their website, from an old DaveNet piece I wrote for Wired about Jean-Louis Gassee. That's all I can say right now, or else they'll shoot me!&quot;"/>
				<outline text="The project is DigiScents, an inexpensive hardware product that connects to the Internet and brings smells to your desktop! Could it possibly work? I don't know, I haven't gotten my demo yet. But it's on the cover of Wired this month, and the reporter recounts a demo, and says that it works. I signed up as a beta tester of the product, as soon as I get my demo I'll let you know."/>
				<outline text="The DigiScents site is here:"/>
				<outline text="http://www.digiscents.com/ "/>
				<outline text="And the quote they used is part of a story I like to tell about JLG and what he does when he sees a piece of software he likes. You can do it too. &quot;Extend your right arm. Pull your pinky to your palm. Same with the fourth finger and your thumb. Extend your index and middle fingers and pull them together. Move your arm so that these two fingers are directly under your nose. Sniff shortly three times.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Boston and Davos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Hey before I get started with a new essay, here's some news.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I'm going to keynote Seybold in Boston in February!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That's the same stage that John Warnock, Steve Jobs and Tim Gill use to launch their products.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="So when I act kooky, remember to take me verrrrrrry seriously!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And wait a minute, there's more. I've been invited to the World Economic Forum in Davos a couple of weeks before Seybold. They say I'm a Media Leader. Like Peter Jennings or John Markoff. This is too much. What happened? All of a sudden I'm &quot;in&quot;. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What's wrong with the world. I'm having a serious case of any-clubitis, you know, any club that would have me as a member has a serious problem. At least I have to get a haircut and a new suit before going to Davos. And I haven't worn a suit in five years!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Wheee Blogs!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="OK, so now for the kooky part of this piece.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Do you know what a weblog is? It's one of those funky new kinds of sites. Like music DJs, webloggers start with basic ingredients, other people's stories, and mix them into a selection of carefully chosen and delicately prepared morsels of web goodness. Read top to bottom or side to side, pick your favorites, there are hundreds, and lots more coming online every day. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="These are weblogs, or blogs, as some people like to call them. Creative director Peter Merholz of Epinions, a hot Internet startup, calls them &quot;wee blogs&quot; which is a phrase I just can't get out of my head. I say it with a Scottish brogue. So for now, that's what I will call them. Weeeeee blogs! Excellent.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Wee blogs have been getting lots of press, and this should come as no surprise, since writers love reading and wee bloggers are the ultimate readers. Humbly, I have run my own wee blog since 1997, thank you, and we make software that makes them work. Longterm I think that the software will prove more important than my writing, but who knows.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And of course there's a mail list for wee bloggers, so if you want, you can rub elbows with the literary lions of the late-late 20th century:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/group/weblogs/&quot;&gt;http://www.egroups.com/group/weblogs/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Picture this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Now most people who do wee blogs are hairy or artistic or eclectic in some other way. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But Dan Gillmor? Dan is one of the least hairy people I know. He's not wild. At least not on the outside. But today, I am proud to say that my friend Dan is starting what I think may become one of the most interesting wee blogs on the Internet.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Why will it be so interesting? Because Dan is a Journalist. I put a capital J on that because he's got it in his blood. He writes the marquee computing column for the San Jose Mercury News, the Silicon Valley cornerstone of Knight Ridder. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We've been working with Dan on this project since May 24, which is not coincidentally the same day I published Edit this Page, the piece that defined Manila, which is our wee blog framework for people who like to write and take pictures. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now four months later Dan is using Manila. Dan is a writer, not a web developer. He writes his own website. His technical people work with us, but Dan owns the site. That was the goal. It's working. A dynamic site with all the fixins, and you don't need a degree in rocket science to keep it going. This is a barrier-break. A goal achieved. We still have more work to do, lots! But this is a milestone day for us at UserLand.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Dan's doing a weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Dan's a Journalist, he's writing stuff live on the web, he's going to take reader comments, respond, point to things, and then take stuff he writes on the web and flow it back to print. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Today at 1PM he's on a plane to Hong Kong, where he's going to spend a month teaching Chinese students about Silicon Valley, software, and weblogs, of course. We're going to give each of his students a site on UserLand.Com so they can compete with Dan! ;-&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Dan's bringing a digital camera with him. We're going to get stories and pictures and students and a foreign land, and it's a Journalist doing that. A lot of wee bloggers will be surprised for sure. This is what they call a viral app. This is the web.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I love Dan because he is smart and has courage, and is willing to go first. I also love the Merc for the same reasons. Outwardly they're quiet, and the big press doesn't take them too seriously. But I do, we made the invitation broadly, and the Merc said yes. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="For the first time a publication is using the public web to generate content for their print version. Stop and think about this. Print assumes its proper role, as the medium for finished writing. Writing that evolves, changes, can only be on electronic media.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;UserLand's role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We did the software that makes Dan's site run.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Dan and his team taught us about journalism. We don't come from the same world, and that's why we wanted to work with them. It's been frustrating at times, but it was worth it!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/&quot;&gt;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I'm sure there'll be more glitches, remember Murphy's Law, it applies to websites equally as it applies to software. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And soon, we're going to offer the same software to the world, at an unbeatable price.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Big wheel keep on turning!&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Controversy and comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="This new site will surely be controversial. Basically I want to start a discussion, and see where it goes.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/28/99; 7:53:35 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I have a new friend, Alex Cohen, a scholar and UC-Berkeley professor, and an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner-Perkins, the famous Silicon Valley venture capitalist that started Sun, Compaq, Lotus, Netscape, Excite, Amazon, and lots of other rich companies that you've heard of.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Alex and I get along really well, partially because we share a similar vision of how the net builds out. He's one of a handful of people I know who sees the Internet as a programming platform, and sees the need for standardized higher-level APIs that allow apps to be plug-compatible across OS, scripting and content management system boundaries.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="As a former Netscape exec, Alex knows the value of being able to swap in new hardware and services in a manageable way. Now his vision extends to servers running in other organizations, opening the web to the kinds of high-level interfaces that heretofore only ran inside the firewall at portal sites, like Netscape.Com.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Anyway, last week Alex told me a story about the art of war, the lessons of Sun-Tze and Von Clausewitz, which he says can be summarized in a single Star Trek episode.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's the one where Kirk and Spock discover a culture that had turned war into a bloodless business run by a computer. Every day a printout says which citizens have to enter a chamber, where they are killed, in a painless way. This method allows the cities to remain intact, no property is destroyed, and life can go on even though there's a long-term world war going on. The culture was very proud of this innovation, finally, a humane war!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Kirk, of course, is horrified. Where's the glory in fighting battles in the memory of a computer? Interesting question, and not one that I know the answer to. As Spock would say: Fascinating.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Strange gases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Another thing I liked about Star Trek are the scenes where ambassadors from different cultures get together and the script writers have fun with their different physiological needs. Some live in ion baths, others need to breathe fumes from devices that are housed in their chests and deliver strange gases to their noses. This has been a recurring theme in all versions of Star Trek, and the idea really blossomed in Star Wars. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is the environment of the web. It's like the bar scene in Star Wars. I get lots of mail from Unix people warning me that I'm reinventing the wheel when we move forward with interfaces designed to run on networks defined by XML-RPC. Some of these protocols, at first glance, look to them like SMTP, others like FTP. But only if you fail to notice that I hail from a different culture, not your culture, where what we breathe would smell as strange to you as what you breathe smells to us.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="For this round of the Internet, the Unix folks are doing the hosting. We (the GUI people) listen a lot as we try to puzzle out why FTP works the way it does, and SMTP and NNTP work the way they do. But how much effort have the Unix folks put into understanding how developers of graphical systems work? Not enough, IMHO.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="One question I'd like to hear an answer to -- where is the Unix equivalent of COM and Apple Events? The stock answer is CORBA, but think again. Apple Events and COM are *easy* -- programmers working in scripting environments such as Visual Basic and AppleScript have been able to master these protocols in weeks not years, without having to go to school. And there are hundreds of thousands of them, if not millions. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Now, is CORBA really that strong? Should CORBA dictate the rules about how we move these traditions onto the Internet? Is FTP an equivalent to COM? If all you know is FTP, perhaps it looks something like COM. It's certainly one process talking to another. But if you had to build another layer on the Internet, would you chose FTP as the substrate or would you go with HTTP which is much cleaner, better specified, and more widely deployed? To me, it's a no-brainer.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Dale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="So where did this little rant come from? Wednesday I spent the afternoon meeting with Dale Dougherty from O'Reilly. We got around to a favorite puzzle. What is the web?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Here's my answer. It's the crazy bar scene from Star Wars. It's unweblike to ignore the weird cultures that show up here. Some of the patterns are the same old thing all over again, and others are truly new. To be of the web, you embrace the newness instead of hiding from it. You move quickly. When an invitation comes, the answer is Yes!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That definition works because it embraces the power of the web, the power of linking.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;A word processor for the Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="There's more ado here every time we meet. Even though I hail from the GUI Galaxy and Dale comes from the Unix Quadrant, we share the same vision with Alex, the Kleiner guy.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I still need one more leg on my stool, and that leg will come from Microsoft. I'm sure I've said this before, but it bears repeating. Microsoft is not the enemy. Microsoft gets what a  lot of the open source advocates don't get. The days of Windows being the dominant operating system are over. At best it lasted two-three years at the beginning of this decade. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But Windows is important because it's what so many end-users use. So here's the vision. Let's have a word processor for the Internet. Open the net for writers. It's sure to happen. Emacs and VI are not going to be the standard writing tools on the Internet, if you think they will take another hit of benzene. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Today's web browsers are mere training wheels for the writers network. Office 2000 is inelegant and far too complex to be the standard. To find the answer, turn the clock back to the 80s, when we were learning how to do writing tools for end-users. We will do it again, start over, this time for the net. &lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Today's installment tells the story of Dan wandering into a Microsoft/Dow Jones-sponsored conference in Hong Kong, and getting kicked out!  &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;The event, apparently a high-level schmooze for executives of companies with which Dow Jones and Microsoft do business, was closed to the press -- except, of course, people who worked for the Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones media properties.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="And happy November..&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're whistling while we work on the new release of Frontier, version 6.1, the Manila release. Sorry to be so long in writing, that's the way it goes when I'm in development mode.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Last night there was a Finding of Fact in the anti-trust trial against Microsoft. The decision, which I have read, is totally one-sided, against Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This was not a surprise, while the trial was going on, it was pretty clear that the judge, Mr. Jackson, was going this way. My comments follow.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Don't cry for Netscape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We're judging this with hindsight, but even while the events were transpiring, it was evident that Netscape didn't have a vision for itself. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Further, the company never developed its natural base of developer support, among web designers, scripters and ISPs, choosing instead to woo developers with a C-like platform, Java. This was their major strategic blunder, it was massive. None of these groups wanted to align behind Microsoft, but the energy was behind HTML, not Java, which was incomplete, slow, buggy and not truly cross-platform (which was its promise). &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Viewed another way, their natural constituency was the remnants of the Mac user and developer base, newly energized by the opportunities of the web. Had Netscape stood in the center of this group and said &quot;This is where we're going&quot; we all would have gone with them. But they never had anything to say to us. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Netscape didn't invent the web, as many in Washington appear to believe. Netscape was as opportunistic as Microsoft, and the principals of Netscape, and their investors, were amply rewarded for the risks they took. Read Tim Berners-Lee's account of the history of the web, and you'll see that from his point of view, as the inventor of the web, Netscape played a minor role in its evolution. Berners-Lee's account is consistent with everything I know about Netscape.&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Microsoft as training wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Now switch over and look at this moment of history, and how Microsoft fits in.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We need Microsoft's operating system less and less every year. That will continue, it's inexorable, it's a product of the environment, it's happened before, and it will continue to happen. I like The Jackson Finding if it hastens the process, but the process is happening anyway.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The process can only be seen, IMHO, when you have studied a few transitions in the software world. We need companies like Microsoft for a while, when we're commercializing a new layer of technology (Microsoft's layer was the graphic user interface), but then another generation comes along, and they incorporate what the previous generation invented, as part of their world view, and the dominating company is marginalized, cast aside, as a child learning to ride a bike throws away the training wheels on his or her bicycle. Eventually you don't need them, they only hold you back.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That doesn't mean that the dominating company goes away, far from it, but their role changes from being the scrappy innovator to the steady source of support and infrastructure. IBM made the transition, after spending a decade in court fighting a similar anti-trust case, after they lost dominance of the PC market. You can see Microsoft anticipating this transition in the investments they're making in network bandwidth.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A booming networking industry is building itself around Microsoft, to some extent, but also around Unix and the Macintosh, Java, PalmOS, Sony Playstation, etc. Even Microsoft has acknowledged this. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The widely-overlooked SOAP specification, their blueprint for networking in the future, is markedly *not* Microsoft-centered. Any would-be competitor to Windows now has a way to feed off the installed base of Windows developers. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="At a strategic level, this is very smart of Microsoft. Being hard and fragile and insistent would be a formula for complete marginalization, as IBM was marginalized in the late 80s. SOAP is evidence of some flexibility, which is hard to accomplish in a company of 30,000 employees. It's hard to get a community that large to recognize that there's a world outside its boundaries. This is probably due to the fact that Gates is a student of history and the consumate game player. I called it right, I think, in 1994, when I said his game was to not be the next Ken Olson, the founder of DEC. (When I wrote this paragraph, my main Windows NT server blue-screened for the first time ever! As I was typing Ken Olson's name. Wow. Talk about synchronicity!)&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Why do anything?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="The fight with Microsoft is about whether or not we will all be Windows Developers. That fight is now over, completely. Microsoft had dominance in this dimension for at most three years. The Internet wiped the slate completely clean in 1993. Microsoft struggled mightily for five years, helping push Netscape to the mat, but they were already down, from the moment they popped into existence, because they didn't have any ideas or vision or ability to execute. I don't know which of these caused Netscape to go poof, but the net-effect is that Netscape had nothing more to contribute than a browser, they did that, their investors made huge returns, so why do anything at all here?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Show me the money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="Further, Microsoft is under another kind of pressure. I always believed that if Microsoft stock should ever take a downward turn that it would spiral down quickly because the value of stock options is what glues a lot of the key people to Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I didn't anticipate that Microsoft stock value could spiral *up* and still fall under this kind of pressure. The rise in Internet IPOs is siphoning off many of the best people at Microsoft. Having a huge appreciating stock is not that unique anymore. Internet IPOs happen all the time, offering much higher rates of return than Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is why you see Microsoft doing more and more investing in Internet startups and infrastructure. Imagine Microsoft in three years as two companies, one an investment banker, and the other a consulting and services company. It's time to rethink what Microsoft is, because it's changing, with or without interference from the courts.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Dear reader, I left the r out of Greeks. It was not a typo. My generation is getting on in years. Pretty soon we'll be looking back on the 1900s the same way our ancestors looked back on the 1800s. Someday someone is going to ask you what the 1900s were like. I wonder if we're prepared for the new level of mid-life crises that this will bring about. Hot flashes galore. All of a sudden we don't have to worry about becoming our fathers (the crisis of turning 40) now we have to worry about becoming our forefathers!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Oh what opportunities to loop. But instead of resisting the future, let's reserve a space for it on our laps. Let's read the future our stories, but give it the space to be whatever it's meant to be. None of us, Bill Gates included, is so powerful as to determine destiny. We're all just humans, part of a tidal wave of human growth, doing the best we can.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="The web is a coversation, sometimes it's a great one.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A recurring topic in the ongoing conversation. What to do about Microsoft?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's been going on for years and years, and shows no sign of going away.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If nothing else, we should be grateful to Microsoft for providing a constant reminder that there's more to the web than e-commerce. We also need the web so we can check in with each other to find out if our points of view have changed re Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;BOGU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="In response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/11/06/theAncientGeeks&quot;&gt;Saturday's DaveNet&lt;/a&gt;, a writer asked if Microsoft's power was of any concern to me at all. The answer is yes, but I limited my comments on Saturday to issues that the Jackson finding focused on. For some unknown reason the government hasn't pressed Microsoft and the hardware OEMs to open the terms of their license agreements. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I wrote about this in May 1998:&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/13/bogu#keyquestion&quot;&gt;http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/13/bogu#keyquestion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;I want to know to what extent Microsoft controls the personal computer distribution system. Are Compaq, Dell, IBM, et al franchisees or are they truly independent? Under what conditions can Microsoft take their licenses away? At will? A violation of the terms of the distribution agreement? And what do the agreements look like? Are they confidential? If so, why?&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If on examination, it turned out that Microsoft totally controls the hardware OEMs that's another story. We should not permit one company to limit choice and competition that way. There's something deeply immoral about a company that *wants* that kind of control. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But that's not the case the government presented. Why?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;To Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I hope people at Microsoft still read DaveNet because I have something to say to them.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="First, I believe in the two-sided development strategy used at Microsoft. If you're developing operating systems and not applications your operating systems will miss the mark. On a smaller scale, if you develop writing tools without being a writer, your writing tools will miss the mark. Or if you make web development tools but don't do websites your website tools will miss the mark.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is just common sense. A vintner that doesn't love wine should find another business, and eventually will. It's no surprise to me that the company that won in competition with Lotus, Ashton-Tate, WordPerfect, MicroPro, VisiCorp, Apple, Novell, Netscape, etc, is the one that focused on using the products for their intended purpose. It's amazing to me that so many software companies have been run by people who appear to dislike software. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="However, no matter how smart the two-sided strategy is, eventually it runs its course. It happened with IBM, DEC and Apple. Then you have to recast yourself in the new space, so you're in harmony with it. The apps usually don't go very well in the new environment. Look at mainframe or minicomputer apps in a PC context. Or character-based apps in a graphic environment. Now get this, Office doesn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/06/08/office2000&quot;&gt;make any sense&lt;/a&gt; in the new environment, the web. It's going to keep selling because there are millions of users, but where do you take Office now? I wouldn't want that problem. If I had it, I'd say spin it off, let it keep going, let it find its own way.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="First, thanks to The Motley Fool for setting a shining example of the power of not taking oneself too seriously. Truth be told, our motto for Manila, &quot;We're all newbies!&quot; was inspired by the Fools.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to all the new Manila webmasters, including but not limited to Dan Gillmor, Doc Searls, Luke Tymowski, Lance Knobel, Alex Cohen, Andrew Wooldridge, Leigh Dodds, Lawrence Lee, Dale Dougherty, Karl Martino, Scott Loftesness, Steven Ivy, Susan Victor and Jeff Shelton; and of course Dan Gillmor's 30+ Hong Kong University students. Together, I think we're on the ground floor of one of the biggest opportunities to improve communication, ever.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to the weblog community for embracing the Weblog Monitor site, and for working with UserLand, even though some think we're the Microsoft of this little corner of the Internet. (One weblogger calls me the equivalent of Bill Gates, without the power, money or looks!)&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Hey, now that I think of it, thanks to the weblog community for existing! How many new logs were started this year? How many will be started next year?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to the UserLand Support Associates for their patience, knowledge, professionalism, battle scars, love for the technology, and putting up with our nonsense. Our system works thanks to their passion and committment.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to Silicon Valley venture capitalists with a twinkle in their eye. I've actually met a group of financiers who love what we're doing. That's what makes the world go round! (At least my world.)&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to Microsoft for partnering with us on SOAP, and thanks to Netscape for working on RSS with us. Both efforts prove that there's more to XML than drafts and proposals and debates.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to all the developers who implemented XML-RPC this year, and thanks to the publishers who syndicated their content in XML for My.UserLand. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to Craig Cline for inviting me to keynote Seybold/Boston in February and to Lance Knobel for inviting me to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. I am looking forward to both the events, a lot!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to all the people I knocked heads with this year. Every time that happens I work thru more of my own stuff, get more free, happier, and worry less about what's coming next. I survive all these experiences, often to my own amazement.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Thanks to Brent Simmons, Andre Radke and Bob Bierman, my development team at UserLand for Frontier 6.1, which is the best release of Frontier, ever, hands-down, by far, no question about it. You guys are the best!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And finally, thanks to all the people who have stepped up and bought subscriptions to Frontier in the last year and half since we've been commercial. With all the hype about open source, it's great to know that there are enough webmasters with vision to keep the team going. Our customers are the smartest people on the planet, because they were smart enough to sort thru all the hype and buy the best web content management system. ;-&gt;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And further, thanks to our customers for giving us enough cash to buy new servers! I have three shiny new NT honkers waiting for apps to run on them. When I look at these machines I think how great our customers are, for giving us the money to buy these machines.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="On Monday we'll release Frontier 6.1. In this release setting up a web server is browser-based. And maintaining and developing websites happens in the browser too. This is Manila. It's a new way to write for the web. It's content management scaled down, packaged, made easy to use. But when you lift the hood there's a powerful engine in there humming away, and totally subject to a creative programmer's imagination.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's a strange but wonderful environment. It has a logical set of rules, stories and pictures, managing editors, contributing editors, members. Edit this Page, preferences, profiles, templates, searching, JavaScript, CSS, macros and shortcuts, bulletins and opting-out, and lots more. I've been working in Manila since May, but even now I'm doing things for the first time. It's just a beginning. Again!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Next week we'll bring a few hundred new Manila developers up the curve. In the coming weeks they'll teach their users, writers, designers, photographers, how to create in the new environment. Thinking about all that makes my mind go whooosh. How will we do this? But I know that we will do it. All those newbies makes me nervous, until I realize that I am a newbie too. I've never done this before. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;We're all newbies!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="In Internet lingo the term newbie is roughly equivalent to &quot;pest&quot;. I've never really liked the word, and didn't fully understand why until I came across a community that had only been in existence since the summer, and was amazed to see a newbie-defensive attitude. Then I started thinking.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="What's the opposite of a newbie? An oldbie. Now, who in their right mind, would want to be one of those? If you spin it positive, newbies are people who are trying something new. So it seems pretty clear, if you have a choice, why not be a newbie?&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That led me to an old jingle, the happy Dr Pepper song that goes like this. I'm a newbie, he's a newbie, she's a newbie, we're all newbies, wouldn't you like to be a newbie too?&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="&quot;Writing for the web is too damned hard. It turns you into a bookkeeper. I've got files all over my hard disk and their counterparts on the server. I can't keep track of them.

				<outline text="Kevin Werbach, managing editor of Release 1.0 said: &quot;Manila is as simple or as deep as you want it to be. Few other Web products scale well in both directions -- you either wind up with easy-to-use homepage-building tools that can't handle dynamic sites, or you have complicated, expensive content-management platforms that aren't helpful for beginners or small sites. Manila lets anyone set up an interactive web site quickly and easily, without any client-side software, but that site can grow into a sophisticated, high-traffic site on the same platform.&quot; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="My translation of what Kevin says: Manila is a software product that interfaces thru any web browser, in the same way that earlier products I created interfaced thru a dumb terminal, then a character-based PC, and then thru a windowing system. We've finally got real software running in a web browser, without using plug-ins, Java applets, DHTML, or any unreliable not widely deployed or not-standardized technology. It's true that the web browser is severely limited as a writing environment but it's what the people want, me too, so that's where we go.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="I wrote a real press release! Yow. Haven't written one of those since the Internet Age started. It's a discipline. The tone is different. But you can still have fun.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Manila replaces HTML editors, word processors, FTP clients and groupware such as Lotus Notes, with the simplest writing environment of our day, the Web browser,&quot; said Winer.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Is that still me? You bet. But I'm wearing a suit when I say that, and that's OK. There are times to wear a soooot. And times to not.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Now a little net philosophy. Some slogans work their way into the consciousness of all who use the Internet. &quot;You have mail,&quot; while it probably was popularized by AOL, belongs to the Internet. It causes a visceral reaction. I have mail. Wow. I wonder if someone has something interesting or appreciative to say to me. That's what comes up for me, even though my emailer doesn't say You Have Mail. (I wish it did.)&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Another net slogan: It Worked! &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's what a web server says when it was successfully installed. It's a great message, like a pat on the back, or a bow from the waist as a door is opened for you. Here, sir or madam, is your new website. It's yours, it's blank, and it works.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="One of our goals for Manila was to shorten the time from purchase to It Worked. We've got it pretty short. Bob Bierman, one of the guys here at UserLand.Com, says &quot;You can hold your breath.&quot; It's true. After downloading the software, you can be editing your site in less than 20 seconds. That's a pretty amazing accomplishment, in my humble opinion.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;I'm tired but excited!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="People love Manila. That is so cool. We have lots of things that have been on hold, in the pipe, waiting for Manila to ship. There will be a bunch of add-ons, complementary applications that build on the vision of web writing for everyone.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="One final note. The the title of the last DaveNet piece was just right. We're all on the ground floor of the most exciting opportunity in the business of technology. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web said it first -- the web is a two-way medium. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The challenge was to make the software do it. With Manila we got there. There surely will be others. But it's important to remember that we're all newbies. No one knows how it will go from here. But the feeling of empowerment is real. Let's learn and grow together. Let's have fun!&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We shipped Manila last Wednesday. On Thursday people are puzzled. What is Manila? We had screen shots and lots of writing, but people were still confused. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/&quot;&gt;http://manila.userland.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I decided that we needed to get a lot of people actually using Manila quickly, while the interest was high, to feed word of mouth and to give Manila a shot at defining web content management, a market that most people don't understand. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="For the first time we had a way for people to experience the power of web content management, with nothing more than a web browser. So quickly we started developing an app, one that would allow any UserLand.Com member to create their own website using a browser.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Luckily we have a reserve of unused domain names for these kinds of projects. I decided to use EditThisPage.Com. At first I wanted to limit it to 250 sites, but Scott Loftesness, a friend of UserLand, convinced me to take the limit off. I did. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="On Saturday night a bulletin went out to all registered UserLand.Com members. Come create a website! 60-day free trial. UserLand.Com members only. And 300 of them did.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;EditThisPage.Com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We're still trying to get a handle on all the stuff that's being created on EditThisPage.Com.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="One of the tools we're using is a page that ranks all the sites based on the number of hits.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/siteRankings&quot;&gt;http://www.editthispage.com/siteRankings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="This is not a scientific measure, but it's at least some indication of how we're doing.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;What is Manila?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I've spent most of the last three weeks writing about Manila. I wrote about the software and how it can be used, but up to this point I haven't written much about the *market* that Manila is starting. As one of the first products in this market, we will have some say in defining it.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="With Manila, writing for the web is now on the same level as writing for email. It's so easy that almost anyone who can use a computer can do it. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/&quot;&gt;eGroups&lt;/a&gt; hosts email lists for the public, with EditThisPage.Com we're hosting websites for the public. And there is an opening for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.criticalpath.net/&quot;&gt;Critical Path&lt;/a&gt;-like service for outsourcing site hosting operations for big organizations. And there is a Cobalt-type opportunity for sealed-box cheap server &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/weLoveOurQube.html&quot;&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; for LANs and Intranets.  (Hint to Microsoft: If you want NT to play in the last market, the pricing structure for OEMs must change.)&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="That's what Manila is. It's as if we made the first mail server, for the web.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Distributing the web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I think the opportunity is pretty large. We sell servers for Windows and Macintosh, almost all versions of either OS. We've priced it like a professional mail server, $899 with free updates for a year. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We're connecting the servers into a network of content-managed sites. There will be lots of services we can offer to this market, the first one I want to offer is offloaded search engines, then syndication and aggregation software and services, advertising and link exchanges, e-commerce service bureaus and whatever else our customers tell us they want.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Key point: all of the interfaces connecting these services to Manila sites will be open and subject to competition. No technology-level lock-in here. There's no reason for a competitor to be incompatible. I wanted to make sure all the potential customers in this market know this up-front. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;A developer opportunity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="We want people to set up hosting services for sites both within an organization and for the paying public. In the software business this is called a &quot;developer opportunity&quot;. There's a way for hosting services to add safe macros, tiny bits of script code that connect the Manila page rendering process to back-end services. This is how the various services will be differentiated. The opportunity is explained on this page.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://manila.userland.com/developers&quot;&gt;http://manila.userland.com/developers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Think of modules you could create that plug into Manila sites. Links to project management and workflow systems. A multi-user calendar. Web-hosted email. Think of the market that buys this kind of stuff. ASPs, Intranets, publishing companies. Places where price usually isn't the issue. These are good markets for Frontier developers. And they're new markets for us, because without control over macros, you couldn't deploy Frontier in an ISP environment. This is new in 6.1.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="And because Manila is implemented in a database and scripting environment with a website framework, HTTP server and XML deeply integrated, the door is so incredibly open. We ship all the source for Manila with Frontier 6.1. If you've got an idea and there's a programmer nearby you can probably make it happen.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Your EditThisPage.Com site awaits you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="So, finally, the offer to UserLand.Com members was so successful, now I want to make the same offer to DaveNet readers.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A complete web writing and design environment. Stories, pictures, templates, a &quot;flippable&quot; home page, calendar, membership, prefs, discussion group, syndication, shortcuts, contributing editors, bulletins and much much more. All in your web browser, with Edit This Page buttons everywhere. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Your 60-day free trial EditThisPage.Com site awaits you.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/member/signup&quot;&gt;http://www.editthispage.com/member/signup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Get your holiday shopping done *next* weekend, this weekend you can experience a revolution in web writing, at no charge. Now there's nothing stopping you from finding out where the web is going next, right now.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Let's have fun!&lt;p&gt;"/>

			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Millennium burning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I wasn't around for most of the last millennium, just the last 44 years.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I didn't realize until the last few weeks how much I looked forward to the next few weeks. In a way it formed my life. &quot;Will I make it?&quot; Not wanting to tempt Murphy, I won't make any big claims. But it *looks* I might be around when the clock rolls over approximately two weeks from now.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's a shaky time for me personally. All of a sudden it won't be the 1900s anymore. No matter how much my world looks the same, it won't actually be the same. It'll be the 2000s, not the 1900s.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It won't matter if all the computers go down or don't. We're changing, all of us. If like me, you've been devoting some of your energy to wondering if you'd be around, you'll have to let go of that. The space it was filling will be empty. You'll have to find something else to fill it, or you could let it stay empty. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;A millennium vignette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="A few days ago I was in a convenience store buying a Diet Pepsi. The guy behind the counter fumbled and sweated. He looked something up in a book. Entered something into a computer. He forgot what he had looked up in the book, looked it up again, entered something into the computer. It beeped. He found another book and looked up something there. He typed something into the computer. It beeped and something came out of its printer. This went on for five minutes!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="At first I got agitated. Then I said (to myself) &quot;Take a deep breath.&quot; I did. The angst passed. I looked at the man. &quot;He's having a difficult time.&quot; This was an unusual thing for me to realize. In times of stress I tend to focus on myself and my needs and how they aren't being met. Taking it personally would be predictable, but it almost certainly would be a fantasy. I'm sure it has nothing to do with me. The sweating man behind the counter is just having a rough day. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="After a few more minutes, he figured it out, the cash register popped open, he took my money, gave me my change, let out a sigh of relief and showed a meek embarassed grin. I smiled back. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="&quot;Have a nice day,&quot; I said, without any sarcasm.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It felt really good!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;We're all having a tough time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I don't know this for sure, but it's probably a tough time for almost everyone. There's a lot of stress floating around now. Here's a request. Let's cut everyone else some slack for the next few weeks. When you think someone's trying to do something to you, give it a moment's pause and a deep breath and consider that we're all going thru this together. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="It's like a graduation, but on a global scale. There's never been anything like it. It's never happened before, and in our lives it will never happen again. If you screw it up you won't get another chance. So play it safe and assume everyone means well, and let it go at that.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A deep breath and a smile and keep on truckin!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor just called&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="As I was finishing this piece, Dan Gillmor called. He said he has a piece for January 1 in the pipe, but would pre-empt it if there was a cataclysm. &quot;If the lights go out in Auckland I'm going to write about that,&quot; Dan said.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Then I had a thought. If the lights go out in Auckland, what would we do in the Pacific time zone? &quot;Set our clocks back!&quot; I exclaimed. Dan said &quot;What a good idea!&quot; I laughed. &quot;You're talking to a programmer Dan.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="Yesterday an exhiliration, Albert Einstein was named Person of the Century by Time Magazine.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="A choice that shows appreciation for thought, which is something that's underappreciated in the times we live in. The universe is stranger than we can imagine, Einstein taught. Our minds can travel to other galaxies, to the first moments of creation, not from belief or emotion or faith, but from thought. This is true power!&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="FDR and Gandhi were Time's runner-ups. Both are excellent choices, but I would have chosen Women as the sole runner-up for Person of the Century. This century saw a new balance between the genders and along with it, massive change. It can be hard to appreciate how substantial the change was, since most of us were born after the shift started. There's even a technological reason, birth control. Whether you like it or not, this one invention gave women choice about parenthood. Choice is true power too.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Superfly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="An exhiliration, followed by a bitter-sweet reminder of how good the music of the sixties and seventies was. Curtis Mayfield died yesterday. I found an MPEG clip of Mayfield's Superfly and listened to it about 200 times late last night. &quot;Darkness of night with the moon shining bright. There's a set going strong. A lot of things going on.&quot;&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="The web isn't perfect, I only found part of one song. With Internet startups burning millions trying to be the next Yahoo or Amazon, why doesn't someone buy up gems like Superfly and make them available for free on the Internet? Come look at our ads and we'll entertain you with golden oldies while you browse. Blue Mountain Arts meets Yahoo. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="There's a huge well of undervalued intellectual property, to use the language of business to describe a feeling that's actually indescribable. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The 1999 IPOs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="At the end of last year, in the US, we impeached our President.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="But that's a dim memory now.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Instead, think about the heavy heavy IPOs of 1999.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Red Hat, Critical Path, Allaire, Cobalt, Phone.Com, Akamai, and that's just the start.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Those are just the ones I think about.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Microsoft is out of the way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="The focus is off Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Key people leave for Internet startups. They grabbed dominance in web browsers without knowing what they would do with it. Office is a big smoking hulk in the middle of Microsoft. &lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="As unncessary punctuation the US goverment intervenes. Will Microsoft be split up? The best thing that could possibly happen to Microsoft.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;7&quot;&gt;A gentle how-do-you-do to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;">
				<outline text="I have something to say to Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Jeff, love the web, and let other companies do 1-Click ordering.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="Long-term it'll work out better that way. Patents are road-blocks to the growth of the web.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If Amazon aligns itself with the growth of the web, you can't lose.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="If you try to own the web, like all-things-Internet, it will route around you.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="My advice is the same as my advice to Microsoft in 1997, lose the control, trust the universe, make great software, offer great service, and your shareholders can't lose.&lt;p&gt;"/>

				<outline text="It's good that Slashdot is trawling for possible net outages.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="We'd love to work with Google. Our content management software is generating lots of content to index.&lt;p&gt;"/>
				<outline text="I can't imagine a better partner for working out an XML-RPC interface between search engines and content systems.&lt;p&gt;"/>
