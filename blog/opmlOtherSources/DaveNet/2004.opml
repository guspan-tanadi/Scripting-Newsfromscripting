				<outline text="Many apologies for having written so few DaveNets in the last few months. It's January 25th, and I'm only now writing the first piece of 2004. It's been a long time. "/>
				<outline text="During the Christmas holiday I stopped in to see John Brockman and Katinka Matson at their farm in Connecticut (we East Coast people do things like that, believe it or not) and they asked what happened to DaveNet. I said I got tired of writing it. They asked again. And again, as if they had forgotten they had asked. I know the truth though, they hoped that I would forget that I was tired of it, and would start writing again."/>
				<outline text="Truth be told, I wrote a new content management system, and didn't feel like adapting the email code. I've been writing, more than ever, but doing it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. But now I want to try writing for email again, so I'm going to convert the email code and send out some essays."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Why email?">
				<outline text="I think the people who tune in through email are different from the people on the Web."/>
				<outline text="We'll find out."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Catching up">
				<outline text="In the last few months, I've been to New Hampshire a bunch of times to see presidential candidate campaigns. Southern New Hampshire is very close to Boston, driving there is like driving to San Francisco from San Jose. "/>
				<outline text="I've gotten acclimated to incredibly cold weather. It's three degrees farenheit now, with a wind-chill below minus twenty. Bundle up, go out for a walk. No problem. Amazing. "/>
				<outline text="In October we had a fantastic blogging conference at Harvard Law School. And last week I was at Dean Headquarters in Burlington, VT on the night of The Great Dean Scream. "/>
				<outline text="That's where we pick up the story. There are a lot of bits missing. The archive is on the Web. If you care to read it, it's all there. "/>

			<outline text="Vetting Tim Russert">
				<outline text="Watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://slate.msn.com/id/2085153/&quot;&gt;Tim Russert&lt;/a&gt; interview Wesley Clark this morning, it occurred to me how dysfunctional the system has become. I saw The Scream another dozen times. I heard the chief of the Democratic Party asked if he thought it was the end of the Dean campaign and he said the obvious -- it wasn't, and it should't be. Then they asked if Clark had screwed up by letting Michael Moore call the President a deserter. Later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanpolitics.com/russertgun.jpg&quot;&gt;Russert&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly asked Clark to denounce Moore for saying that, but he wouldn't. The system is so perverse that Clark just danced instead of coming out and saying the obvious, yes, he's President, and yes, he got elected without his character getting the kind of examination the Democrats are getting. " created="Sun, 25 Jan 2004 20:56:41 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&quot;So Tim, let's turn it around,&quot; Clark might have said, &quot;Why didn't you grill Bush on that during the 2000 election? How did he become President without that getting vetted?&quot; I might go further and wonder how he got the &lt;i&gt;nomination&lt;/i&gt; without his military service being fully examined. "/>
				<outline text="And then to nail it, ask Tim to play the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/archiveScriptingCom/2004/01/25/deanScream.jpg&quot;&gt;Dean Scream&lt;/a&gt; a few more times (we're starting to like it). If the Republicans cry bloody murder, let's go back and figure out who painted Dean with &quot;angry&quot; label. Yeah, it was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/pow/article/0,8599,388523,00.html&quot;&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, in case you were wondering. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
				<outline text="Net-net, Clark could've scored a bunch of points by asking Tim to ease up on his fellow candidate Dean, and go do his homework on Bush."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="A wasted nomination?">
				<outline text="The Democratic field this year is incredible. They're all good candidates. If you forget the labels the Republicans, the Clintons and the press have pinned on Dean, he'd be a good leader, a good commander in chief. We probably would get a good health care system, finally. His wife Judy would be a fantastic First Lady. I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the fact that she's more comfortable in sneakers and jeans than in fancy ball gowns. But Kerry is good, so is Edwards, and Clark, even Sharpton and Kucinich are interesting. Lieberman, well, he's more of a Republican, imho. Anyway, it seems a shame to waste a nomination on Dubya. "/>

			<outline text="Alice's Restaurant">
				<outline text="In 1966, Arlo Guthrie suggested we all walk into the draft office singing the chorus from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arlo.net/lyrics/alices.shtml&quot;&gt;Alice's Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. He figured that would be enough to get us a deferment for mental incompetence. "/>
				<outline text="But if enough people did it, that would be the end of the war because there wouldn't be anyone to fight it. It would be a movement, a solution, an end, a great thing."/>
				<outline text="These days we call this a smart mob or a social network, but the idea is the same, and it would work to revolutionize television, radio and newspapers, which desperately need to find a proper place in the age of an informed electorate, which despite what you've heard, is the real impact of the Internet on the American political system. "/>
				<outline text="Since the candidates have to avoid saying anything on TV, or showing any human qualities, they might as well go all the way and &lt;i&gt;act&lt;/i&gt; crazy too. The challenge wouldn't be (only) to sound presidential or seem avuncular, or friendly, or dignified, or whatever it is the press values in a presidential candidate, but to mock the system so the voters know to go to your website to find out what you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; think, what you really have to say. If all the candidates do it, or all the candidates who get votes, we've then reclaimed our political system. Could it really be that simple? Is it really such a wacky idea? Any wackier than the world we live in today?"/>
				<outline text="So Dear Mr or Ms Candidate, when Tim Russert asks why you won't denounce someone or something, or admit to this or that, here's what you say. "/>
				<outline text="&quot;You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant. You can get anything you want. At Alice's Restaurant. Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track. And you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.&quot;"/>

				<outline text="PS: This was fun. I want to do more."/>
				<outline text="PPS: I have a new laptop, an IBM ThinkPad. Lovely keyboard. Totally screwed up company. Set a new record last year at filing patents. They're gumming up the works. Don't buy their products. Heh. Sorry."/>
				<outline text="PPPS: It would make my day, week, month, year, life if they sang a chorus of Alice's Restaurant at a Dean rally tomorrow in New Hampshire. I would feel so damned powerful. Jim Moore, if you see this, what do you think?"/>

			<outline text="Walkin with Larry and Jay">
				<outline text="Now that I live in the east I still go for my afternoon walk. But instead of walking around the rainy hills outside Silicon Valley, I walk in a frozen western suburb of Boston. I still bring my walkman, but now it's an all solid-state &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?prodid=9194&quot;&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; that can play MP3s. It's an FM radio, and can record speech through a built-in microphone. It's a marvel of technology, a product one could only dream about a few years back. And a few years from now it will seem utterly &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=baroque&quot;&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt;, having been replaced by something that speaks 802.11b, and connects up to the worldwide network and plays music and commentary that I chose on my laptop back home, which could be a mile or ten thousand miles away."/>
				<outline text="Today I brought two great teachers with me on my walk: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/12/18#a455&quot;&gt;Larry Lessig&lt;/a&gt;, law professor at Stanford, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/10/04#a361&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the journalism department at NYU. I listened to Lessig first. He was interviewed by Chris Lydon in December, just after Al Gore endorsed Howard Dean. He talked about weblogs and the campaign of 2004. Then I listened to Rosen talk about the power of amateur journalism; he was also interviewed by Lydon, in October, as the Dean campaign was ascending. Both interviews are highly recommended if you want to understand the transformation that was taking place in politics, journalism and culture. "/>
				<outline text="At the same time, this afternoon, we're in a unique little space in the political-journalism-culture spectrum. The campaign for New Hampshire is over, the voting is happening right now, we're waiting for the returns, which will come in just a few more hours. It's an easy but uneasy day. After the shakeup of Iowa, we're trying to prepare for another shakeup, and if one should happen, we don't know what it is yet."/>
				<outline text="But then I realized that there's nothing to wait for. Something big had already happened, and in all the excitement of one of the first great elections in several decades (I'm sure many more are coming), we missed something important had &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; happened. It's just these moments that this column is here for. A thought in time, a thought that won't wait, something exciting and interesting."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="It's ours">
				<outline text="Zoom back to December 8, 2003. Huge hoopla of the day: Al Gore endorses Howard Dean."/>
				<outline text="The Internet has arrived, many proclaim. Now even a major artifact of the old system acknowledges it. All Hail The Internet, Al Gore Hath Embraced Thee. "/>
				<outline text="Now I was a contrarian about this, instead of seeing it as a buy signal, I said &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2003/12/10#When:9:50:40AM&quot;&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly Dean didn't understand the power of the medium he had tapped into. The press proclaimed Gore's shrewdness. He wants the Internet money-raising machine to work for him in 2008, after Bush beats Dean in 2004. Surely Clinton will be next, answering the Gore move by endorsing Clark. (Clinton didn't blink.)"/>
				<outline text="December 8 was a bottom. Like the cover of Business Week that proclaims an infinite bull market, this was the moment to sell. It was a bottom. Nowhere but up from there. How did I know? See the headline of this USA Today &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-12-09-edit_x.htm&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; for a clue: &quot;Gore's early endorsement drowns out voters' voices.&quot; The story goes on to say that in the new politics, with more happening behind the scenes every cycle, the poor voter has almost no say in who runs the country. How neat this must have seemed to the professional journalists. "/>
				<outline text="Now the bloggers, and Lessig and Rosen, have a different philosophy. The power of the voter is ascending, because the new network is pro-creative, a term that Lessig uses to describe the difference between centralized media and distributed media. The least important thing about the Internet as a political medium is its power to raise money, because over time it obviates the need to raise money. The cost of circulating ideas is dropping steadily and aggressively. Television is the least efficient way to do it, and as Iowa proved, it's not even effective. Dean outspent everyone and came in third. As citizen bloggers analyze the positions of various candidates -- why guess what they stand for, insist on knowing."/>
				<outline text="In the new election cycle, we have more power than ever before, even though there are so many of us. It's wishful thinking on the part of the professional journalists to think that an endorsement from a leader from the old political model could factor out the power of the electorate. And I'm happy to report that few pundits could tell you right now, at 2:51PM Eastern, what the political campaign of 2004 will look like. But tune in a few hours from now, after the voters of New Hampshire have made their decision, and all of a sudden, they will have lots to say. "/>
				<outline text="So don't believe it when they say the vote doesn't matter. Only if there's been an overthrow of the US Constitution could that possibly be. And of course keep your eyes open for exactly that, because when it becomes clear that they're losing, there will be desperate measures taken by the media conglomerates, and the politicians they control."/>
				<outline text="And isn't it ironic that in the last week Dean truly has become the Internet's candidate. I've watched him in interviews with CNN reporters explain how their business really works. Dean blinked between his ascendence and Iowa, he thought he had to join up with the established system in order to win. Of course they kicked his ass, and that was the biggest favor they could do for us. Now we truly have a candidate, and even if we lose this election, the process is inexorable, the US political system is ours."/>

				<outline text="I've seen the MoveOn.Org &lt;a href=&quot;mms://windowsmedia.dvlabs.com/adcritic/bushin20-childs_play.asf&quot;&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=39555&quot;&gt;slated&lt;/a&gt; to run during the Super Bowl tomorrow.

In other words you don't have to agree with the ad to be moved by it."/>
				<outline text="CBS has said they won't run it because they don't run &quot;issue ads&quot; on the Super Bowl."/>
				<outline text="I believe I've seen issue ads on the Super Bowl, in 2002, equating drug use with &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebigstory.org/front/front-warondrugs.html&quot;&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. So I think CBS does accept issue ads for the Super Bowl."/>
				<outline text="The question of whether CBS is lying or not seems to hinge on what an issue ad is. I'm not an expert, so I might be missing something. If you think the MoveOn ad is an issue ad but the White House ads about drug use are not, please let me know."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Howard Dean is not a soap bar&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/7/04; 4:34:11 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="What happened?">
				<outline text="In the lead-up to the war in Iraq, for some reason, people who were against the war didn't speak. There was a lot of shouting from the other side, an assumption that if you were against the war you were un-American. In my private thoughts, maybe yours too, I said &quot;How un-American this is.&quot; "/>
				<outline text="Enter Howard Dean saying the war is wrong, it's a mistake, we shouldn't be going, and if he were President we wouldn't. It's one of those things, so stunning, so fresh, so right, that I remember exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2003/03/10#When:10:23:53AM&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; I was when I heard it. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What didn't happen">
				<outline text="Howard Dean didn't stand up in March last year and say &quot;Hello my name is Howard Dean and I'm the Internet candidate.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="People who have analyzed the Dean story as if their march to the Internet was planned, are mistaken. That's not what happened. "/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="The bloggable candidate">
				<outline text="In fact what happened is that in a virtual sense, the Internet was looking for a candidate, and Howard Dean fit the bill. He was &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2003/03/27#When:5:36:55AM&quot;&gt;bloggable&lt;/a&gt;. He was interesting. And get this, he was interesting if you were for the war, as well as if you were against it. "/>
				<outline text="The man is interesting, like him or not, and that's a rarity in US politics where candidates are as exciting as toothpaste or underarm deodorant, because that's exactly how they want us to view them, as products, not  people. Enter Howard Dean, person. Bloggable to the nth degree. But did Howard Dean know what a blog was? No. Does he know what one is today? No! Did he ever have a blog? He didn't. (I don't mean to ask, as some people misunderstand, did he write his own weblog. I mean did his campaign have a weblog.)"/>
				<outline text="He did raise a lot of money on the Internet, and that's interesting, for sure, and he taught us so much, and if he had gone all the way, I believe he would have survived the onslaught of CNN, ABC and NBC, who were his real competitors, not the other candidates for the Democratic nomination. Read that sentence again, please. That's the core premise of this piece, and the point that all the analysis so far has missed. His challenge wasn't to get the most votes, because that would inevitably follow, once he won the battle with the television networks, a battle which he failed to even show up for."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="What we learned from the Dean campaign">
				<outline text="The Dean campaign taught us that you can't use the Internet to launch into a successful television campaign to win primaries. By raising money to run ads you play into the gatekeepers, who for obvious financial reasons, have a lot at stake in the money continuing to flow through their bank accounts. At some point he wouldn't need them. If Dean didn't get it, they did. So they proved that in 2004 at least, they still get a veto on who runs for President."/>
				<outline text="To Blitzer, Sawyer and Russert, to Viacom, GE, Time-Warner and Disney, Kerry seems safe, but Dean is dangerous, he routes around them, he goes direct. To accept his candidacy would be to accept the end of television-dominated politics. They aren't going to let this happen, any more than the record and movie companies are going to roll over for P2P distribution. "/>
				<outline text="Had Dean fully embraced the Internet the campaign would have helped flow good news and bad about all the candidates. They would have followed Rule 1 for Internet candidates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2003/09/02/tipsForCandidatesReWeblogs#1RunARealWeblog&quot;&gt;run a real weblog&lt;/a&gt;. Then, when the inevitable smear came from CNN (who protests that the candidate actually had the gall to behave like a human being instead of a soap bar) -- key point -- the voters would have known where to tune to get a variety of viewpoints."/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="Engineering a variety of viewpoints">
				<outline text="In the 20th Century we got our news from an ever-more-uniform &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2002/05/13/monocultureAnArtifcactOfThe20thCentury&quot;&gt;monoculture&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the spin is different between NPR and Fox News, but the same basic assumptions are behind their stories. Neither challenged Bush as we went to war. Only the NY Times, among the traditional press, put up the meekest of &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2003/03/18#When:11:46:17PM&quot;&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the American way is democracy, one man one vote, a republic of the people, by the people and for the people. Only Howard Dean, among the candidates, used that feature effectively."/>
				<outline text="People laugh when Fox says they're Fair And Balanced, and of course we're meant to laugh, because it's a joke. It's a sign of how totally we are controlled, when our only way of getting information is through television. "/>
				<outline text="Last night, the night before two crucial primaries, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,62200,00.html&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/159805_caucusesww07.html&quot;&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, I circled through the cable news channels, about five of them, to see what's up. They're talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/South/02/06/missing.girl/index.html&quot;&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of an eleven year old girl. All of them, all the time. There &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; other news yesterday. The President announced a task force to investigate the claims of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The US government budget for 2005 is fresh news, and the President, who's looking weak against the Democrats, is going on Meet the Press on Sunday. All of this should be fresh fodder for the Capital Gang et al, but they're on vacation, and we're left with the usual fare, news-as-entertainment."/>
				<outline text="I'm an engineer and a writer, and after years of work on content management, editorial interfaces, syndication and desktop tools, delivering a variety of viewpoints to thinking citizens is something we can now engineer. Technologically we're ready to route around the news channels. Had Dean decided to help develop the human network of citizen journalists, providing coverage not just of his campaign, and not just the good spin of his campaign, he might have been able to survive the onslaught of the television networks. "/>
				<outline text="It will eventually happen. Some day, maybe in 2008, we will elect a President who is not subject to the veto of the television networks. In the meantime, the techniques that the Dean campaign could have used are available to any candidate running for local office because the networks don't reach below the national level. The competition there is with local television and local newspapers, which are shrinking rapidly. "/>
				<outline text="In war it's best to zig to the zag of your enemy. In this case, Dean zigged to their zig, and lost. But in doing so, he showed us clearly how to do the zag. The challenge is to find a candidate with the courage to use the new technology to route around the television networks. We know how to do it, the Dean campaign removed all doubt."/>

What's so fixed about our political system that a minority independent candidate, who likely won't be able to register in many states, is going to spoil it for.. who exactly is he going to spoil it for? Think. Is this the America you imagined when you were a kid? Why can't we make it better? Why can't we have a dozen people running for President? By trying to hold back Nader (good luck) maybe you're preventing exactly the kind of transformation we need. I think Nader is a patriot. Give him a medal. And think instead of being part of the herd.

I'm nominated this year in the Software Designer category, along with the designers of Friendster, Skype, BitTorrent and iTunes. I was nominated for work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. With any luck, we'll be able to announce Andrew Grumet's work that connects RSS with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/introduction.html&quot;&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;. We're very excited about combining syndication with Big Media Objects. It would be cool to make the announcement on the day of the award ceremony, March 15, in San Francisco."/>
				<outline text="Next month I'm hosting the second &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/II/invitation&quot;&gt;BloggerCon&lt;/a&gt; at Harvard Law School, on April 17. It's a one-day event, four tracks each with four 1.5 hour discussions. The cost to attend is $0. The timing of this BloggerCon is at a turning point in the US political process. The first conference was held in October 2003, when the new excitement about the use of the Internet in the Presidential campaign was front and center. Now it's time, between the primaries and the conventions, to take stock, in time to apply what we've learned in the subsequent stages of the election. "/>
