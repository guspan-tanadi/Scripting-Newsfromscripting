			<outline text="It woke up at 12 midnight, did two seconds of initializing, and then generated all the email messages exactly as you saw them. "/>
			<outline text="About ten minutes into the New Year the script told Eudora to upload the messages to well.com's POP mail server. "/>

			<outline text="I left the modem turned off. "/>
			<outline text="Grrrrrrrr."/>
			<outline text="I decided better late than never. I turned the modem on, dialed into The Well, and transferred the messages manually."/>

			<outline text="My DaveNet suite of sysop verbs now has a smooth connection to Eudora, Netscape and AnArchie. "/>
			<outline text="It can send email to groups-of-eight, a single back-issue to a single person, or send all back issues to a new subscriber. Automatic backups, etc."/>
			<outline text="And now the suite maintains a worldwide web site! "/>
			<outline text="Every time I release a new essay, it automatically uploads it to the DaveNet web site, and rewrites the home page to contain a pointer to the new essay. The script even launches NetScape and jumps to the right page to show the new essay to the sysop."/>

			<outline text="***I also did a lot of C programming over the holidays."/>
			<outline text="One of the unshipped pieces on UserLand's shelf is a graphic UI designer for script writers called Iowa."/>
			<outline text="I was so down on the Mac scripting business before the Internet came onto my desktop, I forgot that Iowa was designed to fill a hole that's still there. "/>
			<outline text="Add the Internet to the mix, and it gets more interesting."/>
			<outline text="Here's a fact that I wasn't aware of. Most of the content development for the web is done on Macintoshes. So it stands to reason that there should be a healthy market for Mac-based tools for designing web content."/>
			<outline text="Here's what Iowa makes possible -- we can put a beautiful graphic interface on the Internet. Iowa can fit in underneath, alongside and on top of the worldwide web. Over the holidays I got much of that up and running. It's smooth. "/>
			<outline text="Just for fun, I added a new script type to Iowa, a worldwide web url. So now I can add a button to a card that launches Netscape and jumps to the url. I wrote a script that manages a table of cool sites and drops nine random site-buttons into your card. Run the card and click away. "/>

			<outline text="***One final question..."/>
			<outline text="What is an agent?"/>
			<outline text="Is an agent a script? Why can't I write one in C?"/>
			<outline text="Is it a background process? I think so..."/>
			<outline text="I've been using the term as best as I can. "/>
			<outline text="I think the things I'm writing *are* agents, if there actually is such a thing."/>
			<outline text="To Alan Kay, John Sculley and/or Marc Porat: what is an agent?"/>
			<outline text="This could be interesting..."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Thanks to Brian Zisk for letting me use some of his space on magnet.mednet for the DaveNet web site."/>
			<outline text="PPS: &quot;url&quot; stands for Universal Resource Locator. It's like a file path, something Unix and PC users are intimately familiar with, but Mac users don't see too often (unless they write scripts!). Url is pronounced like the man's name Earl. Your url points to a file. Programs like Netscape eat urls for a living. Feed an url to Netscape and it displays the file in its window. Each web page has hidden urls, every underlined bit of text has an url lurking behind it. Click on the underlined text, and Netscape displays that file. It really is that simple! (It's nothing but text, graphics and urls...)"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Another little-known fact, the Mosaic phenomenon happened on Next machines! A lot of web servers are running on Next boxes. So while the computer biz was writing Next off as dead, something actually was happening. Steve may have missed a big opportunity, it seems. Maybe it's not too late?"/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: It's party time, comrades! At MacWorld Expo I will be at the following parties: Wired, Mac the Knife, Mac Web. Perhaps others. "/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/4/95; 8:02:45 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&lt;i&gt;This essay was originally written as a guide for participants at Stewart Alsop's first &quot;Demo&quot; conference, held in Palm Springs, CA in May 1991. It was updated in December 1994. &lt;/i&gt;"/>
			<outline text="***Demoing at Demo"/>
			<outline text="This conference is loaded with bigshots whose opinions are listened to."/>
			<outline text="Don't be nervous!"/>
			<outline text="Seriously, having a product that's interesting enough to demonstrate at Stewart's conference doesn't guarantee that the demo itself is going to be interesting. It's important that you think about your demo before doing it, that you make your mistakes before showing up in Palm Springs. "/>
			<outline text="***Experience is everything"/>
			<outline text="Experience demoing a product will help you understand what features turn people on. Your first demos will be filled with nothing but surprises. By the time you've done your twentieth or thirtieth demo there will be no surprises."/>
			<outline text="Demo to yourself first. Go through, step by step, reviewing the features. Take detours, try things out. Use the product to solve the kinds of problems it was designed to solve. Put in some real time using the product."/>
			<outline text="Then you want to demo to non-critical people. This is a double entendre. They should be non-critical meaning that they're pre-disposed not to criticize you. And non-critical because if they don't like it they might give you another chance before they tell their friends that the product is slow, unnecessary, or crashes a lot. Your ego will need a lot of support in the early demos."/>
			<outline text="If you're part of a company, demo to your tech support people. They will appreciate being in the loop with product development; and will immediately recognize why certain features are there. And they'll tell you which features you missed. Try demoing to small groups of people. Take them out to lunch afterwards and talk about the product. Listen to what they have to say."/>
			<outline text="***Crashes are not funny"/>
			<outline text="Crashes make you look silly. Sure, everyone understands, so they say, but in practice there's nothing worse than the awkward feeling of watching the machine reboot after a crash. "/>
			<outline text="Learn what makes your software crash, and avoid doing those things! Run through the demonstration over and over, each time you get a new version from development. If the new version doesn't demo without crashing, use an older, more reliable version instead."/>
			<outline text="If your program is crash-prone, remove as many INITs, TSRs or DLLs as you can from the boot process so that reboots will happen as fast as possible. And memorize a good joke you can tell while the machine is rebooting."/>
			<outline text="***Fuss over the product"/>
			<outline text="The best demoers are people who have access to the source code and are inclined to fiddle with the user interface and performance of the software to make it demo better and use better. Take time in advance to make some changes to the product so it demos better. "/>
			<outline text="Appreciate every feature in the product you're demoing. If you don't like the product, if you don't use it yourself, it will show."/>
			<outline text="***A demo is not a tutorial"/>
			<outline text="I've been given countless demos by people who think that I have to understand and appreciate every small little niche of the product. In some settings you have as much as a half hour to show off the features of your product, sometimes longer. In a tradeshow or conference setting, five minutes is the max. "/>
			<outline text="Generally, you want to focus on results you can accomplish with the product, not how you accomplish those results. Complete understanding of most software products can take days, weeks, even months. If you dive into corners of the product, you must be leaving out major chunks of what the product does. The prospect walks away thinking your product is a word processor when in fact it's an integrated file manager and word processor. Bad news."/>
			<outline text="***Don't start with talk"/>
			<outline text="Start with your hands on the keyboard or the mouse. Make something happen on the screen while you're telling them that your product is the latest, wizziest multimedia presentation system and with an integrated information superhighway browser. No speeches! These people came to see your product, not to hear you pontificate."/>
			<outline text="***Get the saliva going in minute #1"/>
			<outline text="If you have five minutes to tell your story, make sure that by the time minute #1 is over, the prospect has seen enough to be totally blown away. Surely there must be one thing you can show that will make almost anyone start salivating. If not, your product has a real problem."/>
			<outline text="I remember getting my first demo of a spreadsheet in 1979, from Dan Fylstra, the president of Personal Software. Dan understood some of the basics of giving a good demo. Before minute #1 was over I had seen him enter a new number in one cell and watched the numbers ripple down and to the right. I know it was a great demo and a great product because I still get goosebumps thinking about it! Of course you can't expect to have a product as revolutionary as VisiCalc was in 1979, but there must be something that wows 'em every time. Don't save that for the end. Put it up front where it belongs."/>
			<outline text="By the way, the first feature you demo is going to be the one people talk about. You might want to vary it. If you have three killer features, rotate them through the first slot. That way when Mr. X and Ms. Y are talking about your product later in the day, one will say, &quot;Did you see how it recalced?&quot; And the other will say, &quot;I think people are really going to love the way it paginates on the fly!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="OK -- let's assume you've floored them with the killer feature in minute #1. Now that you've got their attention, don't let up. Your prospect is going to be predisposed to thinking your product is great, so show some more great stuff."/>
			<outline text="***Make it personal"/>
			<outline text="When we were rolling out MORE at Living Videotext in 1986, I liked to show tree charts first. I'd start by typing in the name of the company president. Then ask, &quot;Who reports to the president?&quot; I'd enter a list of the direct reports. Then flip the switch, and voila! -- a beautiful little graphic tree chart, with their names in it. No fuss no muss. I'd flip the switch five or six times and watch their faces light up each time. Involving the prospect in the demo makes it hard for them to shift their attention. It also shows you care about them."/>
			<outline text="***Can you make it funny? "/>
			<outline text="Humor definitely does have a place in demos. If you're demoing an accounting program, hide a little embezzlement for your prospect to &quot;discover.&quot;  Show it to them if they don't catch it. "/>
			<outline text="***Eye contact is important"/>
			<outline text="The demo stations at the Demo conference have been set up so that eye contact is not impossible. Look at the faces of your prospects as often as you possibly can. If you see their eyes glazing over, show them something visual that will wake them up. Don't let their boredom rattle you."/>
			<outline text="***A little nausea can be a good thing"/>
			<outline text="You should show at least one hard-to-understand feature in each demo. This may sound cynical, but I learned this the hard way. At Living Videotext we fussed and fussed over the first version of ThinkTank to push all of the hard features out of the initial release. At the time (1983) ease-of-use was the big industry buzzword. We fell right into the trap."/>
			<outline text="People came away from demos thinking the product was trivial. Some competitors boasted that they could have an outliner on the market within months, if not weeks. We knew that it would really take them years to match the features in ThinkTank, but the product earned a reputation for being almost insignificant. "/>
			<outline text="That's why we added a dizzying feature called cloning to the second release of ThinkTank. &quot;Great technology!&quot; people said. Our competitors stopped sniffing."/>
			<outline text="I believe in showing off one deep feature of every product, knowing full well that most prospects won't get it. On the other hand, don't use up more than twenty or thirty seconds to show this feature, and for the most part stick with trying to build an understanding of what your product is really all about."/>
			<outline text="***Prepare your materials before hand"/>
			<outline text="No one wants to sit there (or stand!) while you type &quot;Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country...&quot;  If you're demoing a text product, have a memo or report on your disk so you can show the features working on a real document."/>
			<outline text="Don't get me wrong -- I think you have to do at least a little typing if only to prove that it's a real product and not a Visual Basic simulation of a product."/>
			<outline text="***Here's a scene to avoid"/>
			<outline text="You're in the middle of demoing your second killer feature to a group of five important prospects. A newcomer arrives with a pressing question. &quot;Does your product do circular redundancy algorithms?&quot;  Do you stop your demo and deal with this jerk? No way!"/>
			<outline text="Stick with your script. Accept detours only if you're sure it will be a turn-on for everyone getting the demo. If you can handle requests from the audience gracefully and smoothly you'll impress them. But you're courting disaster if you've never rehearsed the feature."/>
			<outline text="The wrong thing to do is to abort the five minute demo and answer the challenge. &quot;Let's talk later,&quot; would be an excellent response. "/>
			<outline text="By the way, the person with the big problem is probably a competitor."/>
			<outline text="***Do a demo script"/>
			<outline text="Once you've done twenty or thirty demos you'll be ready to teach other people how to demo the product. Then it pays to sit down with an outliner or word processor (if possible the product itself) and outline the demo, step by step. Put the keystrokes and mousestrokes in the major heads and the words you say in subheads."/>
			<outline text="***Confidence is the most important thing"/>
			<outline text="You must have confidence in your product, and confidence in your ability to sell it. The only way to get there is to practice, to think about demonstrations, and play Monday-morning quarterback. Refine your demo, and maybe even the product, and experiment and rehearse until you win every time."/>
			<outline text="***About the author"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer, 39, has been a commercial software developer, marketer and software demoer since 1979. Winer pioneered the category of outline processing, shipping ThinkTank for the IBM PC, Apple II and Macintosh in 1983 and 1984; Ready for the IBM PC in 1985 and MORE for Macintosh in 1986. MORE won MacUser's first Product of the Year Eddy in 1986. He founded and was president of Living Videotext, Inc., which merged with Symantec in 1987. Winer served on the board of Symantec before founding UserLand Software in 1988. He is one of the two primary developers of the UserLand Frontier scripting software. Frontier won MacUser's Eddy award for best new development tool in 1992. Winer holds a MS in Computer Science, (University of Wisconsin, 1978) and a BA in Mathematics (Tulane University, 1976)."/>

			<outline text="***Back from MacWorld Expo"/>
			<outline text="I'm back from the Expo. It wasn't exactly like a trip to Maui, but I had a wonderful time, learned a lot. It was a net experience for me, totally. Next year I think the whole show will be a networking show, assuming Apple doesn't screw it up! [Which seems like a real possibility. I wish they'd drop the &quot;Open Transport&quot; name, focus all their energy on improving the performance of MacTCP, fix the bugs, and kick back and let us developers try out a bunch of new  ideas.]"/>
			<outline text="The Expo was like a trip down memory lane for me. Personally, I came a long way in 1994, much of it accomplished by distancing myself from MacWorld. Coming back after a year helped me see how totally negative that world is and how bad it was for me. "/>
			<outline text="***All I want..."/>
			<outline text="Here's what I found out -- over there at MacWorld -- people don't respect each other!"/>
			<outline text="Remember, I'm the guy that loves Aretha."/>
			<outline text="Here's a typical conversation with Dave at MacWorld. Hi Dave, how's Frontier doing? Just great. I'm having a blast. Scripting Eudora and AnArchie. Doing my DaveNet thing. Just got my website up. Love where it's going. "/>
			<outline text="What about AppleScript? "/>
			<outline text="Arrrrrgh!!!!"/>
			<outline text="I'm very tired of answering this question. I just want to have fun with my Macintosh and feel like I'm appreciated and respected by my fellow Macintosh developers, script writers and users. Apple could help me here, but they refuse. "/>
			<outline text="So here's my answer: I don't use AppleScript. If you want to know about AppleScript, ask Mike Spindler. Has he written any great scripts recently? How does he like scripting without a debugger? Does he wish AppleScript had some built-in verbs? A browsable, editable persistent storage system? A powerful script editor? A script scheduler? More sample scripts?"/>
			<outline text="If you want to use AppleScript, god bless you. I am using Frontier and that's that! If anyone thinks they can do better with AppleScript or HyperCard or AOCE or whatever, go for it. But your scripts will have to compete against mine. I go with the best tool. You like AppleScript? See you in the marketplace!"/>
			<outline text="Sock it to me!"/>
			<outline text="***Random MacWorld Entourages"/>
			<outline text="A great tradeshow phenomenon -- the entourage! The first entourage I ever personally experienced was Adam Osborne's at Comdex in (probably) 1982.  "/>
			<outline text="MacWorld is a mature show, so it has entourages too. Sometimes entourages meet and merge. Sometimes they just breeze by each other. Passing Laurent Ribardiere's entourage was a real trip. All those French girls! Oooh la la!"/>
			<outline text="Adam Engst's entourage was very bright and lively. Ready for business."/>
			<outline text="Then there was John Gillmore's group. I used to hang out with John in the early 80s when I was an author at Personal Software and he was running a San Francisco BBS. John went on to be one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, and is now doing Cygnus Support. Our paths are intersecting again. I asked for help in adapting my software to work with existing net protocols, and he said yes. John is a great guy! Looking forward to working with you John (he's also one of the new DaveNet subscribers)."/>
			<outline text="Chuck Shotton, the author of MacHTTP had a nice entourage party on Thursday night. That party was packed with networking leaders, and lots of wannabe-leaders (myself included -- in the latter category). I like Chuck's energy, we talked about my plans for a server and he got very agitated when I said I was planning on using a Sun for the server. I must admit, I'd prefer to use a Mac, but who's going to respect userland.com if it runs on a Mac? This is deliberately worded to extract an evangelistic essay from Chuck. I think you'd all be interested in what he has to say."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape is the leader"/>
			<outline text="I got my website up a little over a week ago. It's all done with scripts. All the HTML code is written by the compiler I wrote. I just deal with folders and text files. It's easy."/>
			<outline text="Thru this project, I've been learning a lot about HTML and web browsers over the last few weeks. Here's what I've learned..."/>
			<outline text="HTML is a crock, but it's the best crock we got. I wish it were QuickDraw."/>
			<outline text="A lot of the webwriters are waffling on using the Netscape enhancements, and as a result, some of the browser developers are sniffing at these enhancements, and are proceeding down their own incompatible paths. Everybody, get a life! Netscape has added a few interesting new features. Seems like about two weeks of programming, max. This standard has a long way to go, this is the wrong point for the road to fork. Anyone who doesn't implement the Netscape enhancements is going to be left by the wayside, in my opinion. This round goes to Netscape. Everybody else get behind the new standard. [Personally I am using the Netscape enhancements on my website and in my scripts. If you use my stuff, your readers will have to have a Netscape-compatible browser.]"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, Netscape isn't a great leader. To be the leader in this category, you have to be totally open to other people building on your stuff. I want to build on the web, and I'd be happy to use Netscape as my platform. But, if they won't open the damned thing up, I have no choice but to compete with them. I spoke briefly with the author of their Macintosh client, and didn't get any warm fuzzies that they had any plans to open it up."/>
			<outline text="I guess we can forgive truly big companies with huge bases of standard software for having a fear-driven paranoid reaction to being truly open. But a tiny startup with no revenue? And a very thin 2-week lead over their competitors? And a cranky app that is really hard to drive from a script? No way the market will forgive that. They need an attitude adjustment at Netscape Inc. Act like leaders. Be open. It's too early to close up. You'll just create competitors."/>
			<outline text="***As Sally Atkins says..."/>
			<outline text="&quot;What you are doing through the content and the technology of DaveNet is helping the convergence of Unix/open systems and the PC and Mac communities. I love it. I have strived for this for about three years in most everything I do professionally. The world can move forward once the lightbulb that went off for you goes off in more industry leaders' heads!&quot; Sally, sally.atkins@forsythe.stanford.edu, coordinates networking architecture and standards at Stanford."/>
			<outline text="***Then Dave says..."/>
			<outline text="Yes ma'am! The lightbulb did go off for me."/>
			<outline text="I definitely want my friends from the PC business to come play on the net."/>
			<outline text="Email is very cool, but it's not leading edge anymore. If you want to stay ahead, you've got to be browsing -- not just reading."/>
			<outline text="To all the computer industry execs on this list -- here's a challenge -- by this time next week, get a a web browser installed on your computer, then spend 15 minutes a day exploring and learning. You won't be disappointed, I'd stake my reputation on this. And it's easy to get over the hurdle. Get Eudora, Netscape and whatever you need to get TCP coming to your Macintosh or Windows desktop."/>
			<outline text="Next step: everyone gets their own personal website. I want to help you do this."/>

			<outline text="PPPPPS: Global Village has a new product that, at first, looked very sexy. It a router in a beautiful package. It connects your local net to the Internet, thru an 800-number connection to Global Village's net. But it's one-way. You can't set up a website thru this service. And it's unbelievably expensive -- $9 an hour --  totally diseconomic, and not even remotely competitive. But some people will probably go for it because they're confused about the net and would like an easy solution. Amen! My recommendation -- have all your questions answered before buying into this scheme. I think one of the joys of the Internet is getting your own website on the air. Global Village can't help you here. If that's what you want to do, keep looking."/>

			<outline text="I've been reading Jerry Michalski's (spiff@panix.com) reports from late 1994 on HTML and online publishing. These pieces are making a lot more sense to me, now that I'm a web site manager and HTML writer. After my thoughts gel, I'll have more to say on HTML standardization and Netscape and the rest of the web browsers."/>

			<outline text="Anyway, today, we loop back around to a question I asked on January 2: What is an agent? I got lots of great mail on this subject. My only regret is that there isn't enough bandwidth on the email channel to carry *all* the comments. But the website comes to the rescue!

			<outline text="Agents are stand alone programs that can query you to find out what you want or expect, cruise the net to look for that something, and not just return it to you, but format it and present it in such a way that it's useful. It's got to work in an existing environment, not some custom, academic test case."/>
			<outline text="***Adam C. Engst, TidBITS on-line newsletter, ace@tidbits.com"/>
			<outline text="An agent is a program that performs tasks for the user without the user's direct manipulation. The closest we get on the Mac as far as I can think is Super Boomerang, because it watches what you do and makes it easier for you to do the same things again later, all without you changing your work habits."/>
			<outline text="From what I've heard, I don't think your scripts are agents. The reason is that they act purely predictably according to preset rules. They may be flexible enough to handle different email messages or subject lines or whatever, but they're still utterly predictable."/>
			<outline text="***Harry Saal, Smart Valley, Inc, hsaal@svi.org"/>
			<outline text="One feature of agents is that by using an agent one can accomplish a task by specifying a goal or outcome where you don't have the specific details to execute it yourself (e.g. knowledge of timezones of the recepients). My alpha pager service as well as FedEx offer a specified time-of-delivery option (sometimes just to day-of-the-week resolution, sometimes to the minute). These are instances of crude but useful agents."/>
			<outline text="***Yoav Shoham, Stanford University, shoham@interval.com"/>
			<outline text="I coined the term &quot;agent oriented programming&quot; in 1989. I meant something specific by it, a specific specialization of object oriented programming in which objects have a particular kind of state (called mental state) and communicate in specialized speech protocols. In the past two years I've spent much time understanding what different people in academia and industry mean by the term agent. I'm writing a piece on it. If you think it'll be of interest, I'm happy to share it with your readership."/>
			<outline text="***Bob Frankston, Microsoft, bob_frankston@frankston.com"/>
			<outline text="I do consider you (Dave) to be in the business of selling tools to create agents."/>
			<outline text="One pragmatic approach to agents is indeed the scripts (or macros) you are using. They are bits of intelligence which you add to a system to act on your behalf. The problem, as you discovered, is that they are idiot savants who can do a task very well but cannot react to variations and surprises. More to the point, they might not have the concepts necessary to detect failures or the ability to report the results. "/>
			<outline text="Systems built on shell scripts work fine until they blow out and drop a message on the floor. In an open loop system, this goes undetected. Compositing these scripts just multiplies the reliability which, being less than 1.00, increases the unreliability dramatically.  "/>
			<outline text="Scripts also tend to become more and more arcane until the day you try to make one more tweak..."/>
			<outline text="While on the subject, I should confess to VisiCalc's keystroke macros. I knew they were wrong and should have been in a language that expressed the operations not the typing, but I didn't have the space to do it right on the Apple ][. Alas, the expedient decision was copied into other spreadsheet languages. Again, the value of automation is high enough that people just put up with it. Just like MIT secretaries thinking Teco programming was normal."/>
			<outline text="Scripts are attractive because they are relatively simple to create and maintain. They also typically allow you to use entire applications as building blocks. This provides real power and leverage. But the price you pay is in reliability. But that's a small price to pay compared to not being able to automate the task at all. Or, at least, not without lots of additional effort. And, even then, even production apps written in C (or whatever your favorite language is) are not 100% reliable, especially in the context of a complex system."/>
			<outline text="Pragmatically, yes, write scripts and I'd call them agents. But don't be  surprised at hiccups. And appreciate them when they do work."/>
			<outline text="***Scott Turner, scotty1024@aol.com"/>
			<outline text="An agent is a trusted piece of software that performs a task on your behalf. It operates independently to achieve goals you set for it. It is free to operate as it sees fit, within the guidelines you establish, and is given authority over resources to perform the task given it. The agent is expected to the do the best job it can to complete the task and advise you if it couldn't."/>
			<outline text="C can be used to write agents. But poorly compared to a language designed for writing agents. Agent scripting languages can contain verbs that would take many screenfuls of C code to implement. Plus agent scripting lanaguages attempt to be secure, they contain no open ended concepts that allow them to be used to subvert the host system (at least in theory.) Whereas C for example will let you drop into the gears of the machine whenever you choose and wreak havoc if you wish."/>
			<outline text="Are agents background processes? Only if they are running on your machine. True agent meeting places will most likely run agents as &quot;foreground&quot; tasks since that's all that machine does, run agents."/>
			<outline text="Are your scripts agents? The one's you've described so far aren't what I would call agents."/>

			<outline text="***Dave's Bluff is Called"/>
			<outline text="It happened! After telegraphing my ideas thru DaveNet in &quot;R E S P E C T&quot; 1/9/95, finally a credible web browser developer has asked the question I was hoping someone would ask: &quot;Dave, what do you mean by an open web browser?&quot; My bluff got called! Coooooool."/>
			<outline text="***What NetScape 1.0N did right"/>
			<outline text="Since Netscape came first, it was the first web browser to support scripting, let's look at what they did, and what works and what doesn't work."/>
			<outline text="In my opinion, there are two scriptable features of Netscape that are of interest to script writers. The first feature allows a script to send a URL to Netscape. Then Netscape jumps to that page."/>
			<outline text="This feature makes some interesting things possible. For example, you could add a button to a card designed with a neat GUI builder that jumps to a specific page. I've tried this with Iowa, it's neat and will probably be useful. It's great for demos! Pop up a card, click on the &quot;Cool Sites&quot; button, and Netscape shows you the Cool Site of the Day page, http://www.infi.net/cool.html. People *love* that little demo!"/>
			<outline text="But there's one major problem with their implementation of this verb, it isn't synchronous. The call returns long before the page is displayed. Typically scripts need things to be synchronous. If Netscape implements the remaining features I'm asking for, this verb will have to be synchronous if things are going to work properly. "/>
			<outline text="The other thing Netscape did right is support the standard &quot;open document&quot; verb. This makes it possible for a script to take the text in a Eudora message and with one keystroke shoot it over to Netscape for display. Some people, notably Chris Tacy, webworks@sirius.com, have been sending email messages in HTML. Now I can read Chris's messages as they were intended to be read with one little keystroke from within Eudora. On the other hand, I'd like to be able to shoot the text directly at Netscape without having to create a text file on the hard disk. But this is a small thing, basically I'm happy with the current implementation."/>
			<outline text="The remaining verbs handled by Netscape appear to be of fairly low value to script writers, and probably were included as proof of concept, not because any application had a need for them."/>
			<outline text="Netscape 1.0N has a couple of major problems for scriptwriters. First, it's very particular about how it gets launched. In my scripts I've had to first be sure that the Finder is in front, and then launch the app using the Finder's &quot;open&quot; verb, I can't use the operating system to launch Netscape, or my machine hangs."/>
			<outline text="It's not rocket science. Almost all System 7-savvy apps (which is almost everything these days) can be launched simply by telling the OS to launch the app. This is what I meant when I said that Netscape 1.0N is a cranky app. The problem almost certainly is with their implementation of the splash window. They assume that when they get launched that they're the frontmost app. This isn't true when a script launches the app. This came up early in the System 7 transition; FileMaker was the prime example of an app that didn't like to get launched from a script. Claris fixed the problem. Netscape should too."/>
			<outline text="The second problem is that it doesn't return errors to the script. If you tell Netscape to jump to a page, but it can't get it, it puts up a dialog! Even worse, it uses the Notification Manager, so you get two dialogs if Netscape isn't the frontmost app. Instead it should just return the error message string to the app that sent the message."/>
			<outline text="***Writing a worm script"/>
			<outline text="But there's much more I want to do with the web from scripts than just poke URLs at the browser."/>
			<outline text="I want to write a worm. I can come ridiculously close to doing this with Netscape, but for a missing verb. "/>
			<outline text="What's a worm? It's much less insidious than its name would indicate. Basically, it starts with a specific web page. It analyzes the text to locate all the pages it points to, adds them to a list, and then repeats the process for each of the linked pages. When it hits a page its already seen, it skips it. Let the worm run to completion. Now you've got a potentially *huge* set of web pages. These scripts are used on Unix machines to explore the web, to gain statistics on the size of the web, and to gather interesting places for human beings to look at. I want to do the same thing for Mac users."/>
			<outline text="What's missing? A verb that returns the HTML text of the current page displayed in the browser window. That's all. "/>
			<outline text="[Note: It *may* be possible to do this with Netscape 1.0N. I can't tell from looking at the app. If it is possible, I hope someone at Netscape will show me how to do it. Their lead Mac developer, Aleksander Totic, atotic@mcom.com, is reading this stuff.]"/>
			<outline text="***Evaluate a bit of text in a script"/>
			<outline text="The worm thing is just a warmup. Here's the *real* killer feature, the one that would truly open up the web to the full creativity of script writers."/>
			<outline text="Add a markup to HTML that would allow a script to evaluate an expression. If a page contained &lt;=user.name&gt;, the browser would display Dave Winer. If it contained &lt;=clock.now ()&gt; the browser would display 1/13/95; 7:06:23 AM."/>
			<outline text="To implement this feature, add another helper app, the expression evaluator app. When the browser encounters an &lt;=xxx&gt; command, the text is passed to the expression evaluator. The script runs, returns a value, and the value is substituted for the command."/>
			<outline text="The script can easily access the context from which it was launched by asking the browser for the text of the page that's currently being displayed. That was the feature that the worm script needed."/>
			<outline text="This may seem like a little feature, but it's not. Control is being passed out of the browser into a script, which in turn can invoke other apps: a database, a mailer program, a page layout program, a card runner (that's my pet project) or any other app anyone can dream up. An open architecture for helper apps! And they can be very big apps that manage lots of content. It's a huge chunk of blue sky."/>
			<outline text="There is a solution, I think, for the security issue this raises. What if a page contained:"/>
			<outline text="&lt;=file.deleteFolder (file.getSystemDisk ())&gt; "/>
			<outline text="With no security, the user would jump to the page, wait and wait, watch the disk light go on and stay on. After a very long pause, the page would display &quot;true.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="We absolutely cannot let this happen."/>
			<outline text="***Support menu sharing"/>
			<outline text="One final feature and we're done. Support the menu sharing protocol. This allows script writers to easily add commands to your menu bar. Eudora supports menu sharing. AnArchie and StuffIt. Quark XPress. It's a basic open-ness feature. Frontier is a menu sharing server. It's an open standard."/>
			<outline text="Otherwise, that's it! I wouldn't ask you to script the back button and forward button. Scripts almost never have a need to resize an apps window (that's really the user's domain). Keep it simple, let scripts drive the features. No gee-whiz stuff."/>
			<outline text="And of course once these features are in, we'll hit new walls, and will need new openings from the browser developers. That's how this stuff always works! ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I had dinner last night at Ridgeside Cafe in Portola Valley with Dave Carlick, dsc@sv.poppe.com, an old friend and an exec at the Poppe Tyson ad agency. Dave is one of the leaders among ad agency types at doing business on the worldwide web. Dave can talk HTML! Cool."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Today is Friday the 13th. Be careful!"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: I think that Adobe Acrobat could be a major player in the web browser business. Still thinking about this."/>

			<outline text="Well folks -- I bet you never thought you'd make it thru a *whole* week without DaveNet. Not this week. Here we are, Dave and DaveNet, to brighten your mailboxes in advance of what promises to be a totally great weekend here in California and hopefully where ever you are. Aretha's on the box wailing and humming. Life is just great. "/>
			<outline text="Yeah! I've been in crunch mode on the AutoWeb product. It's almost done. How do I know? Last night I was driving to my shiatsu thinking about what comes next in the twisty process of shipping this software product. Instead of a list of cool tweaks and cleanups, what popped up repeatedly was &quot;ship it&quot;. And then the inevitable post-partum feeling (not exactly depression) just a bit of a let-down; now I have to share this thing  with *anyone* who wants it. Will they love it too? Perhaps there's a little stage-fright in there too. Yes."/>
			<outline text="As I've been crunching, I've been returning phone calls and email to vendors of web browsers. After the last piece (&quot;A Huge Chunk of Blue Sky&quot;, 1/13/95) it's not surprising that they're calling. That's what I wanted."/>
			<outline text="I've had a chance to test out some of my ideas and conclusions. There's an amazing consensus among people in this business."/>
			<outline text="***NeXT is really there"/>
			<outline text="In an earlier piece, I mentioned briefly that I was seeing Next people and Next boxes in very important places out there on the Worldwide Web. I was surprised, because I thought Next was a dead platform. My experience in the last few weeks has only built my respect for the role this platform plays on the net. "/>
			<outline text="For example, the people at CERN in Switzerland who invented the web are all Next people. You keep running into them. I found out that the service provider that I dial in thru (sirius.com, in San Francisco) runs on Next machines. They show up *everywhere*."/>
			<outline text="Jeannine Barnard (j9barnard@aol.com), former publisher of NextWorld, says that email on Next is from heaven. "/>
			<outline text="I also noticed in Infoworld and PC WEEK that Canon is coming out with a very nice looking Next box. Culturally, and support-wise, this is probably a very good choice for a system manager's desktop or for a net server. Maybe even for the editor-in-chief?"/>
			<outline text="Next should run some ads. Take credit. Develop this market that they are very strong in. Get a quote from the CERN folks. "/>
			<outline text="It's time to bury the hatchet, let bygones be gone and welcome Steve back into the software industry. He's got a bit of heat. I hope he does something good with it."/>
			<outline text="***Servers run Unix"/>
			<outline text="As a general rule, the machines you're talking to are Suns, Nexts and Silicon Graphics (&quot;SGIs&quot;). They run Unix. "/>
			<outline text="If you're a Mac user developing content for the web, you must live with the strangeness of Unix machines, their limitations and complexities. "/>
			<outline text="There really is a convergence here, because more and more Macintosh people are having to learn how Unix works thru the lens offered by Fetch, Anarchie and Telnet. You have to deal with things like &quot;~/disk/sd4h/dwiner/public_html/&quot;. It can be very, very intimidating. [But real cozy to a guy like me who grew up on Unix in the late 70s.]"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, people who aren't developing content, the users, get to see it all thru the Mosaic interface -- which is very pretty. That is what a platform is all about. Nice for the users. Powerful for the developers. Cool."/>
			<outline text="***Content is developed on Macs"/>
			<outline text="I was very surprised to find out that a vast majority of the content that appears on the web is authored using Macintoshes. "/>
			<outline text="People who write prefer Macs. I forgot that. They still do."/>
			<outline text="It was this insight, and my experience with the San Francisco Free Press strike paper (&quot;Dave's Automated Webster&quot;, 11/7/94) that led me to develop content management software, to see that as the biggest opportunity in the tools and products we have at UserLand. "/>
			<outline text="I've been talking about this with lots of people. Subjectively, everyone agrees that 80  percent of the content on the web originates from a Mac or a network of Macs. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Carlick, dsc@poppe.com, the ad agency guy, had me fooled into believing that he had switched to Windows. He actually runs his operation on a network of 20 Macintoshes. His server is an SGI, but all the words and pictures on his home page are authored on Macintoshes. "/>
			<outline text="This is a very common picture."/>
			<outline text="Software can smoothe out the connection. Eliminate the differences between Macs and Unix. We already know how to streamline workflow for organizations producing printed publications. Quark XPress taught us how to do that. It's one of two apps that drive the Mac business (the other is Adobe PhotoShop)."/>
			<outline text="I've helped dozens of people debug newsroom scripts that wander around a Mac local area net, picking up copy from editorial people and flowing it thru XPress. At deadline, a script runs. Reads all the words, does a decent job of laying out the paper. Passes it off to design people who get it ready for the presses. We can do the same thing with the web, but we can do much better than decent. Quark is much more expressive than HTML. "/>
			<outline text="Instead of flowing text to a printer, we flow it to the web. Same process, different result. Writers write. They're happy with their Macs. The scripts hide all the arcane-ness of Unix. Want to put a new article on the web? Write it with a text editor. Drop it in a folder. A few minutes later it's linked to your home page. It really can be that simple."/>
			<outline text="I love it! "/>
			<outline text="The next step is to allow posting of web pages thru email."/>
			<outline text="***The client is ???"/>
			<outline text="Here's where the fun begins. "/>
			<outline text="Last Friday Microsoft announced that it had licensed Spyglass's web browser to be included with Windows 95. This is a big deal (see the next section)."/>
			<outline text="I'm sure Microsoft wants to own the client side of the web industry. But right now, it's probably an even split between Macintosh and Windows 90."/>
			<outline text="Apple doesn't have to cede this market to Microsoft. Current thinking at Apple is that Mac makes a great net server. [MacHTTP is gaining a great reputation.]"/>
			<outline text="But Macintosh is the original client. This is a market where Apple doesn't have to struggle to attain 20 percent market share. Quantify it. I bet Apple already has 50-plus percent. And it's a very high growth market."/>
			<outline text="Product-wise -- I'd love to see a Mac clone pre-configured for net authoring and browsing. With email and basic utilities included. ISDN hardware built-in. A contract with a service provider. An 800-number in ROM. Plug it in the power cord, plug in an Ethernet connection, plug in an ISDN connection and boot the machine. You're on the net. Choose a command from the Finder's menu bar to upload your home page. Software-wise we could ship this product in May of this year."/>
			<outline text="Now that they're licensing the Mac OS, I can ask Radius to do one of these. What do you guys say? And Apple, if you want to do a real net client, let's do a deal! [Dave is forever the optimist...]"/>
			<outline text="***Time interview"/>
			<outline text="I was interviewed thru email by Philip Elmer-DeWitt, Time Magazine, ped@panix.com, this week. They're doing a piece on Bill Gates and the Internet. I wrote a 6-step process that tells how I think it will play out in the web client business. And of course if anyone controls the client side, they also control the server. Here's my tale..."/>
			<outline text="1. Microsoft bundles a web browser with Windows 95. Already announced. License source code so they can improve it. Probably part of the deal."/>
			<outline text="2. Respond to customer and developer feedback. Give them the features that the web is sorely missing (there are a lot of them)."/>
			<outline text="3. Pay lip service to the standards process, *if* Microsoft is invited. They'd love to not be invited. Fairly good chance they won't be invited."/>
			<outline text="4. Hold a developer's conference (say in 1997, maybe as early as 1995). Invite various experts from the editorial side, but no other client companies are on stage (they're allowed in the audience, where they grouse at Microsoft's arrogance, to no avail, of course)."/>
			<outline text="5. Announce Microsoft's super-enhanced-web standard. Totally backward compatible with the existing (by now totally messed up) standard (because of infighting among the other client vendors). The press misses the point, hails Microsoft as observing the importance of backward compatibility."/>
			<outline text="6. Apple bundles Insignia Solutions' new SoftWindows, which includes a Microsoft-compatible web browser."/>

			<outline text="***Will Gates Get the Net?"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's chairman says it is a make-or-break business for him, but the Internet's users may resist his long reach"/>
			<outline text="By Philip Elmer-DeWitt, ped@well.com "/>
			<outline text="It has all the makings of a classic power grab. Bill Gates, the richest man in America and chairman of the world's largest PC software company, announces that his next business target is the Internet, the world's biggest -- and most chaotic -- computer network. The move instantly becomes topic No. 1 in boardrooms and on electronic bulletin boards around the world. The assumption is that Gates, whose software runs 9 out of 10 personal computers, will do to the Internet what he did to the PC industry: seize control of key chokepoints and leverage his advantage to extend Microsoft's domination."/>
			<outline text="Gates' strategy -- as laid out in a series of public appearances over the past two weeks -- certainly makes sense. Before the end of the year, Microsoft will begin offering &quot;one-button&quot; access to the Internet to anyone who buys Windows 95, the newest version of its wildly successful Macintosh-like point-and-click system (60 million copies sold). Given the Internet's well-deserved reputation as a difficult place to reach, Microsoft's promise of a one-stop, easy-to-use gateway (&quot;just click on this button and you're there&quot;) is sure to attract a lot of first-time users."/>
			<outline text="The vehicle for this is Microsoft's first online service, the Microsoft Network (MSN), which Gates unveiled this month. In a typical Gates marketing ploy, the network software comes bundled with every copy of Windows 95. This gives his offering an edge over every other online service promising access to the Internet. &quot;The numbers are pretty simple,&quot; says Allen Weiner, an analyst at Dataquest. If only 10% of the 30 million people expected to buy Windows 95 this year click on the button that lets them connect to MSN -- and through it, the Internet -- that's 3 million customers in the first year, more than Prodigy and America Online have amassed between them in nearly a decade."/>
			<outline text="But can Gates really control the Internet? For a variety of reasons -- some structural, some cultural -- that may not be as easy as it seems. &quot;Microsoft would have a better chance at controlling the weather,&quot; says Brad Templeton, president of ClariNet, which makes a nice profit selling news wire services to Internet users. The Internet, he explains, has no central network operating system that Microsoft can patent and control. Moreover, the Internet is devoted to open -- that is to say, nonproprietary -- software systems. A week after the Internet community discovered that the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) system used to exchange pictures over the network contained a patented compression scheme and that the patent holder was demanding royalty payments, somebody came up with an alternative: GEF, a graphics-exchange format that worked just like GIF but was patent-free."/>
			<outline text="Even if the Microsoft Network becomes one of the most popular on-ramps to the Internet, that still doesn't give Gates dominion over the whole network. As Microsoft is quick to point out, the Internet access business is intensely competitive; already CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy are scrambling to catch up to dozens of small, feisty Internet access providers like Netcom and the Pipeline that promise faster service at lower prices, and these companies could soon be joined by some outfits that are even bigger than Microsoft and have a closer relationship to their customers: the phone companies."/>
			<outline text="But Microsoft is exploring other ways to make money off the Internet. Last October it announced that it was buying Intuit, maker of the leading check-writing (Quicken) and tax-preparation (TurboTax, MacInTax) programs. But the acquisition was challenged in federal court last week by five anonymous software companies that argued that the deal, and a related agreement between Microsoft and Visa, will allow Gates to corner the market on online financial transactions, taking a cut of every bill paid and every purchase made in the online &quot;shopping malls&quot; springing up on the Internet's World Wide Web."/>
			<outline text="Gates is not the only one trying to horn in on this market. Every major bank and credit-card company sees financial transactions on the Internet as a huge business opportunity. There are even plans afoot to replace the expensive Electronic Funds Transfer System used by banks to exchange credit with a system of encrypted transactions carried over the cheapest available open network, which is to say, the Internet."/>
			<outline text="There are some who argue that Gates may be overreaching by taking on the Internet -- that online services could become, as an America Online executive put it, &quot;Microsoft's Vietnam.&quot; Dave Winer, president of a Silicon Valley software company called UserLand, sees the extraordinary growth of the Internet as a rebellion against Microsoft. &quot;The users outfoxed us,&quot; he says. &quot;While the software industry was following Bill Gates, the users went another way. They took control. And once the users take control, they never give it back.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="And judging from the traffic on the Usenet newsgroup called alt.fan.bill-gates (but hardly a fan club), the last person in the world to whom Internet users would willingly yield control is the chairman of Microsoft. &quot;The Net has a culture,&quot; says John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. &quot;Everyone who goes there takes on some of it. And that culture has a strong immune response to Bill Gates and Microsoft.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;The SF Web-O'Lution&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/26/95; 11:40:58 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hello!"/>
			<outline text="Greetings!"/>
			<outline text="Welcome to my desktop."/>
			<outline text="This time, I come to you from a new place. This is the first DaveNet piece not authored in Silicon Valley. It's also the first DaveNet piece not authored on a 68000."/>
			<outline text="I'm looking out my window at San Francisco Bay. The Golden Gate Bridge is to my left. Sausilito straight ahead. Alcatraz to the right. Go into the living room. Telegraph and Russian Hills. The TransAmerica Pyramid peeks out behind a hill (it looks like a cottage!). You hear the cable cars at night. Sparks from the cars on their tracks light up the neighborhood. My friends say that my mountain home is quiet. I know what they mean. I forgot how noisy cities are. I realize that it's been over 15 years since I lived in a city. It's just grrrreat to be back!"/>
			<outline text="Having a second place in San Francisco is part treat for myself, part business. I need a personal San Francisco Point of Presence. The Web-O'Lution is happening here in the city."/>
			<outline text="Glad to be here!"/>
			<outline text="***Apple did good!"/>
			<outline text="I just upgraded my entire Mac setup, got a PowerPC 8100, totally loaded. Got a good price from Tom Santos at MacAdam on Folsom Street in SF (I don't know Tom's email). While I was at it, I bought the PowerBook 540C I've been renting for the last few months. Color, big, light, a totally beautiful computer. "/>
			<outline text="Both systems are fast, even running the old pre-PowerPC programs. I've yet to be blown away by any *huge* performance boost, but then I haven't installed native versions of any apps yet. So I still am looking forward (with excitement!) to find out how much faster this machine is. I'm hoping to be blown away."/>
			<outline text="I'm a software guy. I know nothing about hardware. I like it that way. But I also just *love* hardware. Because fast big pretty hardware is pure fun. That's it."/>
			<outline text="Did I think that Apple would be able to turn the PowerPC corner so easily and gracefully? I had big doubts."/>
			<outline text="This wasn't an easy transition. But they made it look easy. I'm using a new CPU, and software that was built with no idea that it would be running on a different CPU. This is great engineering and great platform management."/>
			<outline text="My benchmark for Mac compatibility is MORE 3.0, released by Symantec more than four years ago. My fear: one of these days Apple is going to release an operating system that breaks MORE. "/>
			<outline text="But not yet! I'm writing this on a PowerPC running System 7.5, with all the options turned on -- MORE 3.0 is runnin like a champ! Whew... [It's mission-critical for me.]"/>
			<outline text="These are great computers!"/>
			<outline text="***Who owns the platform?"/>
			<outline text="I've been thinking about this for quite some time. Have we ever defined what a platform is? It's one of those hypish buzzwords that actually proved to be useful. It stuck. 10 years later we're still talking about them. Cool. But what is a platform? Maybe if we understand what one is, we can have better ones?"/>
			<outline text="I have a good idea of who owns them -- and this will come as a surprise to platform vendors -- it isn't the platform vendor!"/>
			<outline text="They own a piece of the platform. And to some extent they control it, but control is always an illusion, and always fear-driven, negative, and self-defeating. When it runs its cycle, you end up with nothing to control. So I don't care if you own the source code to the operating system, it doesn't belong exclusively to you."/>
			<outline text="Who has more invested in the platform? Developers have more invested than the vendor, but users totally overwhelm all platform commercializers. Their investment is the sum of items 1-3, following:"/>
			<outline text="1. All the revenue ever received by the platform vendor minus the &quot;retired&quot; installed base (some Mac Pluses aren't in use now, none of the Mac 128s)."/>
			<outline text="2. All the revenue ever received by developers. Minus the same retirement factor, above."/>
			<outline text="3. All the hours spent using the platform by all users. Creating new content. And creating software (Isn't a spreadsheet a program? Where's the line? I don't see it.) This number vastly overshadows items 1 and 2. (Subtract the value of time lost due to crashes and buggy features)."/>
			<outline text="And what's the platform vendor's equity in the platform? Only this: the possible option to upgrade the installed base. But it's always just a possibilty. Someday maybe the users won't go where you want them to go. It's happened before, take a look at the dBASE 4.0 release that drove Ashton-Tate into oblivion. The stakes are huge, you're betting your growth every time you take a step."/>
			<outline text="In other words, every transition is an opportunity for the platform vendor to completely lose it."/>
			<outline text="And platforms can be large or small. Apple is a platform vendor. So is Metrowerks. [You haven't heard of them? You will!]"/>
			<outline text="We need to acknowledge a successful transition when it happens, and never assume a transition is going to be successful, until it is."/>
			<outline text="***AutoWeb 1.0b4"/>
			<outline text="Back to earth! AutoWeb 1.0b4 is out to testers, and getting good marks. In a couple of weeks, I expect to be able to point you to new websites, other than my own, that are managed by AutoWeb."/>
			<outline text="There are lots of new tweaks, touches and bugfixes in 1.0b4. And one really outstanding feature, suggested by Adam Engst, ace@tidbits.com. He asked: &quot;Can AutoWeb see email addresses and newsgroup names and URLs in the text and make them hot?&quot; It can now! Check it out at my msen.com website. As of yesterday, every time you see an email address in a DaveNet piece, you can click on the address, and up pops an email window. Type in your message. You just sent email!"/>
			<outline text="Same with URLs. Any time you see an http://www.xxx.com/ in the text of a DaveNet piece, you can click on it to go to the page. This feature accrues to all AutoWeb installations!"/>
			<outline text="Pretty soon we'll be ready to flip the switch on UserLand OnLine. AutoWeb will be our first centerpiece, but there are two or more new products to roll out thru the rest of 1995, all for the net, and all currently uncontested in the market. Blue sky! Yes!!! [Go 9ers!]"/>
			<outline text="My enthusiasm here is totalllllly real."/>
			<outline text="Back to earth again!"/>
			<outline text="I'm looking for a few more places to run AutoWeb before opening up. I'm interested in connecting with real publishing operations. Print publishers going online or already online. Consultants that build systems of web pages. Unix people who have Macs on their desk. Also looking for people who are befuddled by the net. But not too befuddled, you must already have Netscape installed on your system. I can't help people get on the air, at least not yet..."/>
			<outline text="Most of all I'm looking for great writers who want to try out their ideas on the worldwide web."/>
			<outline text="Send email to dwiner@well.com if you have time to try out AutoWeb over the next couple of weeks. System requirements: Macintosh running System 7.0 or greater, Netscape 1.0N, MacTCP connection."/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I'm also looking for people who have graphics that they want to show off on the web. Rick Smolan with his &quot;Passage To Vietnam&quot; content comes to mind..."/>
			<outline text="PPS: I thought of another form of equity the platform vendor has in the platform -- relationships. The extent that they have the trust of other players in the platform determines how much power they have to move the platform forward."/>
			<outline text="PPS: As always, if you aren't interested in this kind of stuff, send me email and I'll happily delete your name from the list. And it's OK to forward it or repost it anywhere you like. The list is expanding -- I'm always happy to add new names. Send email to dwiner@well.com."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;1/27/95; 11:39:53 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hello!"/>
			<outline text="These days I can't write a DaveNet piece every morning. But this is a DaveNet morning. It's 6:18AM. Looking out over a dark city. I see the lights of the Golden Gate Bridge. Before this piece is over it'll be daylight. On KRQR they say it's going to be in the 70s today and clear! Hope you're not digging out from a Nor'easter. We're going to *basking* here in California on the first of February. Come visit!"/>
			<outline text="My writing is choppy. I haven't really gotten comfortable in San Francisco, but I'm loving it. Getting used to a new keyboard and monitor, new table, new view, new walks, new bay. Lots of new! "/>
			<outline text="So I pick this day to approach one of the most difficult and sensitive subjects around. It's the last section of this piece. But please read the first few sections first. They'll set up the mood."/>
			<outline text="***How bout them Niners?"/>
			<outline text="Five SuperBowl victories! Man. "/>
			<outline text="It was a boring game, as football goes (it was the only game I watched this year), but the commercials were great! We rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. The best one: the guy is trying to get a Pepsi vending machine to take his dollar bill. But you don't know that until the end. As the plot unveils, clearly this is either a 1 or an 11. The punchline is delivered -- we rollllled on the floor, hootin and hollerin. An 11. Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="The worst commercial was from Taco Bell. A beautiful moment of love. Our hearts soften and open, we're ready to accept a lovely, sentimental, even sappy and gushy message. What do they do? Tell us how great they are, without telling us why! I hated it. [And who owns Taco Bell? Pepsi!]"/>
			<outline text="Like everything else that's entertaining, a great commercial involves you in the story without hurting or insulting you. Pepsi rules."/>
			<outline text="Was there an Apple commercial? If so, I didn't catch it."/>
			<outline text="***HotWired visit"/>
			<outline text="Monday afternoon I visited the headquarters of Wired magazine, met Louis Rosetto, louis@wired.com, and the people that produce the HotWired website, Andrew Anker, aa@wired.com, and Chip Bayers, chip@hotwired.com. "/>
			<outline text="The first thing I realized on walking into the big room with about 30 people and a network of Macintoshes -- this is probably the biggest website in the world. Maybe not in terms of hits-per-day, but in terms of the size and professionalism of the organization behind it."/>
			<outline text="The URL for the HotWired website is http://www.hotwired.com."/>
			<outline text="After getting the tour, we had a two-hour discussion where we touched on all the current issues of doing business on the web. "/>
			<outline text="We hate the word &quot;content.&quot; The technology suppliers view web writing as peripheral. Andrew said it should be called context instead of content. We laughed. Ain't it the truth! Think about it."/>
			<outline text="They're having fun at HotWired. We're going to be friends. "/>
			<outline text="***Documenting on the Web"/>
			<outline text="In the last few days, instead of writing DaveNet essays, I wrote the docs for AutoWeb 1.0. They're a little drier, but I did manage to include some of the humor and irreverence of DaveNet rants in the AutoWeb docs. [See the Requirements page for an example.]"/>
			<outline text="The manual is a structure of web pages. They're the best docs I've ever written because they're infinintely updatable, nothing is locked down. But they're also the best because I know people will read them! That makes a realllll difference to Dave-the-docs-writer."/>
			<outline text="In the past, we shipped our docs on paper -- which means you can't easily change the product after shipping the docs. This is good, it forces a certain discipline as you approach version 1.0. If we document it we're going to have to live with it and support it forever. Think! [Aretha!]"/>
			<outline text="But paper is also an *awful* way to document software. We're still shipping docs that were written in 1993. We've learned so much since then, but it isn't reflected in the manual, and therefore it can't be reflected in the software. As a progress-inhibitor, printed docs are almost as bad as FUD."/>
			<outline text="Then we evolved. Like a lot of other software companies, we have AOL, CompuServe and AppleLink forums. When we'd release a new module for Frontier, it would be uploaded to a data library with a short blurb, two paragraphs, max. Inside the package is a Word 5.1 text file with simple markups, screen shots, installation instructions, programming tips. As I wrote these docs, I was aware that most people wouldn't read them. It made the docs impossible to write. And achieved the expected result. No one read em! This system didn't work either."/>
			<outline text="I think docs on the web really work. I have been able to document features and bugs in 1.0b5, knowing that I can revise them when 1.0 ships, and when 1.1 ships and on and on. Yesterday I started a FAQs page. A testimonials page. I responded to the experiences my users were actually having. The docs evolve to fit the product, and that makes it possible for the product to evolve to fit needs. "/>
			<outline text="The net: we're going to be able to support a lot more people more effectively because the new medium has so many advantages. "/>
			<outline text="The URL for the AutoWeb docs is http://www.msen.com/~dwiner/autoweb10docs_119.html"/>
			<outline text="Steve Michel, michel@netcom.com, really influenced my thinking on this. He told me a story -- at first he used to copy and paste text from his web browser to store on his hard disk. Then he realized he didn't have to. His net connection is a free local call, and the Netcom connection costs a flat $15 a month, no matter how much time he's online. Steve now views the web as just another part of his hard disk. That's right! I'm doing the same. No more copying text onto my hard disk. I use the web as god intended me to."/>
			<outline text="I hope every AutoWeb user adds the UserLand website to his or her Bookmarks menu and checks it frequently. "/>
			<outline text="***This should be a record-setting rant"/>
			<outline text="Here we go..."/>
			<outline text="Woman says: &quot;Men are helpless.&quot; Look at her face. There's a wide grin. This is a joke. Don't be offended."/>
			<outline text="Man agrees. Laughs. Smiles. Inside the man is furious. It's condescending. He doesn't say anything."/>
			<outline text="It happens all the time. Women dismiss men as inferior, incompetent, helpless, disorganized, worthless people. It's disrespectful. Negative energy. If women knew how this makes men feel, they'd stop doing it."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="And, as always, there are exceptional women who view each man as an individual, and don't place limits or expectations on him. They see the positive things the person, regardless of his or her gender, has to say and contribute and share."/>
			<outline text="There's lots more to say about this, but I want to see what comes back first."/>

			<outline text="Voyager files a lawsuit saying that they're being censored by Apple. It hits a nerve in the press. [The problem is with the press, they always bought Sculley's hype. They should have been more skeptical. Apple never was that hip, even when Steve was the frontman. If they looked more carefully, they might have noticed sooner. Apple is a company, not a second coming.]"/>
			<outline text="Then Apple sues Microsoft and Intel over video software. Mac developers got an email from Dave Nagel a few days ago. I guess I understand why they had to do this, but it still makes my heart beat fast thinking -- what if I had to worry about this? Brrrrr.

			<outline text="***Positive Energy"/>
			<outline text="That isn't Apple's answer to Windows 95."/>
			<outline text="Here's Apple's answer. [Not the official one, that can only come from Apple. Technically speaking, this is a developer speaking. It's what I imagine Apple would say if someone asked &quot;What about Windows 95?&quot;]"/>
			<outline text="Plug and Play is nice, but we've had that for years."/>
			<outline text="Long filenames are nice, but we've had that for years."/>
			<outline text="We still have ubiquituous standard networking."/>
			<outline text="The &quot;we've had that for years&quot; argument is more persuasive than it may seem at first. In networking, for example, it means that every Mac can be networked with every other Mac. In practice, this makes the machine more useful for normal people who don't like dip switches, or even opening up their computers. Artists can set up Mac networks. Only rocket scientists can set up Windows networks."/>
			<outline text="The long file name thing is interesting because while Windows users are about to get them, none of them know how to use them! Speaking from my own experience, I noticed just recently, for the first time in over 11 years of Mac use, I'm just starting to hit the 31-character limit. Most of my file names are between 15 and 25 characters. You can't reprogram all those minds in one shot. And what about all the 8.3 files already out there? 70 million users, with (conservatively) 100 files per user. That's 7 billion files with 8 character file names. It could take a while to convert all those files."/>
			<outline text="Maybe Windows has arrived at parity with the Mac system from a feature standpoint. We won't know until Win 95 ships. But the user base has years to go before absorbing the new features."/>
			<outline text="Moral of the story (repeating something I've mentioned before): The investment of the users totally swamps the investment of the platform vendor. Microsoft caught up, maybe, but the race is really being run by the users. Mac users are much more powerful, and will remain so for quite some time."/>

			<outline text="Second, as much as I enjoy football -- especially when I'm lucky enough to attend a 49ers game in person -- the SuperBowl is always a disappointment -- with the exception being the commericals! Thank goodness there are still companies willing and able to pay the $1M per 30 seconds that the network commands.  "/>
			<outline text="We watched with my brother-in-law who's a major gridiron freak and he taped the whole game. I just made sure that he didn't do the unthinkable and edit the commericals -- in fact, it's almost worth taping only the ads!  (Wouldn't Madison Avenue think that's great!)"/>
			<outline text="Third, my first impulse as I read the last segment of your most recent &quot;rant&quot; was to respond -- there are so many facets that are compelling me to write this. I'm not quite sure which part I should address first, so forgive me if this rambles a bit."/>
			<outline text="You say: &quot;It happens all the time. Women dismiss men as inferior, incompetent, helpless, disorganized, worthless people.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I have to reply that yes it does happen all the time -- to both men and women! If women seem to be doing it more often than men, the reason behind it is twofold:  a)  being a man you're more aware/sensitive to when a jab such as this is directed toward a male, and b) women have been living with this for years and have learned from the pros."/>
			<outline text="You then proceed to give us the man's response: &quot;Man agrees. Laughs.  Smiles. Inside the man is furious. It's condescending. He doesn't say anything.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Perhaps I'm taking a hard view on this; however, if he agrees, smiles and says nothing he has no right to be upset because he's taking no action to disprove her theory/opinion. Men are helpless if they don't defend themselves. I guarantee you that when I'm faced with a similar situation -- even if the person is obviously making light of the issue, I take exception and let the person know that I don't agree and I don't appreciate that type of humor. (It's the same thing as not telling someone you disapprove of an ethnic/racial &quot;joke&quot; he told--if you don't say anything you'll hear yet another.)"/>
			<outline text="&quot;And, as always, there are exceptional women who view each man as an individual, and don't place limits or expectations on him. They see the positive things the person, regardless of his or her gender, has to say and contribute and share.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Thank you for recognizing that everyone isn't the same -- we aren't all cookie-cutter people and so of course generalities won't apply to every one. Instead of focusing your energy on the woman who is making disparaging remarks, focus on the more intelligent woman who can see the whole picture and realizes that it's our differences that make us so wonderful!  Give this person positive feedback that will reinforce and encourage her to continue in her open, understanding and caring ways."/>
			<outline text="Peace &amp; Love!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Very provocative, Dave!"/>
			<outline text="When I hear, &quot;I like her, or doing it with her, because she has no expectations...&quot;  I know the man is being conned or the woman is disinterested in him! Come on! You  have expectations about ways women should behave. Codes of conduct, morals, ethics. Those are Expectations. Expectations can be okay! (Hopes and personal standards are better though. Then if he does not live up to my standards, say he is a liar and a cheat, I can leave based on my own values -- not expectations about his.)"/>
			<outline text="As for limits, I do not think people should place limits on one another. Or limits on what they think the other is capable of. This is typecasting. Limits are why a lot of men on the net have posed as women and vice versa. To explore what it is like without the limitations of their sex."/>
			<outline text="Some limits are just sexual stereotypes used by women who have been burned too many times. Some women say men are helpless because we have thrown up our hands in disgust after being misled or lied to...  all while playing the Mommy role. This is why many women never marry. It so often comes to being his Mom. Who needs that?"/>
			<outline text="There are lots of women who hold negative stereotypes about all men. I fight it myself sometimes. Just as you must when you see patterns in women!  We aren't all golddiggers, for instance Dave!! It may be a common pattern, but it is not a limitation. (I'm surprised how many of my bright attractive well-heeled female friends are looking for a &quot;rich man&quot;.)"/>
			<outline text="Sexists are their own worst enemies, creating their own worst hangups, and missing out on the excitement that the differences between the sexes allow. Respect the differences and enjoy the friction."/>
			<outline text="I am most impressed that you try to understand women. You know, a lot of men do not bother. They excuse themselves as incapable of emotional depth."/>
			<outline text="PS: If you reprint any of this, please leave my name off!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Dave:"/>
			<outline text="The issue is much larger than how men and women communicate and interact with each other. It's much more than a gender issue, it's a people issue."/>
			<outline text="There are people in this world who predetermine who you are and what you are based on very little information about you. Maybe the opinion is based on the job you hold, the city you live in, the car you drive, what you look like, or who you love. Maybe the opinion is derived from that person's previous experiences, and truly has nothing to do with you at all."/>
			<outline text="At some level, we are all guilty of behavior like this, and I believe that the difference between exceptional people and ordinary people lies in whether or not unsubstantiated or immediate opinions about individuals color their entire life experience."/>
			<outline text="I naively walk around this earth believing that all of us people, are mostly of the exceptional kind you mentioned. I am always, always shocked to the core, when I encounter those who are not, and those that don't even try."/>
			<outline text="I know it sounds very 60s, very new age, but I do believe in Karma. I believe that you get what you give. You've got to see before you make judgements, put out respect for individuals, look for positive things in others and not place limits if you want the same -- Man or woman."/>

			<outline text="Women often tend to treat men as helpless creatures -- as you said -- because they revert to a mother-child role. You're right to point out that women should realize the damage they do to men when they treat them in this  way -- they treat them as unequals and that hurts. "/>
			<outline text="Women should treat men as equals, not as inferiors. Of course, we know that because the reverse hasn't been true for most of civilization, some women might carry an historical grudge. "/>

			<outline text="Overheard at a streetside cafe in San Francisco yesterday..."/>
			<outline text="At the next table a couple is talking about computers. The man at the next table (not mine!) leans over and asks &quot;Hey -- do you know where I can get a copy of Windows 95 tomorrow or the next day?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Wow! A few years ago he would have been asking about illegal drugs."/>
			<outline text="It struck me that an agressive software company could start shipping their Windows 95 compatible apps right now. A market probably already exists for Win95-savvy apps. There have been lots of complaints in the press and industry newsletters about developers being hurt by the delay. I bet there's no reason to hurt."/>
			<outline text="It reminds me of a Woodstock-like rock concert I went to in the early 70s at Watkins Glen, NY. Three famous bands. Hundreds of thousands of people show up the day before the concert. Oops!"/>
			<outline text="The first two bands show up to do their 5-minute equipment test. The third band does a 5-hour test. They say repeatedly, &quot;Remember folks, this is just a test!&quot; Well, no, it was actually a concert! "/>
			<outline text="[The bands were the Allman Brothers, The Band, and the act that won the hearts of the audience was... the Grateful Dead -- of course...]"/>
			<outline text="The point -- the Windows 95 market has already started. It isn't a test. Stop grousing and ship your products! There's an opportunity out there. Go for it!"/>
			<outline text="***The New Software Industry"/>
			<outline text="Software is not rocket science anymore. I find that all the pieces I need to make products are already on my hard disk, the result of spending the last six years solving a lot of problems, and bothering to do an organized job of building the stuff. Some people call this object orientation -- why bother? It's modularity, structured code, all old buzzwords for the same thing object oriented is meant to communicate. I like to think that it's just organized or thoughtful software development. Clean living. Don't cut corners and you get to re-use the code. That's where a lot of us are these days in the development biz. Lots of re-usable code out there."/>
			<outline text="If it isn't rocket science, why is Microsoft having such problems shipping a new word processor for the Macintosh? Personal computer word processing was leading edge 10 years ago. It should be routine by now. Why isn't it?"/>
			<outline text="After running jrsumser@well.com's &quot;My Mom's PC&quot; series late last year, which included &quot;Word 6 &amp; Truck Stops,&quot; I got cc'd on a steady stream of email from all sorts of Microsoft people, including Bill Gates and Pete Higgins. A fascinating picture developed and I realized that the software industry is changing radically, and that the basis of competition is shifting. It used to be about features. Now I think it's about people."/>
			<outline text="It's shifting because the online business is booming. But the major innovation of online isn't what most people think it is. Online publishing -- ala the worldwide web -- is just a step on the road. It's really about connecting people to people. This is the really big stuff. Much richer connections between people, implemented using the Internet. The current DaveNet is one of the early instances. Others surely will follow, and more innovations in people-connections will happen. "/>
			<outline text="Now, narrow the focus a bit, and see what this does to the software industry."/>
			<outline text="The people of the industry are becoming visible to users!"/>
			<outline text="Watching Microsoft struggle with an outspoken customer (and with itself!) was fascinating. I had a feeling I was glimpsing a bit of the future -- where software products and the people who create them -- are visible to customers. "/>
			<outline text="I can't prove this is the way it's going to go, it's just a hunch. If you run a software company, and want to go with this hunch -- start teaching your people now to be friendly and empathetic to customers in the online world. There will be a lot more contact in the future. "/>

			<outline text="***A challenge"/>
			<outline text="I got an email from a DaveNet reader a couple of weeks ago that's taken a while for me to process. The subject was &quot;No More DaveNet.&quot; I'm going to keep him nameless, I don't want to expose him to a torrent of email, or make anyone else fearful of criticizing me, but I do want to address the points he raises. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what he said:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;How about just sending me the *important* DaveNet messages? I really don't care about your new house, the fog, football, or whether you and the folks at HotWired are going to be chummy. Too much ego, too little substance. But when you have something to say, I'd love to hear. I just don't need the fan club stuff. Would you be interested if everyone you knew sent out their daily schedules to you?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="My reaction was to accept this person's resignation, professionally and courteously. I went to the AutoMail menu and chose the &quot;Delete User&quot; command. I replied with a personal memo, saying that I had resigned him from DaveNet, but didn't want to deal with the issues he raised."/>
			<outline text="It was wishful thinking! I find myself stagnating on DaveNet, thinking of things I want to write about, but not writing them because a bunch of issues have been raised in a provocative and unavoidable way."/>
			<outline text="Not too much is written about creative stagnation -- for obvious reasons! So I'm trying to overcome it by (as usual) saying what I have to say, and hoping this makes it easier for me move on."/>
			<outline text="***First, my anger"/>
			<outline text="This letter makes me angry!"/>
			<outline text="My father used to say the same kind of thing when I was a kid and did something creative or funny. He'd ask me, in all seriousness, what if everyone did that? "/>
			<outline text="As a kid, I didn't have the words to answer him. Now I do. "/>
			<outline text="It would be great!"/>
			<outline text="Imagine being able to find out what's *really* going on in anyone's life. What if everyone wrote about their issues. We could all learn from each other. Friendship would mean a lot more. We could grow more quickly, accomplish more in our lives, live more richly, have more fun. My grandfather taught me that living is an art. Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- I've been in *relationships* that were less intimate than my DaveNet chatter! I bet you have too. Honestly, I'd like to share *more* about my life, not less. I explore new territory carefully, sticking my big toe out, let's see if it gets stepped on. And if so, how it feels. Can I get thru it? Usually yes."/>
			<outline text="I'm constantly impressed that I am allowed to write about the things I write about! I'd like to move from where we are now, in February 1995, to new places that will be equally impressive. I'd like to look back from the first essay of 1996 and believe that there's no way people would have been ready to read that in early 1995."/>
			<outline text="To me, the DaveNet podium is precious. And it's not just for me, it's for others too because it helps open space for others to write in the Internet style. It's happening. I think any trail I blaze is open for other writers to explore. And of course the competitive spirit will kick in, and we'll race to explore new stuff. It will accelerate the pace. More fun!"/>
			<outline text="It was already happening in other venues. Check it out. Online people put their names on their feelings. Try browsing the boards at The Well. I've heard of lots of other online locales where people talk about real stuff, on-the-record, for-atribution. "/>
			<outline text="I'm proud to be part of the virtual community. Believe it or not, it's what I wanted to do when I was a kid! I wish lots more people would write about their lives."/>
			<outline text="***I want to write literature"/>
			<outline text="I am not a computer industry analyst. I don't want to be one. I admit, at one time, I lobbied Stewart Alsop to let me write PC Letter. For his own reasons, Stewart decided not to hire me. It turned out for the best because I like what I'm doing now much more than I think I would enjoy the PC Letter job. If I had paying customers I'd have to worry a lot more about this kind of criticism!"/>
			<outline text="I am a software developer. I want to be a writer. I actually want to be a great writer. I want to write about life. Of course I write about things I know about. That means that technology shows up. It's an important part of my life. So it shows up a lot. It's one of the basic ways I choose to be creative. "/>
			<outline text="But writing is another channel for my creativity. I find it very satisfying. One of my goals is to have more interesting people flow thru my life, and thereby have a more interesting life. DaveNet has really helped me achieve this goal! "/>
			<outline text="And by writing about my experiences, I invite more experiences. As an example, after writing about men and women and respect, I had a lot of discussions with DaveNet readers, both men and women, about this subject. It got onto the agenda among my friends. I listened to their stories. Learned a lot. Of course I want to share what I've learned! But, if I do so, I seem to risk the patience of at least some of my readers."/>
			<outline text="Also, I don't think I can manage two DaveNets. I have a day job. It keeps me pretty busy. Aside from that, I haven't asked anyone to pay for this stuff. I get all the value I need by having an interactive audience that reacts to the stuff I write. I learn. Hopefully you do too. The discussions are interesting. About real stuff. The truth starts to come out. I like this system!"/>
			<outline text="***My choice"/>
			<outline text="The unnamed writer gave me a choice. I could have engaged him in a dialog, asked for his opinion about what is important and not. But I couldn't ask, because his opinion wouldn't influence me. This may sound harsh. But if I accept limits on what I write about in order to please my readers, DaveNet would lose all its value for me."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="So it's an either/or. If you don't want to hear about what's going on with me, you can resign, or you can read the essays at the DaveNet website. Those are the options. "/>
			<outline text="Of course, anyone can agree or disagree with what I write about, and express those opinions. Please, please do! It's a priviledge to be allowed to drop things into your mailbox, I recognize that. I don't want to overstay my welcome. So if you don't enjoy getting these essays, just say the word. You can get back on the list anytime you want. But I ask that you not ask me to question the basic value of the stuff. I believe it's important and it's going somewhere. I want to keep doing it."/>
			<outline text="So, I guess I'll get a bunch of resignations over the next few days. That's life! At least I'll know that those people who chose *not* to resign are at least entertained by my little stories! And I'll feel that I have more space to write about life, people, and yes, about technology too. "/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;jokeTellingCamera&quot;&gt;A little gem&lt;/a&gt;"/>

			<outline text="A camera that tells jokes!"/>
			<outline text="I wish I could remember who the product is from. They would win the DaveNet Product of the Year award for the most clever new product."/>
			<outline text="I hate it when someone points a camera at me and says &quot;smile.&quot; I try, but the shutter always seems to snap with a silly look on my face."/>
			<outline text="Even if the camera tells a stupid joke, I can't imagine not being totally entertained by the *concept* of a humorous camera."/>

			<outline text="PS: Have you heard about the new movie documentary coming out in April about the life of counter-culture cartoonist R Crumb? I saw an early review of it on Siskel &amp; Ebert. It looks stunning! And it makes DaveNet look really tame."/>

			<outline text="***General Magic IPO"/>
			<outline text="According to the Wall Street Journal, at its open this morning, General Magic (NASDAQ GMGC) is valued at $600 million. They went public on Friday. "/>
			<outline text="Investors appear to be very enthusiastic about the technology that Magic proposes to supply. "/>
			<outline text="Those investment dollars might be available to other companies with a stake in online technology."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, General Magic is more of a force to be reckoned with now that they have deep pockets. They have lasting power, assuming they don't overstaff, and they ship software that's useful for people with popular client systems such as Windows and Macintosh."/>
			<outline text="Realistically, it's no longer possible to hypothesize that they'll go away anytime soon. With the coffers full and a $21 million yearly burn rate, they can keep the doors open with zero revenue (effectively what they have) for a couple of years."/>
			<outline text="It's been a while since I saw their client software for Mac and Windows. I hope by now they have Magic Cap windows opening in windows hosted by the client OS. Implementing the Magic Cap desktop in a single window just doesn't cut it. Take a look at the level of integration in Microsoft Network. It's totally integrated into the file system browser. "/>
			<outline text="Magic should also take a look at the America On-Line client. This is what they will be compared against if they show up on desktop systems in the next couple of years. At least that level of integration is a minimum requirement. "/>
			<outline text="An open server platform would help their story a lot too. "/>
			<outline text="And an open developer program. "/>
			<outline text="For background check out the Sony MagicLink board on America On-Line, keyword SONY."/>
			<outline text="***The Netscape IPO could be hot too"/>
			<outline text="Everyone knows that Netscape is on the road. Gettin ready for their own smashing IPO. The Netscape guys should be watching Magic closely. My gut says they tap into the same river of gold as Magic. But Netscape's story is more complete, even though their revenue picture isn't much more developed. Netscape is already having impact on the world. They are approaching the technology iteratively. Good strategy. I bet GM has a much bigger source code base. But Netscape overwhelms them in terms of numbers of actual users. "/>
			<outline text="Another advantage Netscape has is a technical visionary who seems to have his feet on the ground. A couple of months ago Wired had an interview with Marc Porat, CEO of General Magic. Sounds like he's still in the Kool Aid business! That may have been appropriate when they were a non-public company with no shipping software. "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I think there is a faceoff here, and that investors probably wish they were investing in Netscape, if they really understood what was going on... "/>
			<outline text="We'll see!"/>
			<outline text="***Jim Manzi in Upside"/>

			<outline text="I didn't know much about their deal with AT&amp;T. I still don't. The interviewer was so focused on trying to get Manzi to admit that Lotus is toast, that Microsoft is going to eat their lunch, that we didn't get a real picture for where Lotus is headed with Notes. "/>
			<outline text="What did come thru, loud and clear, is that Smart Suite is a $600 million business, it's very profitable. They were definitely interested in acquiring WordPerfect. The word processing app drives suite sales, according to Manzi. Notes is not making money, but Manzi is very confident that it's their next cash cow. What comes next? According to Manzi, it's Totes, or Coats or something like that. Cute! (and coy)."/>
			<outline text="He was also a bit ingenuous at one point. He said &quot;We like our position of being operating-system independent. We're the last of the companies who are...&quot; Well, gee, Jim, Notes sort of seems like an operating system. Maybe I'm missing something?"/>
			<outline text="I talked with a friend who's a former Lotusite over the weekend, who says Notes is a new religion for Manzi. As recently as two years ago, apparently he didn't believe that Notes could carry the company. Now it's the only song he sings."/>
			<outline text="Notes is beginning to show up everywhere. I'm still trying to figure out what the Apple bundling deal with Lotus means for the shape of the online business for the Macintosh. At least it's only for PowerBooks... Or is it? Do they have a deal with Radius? Other clonemakers??? We don't know."/>

			<outline text="I just read &quot;Computer Makers Defend Vaporware,&quot; by Stephen Kreider Yoder, in today's Wall Street Journal. You can get the full text of the article, today only, thru CompServe, G QQUOTE at any ! prompt, enter MSFT, then /conews. You'll see the article in a list of today's news releases and reports on Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="The Journal piece is centered around the decision of Judge Stanley Sporkin to hold up the Justice Department's consent decree with Microsoft concerning its anti-competitive behavior."/>
			<outline text="The article quotes the computer industry, lecturing and talking-down to the judge, justifying the practice, saying it's inevitable, excusing it, shrugging their shoulders about it. "/>
			<outline text="The Journal quoted people who are using the practice, please don't miss that. I suspect they hope it will just go back to business as usual, hoping the judge won't notice that it's not just Microsoft, and it's not just vaporware."/>
			<outline text="Reality: the software industry is a very closed little club where people trade fear for dollars. &quot;Welcome to the software industry,&quot; I said to a friend yesterday, &quot;where we eat our babies.&quot; The user's needs are secondary, if they are ever really considered in more than an abstract lip-service fashion. "/>
			<outline text="The need to preserve their right to exist is primary. Control is the currency. Innovation seems to be irrelevent. Cynicism reigns. &quot;You can't do that&quot; is the message of the software industry to people with big ideas who don't work at big companies."/>
			<outline text="According to the judge, vaporware is: &quot;the preannouncement of a product for the sole purpose of causing consumers not to purchase a competitor's product.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Sporkin is definitely on to something. But it goes much deeper. Vaporware is just a tactic. The strategy behind vaporware is FUD, an acronym for Fear Uncertainty and Doubt. The FUD strategy was perfected by IBM in the 60s and 70s, and has been adopted, by all kinds of technology companies, of all sizes. The larger the company, the more effective the strategy. "/>
			<outline text="In my &quot;Bill Gates vs the Internet&quot; piece (10/18/94) I defined FUD as &quot;the power to set the agenda, to keep anyone else from moving, to make everyone wait for you.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Who can't move? Who has to wait? Not just customers. Competitors!"/>
			<outline text="Nothing is more galling than having technology that's ready to deploy, a leading edge that's ready to take a leap, to have everything just right, and then to have the platform vendor spoil it by telegraphing to paranoid journalists, analysts and investors &quot;Wait wait wait, we have something much better coming soon!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="One strategic direction statement from the platform vendor can stop the flow of investment dollars to products that, for whatever reason, they don't want to be a factor in the market. "/>
			<outline text="This is enormous power!"/>
			<outline text="If we grant that power to the platform vendor, we as citizens, must have some protection against them using it for purposes that are against our interests."/>
			<outline text="It isn't just Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="James Burger, Apple Computer's director of government affairs is quoted saying: &quot;If somebody is a monopolist or attempting to monopolize a market, and they intentionally prerelease information about software with the intent to eliminate or hurt (a rival), that's clearly predatory intent.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="It's up to judges and lawyers to decide the legalities. But Burger invites the judge to look at Apple's business practices. I guess he's assuming that Apple can be excused from scrutiny if it has used FUD, but didn't do it intentionally. My opinion: FUD is insidious, even if you do it unintentionally. "/>
			<outline text="To Judge Sporkin -- look for situations where a company's actions confused customers and potential investors and competitors, and made them wait. Motivations may not be clear. FUD doesn't have to profit the practioner in order for it to be damaging and reprehensible and unacceptable."/>
			<outline text="I think we all have an interest in the leading edge move forward. The software marketplace once was, and can be again, a place where ideas compete, and barriers can only be erected by real products that deliver real value. Today, in the software industry, we are very, very far from that ideal. "/>
			<outline text="Exposure of this practice is going to make the software industry work better. Customers and small developers are ready to understand FUD. Users have power, but only if they believe that they deserve better than the world that Microsoft, Apple, et al, have designed for them."/>
			<outline text="Finally, thank you Judge Sporkin, for having the courage to bring the issue to the front."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: It would be very helpful if the Wall Street Journal uploaded the full text of each issue to a website so that citations would be more persistent, and easier to describe. URLs may look techy, but they work!"/>
			<outline text="PPS: Check out the 2/20 issue of Business Week, the Technology &amp; You column written by Stephen Wildstrom (it's on page 20). It contains more insight into the plug-and-play issue for PC users. It's fascinating stuff and follows the line of reasoning in my &quot;Positive Energy&quot; piece released yesterday."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Peaceful Uses of the Internet&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/17/95; 1:22:06 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Imagine if, at the dawn of the nuclear age, a US Senator proposed a bill that required that all uses of nuclear technology be peaceful. The law would only be enforcable within the borders of the United States. "/>
			<outline text="You could admire the spirit of the idea, but we all know it couldn't possibly have worked."/>
			<outline text="You'd have to conclude that the senator didn't understand how nuclear technology works."/>
			<outline text="Senator Jim Exon (D-NE) -- the man who proposed the Communications Decency Act of 1995 -- clearly doesn't understand how online technology works. "/>
			<outline text="According to the Electronic Messaging Association, info@ema.org, &quot;In an effort to stamp out digital pornography, the act makes all telecommunications providers doing business in the United States (from the telephone companies all the way down to offices that use LANs) liable for the content of anything sent over their networks. To avoid the possibility of tens of thousands of dollars in fines and up to two years in jail, business owners would be forced to police their networks and monitor in advance all messages sent over them.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I understand that there's actually a serious possibility that this legislation will pass. In preparation, I was going to suggest that we all establish dial-in accounts to Internet nodes in Canada or Mexico. But even that won't work. The phone companies would be liable for the content of our calls out of the country."/>
			<outline text="No one is going to be willing to assume responsibility for other people's postings. We have a shortage of connectivity right now. This will make it impossible for the new industries, that we need, to develop."/>
			<outline text="Senator Exon doesn't get it. The net is a global thing. The US Senate can't control it. Australia is almost as close as Sausilito. The US is just one country. He doesn't get to say what goes on the net. "/>
			<outline text="But he can keep Americans from using the net."/>
			<outline text="Think about it folks. How much value do you place on electronic mail? What would you do if two months from now you can't do email anymore? You don't think it can happen? The experts think you're wrong."/>
			<outline text="This bill would devastate the US online industry, which is already suffering from great growing pains. And it totally fucks the people of the United States who want to be online. "/>
			<outline text="Let's stop this madness, ASAP."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Aside from that, Exon's goal is offensive. He doesn't say the Internet should only be used for peaceful purposes, he says we can't talk about sex on the Internet. I guess Senator Exon is a tough customer too."/>
			<outline text="PPS: What's the answer? We need legislation that says that all our rights to free speech guaranteed under the Constitution apply to speech on electronic networks."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Billions of Websites&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;2/18/95; 9:32:06 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Every new website begets more websites. If I have one, I want my friend to have one, so I can point to it. And so they can point to my site. Someday I'll be able to walk a network of friendships, automatically knowing that each of us has mutual friends. It'll be cool."/>
			<outline text="The whole controversy started by &quot;A Tough Customer&quot; a week or so ago, was a non-issue. When I write about relationships between people, I *am* writing about technology. That's the future, as it was the past. It was just an illusion that somehow you could talk about technology without really talking about people."/>
			<outline text="Anyway -- perhaps contradictorily -- it seems that the web should be a finite thing -- that someday all the websites will be done, and we can do something else! But that's just an illusion too. The breadth of the web is limited only by the available space on hard disks, and the availability of human thoughts and feelings to fill that space. There's no shortage of either! [Technically our capacity to create *is* finite, but our ability to travel, even electronically, is finite too. You'll never visit all the cool websites. So the web, for each of us, is infinite. Also for worm scripts, but that's another story.]"/>
			<outline text="Every writer can participate in the web. Someday, very soon, I believe, every writer will. That's the next big opportunity in the online world."/>
			<outline text="***It's hard to get your website up now"/>
			<outline text="As of February 1995 you still need a degree in rocket science to get a website on the air. I know -- I am trying to find a reputable and professional business to manage my site for me. Most of them are flaky, the ones that aren't are hard to get into. All my content is ready. The HTML is written. The scripts are running. "/>
			<outline text="Who can I pay to keep my site on the air?"/>
			<outline text="There's a barrier here, and therefore, an opportunity. "/>
			<outline text="Any one of the popular online services could be instrumental in opening up web authoring to all their users. They're all moving in that direction. Prodigy and Netcom users can already browse the web. America OnLine (AOL) and CompuServe promise it soon. They're also getting their own websites ready. Each will have their own unique look. And people from outside their service get to look too. AOL has opened up a mirror to popular FTP sites on the net. This has been well received in the net community. "/>
			<outline text="But the clean up act, the new leader of the online business, will be the one who makes it really easy for anyone to publish a website on their server. "/>
			<outline text="***How it would work..."/>
			<outline text="One of my many email addresses is davewiner@aol.com. In parallel, I'd like to have a website at http://www.aol.com/davewiner/."/>
			<outline text="Another address is 76244.120@compuserve.com. On CompuServe my website would be named http://www.compuserve.com/76244.120/."/>
			<outline text="Email addresses are a great promotion vehicle for the service. Website addresses will promote the service even more widely."/>
			<outline text="The economics are simple. The user pays a small monthly fee for the site, assuming it gets a reasonably small number of accesses. If it becomes popular (I think this is what the online vendors are afraid of) either the site moves off the host, or the service makes a deal with the author, a deal that they both profit from. A win-win. After all, the goal of every writer is to have lots of readers. Winning is a happy time, not a problem time. [In case you're wondering -- the answer is advertising.]"/>
			<outline text="A little bit of software is added to the client. A new command, call it Update Website, is added to the Members menu. Choose the command, then choose a folder of text and GIF files. The rest is automatic. [It should be smart enough to not upload files that haven't changed since the last upload.]"/>
			<outline text="A second new command opens a web browser window and shows you what your home page looks like. In version 2, provide an HTML compatible editor for all text displayed by the system, including email, so the websites look great even if the writer doesn't know anything about HTML. There are other spiffy ideas and new directions that branch out from here."/>
			<outline text="***Why I need this"/>
			<outline text="I'm a software guy."/>
			<outline text="In my previous life, as a personal computer industry software developer, that meant I wrote strings of little ones and zeros that made hardware do stuff that people wanted to do."/>
			<outline text="In the online world it means that I write little strings of ones and zeros that amuse people and I write software for writing and delivering those ones and zeros in entertaining and enabling ways."/>
			<outline text="I'm not a hardware guy. I don't like opening computers. It reminds me that there's a physical side to all them dancing ones and zeros. I prefer to believe it's actually done with magic. It helps preserve my sanity."/>
			<outline text="I don't want to see the computer that stores my website. I want to believe it's magic. I'm a software guy. I want someone else to worry about it. I have enough to keep me busy in my world of ones and zeros."/>
			<outline text="***What I want"/>
			<outline text="I want two things from the system that runs my website: the ability to respond to hundreds of thousands of accesses per day and 24-hour-a-day uptime. In the world of the Internet these two things are in *very* short supply. "/>
			<outline text="I want to know that if my site becomes popular, the service will be able to handle the load, and if Bill Clinton decides to take a look at 4AM some morning he won't get a &quot;Unable to Locate Host&quot; message."/>
			<outline text="As the current online services all move into the Internet world it would be easy and profitable for them to apply their competency in these areas to running websites."/>
			<outline text="***Why they should do it"/>
			<outline text="The platform with the most powerful users is the most powerful platform. "/>
			<outline text="If all the cool websites are emanating from your server, it will become a cool place to send email from.It will also be a cool place to put up new websites. "/>
			<outline text="This generates billing and lots of publicity. "/>
			<outline text="It taps you directly into the growth of the net. "/>
			<outline text="It's also a good defense against threats like Senator Exon. If millions of people understand and use the expressive power of the web they would be easier to organize against paranoic attacks on our civil liberties."/>
			<outline text="I'll let you all know when the problem is solved!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: The Well already offers this service, but they add a legal notice to every page they display. This is a deal-stopper for me. I don't want to provide free web space for The Well's lawyers on every one of my pages. Here's another reason to oppose Exon with some positive legislation that specifically absolves the service provider from responsibility for pages that the system serves."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Both Mitnick and Exon evoke a common hope that's unrealistic -- that the net will be a safe place. It mirrors the world. It can't be safe. You still have to protect yourself. Be vulnerable only when you can afford to be."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: It's possible that The Well will go down for 48 hours sometime in the next few days to implement a new security system after the Mitnick attack.

			<outline text="Anyway back to the story."/>
			<outline text="I have this theory that great hair is other people reflecting off a balance that's happening inside of you, a balance that isn't visible at a conscious level, but is perceivable, possibly in the same spot inside the person who's doing the looking.

The top Eddy award was great confirmation, eight years later it still feels important. The award didn't change my life, but it marked an arrival, a milestone, a turning point."/>
			<outline text="I feel the same way about the Newsweek list. It's a mainstream magazine. Their writers are interested in the net. My DaveNet stories are reaching them. They're great writers! People I want to be friends with. The net and great writing are going to be important to each other."/>
			<outline text="Like all plans, my plan has steps. But if my memory serves correctly, I think I will look back at this week as a major turning point; where my plans started seeming less like dreams and more like reality."/>
			<outline text="***The value of being heard"/>

			<outline text="Listening. Being heard. Flip sides of the same thing. "/>
			<outline text="All my life I've placed the highest value, derived the most happiness, from simply being heard."/>
			<outline text="It's a precious commodity in a world that seems to always say shut up or go away. People don't want to hear other people. When people shout, they're really saying &quot;listen to me!&quot; It can be a struggle to keep quiet and give other people the space to say something; especially to feel safe saying something real, something that reflects how they really feel. "/>
			<outline text="We understand how this works. If I see you as real, then I have to see myself as real. If I listen to you, I have to listen to myself. It can be very scary stuff.

			<outline text="There is great Windows support from Compuserve, AOL, Prodigy and every online service I can think of.

We are pleased with the way the whole online industry seems to have been galvanized by our plans or people's imagination about our plans."/>
			<outline text="I still don't know what the lack of a Mac client has to do with openness. Are ISVs who only ship their software on Windows now considered closed? This word open gets a lot of interesting definitions nowadays. I always think of it in terms of customer choices - under Windows the customer gets to choose their hardware supplier. Under Mac and Windows customers have a wide choice of software products."/>

			<outline text="More open in the sense that there are more choices for customers. Exactly as you defined it. Talk to the Radius guys. Open also has to do with the tilt of the table. It's not an absolute thing, there are degrees of openness. Certainly Win95 would be a more open client platform if MSN were not bundled. "/>
			<outline text="As I've learned from my own experiences with Apple, customer perceptions count too. Are Windows users that much more sophisticated than Mac users? How will you avoid letting them conclude that somehow MSN is the &quot;official&quot; network for Windows users? I bet you don't discourage them from drawing that conclusion. When journalists start using the adjective &quot;standard&quot; to describe your service, will you call them up and protest? There's a community out there, and you're using them. I didn't say there was anything unethical or illegal going on. But I don't have to ignore the phenomenon, just because, apparently, you want me to."/>
			<outline text="I guess it's ironic that if Apple had been better at executing on eWorld, we'd be hearing a lot about that bundling thing too. I don't suspect you'll hear too much bitching if MSN ends up having the same level of presence as eWorld does."/>

			<outline text="To: dwiner@well.com&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="As you say in your mail we may or may not be successful with MSN. It will depend on whether we do an incredible job at low prices for customers. If we do a good job and customers choose to buy it it seems like a good thing for Windows users to me. Meanwhile all the other online companies will continue to do a great job on Windows. All of them are choosing to put more energy into Windows than any other platform and that will result in lots of good choices for Windows users."/>
			<outline text="As you have pointed out in the world of the Internet no one &quot;owns&quot; an   online customer. MSN will be just one place on the Internet - some people will dial it direct and gateway to the Internet. Some people will come in from the Internet to MSN. We are enabling Windows for the Internet with Windows95 - because we think thats great for customers."/>
			<outline text="MSN is not bundled with Windows95 - the client bits are there and can   optionally be installed. PC manufacturers already bundle lots of front ends. I said earlier that Prodigy was on well over a majority of PCs sold this Christmas. Did Apple let Prodigy do the same things that PC manufacturers did? Giving away front ends to any online service is a trivial thing - just post them on the Internet and get them on the CDs which will be inserted in virtually every PC magazine within the next few years."/>
			<outline text="The last I looked Apple had not given up on E-world. They got into the market before us and I am sure they have learned a lot and will do even better in the future. It's hard to say we are ahead of them or better than them when we haven't even shipped anything yet."/>

			<outline text="Thanks Bill! A very interesting discussion... I learned a lot."/>
			<outline text="Dave"/>
			<outline text="PS: In the same piece, I said &quot;Creative energy will flow to the open platform. Creative people haven't migrated to Windows.&quot; Please let me clarify that statement. By creative people, I meant art directors and copy writers, as in the creative people at ad agencies. Content people. I certainly didn't mean to imply that as a whole, Windows users aren't creative. Quite the opposite. You have to be very creative to derive meaning from 8-character file names! (Sorry...)"/>

			<outline text="It's definitely DaveNet material."/>
			<outline text="Very quotable stuff."/>
			<outline text="It's a cc of a letter to the editor to the Wall Street Journal. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what Fred Davis said..."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="March 8, 1995"/>
			<outline text="Dear Editor: "/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I almost choked on my Cheerios when reading your front page story on Lotus Notes and an op-ed piece written by Lotus CEO Jim Manzi in your March 7 edition. Its been a while since I've seen such an overtly biased journalistic one-two punch delivered in your pages. In the guise of a report about Lotus, you seem to be participating in a gleeful round of Microsoft-bashing without the taking the time to check your facts or present a balanced front-page story. "/>
			<outline text="First, the story by John Wilke, &quot;Lotus's Position,&quot; is a one-sided puff piece, which seems to be written more to boost Lotus's stock than to reveal the true nature of its key product, Notes. Wilke ballyhoos Notes as a wondrous product, peppered with glowing quotes from enthusiastic customers. "/>
			<outline text="If Wilke had done his research -- or maybe just had an open mind rather than pursuing his own agenda -- he would have found many customers who are very unhappy with Notes and many potential customers who rejected it altogether. He might also have discovered what Notes actually is -- something not revealed in the article -- and that it already faces substantial competition. "/>
			<outline text="To put it simply, Notes is a combination of e-mail and database software; unfortunately for Lotus, it's lousy e-mail and a bad database. "/>
			<outline text="The idea behind Notes is indeed powerful. By combining e-mail and a database, an organization can integrate communications and information management. But Notes is a poor implementation of this concept that suffers from everything from weak technical underpinnings, sluggish performance, recurring bugs and crashes, and an awkward user interface. I know this from painful personal experience because my company made the unfortunate move to Notes some time ago subjecting its employees to technical problems that often put us out of touch rather than keeping us in touch. "/>
			<outline text="Competitors to Notes aren't months away, as Wilke suggests. Instead, they are already here -- albeit without as much marketing hype. "/>
			<outline text="The World Wide Web is a better example of integrating e-mail with a database and, unlike Notes, is an industry-standard platform open to all. Online services are also able to provide integration of e-mail and database software -- the Interchange online network, recently acquired by AT&amp;T, seems especially well-suited as an alternative to Notes. Wilke's article certainly seemed more like an ad for Notes than a front-page WSJ story. "/>
			<outline text="The sucker punch was completed by Lotus CEO Jim Manzi's self-serving diatribe, &quot;Where Do We Really Want to Go?&quot; Methinks the Manzi doth protest too much. I suspect Manzi's Microsoft-bashing is merely a pathetic attempt to distract Lotus stockholders from the terrible job he has done of running the company. When Manzi took the helm at Lotus, it had almost twice the annual revenues of Microsoft. Now he is whining to the Justice Department that the big bad Microsoft hurt his company unfairly. Having served as either founder or director of three of the computer industry's leading product testing labs (PC Magazine Labs, PC Week Labs, MacUser Labs), I've spent much of the past ten years evaluating software products. Lotus's fortunes have been hurt far more by the company's own poor product quality -- not just Notes but also 1-2-3 and Ami -- than by any unfair action of Microsoft's. Sure, Microsoft hurt Lotus -- but they did so fair and square by producing better products and doing a better job at marketing them. "/>
			<outline text="The popular idea that the success of Microsoft's applications is linked to its ownership of the Windows operating system can easily be disproved. Just look at the Macintosh market. Apple Computer produces the Macintosh operating system and also develops Macintosh applications through its software subsidiary Claris. "/>
			<outline text="If having an inside track on the operating system gives you the edge in creating applications, it would stand that Claris would be the leading application vendor in the Macintosh market. Surprise, surprise. It's not Claris, but Microsoft that holds a commanding lead in Macintosh application sales -- in fact, it has greater market share on the Macintosh than on Windows. With the legal contention between Apple and Microsoft, it's obvious than Microsoft gets no inside track on the Macintosh operating system yet its applications dominate that market. Maybe they are just good at developing and selling applications regardless of the operating system. "/>
			<outline text="What I find most distasteful about Manzi's moaning is not his faulty logic but his assertion that Microsoft has forced itself into its position of prominence. Bill Gates did not take over the computer industry in a military coup. Instead, he and his company were elected to their position of dominance by the personal computer industry itself, which continually voted to back Microsoft's operating systems over its competitors. Ironically, Lotus is one of the companies that did the most to help Windows get to its position of dominance by withholding support for competitive platforms, such as the Macintosh. Actually, Microsoft has done much to foster competition by supporting the Macintosh with its leading applications at a time when other Windows developers such as Lotus refused to do so. "/>
			<outline text="Customers don't buy operating systems to look at pretty icons -- they get them merely as a stepping stone to the applications that run on that operating system. PC software companies -- by overwhelmingly favoring Windows development at the expense of alternative platforms such as Macintosh, NeXT, and Unix -- are leading their customers to Windows and creating a monolithic standard that does indeed have troubling implications in suppressing competition and quality. So next time Lotus and similar companies vote with their development and marketing budgets on what platforms to support, they should pay much closer attention to where &quot;they&quot; really want to go. "/>
			<outline text="Frederic E. Davis"/>
			<outline text="PS: Fred is a longtime Ziffer, and columnist for Windows Sources, Computer Life, PC WEEK and former editor in chief of MacUser. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: When we talked a few minutes ago, Fred pointed out that the timing of the Journal piece was inevitably linked to Esther's conference. But the timing backfired. To the little extent people talked about Manzi, it was mostly to wonder when is he going to get off the Microsoft thing, and focus on what Lotus is doing."/>

			<outline text="***Seeds a-waiting"/>
			<outline text="It's more than just rainy here in California, it's a deluge! Total gully washer. The creek behind my mountain home is higher than I can remember. The house isn't in danger yet, but I *have* thought about how to make a quick exit if it gets bad. "/>
			<outline text="When it stops raining it's going to be great. A few weeks ago I planted a bunch of flower beds in seeds -- sunflowers, sweet peas and nasturtiums. It looked like spring had sprung back then. To some extent it had. It's been warm since late January, but man has it been raining! The lawn is totally green. And my flowers, incubating in their fertilized beds, are waiting for the sun to come out. It's going to be a glorious bloom this year. There'll be lots of love! It's just a matter of weeks. Maybe days."/>
			<outline text="***Netscape 1.1"/>
			<outline text="Speaking of seeds, my PowerBook is busy downloading the beta of Netscape 1.1 right now. But I already know I'm going to be disappointed. Reports from other script writers say its interapplication support is even more confused than version 1.0's. "/>
			<outline text="I hope to get a chance to help Netscape improve its scripting interface before 1.1 goes golden. The opportunity of a truly open and scriptable network browser makes me very itchy! I want it now. It's very high on my to-do list."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I talked with John Doerr, an old friend, Kleiner VC and Netscape board member, down at Esther's. I've also been emailing with the lead developer of the Macintosh version of Netscape. Hey -- if you think you'd have fun with a scriptable net browser, send me email and I'll pass it on to the Netscape folks."/>
			<outline text="***The Story of Go"/>
			<outline text="Speaking of John Doerr, he's mentioned frequently in the new book, Start Up, which is an amusing recount (rant?) of the history of Go Corporation by its founder and president, Jerry Kaplan, jkaplan@aol.com. "/>
			<outline text="I found a pre-release copy of Jerry's book in a pile of mail I sorted thru before leaving for Esther's. It was a perfect intro to the conference. The book recalls the faceoff between Jeff Raikes of Microsoft and Jerry and Robert Carr from Go, at the 1991 PC Forum. The products were PenWindows and PenPoint. "/>
			<outline text="I remember sitting in the audience wondering &quot;who do these guys think they're making products for?&quot; "/>
			<outline text="After four years, I got it! They were providing fuel for the industrialists that set the agenda for this toothless industry on stage at Esther's."/>
			<outline text="***I said two things at Esther's"/>
			<outline text="Hey -- so -- what was the buzz at this year's PC Forum? You know it! The Web! The toothless crowd joins the Web-O-Lution. Sort of."/>
			<outline text="I spoke just once at the conference just once to say two things. I'll repeat them here. "/>
			<outline text="First, I asked that we all join to fight Senator Exon's Communications Decency Act of 1995. I've already written about this, in Peaceful Uses of the Internet, 2/17/95. If you use email you must make your opinions known and make your presence felt, and make sure your vote is not taken for granted. Clinton wants to get re-elected. Exon is a Democrat. It's democracy time folks."/>
			<outline text="Second, the toothless industrialists are thinking about this web thing wrong. It isn't a publishing system in the sense that magazines, newspapers and books are publishing systems. "/>
			<outline text="The cost of of publishing a page is going down to about the cost of sending a single email message. "/>
			<outline text="In other words, the cost is dropping almost to zero. "/>
			<outline text="It's interesting to watch the current publishing industry try to turn the corner. "/>
			<outline text="Their money may make transition if they're very lucky. The writers will turn the corner if they're brave. Same for software developers. "/>
			<outline text="It helps to not have an infrastructure. Companies are diseconomic. People are powerful. Technology doesn't control people. It serves people. [I can't believe we're still having this discussion!]"/>
			<outline text="The economics will heave. The last barrier is dropping. Think billions of websites, not hundreds. Lots of writing and lots of new writers. No publishers. "/>
			<outline text="And Exon-willing, a chance for the human race to start listening to itself."/>
			<outline text="***A new kind of PDA"/>
			<outline text="There's an awesome PDA type product that no one seems to be making. One that fits perfectly with the worldwide web. I don't particularly want to browse the web from an airplane or a taxi cab. I *do* want to browse it from my bedroom or living room. I need wireless technology. The same kind of digital connection that's in my AT&amp;T wireless phone. I need an 8.5-by-11 screen. Gotta have color. I need lots of RAM, but do I need a hard disk? Hmmm, don't think so. Give me a base station for my desktop computer. I can use the desktop hard disk and its modem. Now you can read the DaveNet website from any home-oriented venue. The same places you can read a book. Gotta have it!"/>
			<outline text="***A computer for your body"/>
			<outline text="This brings me to a conversation I had with Stu Gannes, stu@btw.com, and John McChesney, jmcchesney@aol.com, at the Monday evening cocktail party at Esther's. They were talking about more ergonomic computer systems when I entered the conversation. This reminded me of a product I wanted to do in 1980, when the Apple ][ was the rage. The product still hasn't been made. And now I need it!"/>
			<outline text="Do your arms ever ache from using a desktop computer? Mine do. How about your back? My back went out a couple of weeks ago. Certainly sitting in front of the computer isn't helping. It probably is the reason my back goes out ever five or six years. Maybe as I get older these problems will get worse? I worry about that."/>
			<outline text="Why do I have to sit erect like this using the computer? Why can't my body weight be better distributed? Why can't my neck be in a healthy relaxed position? Where do I put my feet? My elbows? I've become much more tuned in to this kind of stuff over the last year, I got certified as a massage therapist, and I've been doing lots of bodywork, shiatsu and breathwork, and stuff like that. I'm no expert, but I know we're doing this all wrong!"/>
			<outline text="A slight digression -- after starting all this bodywork stuff last summer -- and then resuming software development -- I learned how software is held together. By the muscles in the developer's neck! My neck is like a brick when my software goes thru a tight corner -- when I'm rebuilding a basic internal API, for example, and thereby totally breaking the software (hopefully temporarily!). Until the software turns its corner, no amount of therapy or breathing can get my neck to relax. When the corner is turned, my neck eases up a bunch."/>
			<outline text="Anyway -- back to the main thread. I'd like to have a computer that lives inside a reclining chair. The video is displayed on a box that takes the place of my TV. The screen is ten to fifteen feet away from my eyes. The chair reclines fully, but is adjustable, so I don't always hold my body and neck in the same position. Control devices? Yeah -- I think I need a keyboard to write. No way around that. "/>
			<outline text="I may not need Page Up and Page Down, but why not have them too? And something like the remote control for my current TV setup. The keyboard should swivel out just like the writing boards on classroom desks do. And since we're thinking about bodies, why not include foot pedals? "/>
			<outline text="Does anyone want to make this chair? "/>
			<outline text="I'd be happy to participate, if only as a beta site!"/>

			<outline text="***My Bet with Jerry"/>
			<outline text="Remember Spiro Agnew? Bias, bias, bias! That was his not-too amusing rant about the press. I expect to hear some of that from the proponents of OpenDoc. But I deny it. I have an OpenMind about OpenDoc. But my mind currently thinks OpenDoc is an open crock, conceived by computer scientists to solve their own problems, to fill their own needs, based on very little true understanding of the world it is being injected into, and it is probably not very open, even if it is very doc."/>
			<outline text="I am stuck with subjectives because I don't have a copy of OpenDoc to look at, no sample apps to try out, no theories to test. Not that I haven't tried to get a copy. I have. I'm a credible developer. The mere fact that I am not flooded with news about OpenDoc is an important subjective. Sure, they must get the impression that I am unfriendly. That never stopped Microsoft. If you've got Truth on your side, your evangelistic efforts never stop. Apple et al seem to have stopped promoting OpenDoc before they've started."/>
			<outline text="OK -- next subjective. I know the guys who are doing OpenDoc. We implemented a lot of their specs in Frontier 3.0, because it is a full Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) client and server. The guys who did AppleScript are the same guys doing OpenDoc. What did I think of their APIs? Inefficient, over-engineered, far too elegant, huge gaping holes, and based on incorrect premises about how developers and script writers work. "/>
			<outline text="The &quot;open&quot; part of OSA is a total joke. To be open, they would have to acknowledge our menu sharing protocol, which has become a defacto standard among scriptable apps, and is unique to the Mac, with no counterpart on Windows. Apple, instead, buries its head in the sand, and makes us sell each developer, on an individual basis, on the wisdom of doing the client side of menu sharing. They blow a lot of smoke about standards, but when the dust settles, &quot;standard&quot; means &quot;comes from a large company.&quot; [And MacWEEK plays right along, still insisting that developers add AppleScript compatibility. How incredibly cynical.]"/>
			<outline text="I see my own experience and ideas in Microsoft's OLE 2.0, all over the place, after having spent a couple of weeks working with Microsoft people in 1992. Microsoft is willing to listen to developers they respect. They don't seem to care much about the size of the company you work for, or at least their top management doesn't. Apple may be able to listen to developers they respect, but I've yet to meet a developer who has their respect. If you know one, please let me know."/>
			<outline text="Actually, ironically, I see my own ideas and experiences reflected in Apple's efforts. But these have always been negative appropriations, not win-win deals. Apple steals my ideas, but then uses those ideas to thwart my efforts to get the platform moving in fun, competitive and productive ways. They play the FUD game to the disadvantage of their users and developers. At least when Microsoft plays FUD, they tend to use what already works, instead of making us all wait. [The platform with the most powerful developers is the most powerful platform.]"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I made a bet with Jerry Michalski, spiff@panix.com, in mid-1994. Jerry will get $100 from me if in 1995, five reviews of OpenDoc parts appear in either MacWEEK or PC WEEK. If four or fewer appear, I get $100. We were trying to come up with a way of measuring the commercial reality of OpenDoc. I think we came up with a good one."/>
			<outline text="My bet is that OpenDoc will be a clunky API, the subject of much negotiation among the partners, a joyless solution for their problems, not ours. It will have little or nothing to do with the world developers and users live and play in, and therefore won't be well-supported anytime soon by serious (or fun!) commercial development. "/>
			<outline text="***Mike Maples"/>
			<outline text="I ran into Mike Maples, one of the top guys at Microsoft, at the Phoenix airport last Wednesday. We were both on our way back to San Francisco after attending Esther's conference. I tried out some of my theories about the relative openness and competitiveness of the Mac platform as compared to Windows 95."/>
			<outline text="It turns out that the 8-character-filename argument works. And so does the story about plug-and-play requiring new hardware. See Positive Energy, 2/3/95. Mike is a very smart guy, and a very biased warrior for Microsoft's cause. I figured that if anyone would be able to rebut these points, Mike would. In the end (sit down before reading this) Mike agreed that there were tradeoffs to both approaches, and that there are longterm advantages that the Mac platform will have over Windows 95."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, it will soon be easier to switch a Macintosh network over to Intel hardware, assuming some group of hardware vendors play by the rules of plug and play. Eight-character file names were probably a real deal-killer for wholesale conversion of Mac networks. When Windows 95 ships, it'll no longer be a barrier. Mac files will convert much more easily, in fact it's conceivable that ex-Mac users will be the most powerful Win95 users."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, next time a Windows versus Macintosh debate comes up, try pointing out the advantages of long file names, and hardware-based plug and play. The argument seems to work. If they say &quot;but Apple is a total mess&quot; (a common argument, used by Maples, of course -- I am paraphrasing tho), respond by saying it doesn't matter any more because if Apple doesn't want to play, you can always go down the street to Radius, or PowerComputing, or..."/>
			<outline text="***Metrowerks"/>
			<outline text="Speaking of warriors, Metrowerks, the original red-meat-eaters from Canada, have announced a deal with General Magic, that finally gives GM a non-empty developer story. It's a good move for Magic, and raises Metrowerks' visibilty substantially. I wrote about both General Magic and Metrowerks in the same piece, The DaveNet Letter, 2/13/95. Maybe both companies are reading DaveNet, and do quick deals, or maybe I just got lucky!"/>
			<outline text="In any case, Metrowerks promises that soon we'll be able to develop Magic Cap apps using their Macintosh-based development system."/>
			<outline text="This is good news for Magic, because Metrowerks has a no-bullshit can-do reputation among Mac developers, and as Michael Miller, mmiller@mail.zd.ziff.com, editor in chief of PC Magazine, points out, they saved Apple's ass in PowerPC Land. Without Metrowerks, he observed, there would have been no way to develop PowerPC native apps for the Mac. He's totally correct. How different Apple's world would be if Metrowerks didn't exist. "/>
			<outline text="Maybe they can make the same difference for General Magic."/>
			<outline text="In the world of Mac developers, getting an endorsement from Metrowerks is like having Goldman Sachs take you public. You're definitely going to get attention. But if there isn't any substance to the story, if the development hurdles to Magic Cap are still insurmountable, it will turn into a negative for the company."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: What about Telescript? There's no mention of script development tools in their press release. Despite my complaints about OSA, my recommendation to GM is that they make Telescript an OSA-compatible interpreter, so Frontier and other Mac-based development environments can be used to develop and present Telescript scripts."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Re my description of a new kind of PDA in my last piece, Doc Searls, searls@batnet.com said: &quot;Find a precursor to this in Zenith Data Systems' new CruisePad. It's profiled in HotWired, under Fetishes, which I surfed to from the hot list at your Website. The guy who fathered it, Alan Soucy at ZDS, is a good guy; but the product is a bit of a stepchild for the company, and I don't think the product's getting much notice.  FWIW, I helped name the product; but my first choice was Z-Cruise.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="As I've said before, I love hanging out with Mark Stahlman, New Media Associates, stahlman@radiomail.net. We always have fun. At Esther's conference, we shared a hugely expensive bottle of wine while I flirted with a gorgeous cocktail waitress with a great smile, while Mark spewed various theories that reminded me of the pontifications of my grandfather. "/>
			<outline text="My grandfather was a wise man, even if towards the end he spewed more than he reasoned. He loved me, and had a passion for living and a basic respect for the truth. He was a teacher. He was also a very angry man, but I suppose that's understandable, given that he was a refugee at least twice in his life."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, Mark is younger than my grandpa. He may be a refugee, I don't know. But he thinks and he puts things together. He has an active and curious mind. The more I talked with him in Phoenix, the more I believed he had pieced together the real story of what's going on as our toothless industry grows new teeth, and prepares to fight another fight, this time with the US government."/>
			<outline text="I asked Mark to write a DaveNet essay about this stuff, and here it is..."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="We're being led off to the slaughter house! These guys want our hides and we're sitting around politely sipping tea and flipping business cards. The &quot;largest legal generation of wealth in the 20th Century&quot; is under attack by some guys who certainly didn't get theirs legally. I had this spooky feeling after Biondi spoke at Agenda that these guys would eat our lunch, but now after Forum, spooky is turning into freaky."/>
			<outline text="What started out as a goofy idea that all the anti-trust seesawing around Microsoft might be something more than meets the eye has blown up bigtime. It all started with that cute little quote about &quot;Microsoft knows how to compete but do they know how to behave?&quot; Behave! Hey, where's the Skinner Box?"/>
			<outline text="It's well known that behavior can be modified if you change someone's environment -- particularly, if it's what they call an &quot;aversive environment.&quot; It also helps to be able to hard-cop/soft-cop someone, switching the rules to soften them up. Keep them guessing. Better yet, have no rules -- which is what this case looks more and more like. Maybe it's time to lighten up and read something funny like good-old Kafka, eh?"/>
			<outline text="See, the problem is that Bill (don't you just love him?) isn't one of them. He's one of us. Yeah, I was a software entreprenuer once too. I first met Bill around 1977 when I negotiated a contract with him for uSoft Basic for a machine I was building for Citibank. Man, was that boy a nerd back then. Hard-core. BD. Before DOS."/>
			<outline text="Now, he's the richest man in America and he doesn't even have a Senator in his pocket. Why, he probably doesn't even have a favorite charity. And, he built his house *underground* too. What's he hiding down there?"/>
			<outline text="That's not good, you know. We can't have independent, undeclared, unneutralized, underground really rich guys running around. Especially if they &quot;lead&quot; an industry that is independent, undeclared and unneutralized like PCs. I'm beginning to think that Gates has got the big boys nervous."/>
			<outline text="And, if Microsoft ever thinks about &quot;caving&quot; (&quot;giving in&quot;, &quot;capitulating&quot;, &quot;throwing them a bone&quot;), my guess is that it will hurt their franchise. Not because the new rules will tie them up, but because they will have kissed the RING. Somehow, Apple isn't the rebel machine anymore. Could it be Microsoft now?"/>
			<outline text="And, that's not all. Like Bob Kavner said at PC Forum, &quot;Hollywood is two worlds, the creative and the production.&quot; Only, he didn't say but knew he should've said &quot;...and the Mafia.&quot;  Entertainment is a &quot;tightly controlled&quot; business everywhere in the world.  Culture *is* &quot;social control. Everyone knows LA is a gang town -- it's just that some wear Armani colors and some wear Timberland."/>
			<outline text="Dave, what's happening to our innocence?  Is this the end? (Yeah, I also saw the Doors live at the Cheetah in LA in 1967 -- way BD.)"/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/20/95; 8:17:40 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The concept of a &quot;socal interface&quot; has been making the rounds in the software industry. The leading product, Microsoft's Bob, has been widely criticized for numerous reasons, mostly technical. But I like Bob! Because it makes an important statement. "/>
			<outline text="Yes, let's try to make computer interfaces light and fun, even humorous. I think it's OK for the computer to have a personality. Or even better, I think it would be great if the computer reflected the better parts of my personality."/>
			<outline text="Looking at my Mac desktop, it reminds me that certain parts of my life are unorganized. My desktop is littered with icons for utilities that I use sometimes, old email messages, various versions of scripts, folders for lots of different projects. And one monster folder called Old Desktop Stuff. I never look in there. Every once in a while, usually when I return from a trip, I select all the icons on my desktop and drag them into that folder. A clean desk! I like it."/>
			<outline text="My Mac desktop can be a claustrophobic view of Dave's World. But inside my mission-critical apps, I see blue sky. Eudora is great. I like Netscape. I like my outliner and C compiler and scripting tools. But when I run out of ideas or enthusiasm for real work, my mainstay, the one that gets my creative juices flowing the best is SimCity from Maxis."/>
			<outline text="SimCity is total eye candy, but it's also mind candy too. It's deep and subtle. Every city teaches you something, allows you to try new tactics. I have my own style. I always make 6-by-6 blocks. I always put stadiums in commercial districts. When my cities grow to a certain size, I drop the taxes on commercial property, and raise them for industrial. "/>
			<outline text="When I look at someone else's cities, they look strange. Just like looking at someone else's spreadsheet, someone else's source code. Someone else's kitchen cabinets. All our cities are different."/>
			<outline text="OK -- SimCity is just a game, right? No! It's much more like a word processor. I create documents in there. I always turn disasters off. Can you imagine a word processor with a Disasters menu? [If you can, it's time to get a new word processor!]"/>
			<outline text="Using SimCity is a lot like programming. Totally visual. A much more substantial virtuality than current pretenders that just draw boxes with drop shadows around traditional language constructs. They're little more than program flowcharters. An outliner makes a much better program editor."/>
			<outline text="A city is just like a program that you constantly revise while it's running. But it has its own momentum. I write programs. There's very little difference between what I do when I'm using my C compiler and when I'm using my city compiler and its runtime environment."/>
			<outline text="So where does this go? Right now SimCity *is* just a game. But what if we took this interface seriously, viewed it as a social interface, just like Bob, and built networking and communication into it? What if there was a way to interconnect my cities with other people's cities? To walk a web of dynamically updating cities.  "/>
			<outline text="How would it work? One person has write permission for each city, everyone else has read permission. New rule: you can link to my city so our economies intermingle. You can apply tariffs to all value that passes thru your links. Not just a social interface. A social economy! I think that's heavy. "/>
			<outline text="You can also drop little notes for the owner of the city you're visiting. Propose a treaty. Plot and scheme. Win-win deals. We hope..."/>
			<outline text="Another peaceful use of the Internet!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I hope Maxis is doing this. I don't know if they are. Last time I checked, about 8 months ago, a Berkeley startup, Optigon, led by one of the SimCity authors, was getting ready to launch an online system for multiple player cities. But their concept was limited to sharing cities, not webbing them. I hope they've been using the time to expand the concept."/>
			<outline text="PPS: HyperCard was probably a social interface, even if it didn't have talking animals. HyperCard was also the precursor to the worldwide web. It's not a color environment, the web is. But the HyperCard programmer had a lot more control over the pixels and the logic. It *was* way ahead of its time, just like everyone was saying. But not the way people thought it was..."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: SimCity is mostly a guy thing, like model trains. Add networking and women might think it's more cute because it allows them to be more smart. "/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: I keep wondering if one of these simulation products could be used to add intelligence (the real human kind, not the artificial kind) to world systems that are operated by computer. Bar room games that add intelligence to trading systems. Or the traffic flow of a real city. There's a broad river of human creativity that isn't currently being harnessed. It's a potentially big idea, but one that's very hard to describe in words."/>
			<outline text="PPPPPS: Apologies to the Wall Street Journal for my comments in a postscript to &quot;Fred Chokes on Cherios.&quot; I definitely crossed the line. Thanks to several friends for pointing this out and arguing with me about this. I got it! I still have lots to learn about this stuff. I appreciate the patience people are showing."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Two Views of OpenDoc&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;3/21/95; 8:37:40 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="On March 13 I ran a piece entitled &quot;The Subjectives of OpenDoc.&quot; I didn't get that much mail on the subjectives, but I did get two interesting contrasting viewpoints, they follow. "/>
			<outline text="I was also was contacted by the OpenDoc product manager and am scheduling a meeting with the developers at Apple. This is a sign of major progress at Apple -- in the past, a missive like that would have gotten me banished at Apple. These days we see a hungrier attitude. Good news for all those who have an investment in the Macintosh. A hungrier, more humble Apple is something we might be able to work with, which is all we have been saying we wanted for umpteen years."/>
			<outline text="I also had an empassioned phone conversation with an anonymous engineer at Apple about my bit about Metrowerks saving Apple's butt in the move to the PowerPC. He said it was unfair that I didn't mention that Apple had produced a set of tools for developing native PowerPC apps. I had two responses -- one emotional, and one factual. "/>
			<outline text="Factually, yes, Apple did produce some tools for creating native apps. But they were for a development environment that's not widely used among commercial developers. If there had been no Metrowerks, we would be shaking our heads about how broken Apple is, that there was no major benefit to buying a PowerPC, because there would be very few commercial apps that were native. "/>
			<outline text="Then he asked if I could imagine how it must feel to have your product so thoroughly ignored (we're now getting into emotional part). I said of course I could imagine that. All Mac developers who have ever had to fit into an Apple strategy understand that one. "/>
			<outline text="While I had him on the phone, I asked one of my current hot questions -- which developers does Apple respect? He thought a little, and said they were forced to respect Microsoft and they were forced to respect Adobe. I asked if there was anyone they respected that they weren't forced to respect? He said Metrowerks. I said yes, I think you do. "/>
			<outline text="These days I get that they respect *me* somewhat at Apple. But it seems like a forced respect. Speaking for myself only, I'd much prefer to be respected for my software accomplishments and support of the platform. My public rants serve as an insurance policy that my viewpoint as a developer will get out there, even if Apple doesn't want it out there. But as always, I'd much rather work with them than in opposition to them."/>
			<outline text="***Leonard Rosenthol"/>
			<outline text="I've known Leonard Rosenthol, leonardr@netcom.com, for many years. The first time I met him was at a MacWorld Expo back in the mid-80s. He had done the outliner in Persuasion, which was a competitor for my MORE product. Leonard is very sure of himself. He lectured me on how to *really* do outlining right. He was very young and bright, I didn't know how young. Ten years later he's 26. Hmmm. He must have been 17 then! Anyway I felt sure that he would play a big role in the Macintosh. I was right about that."/>
			<outline text="These days Leonard hangs his hat at Aladdin Systems, definitely a company that should have Apple's respect. They own the compression standard for the Mac, producing at least 18 different configurations all under the StuffIt brandname. Without StuffIt, the Internet would be half as fast for Macintosh users. Not to mention CompuServe, America OnLine, your local BBS, etc. [I'd love to see a Unix version of StuffIt -- it would make my webwork even faster.]"/>
			<outline text="Aladdin supports everything. And Leonard knows about everything. Leonard knows everyone. A very valuble friend. Whenever I want to know who to talk about something with, I call Leonard."/>
			<outline text="So here are Leonard's comments on &quot;The Subjectives of OpenDoc&quot;:"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Boy are you WAY OFF BASE!  Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed that morning or what?!?!?!?!"/>
			<outline text="I have been working with OpenDoc on and off for a while now, from planning/prototype stages to the current beta and it is LEAPS and BOUNDS above what OLE offers both technologically and from a user standpoint."/>
			<outline text="Let's look at the user experience first -- what kinds of things will users be able to do with OpenDoc that they couldn't with OLE.  Here are a few that come to mind:"/>
			<outline text="o live parts -- in OpenDoc you can have a part whose contents are live, updating without user intervention) such as a clock or more usefully something like a stock ticker-tape."/>
			<outline text="o non-rectangular parts -- in OpenDoc your parts can assume any shape so that their isn't any &quot;white space&quot; around your content. This is most obviously important for something like a graphic which is embedded in your document and you want the text to flow properly around it."/>
			<outline text="o transforms -- this allows you to perform an operation (rotate, scale, skew) on an embedded part without that part having the ability to do it itself."/>
			<outline text="Now for some technical things:"/>
			<outline text="o NO PATCHES!!!!!!!!! OpenDoc is &quot;application code&quot;, it does not patch the OS in any way! OLE on the other hand gets its hands REALLY DEEP into certain parts of the MacOS to make it work like Windows. :("/>
			<outline text="o Clean layered API -- OLE is (IMHO) too message based while OpenDoc is more procedural."/>
			<outline text="The only advantage that OLE has going for it is technical and that is that it is easier to take an existing app and make it support OLE than OpenDoc."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="I love this guy!"/>
			<outline text="The second, less passionate viewpoint is from another longtime friend, Amy Wohl, 499-0884@mcimail.com. Amy has appeared on DaveNet several times, so I assume she needs no intro..."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Dave, the real killer for OpenDoc will be that if it can't have a presence before Windows 95 ships (and with the new delays, I'm betting that it won't), it will simply be ignored by developers with other things on their mind.  By the time the smoke clears, the game will be over and OpenDoc will simply never have happened.  You can't miss your (time) window and still make the market."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Amy!"/>
			<outline text="I expect to put another day into my OpenDoc thinking sometime in the next few weeks. I'll report back when that happens."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Other positive signs"/>
			<outline text="There are other signs that Apple is opening up. I wrote a quick email to Shirley Stas, stas@applelink.apple.com, Apple's manager of developer relations, asking if we could add Frontier to Apple's website covering Macintosh scripting languages. Very quickly and efficiently (and respectfully) it happened! "/>
			<outline text="So a small part of the world is right. We have our positioning statement right next to AppleScript's. Interested script writers now have a balanced way to make a choice. You can see that they're very different kinds of products. Thank you Shirley!"/>

I'm always connected to the net. Reallllly nice. Also, I have a fixed IP address, and a new domain name, scripting.com. We're going to move userland.com real soon now, and set up some servers, so our email act will get even better real soon. Dig we must!"/>
			<outline text="Also, I apologize that the website hasn't been staying current.

In that exchange, I realized that a website, as I'm imagining things developing, isn't like a magazine or a newspaper. It's like a front porch. Decorated with all the things you like, things that say something positive about you. And unlike real-world front porches, my porch will point to my friend's porches. Walk a web of mutual friends. Those will be the Billions of Websites, IMHO."/>
			<outline text="Will these billions of sites be art? Yes and no."/>
			<outline text="In the broad sense, they will definitely be art, in the same way that the world itself is a work of art. Is the collection of all the photographs taken on a single day by random people art? Yes. Is each individual photograph a work of art? I think so!"/>
			<outline text="But there's also great art, highly expressive stuff, which influences a lot of other practitioners. There are all levels of art. Every photograph, and every front porch that attempts to say something, attempts to influence you, is art."/>

			<outline text="It was a *physical* sound, you could feel it. My desktop flickered off, back on, and then off. The room became very quiet as the fans in all my hard disks and printers shut down. "/>
			<outline text="Life in the woods! Man. I took a walk outside to see if anything obvious had broken. The house is OK. The creek is OK. The garden is OK. But... my big crooked pine tree had fallen. It blocked the street! Power lines down. Smoke rising from the woods on the other side of the street. Fire!"/>
			<outline text="I saw my neighbors yesterday... And policemen, firemen, reps from PG&amp;E and Western Cable Systems. The city engineer. I learned a lot. They sent out smart people, engineers (like me!) but skilled in getting a real city (not a Sim one) back up when disaster strikes (and there's no Disasters menu in real life -- can't turn 'em off). I ended up paying for the removal of the tree, but it wasn't as expensive as I thought it might be. I'd do it again!"/>
			<outline text="I'll miss that big old tree. Huge birds perched in it, sometimes whole flocks of them during migrations. It was a bent and brown tree, but very tall. Its roots didn't go that deep, it turns out. Not deep enough to withstand the flood of water that was undermining its roots. The winter of 1995 is a deluge. "/>
			<outline text="Will those huge birds miss the tree as much as I will? Who knows. Life goes on. As Prince says, life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last. Let's have fun!"/>

			<outline text="***Waiters on the Web"/>
			<outline text="I'm browsing the web a lot more now that I have a faster and always-open net pipe. There are some wonderful new websites out there. The most impressive one I've seen in the last few days is the Waiters on Wheels site, http://www.sunnyside.com/wow. It's a comprehensive listing of the menus for restaurants that deliver, in seven western cities. You can order food over the net! Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="Marc Canter is going to love this. [I think it's cool. But they don't deliver to my house-site, even if I can get to their web-site. Grrrr.]"/>
			<outline text="I followed the link to the folks who created this site, Sunnyside Computing, www.sunnyside.com. Check it out! They're smart. Good people. and they're in Palo Alto, right in the neighborhood. Hope to meet these guys someday."/>
			<outline text="My impression of all that I've seen in the last few days -- if you're thinking about getting onto the web someday, today's the day! The growth is awesome. It's all happening even faster than I thought it would. There are huge lessons here for technology investors. All your resources should be directed at participating in the growth of networking. All of them. Stop thinking about distributing software via shrinkwrap. That distribution system is about to end. Think in terms of integrating your software with the web. Lots of possibilities."/>

			<outline text="***Outlines on and around the Web"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to add outlining to the web."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="My qualification -- I've written five outliners, the first commercial one, ThinkTank, shipped in 1983. I've got a new outliner on my hard disk, written originally as part of Frontier but made much prettier thru the use of color, graphics and icons. "/>
			<outline text="And it's much more open -- it's designed to plug into all kinds of data, coming from databases, the file system, the net, actually anywhere. Why make it so open? I wanted to make my fifth outliner my last one. [Good luck! I can already see ways to improve it.]"/>
			<outline text="OK -- so much for the technology. How do I want to deploy it? I have an answer. I want to marry it to a web browser. There are three ways I want to connect them."/>
			<outline text="First, I want to replace the Bookmarks menu with an outline that I can search and easily re-organize. Put the cursor on a line, press Enter and boom -- the browser takes me there. I want a command in the outliner to copy a reference to the current page into the outline. Add a few new wires to the browser and we can do it. Right now. "/>
			<outline text="The second connection is to use the outliner to display indented lists. HTML already has enough tags to support an outliner. It's pretty similar to the way all my outliners have stored hierarchies in text files. It's totally trivial to transform an HTML outline into expandable and collapsable outlines. If you want to see what one of these outlines looks like, check out the masthead for the UserLand site, http://www.hotwired.com/userland/masthead.html. "/>
			<outline text="The third connection is to use my outliner as a web authoring tool. That part is already working. The UserLand masthead page was developed using the outliner. A little script parses the outline, turns it into HTML and uploads it to the server. I can iterate quickly over the outline. If you want a copy of the script, and have Frontier, let me know."/>
			<outline text="We need to work with at least one browser developer to make this happen. Preferably more than one. The Bookmarks feature has the most immediate bang, and is the easiest to deploy, the need is the greatest. "/>
			<outline text="If you make a web browser, or know someone who does, please ask them to send me email if there's interest..."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I got a lot of mail on my comments about SimCity being a guy thing. I never want to impose limits on anyone. Women who love SimCity are grrreat! I actually like a little nerdiness in my women friends. Maybe even a lot... When I said that networking makes women smarter, I meant smarter than men. I believe women are the networkers of our species. Men do other things well. There are always exceptions. I'm a pretty good networker. I'm a man. Not a big deal. IMHO."/>
			<outline text="PPS: If the much-rumored CyberDog from Apple is an OpenDoc container in a web browser, it would be, by far, the best selling device for OpenDoc. That would get me much more interested in OpenDoc. Probably a bunch of other developers too. Of course I could be dreaming -- CyberDog might be something else! [If so: never mind...] If it is, as Dr. Strangelove asked -- why keep it a secret?"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: The UserLand website is ready to be promoted. It's safe for other sites to point into it. It'd be great to get a Cool Site of the Day reference. If you have any ideas of sites that should point to DaveNet or Frontier, please let me know and I'll check 'em out and send the sysop some information about our site."/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: Mama mia! You gotta checka out http://www.eat.com. A quote: &quot;If you're using a laptop, show some respect. Put it on a table. This is my kitchen, not some crazy picnic, OK?&quot;"/>

			<outline text="***WOMEN'S WEBSITES"/>
			<outline text="Every new website begets more websites. If I have one, I want my friend to have one, so I can point to it. And so they can point to my site. Someday I'll be able to walk a network of friendships, automatically knowing that each of us has mutual friends. It'll be cool. [Billions of Websites, 2/18/95.]"/>
			<outline text="Eventually, the online world will be managed by women. The role of men, as usual, will be to make it safe for women to create and run our civilization. We'll bring them technology. The information superhighway won't be a cave. It'll be a home. I know this is wildly optimistic. Reality will probably be something less than this. But the unmistakable women's touch, even in a post-feminist age, will make logging on more like coming home. [Random Breathless Stuff, 11/5/94.]"/>
			<outline text="A website isn't like a magazine or a newspaper. It's like a front porch. Decorated with all the things you like, things that say something positive about you. And unlike real-world front porches, my porch will point to my friend's porches. Walk a web of mutual friends. Those will be the Billions of Websites, IMHO. [Two Views of OpenDoc, 3/21/95.]"/>

			<outline text="***MAJOR ONLINE SERVICES WEBSITES"/>
			<outline text="I went looking for the websites of the major online services. Here's what I found."/>
			<outline text="o &lt;!--#link (&quot;www.aol.com&quot;, &quot;America OnLine&quot;)--&gt; doesn't have one. [The services are listed in alphabetic order.]"/>
			<outline text="o &lt;!--#link (&quot;www.compuserve.com&quot;, &quot;CompuServe&quot;)--&gt; has a very competent presence. There's a lot of information on the company, their online system, how it currently works with the Internet, where they're headed. You can find out all about the Spry acquisition. I didn't read the whole site, but I got the feeling that it's all there, and they have a Dig We Must attitude."/>
			<outline text="o &lt;!--#link (&quot;www.delphi.com&quot;, &quot;Delphi&quot;)--&gt; is aggressive. Owned by Rupert Murdoch; you can see the connection to the Fox network, which he also owns. They talk about the new fX cable network, they have the whole schedule on the website. I wish all the networks did this... Interesting site."/>
			<outline text="o &lt;!--#link (&quot;www.eworld.com&quot;, &quot;eWorld&quot;)--&gt; wins the DaveNet award for creative sysopping. It's a very attractive website. And they do something that I think all the online services should do -- scout their message boards for great essays and accumulate them for display on the web. A win-win. The writers on eWorld compete for presence at the website. It's a badge they can wear. It encourages better writing, making eWorld a richer online system. Systematic excellence. Cool!"/>
			<outline text="o &lt;!--#link (&quot;www.microsoft.com&quot;, &quot;Microsoft&quot;)--&gt; has a very nerdy look and dry presence. And there are wierd characters on their home page! I found this really interesting. Do they understand that people who use Macintoshes might show up at www.microsoft.com?"/>
			<outline text="o &lt;!--#link (&quot;www.prodigy.com&quot;, &quot;Prodigy&quot;)--&gt; doesn't have a website."/>

			<outline text="***MACWEEK EDITORIAL"/>
			<outline text="Check out this week's MacWEEK (3/27/95) for a great editorial on Apple's strategic options. They say &quot;Apple can do something immediately to bring back developers and kick start its market share gains much faster. The company should abandon key markets it has mysteriously entered with derivative, &quot;me-too&quot; products... Apple must focus on what it does best: supply the best computer, operating system and infrastructure and let third parties fill in the blanks. Whatever piddling revenue Apple derives from its lackluster success in areas such as e-mail, scripting and network hardware cannot possibly make up for the damage it does to developers who can build better products and service customers more efficiently than Apple's technocracy.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="This echoes the sentiments of my Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom piece, 11/26/94, where I said: &quot;Apple should stop looking inward for the answer. Do your software shopping in the developer world. You get there sooner and it costs less. When you shut down developers, you're cutting off the life support system for users. Today's Mac market is bigger than the DOS market was back in the mid-80s. If the economics were tweaked, if Apple got out of the way, the market would be creating millionaires again.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I know about email and scripting. If Apple admitted that it isn't able to serve all the needs of all emailers and script writers; created blue sky for developers -- we'd be able to raise money, run ads, staff up, and really develop the potential of the Macintosh platform. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Heard on KFOG -- faxes represent 40 percent of all business phone costs. It seems there's an opportunity to bust that down to 10 percent with some new networking technology. Faxes represent a very inefficient use of phone lines when there are computers nearby on both ends of the transmission. A few new wires and a couple of new boxes could save a business huge amounts of money. Maybe some new standards are needed? Maybe Delrina can do something here?"/>
			<outline text="PPS: A couple of essays ago I talked about a webbed version of SimCity. An extroverted SimCity would be great. But an introversion would be great too. Imagine double-clicking on a hospital to enter the SimCity hospital simulator. It would be unreal. Or maybe *very* real!"/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="PPPS: The new version of Netscape, version 1.1, has support for tables. Tables are popping up all over the place. But we don't have a table editor. Tables are a bitch to create by hand. I did one just to see how it works. If you have the source code for a competent table designer/editor on the shelf, dust it off, make it create HTML output. You'll find an instant market. "/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: My masthead page has a list of friends who have their own websites. Today the list is small, but I hope it gets bigger. If you have your own website, send me a pointer and I'll add it to my masthead. Let's pioneer a new form of social behavior!"/>

			<outline text="Czechoslavakian convent sisters talking. Chicago's going to be late. Can't wait to surf the net. The sister's beeper goes off. We laugh. It's funny!"/>
			<outline text="What does funny mean? Look it up in the dictionary -- &quot;anything that excites laughter or mirth.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I'd add that, when we laugh, I think we're really saying &quot;ain't it the truth!&quot; The louder we laugh, the closer to our heart the truth is. "/>
			<outline text="That's why Rodney Dangerfield's self-deprecating humor is so effective. We aren't really laughing at Rodney, we're really laughing at the little bit of Rodney that lives inside all of us. We all know someone like Rodney -- it's you and it's me! [I wonder if Rodney knows Aretha?]"/>
			<outline text="Humor is creativity applied to clever ways of saying things that are true. It makes sense to use humor in advertising, because it adds a aura of truth to what you're saying. IBM says their system is worth your support. They say it in a humorous way. We remember, and if they say it often enough, our barriers come down, and we're more likely to do what they want us to do. All because they made us laugh."/>
			<outline text="But, there's a problem. The sisters are from Czechoslavakia. So instead of saying &quot;Warp,&quot; they say &quot;Vaurrrrp.&quot; (Roll the r's.) So now, when I read about OS/2 in InfoWorld, I always laugh when I see the name of their product. I pronounce it the Czech way. Maybe that wasn't what they were hoping for at IBM? "/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm."/>
			<outline text="Please don't confuse Warp with Warf, the Klingon warrior of Star Trek. Warf says to a settler (who later turns out to be an alien) &quot;That showed gall.&quot; The settler apologizes. Evil grin on Warf's face. &quot;You don't understand. I admire gall.&quot;  "/>

			<outline text="I played matchmaker in the last few days..."/>
			<outline text="The happy couple is Claris's FileMaker and QualComm's Eudora. The result is a real database for email addresses. The glue that connects it all is a set of scripts. "/>
			<outline text="I got the idea from reading a MacWEEK piece on Claris's acquisition of an email program from Fog City Software. The product will include a database for email addresses. I thought -- how silly -- Claris already has the leading easy-to-use database for the Macintosh. Why not use FileMaker to store the list of mail addresses? So I converted my DaveNet scripts to run off a database of email addresses stored in FileMaker."/>
			<outline text="I mentioned this to my buddy Dave Jacobs, bigdave@wired.com. He suggested that I write a script to scan the Eudora inbox periodically, so that if I've ever received a bit of email from you, I'll know that your address is in my database. Easy to do, Big Dave."/>
			<outline text="In the next few days, I'm going to use my new proficiency at web writing, thanks to my new ISDN connection, to put together a release. If you use Eudora and have FileMaker, I think this'll be a must-have. It'll be freely downloadable, a social and technologic experiment. Hope you'll try it out."/>
			<outline text="[Coming soon -- Steve Michel, michel@netcom.com, is working on an outline editor for Netscape's Bookmarks menu, built in Frontier. It's hierarchic, of course, and completely aces the built-in editor that Netscape provides.]"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***A mysterious word"/>
			<outline text="I looked up &quot;standard&quot; in the dictionary. There are eleven different definitions. The one that most closely matches the way the word is used in the software industry -- &quot;a piece of popular music that continues to be included in the repertoire of many singers, bands, etc. through the years.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="There are a lot of key words in that definition. &quot;Included&quot; is totally key. Nothing can be a standard if it isn't included. And of course singers and bands are really software developers and competitors."/>
			<outline text="An example, Symantec's THINK C used to be the standard in the Macintosh development world. It was always included. If you produced a toolkit for Mac developers, you couldn't go wrong by shipping it in THINK C format. No one would complain. Now the standard is Metrowerks. So just because something was once a standard doesn't mean that it will always be so."/>
			<outline text="For many reasons, Eudora is a standard. Maybe that'll be a subject of a future DaveNet piece. It's a very big product. It covers more ground than any one person can fully appreciate. [Its scriptability is second to none, it's totally open, and that makes great things possible. In addition to being a great emailer, it's also an email platform. Key point.] "/>
			<outline text="But you never hear QualComm use the S-word to describe their product. It would be un-humble to do so. Humility is great, especially when it comes from standard-setters. Eudora is almost invisible, you never read about it in consortium press releases. The sign of a true standard. No need to beat their breasts!"/>
			<outline text="Contrast that to Netscape, who is trying to take control of the HTML standard. The ground they're exploring now is outside the safety of standards. They have to make it look like they're a standard-setting organization and not a commercial software company. But their product is nowhere near as rich as Eudora, or even close to being as open."/>
			<outline text="Too often, technology vendors self-proclaim their proposals as standards. But they are misleading everyone, including themselves. Implicit in the concept is consensus. We all have a say in what makes something a standard. It isn't something you can dictate. "/>
			<outline text="Size of the company is rarely important. Maybe it's inversely important! The most vibrant and interesting standards have always come from nowhere. Perhaps this is because incubating standards can enjoy the quiet, perhaps they grow better and more healthily outside the mostly irrelevent politics that infect all large organizations. "/>
			<outline text="Standards are very important in the software world. That's what's driving the growth of the Internet. All that's happening on the net now, was technologically possible many years ago. "/>
			<outline text="We weren't waiting for software, we were waiting for standards."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: Very funny line from an old Elvis Costello song: &quot;I wish you luck with a capital F.&quot; That's funny! It reflects old unprocessed, unreleased anger we all carry around with us."/>
			<outline text="PPS: Standard is an important word. So is &quot;open.&quot; I'm putting this on my to-do list for a future DaveNet piece. Share your ideas -- what does open mean to you?"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Watch out for press releases that use the word &quot;legacy.&quot; When a company is trying to quickly establish a standard using shortcuts, by cutting corners, they position what came before them as their legacy. How inconvenient that there are already solutions to their problem! How arrogant and disrespectful to use such a negative word. What goes around comes around... [You can't hurry love!]"/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: America OnLine apparently has a website, but I haven't been able to get thru. Its address is www.blue.aol.com. So does Prodigy, at www.astranet.com. Why Astranet?

By 7AM the piece is ready to roll. Run the scripts, update the website. After a walk, begin a day of work at about 9AM."/>

And when the morning light comes streaming in, you get up, and do it again."/>
			<outline text="There's something very tender about this song. But I can hardly relate, it simply isn't my lifestyle, my commute is less than 50 feet!

			<outline text="***Miles of booths"/>
			<outline text="Last year's InternetWorld was a funny show. The booths filled a little corner of the San Jose Convention Center. It was a tiny show. For every booth there were five venture capitalists with their checkbooks out. All kinds of oldtimers like me and Resse Jones, that kind of entrepreneur, wandering around trying to figure out if this was an opportunity to get creative again."/>
			<outline text="I was marveling back then at how nice it was to have a tradeshow with no Microsoft booth and no Apple booth. Well forget it! They're here. And they're pissed. Fun!"/>
			<outline text="Sure, there are some new faces. At this show CompuServe and America OnLine have hot booths. And lots of Mom and Pop booths with hopes of striking it big, being the next Booklink or Spry. People ask if this is like MacWorld in the early years. It's not. That was a slow growth show. When it boomed it was different."/>
			<outline text="OK -- let's talk about Apple and Microsoft. They're shooting at different targets, they appear to view the net as very different kinds of opportunities. Microsoft shows how they've integrated their web browser into the Windows 95 desktop. URLs are just like file paths. They plugged them in seamlessly. Very nice!"/>
			<outline text="Apple is showing that the Mac is a great net server. They are an OEM for Chuck Shotton, author of MacHTTP. [Chuck made a deal with StarNine, and got some great bright yellow t-shirts and a new product name, and presumably got more time to focus on programming.]"/>
			<outline text="The new server products that Apple announced are interesting because for the first time, Apple is licensing system software from a developer. Microsoft may sniff (they do!) but they should be paying attention. WebStar, the centerpiece of Apple's server strategy, wasn't written at Apple. Therefore Apple gets to hit a market window. Apple got pragmatic. Yahoo!"/>
			<outline text="I ran into a mid-level Microsoft exec on the InternetWorld floor, a friend for many years. I asked what he thought of the new Apple stuff. He said it was just a bunch of shareware on a CD. He didn't say the software doesn't work. He just said it was shareware. OK. And he said it with real Microsoft zeal. Big grin. Gotta love it."/>
			<outline text="As I walked away from this little discussion, I said to my buddy Brian Zisk,  &quot;The thing that keeps Microsoft people healthy is that they release all their anger.&quot; Yup."/>
			<outline text="So what about Apple, what do they release? Yeah sure, it's shareware. And it works. But it's the wrong move man!"/>
			<outline text="By some measures (I've said this before) the Mac has a greater presence on the net than Windows does. That's greater than 50 percent market share. But not as a server, as a client. Microsoft gets this and they're investing in streamlining Windows as a net client. Good move. They're catching the leading edge. Cool, for them, and cool for Windows users."/>
			<outline text="Apple says they have a client strategy, but I don't buy it. They're preparing to blow past the leading edge with CyberDog, which everyone knows is a web browser and much more, based on OpenDoc. In a meeting with Apple people at the show I asked what CyberDog was. They refused to say. I found this irritating. I think the Microsoft people know what it is. I asked another Microsoft friend. Sure, we know. Big deal. He said, not me. (He was beings sarcastic.)"/>
			<outline text="Blowing past the leading edge is a mistake! Catch it, move it, own a piece of it. That's how you play the technology game. It's amazing how synergistic competition can be. "/>
			<outline text="Let me tell you a story..."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Catching the edge"/>
			<outline text="In skiing you never want to catch your edges. But in technology you always want to. Find the edge. Put a product on it. Let the wave make it grow. Upgrade. Play the FUD game. Upgrade again. Cash out. Do it again. That's my model at least... When it's worked for me, that's how it worked."/>
			<outline text="You can ship the greatest software in the world, but if you miss the edge (aha!) you lose. I've learned this from personal experience. I shipped ThinkTank for the Apple II in 1983, long past the growth boom for Apple II software. I came closer with ThinkTank for the IBM PC in 1984, I was only a year late. Also in 1984, I shipped a Mac product. Too early. In 1985 I shipped a TSR app, almost caught the wave, sold an enormous amount of software, but the product died under heavy pressure from the winner -- Borland's Sidekick. It didn't leave much room for other products."/>
			<outline text="I hit the edge exactly once in my career. In 1986 I had a lot of cool Mac software ready to go, just as the Mac was booming and the PC software market was atrophying (is that a word?). It's the nicest feeling in technology. Watching your product become a standard. My product. That's R E S P E C T. [Catching the edge is addictive -- I want to do it again!]"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, Apple is actually on the edge, but I don't think they get it. The Mac is, today, the best client for the Internet. And it's winning. The tools are great. The opportunities for modularity are incredible. But Apple is trying to hit a home run, trying to blow past everyone, including their developers. Fuck that! That's not what it's about. It won't work."/>
			<outline text="In this world, things are evolving so fast, my ideas are showing up in other people's software, their ideas are showing up in mine. It's actually OK. I was over at the AOL booth, talking with my buddy Bill Hawkins, getting a demo of their new web browser. Oops. There's one of my ideas! But it's OK. Now I can get Netscape to pay attention to what we're doing. Or we'll give AOL a way to launch their Mac client and kick Netscape's butt. I love it because I win either way. Yes!"/>
			<outline text="So the edge is moving fast. What was a hot new idea just three months ago is now an expected feature. The world won't wait. The rush is on. Forget about home runs. Just get on base. Home runs will happen by accident. No head trips. Play the game."/>
			<outline text="Apple is swinging for the fences. Their world is zigging and Apple is zagging. Yes, Chuck Shotton is a sweet guy. It's nice for Apple to have a credible server strategy. But let's work on the client strategy. A few simple tweaks and we've got it made, again. Is Dan Eilers ready for rock and roll? Is Dave Nagel? What about Spindler? I'll let you know..."/>

			<outline text="***DaveNet at WWDC"/>
			<outline text="I've been invited to speak at Apple's WorldWide Developer's Conference. They want me on a panel that comments on OpenDoc. "/>
			<outline text="But I'd much rather be an evening speaker, and get to talk about the web and online stuff and the role that Macintosh can play in it. To focus people on technology that's shipping now, and keep future stuff in the future. I'd like to see developers wire up their apps with Apple Events to achieve integration that has immediate competitive value. I'd like to lead a discussion that gets to the heart of what developers are thinking about. And I want to learn."/>
			<outline text="I'm not sure if Apple realllly wants me to talk about OpenDoc, because I'm probably going to say that it's not a great investment for Macintosh developers, at least not right now."/>

			<outline text="A famous venture capitalist showed up unexpectedly at my office just before dinnertime, we talked for a bit. I got flamed on Apple's behalf. Well maybe the VCs aren't quite ready to invest in Mac-related development, even if the Mac is participating in the booming worldwide web software business. 'Tis a shame because there's so much upside here. I heard a lot of vented anger, and I paid attention, and agreed not to name my source. My VC friend said &quot;I really think this time Apple is going to go away.&quot; I gulped! I said I thought there would be a lot more creativity flowing into the Mac business. The more dominant Microsoft gets, the more interesting the Mac platform is going to get, I argued. He didn't go for it."/>

			<outline text="***Email with Ike Nassi"/>
			<outline text="First, I got a reply from Dan Eilers, eilers@applelink.apple.com, the new marketing czar at Apple, who I've known for many years, saying yes -- he's ready to have some fun. I'm going to try to work with Dan. I think he remembers how to do win-win deals."/>
			<outline text="I also had an email exchange with Ike Nassi, nassi@apple.com, Apple's VP of System Software Technology. He works for Dave Nagel. "/>
			<outline text="Here's how the exchange went."/>
			<outline text="I said (in yesterday's essay): &quot;Apple says they have a client strategy, but I don't buy it. They're preparing to blow past the leading edge with CyberDog, which everyone knows is a web browser and much more, based on OpenDoc. In a meeting with Apple people at the show I asked what CyberDog was. They refused to say. I found this irritating. Blowing past the leading edge is a mistake! Catch it, move it, own a piece of it. That's how you play the technology game. It's amazing how synergistic competition can be.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Nassi said: &quot;Not sure you're reading this right. Of course we want to build the best products we absolutely can build. Who doesn't? In a nutshell, acessing the 'net today means dealing with a bunch of apps. OpenDoc is a way of integrating software components, hence OpenDoc and the Internet is a natural. Cyberdog takes a lot of the good ideas out there and *integrates* them. Sure we're building software for it from scratch, but only as we need to for purposes of seamless integration.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I said: &quot;Re building great products --  At what cost? Missing the market? Netscape is doing it now. An ounce of extra power in today's Netscape is worth a ton of new features in CyberDog. There's so much more you can do on today's Mac, but you're letting Netscape define the Mac as just another client machine. They aren't taking advantage of the unique power of the Macintosh. CyberDog may be a great idea and a great implementation. But when a great idea misses the edge, it's wasted. I think you'll see that 1995 was like 1990, a year Apple could have challenged Microsoft, but chose to look inward for the answers instead.&quot;"/>

			<outline text="***A bunch of apps"/>
			<outline text="Re &quot;acessing the 'net today means dealing with a bunch of apps.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Apps! What's wrong with a bunch of apps? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. [No, I won't say it again!]"/>
			<outline text="This makes me so angry! This is a new strategy. What happened to the old one, the one that said apps would wire up to Apple Events and be integrated thru scripting? If you were paying attention in the early 90s, this was Apple's mantra. Surprise, it worked. In the Internet space, now, that &quot;bunch of apps&quot; are all wired up and scriptable. We won. It's harvest time. "/>
			<outline text="What does Apple do? FUD their own developers. Heeeere we go again! "/>
			<outline text="Remember Hypercard. Remember Taligent. Remember ScriptX. Remember Newton. Oh it's so boring! When something starts working, like System 7 or Macromind Director, even the Mac itself, what does Apple do -- declares it obsolete and invents something new."/>
			<outline text="They focus the spotlight on the wrong thing, the journalists look there, and miss what's really going on. They point their light where they think the leading edge is going to be five years ahead. "/>
			<outline text="Apple's technology strategy is academic, not opportunistic. They invent stuff, then fail to commercialize it. "/>
			<outline text="We get great disertations, but the markets don't happen, and the developers go away, either thru attrition, or thru navigation. "/>
			<outline text="To be totally clear: the edge, right now, is Netscape and Eudora, not OpenDoc. Don't begrudge them their position. Let's work with them. "/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: DaveNet is made possible by scriptable Internet apps. So are the new servers Apple is shipping. This is very important technology because it is being successfully deployed right now in imaginative and enabling ways. There's a lot of latent power here that Apple is trying to blow by."/>
			<outline text="PPS: And the market share head trip refuses to go away. It's all over the trade weeklies, in the page 1 reports on Apple's reorg last week. Instead of market share, let's focus on profitable growth in the app base. It's an easy problem to solve. "/>

			<outline text="***In Favor of CyberDog"/>
			<outline text="The unannounced but very visible CyberDog inspired Gary Pearce, gary@bilpin.co.uk, a longtime UK Mac developer and longtime email friend, to write:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;CyberDog is the most open product Apple will have ever shipped. It will probably be one of the biggest adverts for OpenDoc because it will be the only useful shipping app on day one."/>
			<outline text="&quot;This will be the app to which you will be able to add things. Sure they will ship it as a full set of working parts. They have to do that. The real opportunity for third parties will be the provision of replacement parts that really work, or that add functionality."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The analogy I would draw is cars. Ford couldn't ship a car that wasn't complete, but third parties can supply replacement engine parts, superchargers, turbochargers etc. Others can supply better tyres, wheels, trim or seats. And hey, after a while Ford wises up and notes that everyone is fitting Shelby bits. They cut a deal with Shelby and do the Shelby Mustang or whatever."/>
			<outline text="&quot;That is what will happen with CyberDog. It's the win-win deal you are looking for. Especially as the version they will probably ship might have wheels but maybe not tyres. They will ship CyberPup, third parties will provide the pieces to make it a fully fledged dog. "/>
			<outline text="My 10 pence worth. I would try and get a bit closer to this one if I were you.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Software costs money"/>
			<outline text="Gary, first, I don't dispute the need to ship CyberDog with a set of sample parts. If I were doing it I'd do the same. Totally reasonable. Not controversial. But..."/>
			<outline text="No matter how smart the technology is, you can't develop software without money. I already have a lot of my own riding on Apple-promoted standards. I haven't gotten a return on that investment yet. I'm determined to not invest any more of my own money in that direction (time is another story). Maybe I'm being too cautious, but I figure if I can't find partners for a project, I'm going to invest in other directions where I *can* find co-investors."/>
			<outline text="Instead of me watching Apple more closely, they should be paying more attention to what I've been saying, and act. I'm out there, doing exactly the kind of development they should want. "/>
			<outline text="Basic fact of the universe: software costs money. "/>
			<outline text="You can't make software just from inspiration. It requires people, who deserve to be paid, they actually insist on it. And money simply isn't flowing into Apple-promoted standards anymore."/>
			<outline text="Even so, CyberDog sounds cool! If the economics were right, I'd probably be interested. If they got me to invest in that direction I'd probably be totally shameless in promoting it. But I won't invest without other investors. "/>
			<outline text="To be a total broken wheel -- if Apple is serious about OpenDoc, they should tweak the economics of the platform, visibly withdraw from markets they can't cover, invest in a few developers (so they lose too if they blow it) and maybe the money will come back.

			<outline text="I wonder what that opinion is based on? I've heard a half-dozen Microsoft guys talk very intelligently about operating systems. Brad Silverberg, Nathan Myrrhvold, Bob Frankston, Bill Gates, Roger Heinen, Dave Cutler, Jim Allchin, even Mike Maples. I think I left a few people out. At least one of those guys is the ultimate software industry carnivore. "/>

			<outline text="Nicholoas Petreley is leading the parade. Check out &quot;Poultry in Motion,&quot; page 108 in the 4/17/95 Infoworld. Who is the poultry? Microsoft. What kind of poultry? Chicken! What's the egg? Windows 95. [Or maybe it's a turkey? Hmmm.]"/>

			<outline text="If I ever get my own talkshow, I hope Jerry Kaplan, jkaplan@aol.com, will be a guest. "/>
			<outline text="Jerry is the founder and CEO of GO Corporation, one of the high-fliers of of high-tech in the late 80s and early 90s. Jerry's new book, &quot;Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure,&quot; is his personal story of the company. It's now beginning to appear in bookstores. I read it in March at Esther Dyson's conference. It was quite an experience, having the author of a book immediately accessible while I was reading it. Cool! "/>
			<outline text="I really enjoyed this book. Jerry has great insight into the machinations of Silicon Valley, how it works, and how it doesn't. "/>
			<outline text="Here's an excerpt from Chapter 14, entitled &quot;The Showdown.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="WHEN I WAS FIVE, my parents got a portable television set for my bedroom. At first I was afraid to get dressed in front of it, for fear that the people on the screen could see me, just as I could see them. I knew that the gray, blurry pictures were merely signals magically sent through the air, but I didn't understand which qualities of living human beings carried over to the new machine. Like the rest of my generation, I was captivated by this limitless window on the world, and what I saw seemed as real to me as my own two hands."/>
			<outline text="Through the power of television, I knew that lions were large, proud creatures that roared and lived in Africa. But one day my father took me to see the big cats at the Bronx Zoo. I could barely relate the coarse, smelly creatures in front of me - lying docile and panting in their cages while flies buzzed around their heads - to what I had witnessed from the comfort of my bedroom. The TV images just didn't capture the real experience."/>
			<outline text="Sitting in the briefing rooms of AT&amp;T thirty-five years later, watching staffers project spreadsheets, graphs, and slides from their portable computers onto the large screen monitors, I realized that computers mislead managers just as television misleads kids. Fed a steady diet of numbers and charts from the comfort of their conference room chairs, senior executives experience only a desiccated version of the powerful forces that shape and grow their organizations. Mistaking these two-dimensional reflections for reality, they shadowbox their way through complex decisions, unwittingly jostled in one direction or another by self-interested emissaries, who can spin a tale of threat and opportunity as skillfully as any Hollywood screenwriter."/>
			<outline text="In these rooms, individuals are stripped of their unique skills and reduced to chits, then shifted from one column to another. Complex working relationships, knitted together over time like trees intertwining their limbs, become statistical learning curves. Loyalty and trust, painstakingly earned through years of delivering useful products and serving customers' needs, are measured as the difference between market capitalization and book value. Real human wealth, in the form of security, freedom, productivity, and knowledge, is scarcely captured by unexercised stock options. There are no line items that gauge the real engines of prosperity: vision, passion, and commitment. The plain truth is you cannot suck reality from the hypnotic glow of a vacuum tube."/>
			<outline text="While Bill and Randy began planning the merger, my job was to keep GO's visibility as high as possible among the powers at AT&amp;T. I was lucky to be invited to present some of our most recent work to Bob Kavner at an early morning briefing, barely two weeks after his powwow in Short Hills. Flying to New Jersey for a planning session, I spent an entire day in a room full of nervous staffers, who reviewed my slides word by word, carefully coordinating my presentation with theirs."/>
			<outline text="&quot;When you do your demo,&quot; one staffer suggested, &quot;it's a good idea to focus your benefits around increasing long-distance traffic. That's the real mother lode around here.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Got it.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="After ten hours of review for a fifteen-minute demo, the next morning I walked into the conference room where Bob Kavner and several other key executives sipped coffee and chatted about the news: Kavner had just been promoted to CEO of the multimedia products and services group. One of GO's sharpest salespeople, Danny Shader, was accompanying me on the trip. As unobtrusively as possible, he went around the room collecting business cards."/>
			<outline text="&quot;What'd you do that for?&quot; I whispered. &quot;You pretty much know who everyone is.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Titles are deceptive, but you can tell who really matters by the paper.&quot; He showed me the cards. &quot;The ones with the real power are printed on this bone-colored stock. The others have white cards with blue logos.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I sat down next to Kavner and made my pitch. &quot;Most people think that you have to have a computer with a keyboard to access a database. But there are thousands of VTR&quot; -  voice tone response -  &quot;systems in operation today. You know, 'Press 1 to hear your balance, press 2 to hear your last five debits.' In fact, this is probably the dominant form of consumer data access today. Working with your people, we've prototyped a new, richer telephone interface under Penpoint - the successor to today's twelve-key pad -  which integrates voice and data for the phones of the future.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Kavner watched the screen closely throughout my demo, nodding periodically. But whenever he had a question, he turned to his own staff for an answer. I felt as though I were just another audio-visual device delivering the latest briefing in a more personal form."/>
			<outline text="I groused to Danny as we packed up our gear. &quot;I felt like a trained monkey.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;You looked like a trained monkey.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;What a waste of time. We fly all the way out here and squander a whole day in a planning session, then get to entertain Kavner for half an hour before his real day gets under way.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="&quot;You don't get it,&quot; Danny said. &quot;This goes on all the time. It's just how things get done in a big company.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I hadn't thought about it before, but I had never actually worked for a big company. And based on what I had seen, I wasn't so sure I wanted to."/>

			<outline text="Thanks Jerry!"/>
			<outline text="It seems that dogs and cats and TV show up a lot in the folklore of Silicon Valley. When I was a software author at Personal Software in the early 80s, a fellow author and friend, Mitch Kapor (who went on to found Lotus and EFF), described meetings with the corporate people using his Morris The Cat analogy. "/>
			<outline text="They didn't take us seriously. We'd show up at a meeting, they'd talk about us and our product in front of us, as if we were stars, but they didn't take us very seriously. Mitch imagined that they viewed us much as the ad agency that owned Morris would. Yes, we need them, and if we meowed they'd exclaim &quot;look he said something!&quot; and go on with their meeting. There weren't many Great Hair Days back then."/>
			<outline text="Another bit of animal related folklore, I don't remember where I heard it first, is the Dogs Watching TV story. Have you ever watched TV with a dog? They kind of get it. They understand that there are symbols up there on the screen that stand for people and places and things. But do they understand the plot? They might have a small glimmer of understanding. Of course, stand back when another dog shows up on the screen! And if the other dog barks, you're in for a riot. Sometimes I think TV screenplay writers know this, and are deliberately playing tricks on dog owners."/>
			<outline text="I've heard it said that some corporate CEOs and managers who think they're technologists are like dogs watching TV. I might have even met one or two of them!"/>
			<outline text="Like Jerry, when I was a kid I was mystified by TV. I thought the applause track on sitcoms was a combination of all the people at home watching the show applauding. I used to applaud too, just doing my part. "/>
			<outline text="On Romper Room, the kids always said a prayer before eating their food. &quot;God is graceful, god is good, and we thank him for this food.&quot; I thought god was the guy who brought the food in for the kids! Like Mr. Greenjeans on Captain Kangaroo. Or Fang on the Soupy Sales show. An invisible off-screen guy named god. Maybe John God or Phil God, or something like that."/>
			<outline text="I grew up in an agnostic house in an agnostic city. God wasn't really in my vocabulary. Not so anymore. I use god as the inventor of vast important technologies. &quot;That's why god invented email,&quot; I've said many many times."/>
			<outline text="I wonder if today's kids are inventing new mythology around online communications?"/>

			<outline text="***It's happening!"/>
			<outline text="On March 10 I said &quot;...my flowers, incubating in their fertilized beds, are waiting for the sun to come out. It's going to be a glorious bloom this year. There'll be lots of love! It's just a matter of weeks. Maybe days.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm, it was a matter of weeks not days. But we're there now! Man them nasturtiums are big! The sweet peas are poppin. And the surprise star of my spring garden, the strawberries, are huge, green and numerous. It's a love festival! Spring has finally come, and not a moment too soon!"/>
			<outline text="***The Amazin Mets"/>
			<outline text="Spring has a magic effect on people. Smiles everywhere. It reminds me that the best happiness is one you can share. "/>
			<outline text="Were you in New York in 1969 when the Mets won the World Series? I was. I was a high school student, I lived in Queens, close to Shea Stadium. I actually grew up 10 blocks from Shea Stadium. I went to lots of Mets games with my brother and my friends. The Mets themselves lived in our neighborhood. I mowed the lawn of one of the Mets pitchers, Bob Shaw. Jerry Grote, the Mets catcher, lived a few blocks away. I was more than a fan, I felt connected to the team. "/>
			<outline text="We loved the Mets when they lost, and of course we still loved them when they won. And in 1969, the Mets won it all. The World Champion New York Mets. It was a very, very strange thing to try to understand!"/>
			<outline text="The amazing thing about 1969 in New York, the summer of love, the summer of Woodstock and the moon landing, was the effect on the whole city that the Mets victory had. I went to school in the Bronx, the home of the Yankees. Rode the subway thru Manhattan, the home of American business. On that day in 1969 when the Mets did the impossible, you could walk onto a subway car and get this... everyone was smiling!"/>
			<outline text="There was no sadness in New York that day. The city with no heart all of a sudden had a huge one! Even in the Bronx, even in the subways, we all shared the Tug McGraw feeling -- You Gotta Believe! For a generation after that, when we needed an example of how strange life can be, how great it can be to be alive, we always had the example of the Amazing Mets of 1969."/>
			<outline text="I think happiness and love are inclusive feelings. If you're in love, if you're happy, you want to share everything with everyone. Love is sharing and vice versa. I think they're the same thing."/>
			<outline text="So when I look at my flowers I think of the Mets. My flowers are glad to be alive. There's no mistaking that! Look at how beautiful they are. They are nothing other than a celebration of life. They share that with me, I care for them. It's a win-win. Total!"/>
			<outline text="The Mets were great in the early 60s, even if they didn't seem great, because they had the seeds of greatness in them. It was their destiny to rise above their obvious and glaring mediocrity, to shake out the bugs, to hit home runs, make amazing catches and pitch 1-hitters and lots of shutouts. Watching the ball go thru Frank Thomas's legs in center field, watching Marv Throneberry miss second base after hitting a ball that could only be a triple, these were just warmup exercises for Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, Bud Harrelson, Tommy Agee, Ed Kranepool, Art Shamsky and Cleon Jones. The 69 Mets were the bloom, but the flower was planted long before, in the good positive energy that the Mets created in their bozo days in the early 60s."/>
			<outline text="Eventually the Mets lost their love, embroiled in personalities, became just another contender. They couldn't overcome their success. They became the team of losers, talented men like Daryl Strawberry, who struggled mightily to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And New York went back to being the city of snarls and angry horn honkers. Unhappy, unloved and unloving people who couldn't smile with anything but cynicism. But there was hope, it turns out -- in 1986, the team rose to greatness again, in a lovefest led by the man with the most unlikely name -- Mookie Wilson! "/>
			<outline text="But that's another story, for another day."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***One more baseball story"/>
			<outline text="I'm a mystic when it comes to baseball. Living in California, I'm also a mystic when it comes to earthquakes."/>
			<outline text="Earthquakes are minor events for the planet, even if they are major events for human civilization. A big earthquake is incredibly disruptive. Lots of energy! It can knock out bridges and highways, level neighborhoods, start fires, and of course injure and even kill people."/>
			<outline text="We all know the Big One is coming, so we enjoy the blessings of California with an implicit caveat. If we live long enough, we know that we're going to experience total chaos in our lives at some time in the future, when one of the faults that criss-cross the state decides it's time to throw all our cards in the air. Or, put another way, when we anger the Earthquake God so much that he or she decides to teach us a lesson. There will be many opportunities for personal growth when that happens! That's life in California."/>
			<outline text="This may not sound like a baseball story. But it is..."/>
			<outline text="In 1989, the pennant race shaped up in a very interesting way. The Oakland As won the American League Western Division, and the San Francisco Giants won the National League West. I went to a lot of games that year, including one of the Giants playoff games at Candlestick Park. The As were an established Great Team, with great pitching and two huge power hitters. The Giants had great energy and lots of talent, but were a young team. The Giants played with huge intensity, in many ways they reminded me of the 69 Mets."/>
			<outline text="Anyway -- the miracle happened! Both teams won their pennants. For the first time in my generation, a subway series was happening, and I was there for it, living on the San Francisco peninsula at the time. "/>
			<outline text="Ohhhhh but the Bay Area did not handle this very well!"/>
			<outline text="Vendors sold baseball caps that were split in two, one side with the green and gold As look, and the other side with the black and orange Giants look. The logo in the front was split in two, half a gold A and half an orange SF."/>
			<outline text="Anna Chavez, the anchor on KGO-TV said: &quot;Isn't it great Pete! No matter who wins, *we* win!&quot; Imagine her putting both of her index fingers to her cheeks, twisting them slightly and swaying her head from side to side. I groaned when I heard her say it. &quot;This is not good.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="In baseball, like other things in life, eventually you have to choose sides. In baseball, someone has to lose. You can't have a win-win. That's just the way it is! You have to have an opinion. You Gotta Believe!"/>
			<outline text="So, with the whole world focused on Candlestick Park, for the opening game of the 1989 World Series, what happens?"/>
			<outline text="Being a mystic, I have to see it this way: the gods made a deal. The Baseball God said to the Earthquake God: &quot;we gotta stop this!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Earthquake! "/>
			<outline text="A big one! [Not *the* big one, thank god!]"/>
			<outline text="Eventually, they played the series, but more as a matter of civic pride than from any need to play it from a baseball standpoint. A World Series victory is the accumulation of megatons of energy. The series was already over. The Giants couldn't win. The As couldn't win. "/>
			<outline text="The gods won! [As they always do. Of course.]"/>

			<outline text="Over the last week I've been exchanging email with Dave Nagel from Apple Computer. I don't know Dave real well, but I sense that he would be a good person to have as a friend. "/>
			<outline text="He's very open and straightforward with his opinions. This is good, because when people aren't straight with you, misunderstandings can happen, people end up assuming you're doing something for one reason, when something else is really behind it."/>
			<outline text="Dave is the top development guy at Apple after the latest reorg. Dan Eilers is the top marketing guy. I wish both Dave and Dan the very best, I've said that before and I meant it. Even though I've been generally negative on Apple, I remain bullish on the Mac platform, and I hope someday to understand Apple, and to be understood by Apple, at least at this level -- I'm a Macintosh software developer, I will fight for the platform, and do my best to develop its potential in areas where I can make a contribution. "/>
			<outline text="In the past, Apple has gotten in my way. I forgive them for doing that. I let it happen, mostly due to a lack of self-respect on my part. In the future, I will be clear about respecting myself, and hopefully from that I will gain the trust and respect of others, perhaps including the top people at Apple. "/>

			<outline text="***Dig We Must!"/>
			<outline text="Another random note -- I hope to expand this into a full DaveNet piece sometime in May. "/>
			<outline text="At UserLand, we've made a decision to reorganize our business."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="An overview of the change -- we will stop selling Frontier thru commercial software channels. We have four products now, Frontier 3.0, AutoWeb and two unannounced products which are getting very close to the 1.0 level. One of them is a breakthrough, I believe, for the client side of the worldwide web. It was developed with cooperation from Netscape, with supporting features in Netscape 1.1, but it should be usable in later versions with web browsers from other vendors."/>
			<outline text="In earlier DaveNet pieces I counseled high tech investors to reorganize their businesses around the boom in online software. I failed to heed my own advice! We continued to butt our heads against the retail distribution system, a system which is rapidly becoming obsolete, IMHO."/>
			<outline text="Our Frontier scripting software deserves to grow at a rate faster than the rate that can be supported by the retail distribution system. We've been stalled for a few years, while Apple bundled AppleScript for free, we charged a premium for Frontier, because it is a premium product. This approach didn't work."/>
			<outline text="Now we have four products, any one of which could support a growing software venture. So we will free Frontier from the constraints of the commercial world and make it available thru the Internet. How will we make money from Frontier in that world? Stay tuned."/>

			<outline text="***Tom Mandel"/>
			<outline text="Late yesterday afternoon, after taking a walk with my friend Bernie Dekoven, drfun@global.california.com, I was cruising around America OnLine, reading the online version of the New York Times, when I came across an article about the death of Tom Mandel, a DaveNet subscriber, and a very respected person in the Bay Area online community. Tom used all my software products over the years, so I also felt a connection to Tom that way."/>
			<outline text="It was a very moving piece, about the death of warm man, struggling with his own mortality, and doing it in a public way, sharing his last experiences in life with all who were interested. The Times piece really moved me. I recalled the email I got from Tom late last year, requesting that I remove him from the DaveNet list, because he was about to resume his medication, and wanted to reserve his inbox for personal mail only. I could read between the lines. Tom has cancer. I wished him the best, and told him that as soon as he wanted back on the list, to just say the word."/>
			<outline text="To Tom, in heaven now, for sure, spiritually you will always be on my list! You did something great by sharing your life with all of us. "/>

			<outline text="What does turning 40 mean? A bunch of stuff, I'm sure."/>
			<outline text="One of the things I'm enjoying this week is the novelty of being in my thirties. By this time next week my thirties will be a memory. "/>
			<outline text="By 40, you've learned that people come and go from your life. That security is an illusion. That love and fun and sharing is what life is about. Try your best to be in *this* moment, not in future moments, not in past moments. Keep the lessons, throw away the experiences."/>
			<outline text="Another thing about turning 40 is respect. The world cuts you a wider path as you get older. You have to explain yourself less. People assume more often that you know what you're talking about. You don't have to struggle as much to get people's attention."/>
			<outline text="In many ways I am a younger person as I turn 40 than I was when I turned 30. I'm not scared of living. Not scared of learning about myself."/>
			<outline text="My thirties were a period of great accomplishment. I made some great products! I did very well financially. I bought my first house in my thirties. I made a lot of friends, and lost a few too. I fell in love a few times, also had my heart broken a few times. I got my share of the ebb and flow of life."/>

			<outline text="***The Experiment is Over"/>
			<outline text="by Glenn Fleishman"/>
			<outline text="Most people believe that the Internet is still a US government funded project. This includes a handful of journalists I had lunch with recently who write about PCs, online services, and the Internet. After 20 minutes of discussion, I managed to persuade them that it wasn't."/>
			<outline text="In fact, over the last four years the Internet has been increasingly made up of commercial networks that interface with each other and the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet). About two years ago, the Internet Powers That Be decided that the experiment was over -- that is, they had proven and established the viability of private sector TCP/IP (Internet Protocol) networks, and government money no longer needed to be invested in that infrastructure. Rather, the money should start being directed toward gigabit bandwidth projects and the Iway/Infobahn/InfoSwy."/>
			<outline text="In November 1994, the NSFNet took the first in a series of steps that would essentially remove the backbone of the beast (the Internet) without killing it. Colleges and other institutions that have been using the NSFNet were advised to find alternate feeds (which have turned out to be primarily MCI, Sprintlink, and ANS, which ran the backbone as a joint effort between MCI and IBM and then had most of its operations sold to AOL a few months ago."/>
			<outline text="The final stages are now occurring -- some of you may have noted some instability in the Net in the last week. Last Friday, the routing tables, essentially, the subway maps for packets on the Internet, for NSFNet were removed. Some problems occurred and part of the routing was re-established. All the major backbone operators (Sprintlink, MCI, PSI, UUnet/CompuServe, Net99, etc.) have been upgrading and moving their equipment at the major Network Access Point (NAP) in Washington, D.C., causing more instability."/>
			<outline text="On April 30 -- the end of this week -- NSFNet gets turned off for good unless something unexpected happens that requires some additional perpetuation for a few more days."/>
			<outline text="This marks a major leap in the Internet to an all-commercial network. Even if you decide to count the government and education as non-commercial, their traffic is carried on backbones operated by commercial operators."/>
			<outline text="NSF will be pumping about $4 million into commercial networks this year, decreasing to $0 million in four years. The bite is that the networks must agree to develop and &quot;peer&quot; (exchange packets) at NAPs. Currently, the major points are MAE-EAST (Metropolitan Area Ethernet East) in Washington, D.C. and the ATM/SMDS/Pac Bell hub in San Jose. Motion is underway by several major networks to start a non-ATM-flavored hub in the Bay Area, Net99 has spearheaded a Chicago NAP, and apparently ones in Denver, Seattle, Dallas, and other major cities are also underway. This week, my Internet provider, Interconnected Associates, begins a peering arrangement in their Network Operation Center [NOC] between Sprintlink and Network99."/>
			<outline text="This has been underreported because of its highly technical nature -- Peter Lewis wrote a piece for the Times in November covering some of the details. But regardless of the deep details of the transition, it's a major step in the commercialization of the Net. In fact -- it's the last step."/>

			<outline text="I got a call from my uncle in Jamaica who is 49. He's my young uncle, only 9.5 years older than me, much like an older brother. For six months every ten years we are in the same decade. &quot;Welcome to your forties,&quot; he said. I laughed! "/>

			<outline text="***The Cute Little Nut"/>
			<outline text="I have a friend who I talk with from time to time, her name is Cindy (not her real name), and she calls herself a cute little nut. The nut thing is right! She sure is that. In getting to know her I also realized that she's a cute little hippie and a cute little nerd. There are many facets to Cindy. "/>
			<outline text="Last nite the cute little nut spoke in one of my dreams in her squeaky high-pitched voice, like a little bird's voice in a Warner cartoon. She told me to go for a walk! It's funny because yesterday I spoke with another cute little nut named Hillary, who actually said those words."/>
			<outline text="Actors! Our lives are filled with actors who enter from the left and exit from the right. Some people show up in every scene, character actors, providing punctuation to the real action. There always seems to be a cute little nut on my stage, or waiting off stage. The invisible hand that's writing the story of my life needs a sweet small voice to explain the themes for my audience. "/>
			<outline text="It's so exciting when a new actor appears on the stage, you wonder what role they'll play. In Hollywood no one wants to share the spotlight, in real life you wonder if a new actor is a co-star. "/>
			<outline text="Some actors play dramatic supporting roles; are in one big scene, and are never heard from again. "/>
			<outline text="And some very important actors wait offstage forever, the other actors talk about them, draw pictures of them, speak for them, but the script writer never actually writes any lines for them. The audience waits and wonders. The tension builds. What do they have to say? "/>
			<outline text="We are actors and audience, but we don't write the screenplay. You can be creative with your lines, the director allows that! And like the interactive movies people are experimenting with, sometimes it seems, we can make choices. "/>
			<outline text="You strike a balance, life becomes an artform, each choice you make is precious, every chance for creativity is an opportunity. "/>
			<outline text="And we struggle with the meaning of it all, to varying degrees. I think the truly blessed people don't bother with the struggle and just have fun!"/>

But it's also an endorsement, because it can be fun to be around me. It's a curse and a blessing to be so entertaining. As Consolidated Edison used to say, dig we must! "/>
			<outline text="Anyway, recently I've been pioneering a new form of social behavior: forgiveness. It began with my DaveNet piece, &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1995/04/26/letshavefun&quot;&gt;Let's Have Fun&lt;/a&gt;, where I publicly forgave Apple Computer.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;5/9/95; 7:03:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="The dynamics of the web are completely different from email. Your email box is your private space. As I've said, it's an honor to be allowed to share that place with you two or three times a week. "/>
			<outline text="The web, on the other hand, is more like television. Don't like the show? Switch channels! Because you have more freedom, so do I."/>
			<outline text="A few of weeks ago I added a new section to my website, things that aren't going out over the DaveNet email channel. [This site is no longer on the air. DW 5/97.]"/>
			<outline text="One of the pages in my personal section is a list of my favorite movies. No need to list them here. I just added another one to the list today -- Being There, with Peter Sellers, released in 1979. A beautiful movie, way ahead of its time, with a wonderful title and cast, a light plot, but it makes a huge statement -- that reality is less than we think it is. That gardening and loving and simply *being* is enough. That everything else is just a big misunderstanding. Chauncey Garndener, played by Sellers, becomes a central figure in world politics, totally by accident. The ending of the movie delivers the message that to be an angel you just share your love and speak the truth. The simpler it is, the better. "/>
			<outline text="Sometimes the truth is so simple it's hard to understand. It's taken me years to understand the Sting song that goes like this -- &quot;If you love someone, set them free.&quot; A profoundly beautiful statement, because, from one view, it totally defines the concept of love. Love is about sharing creativity and freedom. Love makes you want to create, and creativity is an act of love. When you try to capture love, to hold it, isolate it, control it, to own it -- it disappears and is replaced with stagnation, boredom and eventually misery. The opposite of creativity."/>
			<outline text="I've often wondered if software development is a right-brained or left-brained activity. So analyitic; at the same time so intuitive. This question stops me, I wonder -- was VisiCalc an act of love or an act of analysis? Was Windows? How about PageMaker? Can you feel the defiance in Quark XPress? I can! I've decried the head-trips that generated products like Lotus Symphony and OS/2. And note that OS/2 didn't become a contender until IBM got angry, and allowed their personality, such as it is, to flow into the product. Yes, I believe there's more love in software than we previously dared to imagine."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, there's a lot of perceived security in them numbers! I thought that spreadsheets were creative tools until Bob Frankston, frankston@frankston.com, one of the co-inventors of the spreadsheet genre, told me that many spreadsheet users do the math on a calculator, type the numbers into a spreadsheet, and print out the result. They don't know about formulas. Wow! No what-if. No play. No fun (spreadsheets *are* a lot of fun...). "/>
			<outline text="Conclusion: even if Dan and Bob poured their hearts into VisiCalc, many of their users hold their love in reserve, and are unwilling to trust the software. It's merely a presentation vehicle. Bob pointed out that Borland had completely captured this idea in Quattro Pro by integrating a full-featured presentation program. Many spreadsheet users view them as CYA tools. Forget passion. Keep the boss happy, keep your job."/>
			<outline text="I discovered the same thing in 1986, when I shipped MORE. Before then, outlining was a small niche, it appealed to total right-brainers, despite the misperception in the software industry, at the time, that to use an outliner you had to be a complete detail nut, a very left-brained sort of person. Our earlier products, ThinkTank and Ready, appealed to intuitive people. The ability of the computer to assist the organization of ideas relieved the human being from being an idea organizer. It can be frustrating to have thousands of ideas if there's no way to capture them. With ThinkTank there was less frustration. You could free-flow your ideas into the computer, evaluate them, organize them endlessly. It seemed a shame to print them out, because once they were stored on paper, they became rigid and hard and un-malleable. It seems Sting would have something to say about this -- &quot;If you love your ideas, set them free.&quot; Uhh hhuh. Yes!"/>
			<outline text="Then came MORE, a product name chosen because we had no idea which new feature (there were many!) would be most appreciated. It turned out to be bullet charts. Type in an outline, flip a switch and voila! a beautful color presentation. Want to switch the order of two slides? Flip the switch back, press cmd-U, flip back. Fast, easy, high leverage, fun and (ugh) your ass is covered!"/>
			<outline text="When we figured this out, that CYA was our main selling point, we switched our ad strategy. Huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/dwiner/images/moread.gif&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of a boss, taken with a fish-eye lens to accentuate the size of his nose. An angry, maybe even hateful look on his face. A caricature of *your* boss. Underneath the picture we said &quot;He has three questions. You have two answers. You need MORE.&quot; We laugh. Ain't it the truth! The message -- if you used this software you could keep this guy from firing your ass."/>
			<outline text="MORE was at least two products inside one app. Some people liked MORE's outlining but had no use for the bullet charts. Some people liked our bullet charts but didn't like the outlining. Our salespeople came back from the field with the request from customers that we unbundle the two, and give them a choice. Yes! I agree now and I agreed then. But there was just one small problem -- there was no way to do it!"/>
			<outline text="Lesson learned: integrated software is a dead-end. Look for another approach."/>
			<outline text="I remembered a speech that Bill Gates gave at a Roger Von Oech conference in Palo Alto in 1983. The question -- What About Integrated Software? It was a hot issue because of Lotus 1-2-3, which showed that presentation graphics and spreadsheets were a natural fit. Bill said that technologically, Lotus was barking up the wrong tree. He said the right way to do it was to make a spreadsheet program and a graphics program and link them together with a scripting language. Yeah! [Bill often figures these kinds of things out before a lot of us do. Go hear him speak when ever you can, you'll always get new ideas you can use.]"/>
			<outline text="So, in 1986, when my customers were asking for two separate programs, the answer was there, but the technology was missing. After selling my company to Symantec in 1987, in 1988 I left to start working on the missing technology, which eventually shipped in 1992 for the Macintosh. We called it Frontier. "/>
			<outline text="An aside, it's interesting that one of the seeds for this product came from Gates, and I unwittingly transferred that seed to Apple. The conventional wisdom, that all good ideas flow out of Apple only to be commercialized by Microsoft, is wrong. Here's an example of the reverse flow."/>
			<outline text="Frontier is many things, but the central idea is that if you have a competent scripting language that has its hooks into all applications, that the temptation, or need, for integration is less. If Frontier existed in the mid-80s, we could have unbundled MORE, using scripts to connect our outliner to our presenter, and presumably opened the market for competition. A more rational world for our customers, and probably a more rational world for MORE too. MORE would have been useful as an email organizer, as a DTP text composition tool, or as an HTML editor, and probably a few other things if it had been opened up. It's still possible, and it still would be a good idea."/>
			<outline text="At the center of Frontier is a C-like language called UserTalk. I had originally wanted to call the language Juicy, because it is C-like, and because both Doug Baron, dougb@chilehead.com, and I are Jewish. But decorum prevailed and we went with the more predictable (and boring!) UserTalk name."/>
			<outline text="UserTalk is different from C because it's totally dynamic. All binding takes place at runtime. The symbol table is fast, but it's also hierarchic, persistent and disk-based, with a huge 31-bit address space. And it's browsable, and editable (even while scripts are running). It's inherently a multi-threaded environment, you can launch as many scripts as you like, and they can communicate with each other: there's a vast shared name space. And each script can have its own private name space too. Scripts can call other scripts allowing you to build layers of functionality. Scripts can run from the desktop and from the menu bars of apps that support our menu sharing protocol, which has become a standard in the Mac developer world. Scripts can run in response to messages from other apps, and across the net, a feature I'm using heavily in the connection between Frontier and Netscape. "/>
			<outline text="Frontier has a bunch of first-time features. The one I am most proud of is its outline-based script editor. It was my third try at a structured program editor, and this one really works. You can collapse the body of a loop, for example, and when you move the loop, you move all the statements nested underneath it. It's right. It's beautiful. I love it! This is how program editors should always have worked. Someday all program editors will work this way, IMHO."/>
			<outline text="Financially, I could have written checks forever to keep Frontier afloat as a commercial product. But here's the problem -- for whatever reason, our sales had dwindled to an insignificant trickle. We had gathered a loyal following, but they were a small minority. To really have a head of steam, you have to appeal to at least a large minority. It's even better if you have a consensus behind you, that your product is perceived to be a standard. There's safety in standards. I've learned that people will sacrifice performance, features, maybe even reliability, in order to feel safe in their choice."/>
			<outline text="I've been trying to resolve this contradiction for at least two years. At some level I always understood that in order to be all that it can be, Frontier had to be free. Like all thruths, this one is a pun, it's equally valid no matter how you look at it. To be free means free of cost, and free to be itself, independent of me, its primary owner. If you love someone, set them free. Correct."/>
			<outline text="So -- for the last couple of weeks I've been working on a new release of Frontier, codenamed Aretha, streamlined and updated for 1995, incorporating much of what I've learned about script writing and leading a community of script writers. At first it was a difficult process, because visiting the old parts of Frontier was like visiting an old wounded friend. I snipped and trimmed, cut out the stuff that didn't prove useful and focused on new frontiers, like the connection between Eudora and Netscape. I saw that AutoWeb was going to be truly useful now that everyone would have an opportunity to customize its scripts. I could use important features that weren't present in our Runtime. I could use Frontier's built-in outliner to store lists of email addresses for DaveNet-style essaynets. It's cool! Most important, I could feel Frontier becoming free, and in a real sense, in doing so, I also became free."/>
			<outline text="I think this gift will re-enforce the community of co-related Macintosh interests that have already built on Frontier, and bring it to new audiences, especially people who run web servers on Macintoshes. Maybe it leads to a Windows and Unix version of Frontier? I hope so too. Can we do what Sun's HotJava proposes to do? Yes! How about General Magic style agents? You bet! Do you have to use Netscape's bare-bones email window? Not any more. Eudora is scriptable, and so is Netscape. Connection made. Someone *is* home! I think it's going to work. More important, it *feels* like it's going to work. There's the right brain kicking in."/>
			<outline text="All that is great, but the greatest benefit of freeing Frontier is that it allows me to share the primary result of my life as a software developer with anyone who wants to experience it. "/>
			<outline text="Finally, please don't worry how I'm going to make money. That's my problem, not yours. "/>

			<outline text="***Worming thru the web"/>
			<outline text="For me, this has been a wide-ranging week. I tweaked up my little symphony. The instruments are Eudora, Netscape, Webstar, Anarchie and the Mac operating system. My baton is Frontier. Lots of little projects. All of them cool!"/>
			<outline text="Some examples: I taught Netscape how to evaluate Frontier and AppleScript scripts, just like HotJava. I got web recording working with Frontier's outliner and Netscape. I rebuilt my AutoMail mail distributor, the scripts that distribute DaveNet email, to store names and email addresses in a Frontier outline. "/>
			<outline text="I learned how to operate StarNine's WebStar HTTP server and started building a connection that will allow Frontier to run CGI scripts. I am getting lots of help from Chuck Shotton, the author of WebStar. When we have this working we'll be doing the kind of network agentry that General Magic's Marc Porat envisions for TeleScript, especially now that we have our hooks into Netscape. That's power! Hummmmm."/>
			<outline text="I also revisited my Netscape-based &quot;worm&quot; script, which I started working on a few months ago. Worms are very cool things, and nowhere near as insidious as their name makes them sound. The way worms work -- you give the script a URL, the address of a website you want to start with. It gets the source text for that page. It scans the text for pointers to other websites, adds them to a list. Then it visits each of the sites, repeating the process. "/>
			<outline text="The script travels thru the net, building a database of places you can visit. It could be a very huge database. A good worm should be running all the time, and should spot every new website that pops up. Can a worm ever complete? Good question! I think not... But if it could, within a few minutes there will be some new websites on the air, so you get up and do it again."/>
			<outline text="My original worm, which I wrote back in February, is a very simple script. I gave it to Eric Newman, enewman@redgate.com,  a scripting buddy who works at America OnLine. Eric has appeared in DaveNet before, he was the anonymous website manager in my April Fools piece, &quot;Dreams Can Come True.&quot; Eric said &quot;This stuff is GREAT!!! I am in the process of setting up Web sites for EVERYBODY IN THE COMPANY with AutoWeb!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="When I wrote AutoWeb I dreamed that someone like Eric would pick up the ball and build a truly huge website with it. Check it out. The site is at www.megaweb.com. Look for the clues that AutoWeb is responsible: Next|Prev|Home links at the top of each page. Surface links at the bottom. Signature and copyright at the very bottom. Yes!"/>
			<outline text="But Eric did even better. He took my worm script and industrialized it. If you dig around the megaweb.com site, you'll come across an alphabetized list of thousands of websites. The author of this listing is Eric's worm script, an improvement of the original worm I wrote back in February."/>
			<outline text="I love this guy! I love working with smart creative people who take my wish as a challenge -- who surprise you by doing even more than you asked them to. I'm lucky to have a friend like Eric. "/>
			<outline text="By the way, at least one of the other Dreams Can Come True quotes is real. Eric isn't the only carnivore out there. Stay tuned. April Fools in May. At the latest June. So what if I lied when I said I'll never tell? Sue me! [Just kidding! Please.]"/>

			<outline text="***John Gilmore on Freedom"/>
			<outline text="I've known John Gilmore, gnu@toad.com, since the early 80s, when he was a San Francisco BBS sysop and I was an author at Personal Software. Since then, John went on to become a founder of Sun Microsystems; The Little Garden, a local (and gutsy) Internet service provider; and Cygnus Support, a company with a very interesting mission. They support software that has been placed in the public domain. They also port and maintain the software, presumably in competiton with others who want to do so. Because of this background, John has a unique perspective on standardization, and not surprisingly, he had a bunch to say about my Being Free piece, released on May 9. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what he said:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Dave, this is a hard lesson for almost everyone to learn. You're ahead of the curve as usual!"/>
			<outline text="&quot;See http://www.cygnus.com/library-dir.html for the five issues of the Free Software Report (they're available in PostScript). They talk about how many companies have set standards and found success by freeing their software. DEC's X Windows beat the technically superior Sun NeWS this way for control of the workstation window-system market. DARPA made their Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) easily beat the ISO protocols by giving away a good free implementation (in Berkeley Unix)."/>
			<outline text="&quot;It sounds like you have truly learned this, but let's check. Are you really releasing Aretha in full source code (binaries too, of course, on the Mac) with full permission for others to use, modify, and distribute it commercially? No payments to you required, no control by you? That's the secret."/>
			<outline text="&quot;There's been a recent trend of companies trying to piggyback on the success of the free software market on the Internet, by making pseudo-free software such as Mosaic, Netscape, RSAREF, or RealAudio. Typically they give away binary-only copies, without providing source code; or will only allow the software to be used for &quot;personal&quot; or &quot;noncommercial&quot; purposes. It's that finger of greed working its way in there -- &quot;if *anybody* else profits from this then *I* want a cut!&quot;. There's no element of &quot;If you love something, set it free&quot; in there. They think of it as canny loss-leader marketing."/>
			<outline text="&quot;This pseudo-freedom kills the software if the owner goes out to lunch; the commercial users can't support themselves, and no phoenix can rise from the ashes (without protracted negotiations and payment) to take over maintenance. Just like proprietary software. It also cheats both the users and the authors of most of the benefits of free software."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Free software reduces the transaction costs of collaboration. Users can *fix* free software, which for them is often easier than persuading the vendor that there's really a problem, and then getting the vendor to fix it, and then getting the vendor to release the fixed version. The more experienced users on the net help out the less experienced users to fix problems, including real bugs and missing features. They have fun teaching and learning about what's inside."/>
			<outline text="&quot;The author also wins because users can pull free software into niches that it's already 90% right for, by adding the 5% that makes a workable 95% solution. For example, porting it to another platform. Or making it interoperate with something. Or adding a small feature. Or speeding up something that's too slow as it is. And this makes new markets."/>
			<outline text="&quot;When we started Cygnus, we had no idea that the embedded cross-compiler market was much larger and easier to penetrate than the native workstation compiler market we'd targeted. The proprietary cross-compiler companies were all small, fat, and lazy.  Their products were overpriced and their support was unresponsive.  Our free software was dragged into that market by early adopter users, who hacked it to do most of the job of cross-compiling. Their companies then paid us to clean up the hackish code and make it solid and maintainable across dozens of platforms.  It's now the mainstay of our business."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Dave, it sounds like you already understand this. Frontier is a tool for prying open applications so that users can add the local 5% that makes the apps really shine for them. But Frontier can only help with interoperability and a bit of customization. It can't unlock a locked-up program, it can only let a little fresh air in. And when a user writes scripts to make a couple of apps do a cool thing, there's no way to get those scripts to all the other users who'd benefit."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Commercial software companies have no `intake' process for improvements written by their users!"/>
			<outline text="&quot;I think it's great that the free-software meme has started to penetrate the personal computer market, and that you're its most recent host. I truly believe that the free software paradigm makes software evolve more quickly, by reducing transaction costs and allowing productive, cheap collaboration. Hardware has evolved ten times as fast in the PC market as software; we have some catching up to do.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***My reply to John"/>
			<outline text="I have to think about this. I'm committed to Frontier being released in binary form for the Macintosh at zero cost. It can be included with commercial software, with no royalty due to UserLand. If Apple wants to include it, or our Runtime, with the Mac OS, they can, again at no cost. The same offer goes to Radius or Power Computing or any other Mac cloner. I suspect that one or more of them will do it, once they find out what it would make possible, especially if they want to create a turnkey Internet client, or a server for that matter."/>
			<outline text="I want to learn more before deciding whether or not to release source code for Frontier's kernel and editors. I believe in what you're proposing. And making money isn't the issue. I have a backlog of unreleased tools and apps that are compatible with Frontier, that add value to it, so if Frontier becomes a standard, there's no question in my mind that I can participate in the commercial bonanza such a standard would open up. Aside from that, money has *never* been my motivator for making software -- even when I was broke -- it was the fun, the art, that drove me to write software. Making money from software has been a pleasant side-effect, not the purpose."/>
			<outline text="Another bit of evidence -- I've been working in Frontier for the last year without making a single change to the kernel. It's been thru three major releases, with tons of openings created. Yes, I have a wish list, but so far I've been happy to work with the product exactly as-is. The Aretha release will include version 3.0.3 of the kernel, which is exactly what we've been shipping in the commercial package."/>
			<outline text="Releasing source is an unreversable move. I have some experience with this. We have a huge SDK that ships with Frontier, all in source. The orchestration this requires is substantial. And we ship source for all the scripts that define Frontier. That's about half of its functionality. Evolving these codebases has been an art not a science! Releasing full source may make sense when the vendor disappears, or is inactive or unresponsive. But what if the vendor wants to keep it moving? Does it make sense to release source then?"/>
			<outline text="Perhaps Cygnus could play a role here. Could we place the source for every release of Frontier in escrow with you, to be released to the public if certain conditions are met? Is this worth discussing?"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I've learned in the past that it's best to learn a little, to do things like this one step at a time. How you do it *is* important. I expect to learn a lot in the next few months, and want to incorporate that learning in the next step after the free release of Frontier."/>
			<outline text="And just in getting this release together, I've been learning a lot. Frontier as a free thing just makes more and more sense. For years I've been dealing with an uncomfortable delineation, having to produce both commercial functionality for Runtime users and provide easy tweaking for script writers. Everything I write in Frontier is visible because I always ship the source code for my scripts. They provide utility and also are coding samples. This is a very hard bottleneck to flow my coding thru. Now I can relax. Everyone who will be using the scripts will also have the script editor and debugger and lots of other tools. Now the challenge is simply how to stay out of their way once this stuff is released. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;If you love someone, set them free,&quot; used to confuse me. I thought it meant &quot;if you love someone, say goodbye.&quot; This seemed silly! Once you find love, why would you want to say goodbye? Now I know that it's not about saying goodbye. Let the love find its own path in the world. Stay involved, as a fan, as a supporter, as a friend. But don't try to control or limit your friend. Let the love roam freely in the world, creating whatever it wants to create. The more you share, the more you get back."/>
			<outline text="In a week or so we will all share Frontier. Judging from the email I've been getting, I think we're going to soar. I'm looking forward to to relaxing a bit, enjoying the view. Having fun! Does this seem unreasonable? I sure hope not..."/>
			<outline text="And thanks for taking the time to get in the loop, John. I hope I can count on your advice, and perhaps your help, as this software rolls out."/>

			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="It was almost a week without DaveNet, but here I am, saved by the bell. It's Friday and you got it. So please don't complain!"/>
			<outline text="Actually people have been very good about this little hiatus. I've gotten a few emails asking if everything is OK. Thank you. Much appreciated. Everything is OK. I've just had my head down on the Aretha project, doing lots of writing work. When I pop up for air, I'm usually thinking about playing in the garden. I've been writing docs, and that always puts me in a funky mood. The garden cures that. Dig a few holes, plant some seeds, dig up them weeds!"/>
			<outline text="Programmers hate to write docs. I don't think it's because programmers can't write. I'm a programmer and I can write, but I still hate to write docs about my own software. I know way too much. It's frustrating. I want to keep plowing ahead. Writing docs is painful because I'll remember, the next time I'm wailing on code, adding feature after feature, that every feature needs to be explained. As I debug a group of features I create a backlog of unwritten docs. It's a regulator on the flow of new software. It's the sales tax on aggressive programming. It's when software stops being fun and becomes work!"/>
			<outline text="Oh yeah, I like writing DaveNet stuff because I can roll and ramble. I don't have to teach you a skill. No pauses to make a screen shot, paste it into my draw program and spit out a GIF file. I don't have to watch my keystrokes or describe my mousestrokes. Or think of a simpler way to do the whole thing two hours later and rip up the pages to do it the new way; all the time wishing I could just go back to making more features. I can ramble in DaveNet, and the worst that happens is you kick out and go onto reading the next item in your inbox."/>
			<outline text="But writing docs is a necessity. Every programmer has to do it. So there's a yin to the yang. A sadness to balance the joy. It's OK, I say to my inner child, eventually it'll be done and you can play again! Soooon..."/>

			<outline text="***Totally Smitten with WebStar"/>
			<outline text="Last week we flipped the switch... Frontier is now free. That was quick! You can download the software from the Aretha website at http://www.hotwired.com/userland/aretha/. Or from the UserLand forums on America OnLine and CompuServe."/>
			<outline text="It's been a very interesting process. Everything got reset to zero. The printed docs for Frontier are in a warehouse in Gilroy. We've discontinued Frontier as a commercial product. The new docs are being uploaded to that website as they are being written."/>
			<outline text="As it stands right now, Aretha is only for the highly motivated, because the docs are so scarce. I've written up the most technical aspects of Aretha first, to interest and incentivize the most gutsy audience we have, sysops who run HTTP servers on Macintoshes. "/>
			<outline text="Aretha contains a new, very simple and powerful framework for writing CGI scripts. I've seen the light -- now I want to run a Mac web server! It'll be a private one tho, a testbed and incubator, because I refuse to wear a beeper. Web sysops have to wear huge beepers that make very loud sounds in the middle of the night. I've been there, done that."/>
			<outline text="I must thank Chuck Shotton, cshotton@biap.com, for persevering. For months he's been dropping passionate missives into my mailbox telling me how wonderful it's going to be when Frontier and his WebStar server get married. Chuck was right. It's turning out to be a huge party!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Babies &amp; Bath Water"/>
			<outline text="I've also written the docs for a feature that's going to be controversial. "/>
			<outline text="My website is one of two sites in the world (that I know of, I'm sure I'll hear of others) that contains scripts embedded in its HTML text.  The scripts run *on the client machine* when the user clicks on them. "/>
			<outline text="For example, on one of my pages, when you click on the name of an object that's stored in Frontier's database, Frontier comes to the front and opens the window. It's so natural you almost don't notice it's happening. Our data is integrated into the web! It's spoooky."/>
			<outline text="Your data can be integrated too. The possibilities for multimedia connections to the web are amazing. This is the hole that content people have been waiting for. *I* was definitely waiting for this because now I can seamlessly integrate my scripts with the web on both ends, on the server (the normal thing) and on the client (the new thing!). I can't wait to write systems that really exploit this connection. Web pages become software and vice versa. I think I got there first! And I think this is the gold nugget that intuitively we all know exists in WebLand. Major stuff."/>
			<outline text="But, it's going to be considered controversial because of the S-word: Security. This hole, it will be argued, opens the door for vandals to write viruses embedded in web pages that appear to be innocuous, but really do harm. The more powerful the scripting language, the easier it would be to do harm."/>
			<outline text="Before you sigh and write off the opportunity, I want to make a huge claim -- I think I have the answer to the security question -- one that allows the idea to incubate, and at the same time, protects client  systems against deliberate acts of violence."/>
			<outline text="First, the ultimate protection is to quit Frontier when you're browsing the web. If the scripting engine isn't running, the scripts can't run. You're totally safe if Frontier is inactive. Of course, I want you to have Frontier running, so this answer is not acceptable. "/>
			<outline text="Here's the deal. If the script is embedded in a web page that lives on my website, the script runs. If it lives in someone else's web page, it doesn't run. This way, I can play with the new open slot, try out new ideas, and we can all learn about it, and refine the approach to security together. "/>
			<outline text="We won't be throwing out the baby along with the bath water."/>
			<outline text="I will be very cautious, and only send commands that show you things. You make the changes. It'll be active documentation. The web extends its reach onto your hard disk and to other scriptable apps running on the client machine."/>
			<outline text="Before moving on -- I'd like to remind everyone to be careful. Any program you download could do harm, whether it's written in a scripting language or in C. Any reasonably experienced programmer could easily write a routine that harmed your system. Such a routine could, theoretically, be lurking inside *any* program that you download. "/>
			<outline text="But the system works because caring and thoughtful people are watching, and checking things out before letting them out to the public. There's an editorial system in place for apps. I believe the security issue for scripts is best addressed using the same system."/>
			<outline text="And finally -- there's no way around this -- you are responsible for the security of your own computer. It's unrealistic to expect that that the net will be a safe place. It mirrors the world. It can't be safe. You still have to protect yourself. Be vulnerable only when you can afford to be."/>

			<outline text="***Youthful Script Writers"/>
			<outline text="My mailbox has been a very interesting place this week! "/>
			<outline text="A surprise that really shouldn't have been surprising -- just in the last few days Frontier has found a whole new market -- nerdy high school and college students."/>
			<outline text="It seems that the free-Frontier move is a popular thing on college campuses! I find this very refreshing, after spending years working with system managers at publishing organizations, large corporations and government institutions, and yes, even on college campuses. "/>
			<outline text="As we get older, I think, our lives get cluttered with all the living we've done. Adding yet another software product becomes more trouble. Learning a new programming paradigm is a problem. But not for the younger people, who struggle to stay entertained. They have time to explore, to learn new things. That's what being young is all about!"/>
			<outline text="Being broke is what being young is all about too. I remember this very well! But many of these young people have free Internet access and Macintoshes, so it's no problem. And now that Frontier is free, they can afford it!"/>
			<outline text="Then I realized something even more exciting. It's May. By the time all this stuff is rolling it'll be June. Then what? "/>

			<outline text="***Supporting Free Software"/>
			<outline text="OK -- it's exciting. But let's come down to earth for a few paragraphs."/>
			<outline text="I can't support Frontier."/>
			<outline text="Already my mailbox is overflowing with questions -- how do you do this, what happens when you do that? There's always an answer, but as one person, I can't accept responsibility for providing the answers on a one-to-one basis."/>
			<outline text="We need an online support infrastructure. I'm doing my part, by writing project notes and crib sheets and posting them on the Aretha website. I'll take responsibility for explaining Frontier and the add-on components that I write, but even there I could use help. "/>
			<outline text="Another committment I make: for the forseeable future, with vacations specifically excepted, I commit to being a regular participant on the UserLand forum on CompuServe. [Enter GO USERLAND at any ! prompt.] "/>
			<outline text="I've spoken with Doug Baron and John Baxter and they make the same committment."/>
			<outline text="But we need to open other channels for providing support information. I want to pass this job off to the Macintosh scripting community. Our CompuServe, America OnLine and AppleLink forums are still there. Does eWorld want to start an independent support forum? Could Raines Cohen and the User Group Connection help? Yes... There's a Macintosh scripting list server. I have a website, and would gladly point it to other websites that provide valuble information for Frontier script writers. "/>
			<outline text="I'd also like to have a page on my website with email addresses for people who are willing to contribute their time answering questions, according to their area of expertise. So, for example, if you have a lot of experience scripting Quark XPress with Frontier, and are willing to help, please send me an email, and I'll add your name, mail address and area of expertise to my website."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***The Big Wheel"/>
			<outline text="It's an interesting loop to close. In a recent email exchange with David Bruns, dbruns@xmission.com, we've been discussing where the center of Frontier is. He says it's the object database. I agree. Then I say, no, it's really the outliner. He agrees. "/>

Never thought I'd do this. "/>
			<outline text="I have the Mac plugged into a Bose table radio that I bought impulsively about a year ago. It's sitting on top of my SuperMatch 21-inch monitor.

			<outline text="I've been having fun, embroiled in various debates on various lists. The web security issue heated up, and I've been in the loop, thanks to Aretha's ability to host scripts that are embedded in web pages. It's an experiment, an opportunity to learn how this stuff works. So far all is well."/>
			<outline text="Before making an investment in any particular security scheme, I need to understand what the application is. That's why I want a safe incubator for this idea, to play and experiment and learn. Maybe file system access has nothing to do with the &quot;killer app&quot; for web-embedded scripts? If so, the simplest security would just be to disable all file system verbs from embedded scripts. People are right, scripting is very powerful. So for now, that power is reserved for me, personally. Once we find a killer app, I'll put in the security features to close up the holes, and open up the web-script-runner to all web developers."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday the whole thing got real interesting with Sun's announcement of their deal with Netscape to embed the Java language in Netscape's web browser. It's good to know that an established technology vendor like Sun can ally itself with an aggressive startup like Netscape. John Doerr, jdoerr@kpcb.com, surely must have something to do with this -- he's on the board of both companies! Maybe a strategy is revealing itself?"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, Java sounds cool. I want to write Java scripts, and make them work with my Frontier worm scripts, CGIs, embedded ones, etc. We can hook Java into the Mac OS and all scriptable apps. We should be able to make some magic happen for web content developers, who still prefer Macs, and for clients who surf from the Mac desktop. Let's all work together on security. Do they have a development system? If not, Aretha is glad to help. It'll be cool."/>
			<outline text="Linking the power of the web with the power of personal computers is a big axis of power. I think we're years and years away from the web being a virtual reality platform. I think Apple and its OpenDoc partners are waiting for a new class of software to link into the web. Today, can we tap Director on the shoulder and say play this thing? Yeah, of course that's totally do-able. Can it be made safe? Sure!"/>

			<outline text="On various Internet lists, a debate has been brewing over CyberDog, OLE and Netscape -- which is the platform for the web? Who should we be following? Whose APIs should I be building on? "/>
			<outline text="I've made my decision. For now at least, it's Netscape. My reasons follow..."/>
			<outline text="OLE is not an option. I work on the Mac platform. Despite Microsoft's excellent efforts, there's no momentum behind OLE in this world. Microsoft may support OLE in all their apps, but I realize that I don't use a single Microsoft app! Am I the only one? And my inner voice tells me that OLE would *not* be a lot of fun. I get low bang for the buck vibes from OLE."/>
			<outline text="Coming back from this year's WWDC, people seem to have a genuine enthusiasm for Apple's CyberDog, which is a superset of OpenDoc, an API for &quot;part&quot; integration. I hear great things about the team that's working on CyberDog. Apparently there are some carnivores at Apple. Glad to hear it!"/>
			<outline text="But... CyberDog promises a lot, but so far delivers nothing. No one is using CyberDog today to browse the web. I want heat! CyberDog may be a wonderful lighter, but where are the CyberLogs? Apple is supplying kindling but where will the &quot;killer parts&quot; come from?"/>
			<outline text="I think people incorrectly overlook Netscape as a CyberDog-equivalent. It's a read-only version. To edit things that live on a web page, you need to open a separate window in a different app. We can definitely create the links from files on the content developer's hard disk to the web browser, that's not a problem, just an opportunity. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape is read-only, but I'll put my stake in the ground here -- it doesn't matter! Techies sniff, editing should happen in-place, in the browser window. But that creates user interface complexity and confusion. The separate windows approach has advantages: like a fresh menu bar, and a fresh interpretation of the user's keystrokes. "/>
			<outline text="Want to edit this picture? -- select it, and choose Edit Object from the browser's menubar. A helper app launches with the object ready to be edited, and with a hotlink back to the browser. Make a change in the helper app, bring the browser to the front, the window recalculates to reflect your changes. This is what people will want. It's what *I* want."/>
			<outline text="I've seen something like this work in a new experimental version of the Netscape browser that I have on my hard disk. I can't edit objects in their window, yet, but I *can* edit its menubar, and add my own commands, in exactly the way I described in the previous paragraph. My software and Netscape's. Their platform and my part. The next steps after this are obvious and do-able. I hope Netscape does them."/>
			<outline text="But my most important reason for working with Netscape is that it's so darned easy to work with them! I get an idea, I call them up, two weeks later I get a new build in my mailbox with the idea implemented. "/>
			<outline text="Collaborative development is my business. I've worked with the best developers on lots of different teams. "/>

			<outline text="On Tuesday I talked with my buddy Fred Davis, 305-7504@mcimail.com, on his return from a two-week trip to Amsterdam. Fred came back with a bunch of clean energy and anger. It was a cool talk. It turns out we're angry about some of the same things!"/>
			<outline text="We talked about the hypocrisy of the US Justice Department. The cancellation of the Microsoft/Intuit merger makes no sense. The banking industry sucks. Why not let the software industry have a shot at driving the process instead of the inbred system that gave us the Savings &amp; Loan debacle?"/>
			<outline text="I said to Fred, this sounds like a DaveNet piece!"/>
			<outline text="Here 'tis... "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***It's Our Money!"/>
			<outline text="It's getting tougher and tougher to believe in the justice part of our justice system. Now, it's the Justice Deptartment's turn to make a mockery of what's just in its preening and crowing about busting the Microsoft-Intuit deal. Ann Bingaman -- Janet Reno's antitrust hatchet-person -- proclaimed Microsoft's dropping the Intuit deal a &quot;major victory for American consumers.&quot; Hello? Has she ever used a computer? To me, this smells like a giant setback to consumers, who will be delayed in the benefits they might otherwise receive through the efficiencies of electronic shopping and other transactions. "/>
			<outline text="What really burns me about this position is that Bingaman and Co. are presenting the American public with a cynical deception. In the guise of defending the American consumer, what the Justice Dept. has really done is defend one of America's special interests -- the banking industry -- which uses very heavyhanded anti-consumer business practices. "/>
			<outline text="Have we already forgotten the savings and loan debacle and the fact that we're still paying dearly for it? The government and the banking system have long been in collusion to take advantage of hapless consumers, and I'm sure we all have dismal personal experiences with the banking industry that make any kind of support problem I've ever had with Microsoft look trivial. "/>
			<outline text="I don't have all the exact numbers at my fingertips, but fairly simple arithmetic can demonstrate that Microsoft just isn't that big a company to warrant the kind of antitrust paranoia that the Justice Deptartment has been promulgating. If you look at Microsoft's annual revenues, it's apparent that it only controls a small, single-digit portion of the computer industry. It's hard to make a case that a company with a small amount of the pie can be making such egregious violations of antitrust law. "/>
			<outline text="My dad was an IBM lifer, and when I grew up, IBM really did control most of the worldwide computer market -- and their antitrust suit was ultimately dropped by the government. Today's market is much more diverse and open to competition as evidenced by the rapidly changing fortunes of all the various computer companies. Remember, it was just a few short years ago when Lotus was the dominant company in the industry with twice the annual revenue of Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="Certainly, Microsoft isn't lily white -- the per CPU license deal with OEMs definitely went over the line -- but Microsoft is far from being a monopoly. Maybe if it ever gets to the point where it has 80 percent of all software revenue, we can accuse it of being a monopoly. In the meantime, it's just incredibly successful, which has a lot of people in a jealous rage. "/>
			<outline text="The Justice Dept.'s attitude should definitely be a wake-up call to the computer industry. Despite the enormous contributions that we are making to the economy and to our culture, the government doesn't like us and is out to protect its vested special interests, such as big banking, rather than help what I think most of us believe the most dynamic force, not just in our country, but on the planet today. "/>
			<outline text="My cynical thought is that government will remain a dirty business for some time to come, and the only way the computer industry will be able to get what it deserves is to do a better job at playing along -- which I interpret as a need for a more effective computer lobby. I've got to believe the banking lobby somehow influenced the Justice Dept. and yet the only lobbying the computer industry can respond with is the SPA -- what a joke. By distracting the industry with stupid small-potatoes like software piracy, the SPA is denying the industry the benefits of a truly effective lobbying organization that would work at a much higher level to garner an appropriate place for computer technology in national policy. "/>
			<outline text="Because ours is a new industry that's most been self-reliant, we've never faced the fact that we have to work against the system to make progress. Now that computers are playing a broader role in society, it's even more critical to educate the government and our lawmakers about the issues that we face and how the system can work with rather than against us. I hate the idea of lobbyists manipulating the system, but if we don't fight fire with fire, we're the ones who will wind up getting burned. "/>

He's going to make our software more emotive and interesting from a human perspective. Show us the way! And he brings something we don't have -- real money for new creative projects. In Silicon Valley, Levy says &quot;a production budget in the low seven figures requires a deep breath and a dispensation from the venture capitalists.&quot; True! Ridiculous! Grrrrr. In Silicon Valley we think money is the *most* precious thing. In Hollywood, a low-budget movie from an unknown producer gets $10 million to play with. It seems the LA venture bankers take a risk every once in a while!"/>

			<outline text="Want to be the next DaveNet? Then you need to get a song playing over and over again while you're writing a piece. Your fingers should to travel over the keyboard to the beat of the music. Your shoulders should rock from side to side as you type the text. Get a good song going and the piece just writes itself. Every beat is a key. Every pause finishes a sentence. Sometimes it's a challenge to make the words match the flow of the music. A good keyboard helps."/>
			<outline text="Today's piece comes to you courtesy of The Indigo Girls, the song is Ghost, from their Rites of Passage CD. It's a sentimental song about lost love. The Mississippi River starts as a stream in Minnesota that you can walk across in five steps. When it flows to the Gulf of Mexico it's so broad, it fills the whole state of Louisiana. "/>
			<outline text="Love starts as a pinprick to the heart. When it ends, it rushes right thru. Signals cross. Love gets lost. The girls are whispering in hushes. Love is killing them, they'd walk into the fingers of the fire willingly. They're in love with a ghost."/>

			<outline text="I missed Bill Gates on NBC last Friday night. But I'm getting lots of email about this show. The most interesting message came from Caryn Shalita, caryn@sfm.com. She says: &quot;It may be silly, but I like having products made by companies that don't just fake a good vibe!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Yeah! Caryn comes from Los Angeles; not Seattle or Silicon Valley. She's an actress and webmaster and music nut."/>
			<outline text="And I have lots to say about this. Right on. I hear a lot of dissonant notes from Bill's customers, which include some of his competitors. And Microsoft hasn't been able to muster an acceptable response to any of the claims that have been rattling around the corridors in the groups-of-ten of DaveNet mailings. "/>
			<outline text="I get a mixture of negative and positive vibes from Microsoft. For the second time I've had the accusatory finger pointed back at me, when I was just the messenger, relaying a thoughtful flame from a competitor this time -- last time it was from a customer. I've seen them swarm all over a user and now a developer. It would be nice if they took us at face value. They could learn and grow. Be a better company. And deserve our support because their vibes could be seen as a positive thing, not a dangerous thing."/>
			<outline text="Yes, Microsoft is dangerous. But so is a lot of life. We may be outraged, but we have to be careful. They *do* have a right to exist. Bill is right, there were risks involved. I remember back when Windows 3.0 shipped, it wasn't a slam-dunk. Should they be deprived of the harvest now? No way! It's still not a slam-dunk. Read InfoWorld. Windows 95 in in trouble. "/>

			<outline text="Dave Carlick, dsc@poppe.com, sends the Bill Gates Joke of the Week:"/>
			<outline text="God calls Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and Bill Gates into his office and says, &quot;The world will end in 30 days. Go back and tell your people.&quot; So, Boris Yeltsin goes to the Russian people and says, &quot;I have bad news and I have worse news. The bad news is that we were wrong, there *is* a God. The worse news is that the world will end in 30 days.&quot; Bill Clinton goes on TV and tells the American people, &quot;I have good news and I have bad news. The good news is that the basic family values upon which we have based our lives on are right-- there is a God.  The bad news is that the world will end in 30 days.&quot; Bill Gates goes to his executive committee and says, &quot;I have great news and I have fabulous news. The great news is that God thinks I'm important. The fabulous news is that we don't have to ship Windows '95!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="It's not easy being Bill. He's the focal point of a lot of negative energy. I get a very small taste of that every time one of my pieces appears in Wired or HotWired. Negative energy in my inbox, from people who are angry with their mothers or fathers or life in general, and decide to let me have it! It's getting easier to push it back, and it makes me a better, stronger person to learn to let go of *their* pain. I'm not here to make these strangers happy."/>
			<outline text="Bill must get a *mountain* of negative energy. I got a glimpse of this back in an earlier round of email with Bill, a few months ago, when Word 6.0 for the Mac was The Big Problem. Bill said &quot;I'm getting ten times more flames on this than anything else.&quot; Yes, Bill reads his email. And he's effected by it. Good for him and good for Microsoft. It's an amazing thing that he soaks up all that negative energy, processes it, and deals with it. It's hard to make these things positive. Because sometimes people must think Bill is their mother, just as some people think I am! The numbers must be much higher for Bill."/>
			<outline text="But it goes the other way. Sometimes Microsoft people unleash their personal anger and direct it at the wrong place. I've seen it happen..."/>
			<outline text="***A Microsoft Story"/>
			<outline text="At last year's System Design Review, an annual assembly of the top developers from the leading software companies, a party thrown by Microsoft, I made the mistake of getting on the wrong bus. "/>
			<outline text="I was supposed to be on the bus for other-company developers. Instead, by accident, I got on a bus for Microsoft employees. It was dark. I was quiet. I listened to the sounds of Microsoft internal people talking about the developers that were attending the conference."/>
			<outline text="Oh the personal side of Microsoft -- not a pretty sight! These people are not Bill Gates clones. Petty personal comments, disrespect, childish arrogance. It reminded me of the Apple of the 80s, elitist and insulated. I felt ashamed to be at this conference. I thought it was a sign of respect from Microsoft to be included, and I'm sure it actually was -- from the top of the company. They saw me as an important developer, even though there were no revenues at UserLand to support that belief. They believed in me, personally. And that was before DaveNet happened, my public presence was almost nil at the time. The respect came from the top of the company. From the troops I was just another one of the hopeless bozos that were going to be crushed by the new Big Blue Machine of Redmond. I heard them saying that in the dark quiet of Microsoft's corporate bus."/>
			<outline text="I realized that Microsoft is just another company. Hiring from the general talent pool created by the American education system. Young people who mistakenly believe that they have extra insight into the world just because they work at a successful company. You can see Bill fighting against this, reminding his troops over and over that the competition has to be taken seriously, to be respected, to be feared. They require energy, intelligence and creativity to be dispensed with. You can't just roll over them with mediocrity. But it must be a losing battle, even for a man of Gates's intensity and intelligence. Microsoft, with 17,000 people, is less and less Gates, and more and more average. It has to be that way."/>
			<outline text="I believe Bill's epitaph will be a slightly above-average company, as long as he is willing to be this intense. If he ever lets go, and lets Microsoft run itself, it will revert to the norm -- an American company with all its weaknesses and self-serving agendas."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***&lt;a name=&quot;whycompanies&quot;&gt;Why companies?&lt;/a&gt;"/>
			<outline text="All this leads me to the real question -- why does Caryn expect great software to come from companies? What evidence is there that companies are the ideal organizational structure for creative, timely and interesting software products? Is any other creative business structured this way? Can you imagine the Indigo Girls singing in three-piece suits? Making their bosses happy? And their boss's boss? And on and on. Add enough CYA and inspiration and good vibes are drowned in corporate agendas, petty egos and ass-kissing. I'm not questioning the premise of Microsoft specifically; just the mistaken idea that software is something vastly different from other forms of creativity. It isn't."/>
			<outline text="It's always been frustrating to me to have my products evaluated based on the size of the company it comes from. I've never met a company that could host my software without interfering. I've tried to compromise with the corporate model. But to hit the mark, I have to zig and zag, try out new ideas, learn and tweak, and go back and do it again. Most corporations have real problems with that approach. The Board of Directors wants detailed plans, head trips that predict exactly how a song is going to turn out. They want to see the numbers. I gave them the numbers they wanted, but they were lies. Eventually I had to divorce myself from the corporate scene. You can't build software out of lies."/>
			<outline text="I've even seen software CEOs ask analysts to tell them what kinds of products they should make! What exactly is their contribution? Why be a software CEO if you don't trust your own intuition to tell you what kinds of products to make? Most analysts don't use the stuff. Same with CEOs."/>
			<outline text="Sure, Hollywood is no panacea. They have fat sweaty mindless executives posturing and pretending they understand what's going on. Remember the Dogs Watching TV. But at least in LA they celebrate the individual. A movie makes a personal statement, not a corporate one. I've seen movies with fat sweaty mindless execs playing supporting roles to screenplay writers and actors who hate them. Who backed those movies??? Cute!"/>
			<outline text="Corporations may appear to be devoid of emotions. Actually they are emotional breweries, but they are in denial. Dave, you're being emotional again, I've heard it over and over. Yeah! So what! My software comes from the heart. But the software industry wants to deny that. They want a sterile lab environment that spits out products that get four stars from PC Week Labs. Untouched by human hands. Good luck! That's Bill's game. You can't win by zigging when he zigs. You have to zag to beat Gates. He must know that. When will you guys figure it out?"/>
			<outline text="I see this unrealistic trust in the corporate system everywhere I go. John Doerr trusts MacroMedia, but forgets Marc Canter, the genius who made Director happen. The world buys into Doerr's deals because they think Marc is still there. He isn't. No doubt MacroMedia has smarts, but the blood of the company's creativity flows thru Marc's veins, not Bud Colligan's."/>
			<outline text="It's time for minds to bend. You don't know what the market wants. Accept that. Let people with talent and passion experiment with new ideas. Bet on people with track records, like the entertainment industry does, and accept the probability that you can't pick the next Forrest Gump or Pulp Fiction. Sheryl Crow appeared to be washed up, so did Bonnie Raitt. Look who's on top of the heap now! "/>
			<outline text="We miss many dynamics in the software business. The venture capitalists *are* greedy, as I've said before. They trust people they can own. If you have an opinion they don't want to deal with you. But that's not how you make money. Freedom of expression is the raw material that great software is made out of. You can't control it or you lose it. You get what you pay for. Control the people and you get predictable boring bloated late software."/>
			<outline text="Great passionate ideas make money. Lucky great passionate ideas make lots of money. To the money people: relax, spread it around, and hope you get lucky!"/>

I never use sarcasm in email, it doesn't work. If I say something, that's what I mean; never the opposite. "/>
			<outline text="We need help here in Silicon Valley. We're stuck playing the same tapes over and over. Head trips everywhere. Creative people need to be set free and given the resources they need, so products can be great and timely. Money is *not* the most precious thing. Passion and talent is. I don't care if the money comes from Steven Spielberg or Bill Gates or John Doerr. We'll know when the dam is ready to burst, a studio in Silicon Valley, that really celebrated the individual creator will be a huge win."/>

It was a world of holocausts, depressions and world wars. My generation grew up with the new reality of nuclear holocaust. Our parents didn't have any answers to our questions. We believed that the world would commit suicide before we'd have a chance to live. We really believed that! We may have been the first generation to realize at a such an early age that our parents couldn't protect us. "/>

But you have to listen, because while they are us, they are also different from us. Their world is different from ours. And the world they want to create will blow you away if you just listen. "/>

A single voice actually has a lot of power. And remember to respect yourself! Your dreams are important, they are raw material of the world we all will live in someday.

			<outline text="***The Bus"/>
			<outline text="by Rick Segal, rsegal@microsoft.com"/>
			<outline text="Dave, I've read your essay over again. And over again. And over. I decided to take the thinking approach to responding. Since I was one of those folks hanging out at Kinkos at 3am the night before, I was surprised to read your System Design Review comments. "/>
			<outline text="I could take the corporate silliness approach and give you the &quot;sorry, not condoned, etc, etc&quot; speech. I think, however, some balance needs to be put on your observations."/>
			<outline text="First, your observation about Bill fighting against the rising tide of arrogance and disrespect for the competition. Yep, he probably does send a mail message or two on this topic. What you may not see is the hundreds of senior management types around here actually paying attention. You are sadly mistaken if you believe that one guy is pissing in the wind because we have an educational system that produces arrogant, know it all, wise mouth twits. "/>
			<outline text="The SDR is a great case in point. This is not some lip service exercise, Dave, it is a serious no kidding attempt to make sure we are moving in the right direction from a systems point of view. This starts with the developer relations team putting together the issues and then being relentless in making sure material is available and that presenters show up and talk to people."/>
			<outline text="You speak on both sides, Dave. On the one hand, glad to be invited, on the other ashamed because some pimple brigade has a brain cramp on the bus. If that bus had Brad Chase, Brad Silverberg, Doug Henrich, Paul Maritz, Pete Higgins, John Ludwig, Dave Culter, Dave Beaver, Brad Struss, or any of the people who were the core of the SDR, then we would be in trouble. Really serious trouble. But that bus didn't have those people on it so I'm not ready to leap to the conclusions that you do."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has a unique culture which is to put it mildly. The company starts with the billy bad ass interview process and then we do meetings and put it on the table to compare sizes. To bring an idea to the table, bring your flak jacket and make damn sure you have your act together or prepare to die. Having come from the US Air Force and Aetna, it is a never ending source of amusement for me to watch some of these tribal antics."/>
			<outline text="Over the years, however, I have learned that this free wheeling stuff does actually produce results when managed correctly. There are side effects. Loud mouth, tired people in a bus, making stupid comments is one of those side effects. Again, it is a quite a leap to believe you have found the secret soul or personal side of Microsoft.  You haven't."/>
			<outline text="The personal sides are the people that try really really hard to make great products. The personal sides are the people in developer relations who spend everyday fighting those same goobers on the bus. We bang on em and bang on em until they get it. Most learn. The personal sides are the hundreds of people who work in systems and do nothing but talk to customers about what we can do to improve.

			<outline text="You're also right about about Microsoft's support for developers. Over the years, I have tried to use Microsoft's excellent support as a lever to convince Apple to upgrade their developer process. "/>
			<outline text="About Symantec, yes Gordon eats red meat. I've always admired that about Symantec. But are they the Software Studio? At one point in its history that was the company's mission -- I know -- I was a board member and a large Symantec shareholder. But it has become one of the most corporate of the corporate developers. And it has trouble holding onto the talent. Perhaps the Norton group is the exception? The Norton guys have always been great carnivores, and it's really nice to see that tradition continue, years after merging with Symantec."/>

			<outline text="***What's the rush?"/>
			<outline text="My friend Barton, one of the CyberGRRLs, author of the hilarious and truthful Love 101, webwaster of the Barton website, writes: &quot;I almost commented on the over/under 30 thing. And maybe I still will. After all, it won't be much longer before I go past that never-turn-back barrier.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I replied: &quot;My observation on turning 40, probably relates to turning 30 too, is that you do a lot more processing before the milestone than after it. You have ten years to figure this one out. What's the rush?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***Bells-for-All!"/>
			<outline text="I now have two computers set up next to each other, connected by Ethernet. It's fast. I have scripts set up on Machine #1, the one that's in front of my face, that allow me to press one key to move the selected thing over to the other machine, where it immediately starts running. "/>
			<outline text="I can move processes over to the other machine, and I can say what those processes do. If any operation can be expressed in a script, and if it takes a long time to run, I like to give it to the other machine to process. Gradually, over time, I think I'll get all my time consuming processes off my desktop and running on the net. I wonder if I'm the only person in the world who has such a sweet setup. "/>
			<outline text="There's a loop closing here -- I used to do things like this when I was a grad student in Madison, back in the late 70s. I was a Unix guy back then, when Unix was new. We were tripping out on the power of networked multi-user computers. They are much more interesting playgrounds than single-user computers. But back then, most of my cross-CPU scripts were experiments, instead of making me more powerful, they were tests to see if something could be done. "/>
			<outline text="They were of the &quot;bells-for-all&quot; variety, they annoyed other people but amused me. Oh there goes Winer again. Yeah! The tunes were crude, but it was fun to watch the bell cursor move around the net. You could actually *hear* the network. It was stereo, back when stereo was kind of new too."/>
			<outline text="So now the loop closes, I've got a network that's actually doing work for me. When I was younger, I knew the day would come. Now it has. "/>
			<outline text="Pinch me!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***The Interactive Website"/>
			<outline text="Back in the early 80s I did a bulletin-board system called LBBS. It was to be the cornerstone product of my first company, Living Videotext. It ran out of the living room of my Menlo Park apartment. It was a single-user BBS, ran on an Apple II with a 10 megabyte Corvus hard drive. Lots of pioneers in Silicon Valley used LBBS, including Tim Oren of CompuServe and Anthony Bay of Microsoft. "/>
			<outline text="LBBS morphed into TankCentral, which ran on the IBM PC, and served as our internal email system at Living Videotext. ThinkTank, our premier product, was conceived as the client for TankCentral. But the world was into standalone productivity apps, so we developed in other directions. TankCentral turned out to be a useful incubator, not a commercial product."/>
			<outline text="Another loop closes! I took a few days at the end of last week to bring the TankCentral concept to the worldwide web, thru the power of CGI scripting. I'm doing an interactive website. I'm loving it. The web is really very powerful. Until I explored CGIs I didn't understand just *how* powerful it is."/>
			<outline text="My new software implements a hierarchic and sequentially threaded bulletin-board. Every message lives in both structures. The BBS runs on the worldwide web. You use Netscape or a compatible browser to navigate thru the bulletin-board database. It's a two-way BBS -- you can reply to messages. It's a web-hosted bulletin-board, and I want it to the best one out there."/>
			<outline text="As we watch IBM acquire Lotus I wonder if they know how easily Notes functionality can be created using the Internet as the networking backbone? The value of Notes becomes the agility and power of the Notes development tools, assuming they can navigate the product to really live on the Internet. Lots of challenges for Gerstner and Manzi. "/>
			<outline text="We got there first, over here in MacLand, with a very agile operating system, and great architecture at the server. Who needs OpenDoc when you have Chuck Shotton? OS/2 and Unix guys sniff at the Mac OS. When they see what we can do, they'll have to stop sniffing."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, all this exploring has made it possible for me to see web browser clients, such as Netscape, in a whole new light. They are just terminal programs! The result is much prettier, because instead of one scrolling page you get an infinite number of scrolling pages, subject to their ability to manage that infinity. The Bookmarks menu and the History menu are humble first steps at managing that complexity. Much more can be done here. "/>
			<outline text="Web browsers are prettier terminal programs, but in some ways they aren't as powerful as the old ones. How do I make the user's speaker beep? In the old days I'd send an ASCII BELL character to the terminal, and a beep would emit from the user's speaker. If you hit a wall, tried to jump off the edge of the database, you'd hear about it. These days I am without audio communication. As a software designer, this is a frustrating limit."/>
			<outline text="So the web is a step forward and a step  backward. The networking architecture of the web is totally wonderful. The script writer part of my personality is totally psyched! But the user interface tools are primitive. The UI for my BBS is not much better than the UIs I could do back in the VisiCalc era. They're not even as user friendly as the UI of Lotus 1-2-3 generation."/>
			<outline text="***Three needed features"/>
			<outline text="I've identified three things that would help me enormously at building more cushy pages for interactive websites. I decided to release these requests to the whole web community. If Netscape doesn't want to specifically support interactive websites, maybe other browser developers want to specialize in this area?"/>
			<outline text="Feature #1: Allow a set of menus to be delivered with each page. The menus display inside the web browser window. Each menu item has a name, which is displayed in the menu, and a CGI script that executes when the user chooses the command. It's a simple extension of the current &quot;select&quot; feature in HTML forms."/>
			<outline text="Feature #2: A real text editor. The current form-based text editing in Netscape is buggy. Word wrap doesn't work. Paste has problems. No Undo."/>
			<outline text="Feature #3: Expand and collapse outlines in web pages. The web already knows about outlines. But they're static, you can't expand and collapse. Ugh. "/>
			<outline text="Interactivity in websites is going to be important. The first browser developer that embraces interactivity will clean up."/>

			<outline text="I got an intriguing email from an analyst at a well-known industry consulting company, the kind of company that goes on the record in rewritten press releases that puff about various product releases in trade pubs like InfoWorld and PC Week. Are you a product manager at a large company introducing a new product? This guy is on your press tour. He asked not to be quoted, and I'll respect that request. "/>
			<outline text="The basic message: Microsoft sends guys out on tour who blow arrogantly and naively, dispensing the competition even though Microsoft doesn't have the answer. "/>
			<outline text="The story is chilling. I've been on these kinds of press tours myself, and believe that the blase attitude of the analysts supports this kind of arrogance. The fact that my correspondent didn't speak on the record is indication that they're having independence problems. If he's upset by Microsoft's attitude, why isn't that being reported in the press reports he lends his name to?"/>
			<outline text="This industry needs to have its house cleaned. Not just at Microsoft, we have to clean up the commentary system too, so the truth has a chance of getting out. And that means we need more voices that aren't scared of the truth. And reporters who can spot a story even if it isn't pitched by a PR firm and backed up by a press kit. "/>

			<outline text="He chose an obscure 60s style coffee shop in Los Altos for the meeting. He said it was a safe place. Most other restaurants in Silicon Valley are crawling with software industry people who might care about what we were talking about. "/>
			<outline text="I liked the place. I had banana pancakes, orange juice and coffee."/>
			<outline text="We talked about lots of stuff. Dan had a message for me, which I can't talk about. My message to Dan: we've got a community here that works passionately for the platform. We're breaking thru on lots of fronts. Apple should become part of that community, accept its role as an equal, not a dominator. Get out of our way and magic can happen. Stop spending so much money developing the expensive way. If you evacuate an area, share the news. Encourage other investors to play in the Mac world."/>
			<outline text="I've been hearing grumbling sounds from Mac OS licensess, that their deal with Apple doesn't include rights to future operating systems. I told Dan I thought this was self-defeating. They're making my decision easy -- if the cloners don't have Apple's most current OS, then the old one is the standard I'll develop to. I don't have to look at any new Apple stuff, I'll code for the least common denominator. That's the way it works out here in DeveloperLand. If the cloners don't have the latest and greatest, Apple won't be able to move the platform forward. They're undermining all of Apple's current development efforts by restricting its flow."/>
			<outline text="I also asked that Apple establish a Mac-based web farm, as IBM is establishing a RS6000-based web farm. Turn eWorld into an Internet Service Provider, providing a smooth channel for Mac users to get on the net, much the same way Microsoft is smoothing the way for Windows users with UUnet."/>

			<outline text="Over the Memorial Day weekend I read Gary Wolf's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netropolis.be/dialectrique/docs/xanadu.html&quot;&gt;excellent piece&lt;/a&gt; on Ted Nelson and the Xanadu project. When I got back, I sent an email to Gary, and we got into a bit of a dialog on Nelson, whose ideas were a strong influence on me early in my career as a commercial software developer."/>
			<outline text="I was afraid, when I heard that this piece was in the works, that it would be another puff piece about how Ted has taken the future by the balls, and is going to completely revolutionize the software industry, and in one swoop, obsolete everthing that's out there."/>
			<outline text="As a mentor, Nelson has frustrated me enormously. He saw the complete picture when I was only getting a glimpse at the parts. I was already working on my first outliner, back in the late 70s, when a friend told me that I had to check out Nelson's Computer Lib book because many of his ideas sounded like the things I was saying at the time."/>
			<outline text="How true! Nelson's book tied together a lot of ideas for me. And taught me that there were smart people that had already implemented some of the ideas I was playing with. It was disappointing to discover this, I thought everything I was doing was completely original and revolutionary! It was a letdown to find out that others had thought of this stuff before I did, and they weren't waiting for me! But I sucked in my breath and made the best of it. I loved personal computers, and I could make these hypertext ideas work on machines like the Apple II, and eventually the IBM PC and the Macintosh."/>
			<outline text="I remember meeting Nelson for the first time, in 1979, at the West Coast Computer Faire in San Francisco. Of all the people in the new software business, Nelson was the one I wanted to meet the most. It made my day when he blessed my software, an early version of ThinkTank, by saying &quot;this is a virtuality!&quot; Yes. That is the highest compliment a person who appreciates software can pay to someone who makes software. It's like telling a movie director or novelist that he or she succeeded in drawing you into their world. It's called suspension of disbelief. If a program completely sucks you into its world, if you can forget for a moment or two that there's a world outside of you and your computer screen, I won. I sweat the details so that you will be entranced."/>
			<outline text="But then, instead of telling other people how wonderful my software was, Nelson ignored it. He hurt me. I wanted the acceptance and support of a man that I respected deeply. Then, even worse, he turned into a mockery of me. Hopelessly fumbling at a task he was incapable of. "/>
			<outline text="The press bought it totally. Dogs watching TV! John Sculley sold it. Bill Atkinson usurped it. Instead of being a force for good, Nelson fed all the detours and white boys of the software industry. Feeding them high-calorie unsatisfying software visions. Fizzwater. Burp material. No gut quality. No suspension of disbelief. They fed off Nelson! He was victimized, but he was also party to it."/>
			<outline text="Why didn't we have his voice, a happy one, pointing people to progress, parts of the solution, real new shipping software. Virtualities! We implemented the technology of hypertext, step by step, but the world was focused on other things. Ted taught them them to ignore the breakthroughs that were being delivered. Holding back the clock so *he* could be the industrialist of hypertext. It made me very sad and angry. The wonderful collaboration I had hoped for had turned into a circus of bullshit."/>
			<outline text="I expected Wired to do the usual, to go with the flow, to talk about Ted's latest attempt to deliver what's already being delivered. Instead, they told the real story; their spin on it, but one very close to mine. I felt we could move on now. Maybe Nelson would read this piece and decide to become part of the leading edge, instead of trying to take on the whole software industry, again!"/>
			<outline text="Sadly, when I got back from my Memorial Day trip, I had an email from Nelson, ted@hyper.sec.or.jp. I've put the full text of the email on the web. It was more of the same. He accuses Wired of libel. Xanadu is still in development and viable. It was classic neo-Nelson, the post-Dream Machines man who gained traction as a comentator, but wasn't satisfied. Nelson in denial. Avoiding the growth. "/>
			<outline text="If he could just let go of his belief that he needs to do the software himself, go thru the pain, the world would open up to him. I'd love to show Ted the new stuff I'm working on. I bet he'd like it! But I have a feeling that the meeting would go otherwise. We'd talk about how the world has wronged him. "/>
			<outline text="Ted, where ever you are, I hate to see you suffer. The world is only fucked up if you choose to view it that way. Turn in a different direction. It'll look great! "/>

			<outline text="Dave: "/>
			<outline text="Your points about the baby boom generation having lost touch with the youth movement that computers and the online revolution represent was a good one, but what really struck me was, shortly after I read your essay, stumbling across a list of the names of the 16 Senators who voted against the Communications Decency Act."/>
			<outline text="To a dittohead, the list reads like a roll-call of the &quot;usual suspects&quot; of the East Coast liberal establishment (Edward Kennedy, Joseph Biden, Daniel P. Moynihan), but at a closer glance there are interesting exceptions. Patty Murray of Washington voted against the act. She campaigned as &quot;a mom in tennis shoes,&quot; and is the kind of person you'd expect to want to &quot;protect kids&quot; no matter what. So did Charles Robb of my home state, Virginia. "/>
			<outline text="You see, Dave, the sixteen Senators who voted against Exon are essentially the only sixteen people in the Senate who either learned the lessons of the sixties while they were cutting their teeth as politicians (Moynihan, Kennedy) or who were involved more actively, such as Robb, who was an officer on the front lines in Vietnam who later spoke out against the war in spite of the fact that LBJ was his father-in-law! And you may say that Patty Murray voted against it to appease the lobbyists from Microsoft and other Washington-based high-tech firms, but at least it shows she's in touch with the zeitgeist."/>
			<outline text="As I see it, people who were in a position to learn the lessons of the sixties never made a concentrated effort to enter mainstream politics and transform things from within, with the result that the US Senate is very old, very white and very isolated. If the Exon bill had originated in the House, it never would have passed in the form that it did -- because the House (last November notwithstanding) is way more pluralistic, diverse and young than the Senate. I may hate Newt Gingrich, but I do respect him, and I know that as a major SciFi fan who made the famous &quot;let-them-eat-laptops&quot; speech, he would have risen to the occasion and denounced it had it come up for a vote on his watch."/>

			<outline text="I don't think we took full advantage of those opportunities. Look where we're at, less than thirty years later and we're repeating the mistakes. The Exon bill may be the equivalent of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. The people of the Internet, an international crowd, are confused and dismayed. There are so many parallels. In high tech today the USA is the major world power. Before Vietnam we were the world's policeman. The judgement of our political leaders may be as disastrous now as it was in the sixties."/>

			<outline text="Important: if you sign on, please leave a message in the Scratchpad section. To really burn this stuff in I need people to create lots of messages. "/>
			<outline text="Other facts: It's running on a PowerMac 8100 with WebStar 1.1. The ISDN connection can be a problem so please try again. The bbs will go off the air in a few days, this is a limited time offer. Act now!"/>

			<outline text="The web is so darned dynamic. It's cool. "/>
			<outline text="But what trails will historians have 100 years from now of the initial boom of growth that launched online as a fundamental form of human communication? "/>
			<outline text="Solution: I'd like to participate in a quick project to freeze the worldwide web on January 1, 1996, back it up, and bury the hard disk. Transmit the archive to the nearest solar system that might have intelligent life. "/>

			<outline text="***The Little Bird"/>
			<outline text="This DaveNet essay comes courtesy of Annie Lennox. I've got her &quot;Little Bird&quot; song from the Diva album in repeat mode running on the PowerPC that's also running my bbs. Annie is angry! She teaches us that (my my my) you reap what you sow. It's another way of saying what goes around comes around. That's one of life's big lessons. Annie expresses it very well. "/>
			<outline text="I have my own Little Bird song. What if a little bird landed on your shoulder and whispered in your ear, &quot;you can have anything you want.&quot; What would you ask for? Another adage applies. Be careful what you ask for, you might just get it. "/>
			<outline text="In fact, I think that little bird is always perched there, always giving us exactly what we want. The key to being happy is to just want good things for yourself. Know what your inner self wants, really wants, and ask for it."/>
			<outline text="So many people want money. What they're really asking for is security. White picket fences. But I think very few inner children are satisfied with the fences. At one point in my life I thought I wanted money. So I got it. It took me five years to figure out that security is an illusion. Go ahead, get the white picket fences. I got mine! But until I was ready to grow again, to become more than my money-wishes had imagined for me, my world was black and white. My inner child threw a three year tantrum. &quot;This isn't what I wanted!&quot; screamed the little boy inside of me. "/>
			<outline text="So many people waste so many years trying to ignore the little child. Our parents told us to grow up. That really means stop listening to yourself! That's what our parents wanted to do, to stop listening to themselves. If they listened to their children they'd have to listen to themselves. A vicious cycle. If we're not very careful we pass it on to our kids."/>
			<outline text="I can't speak for *your* child, but mine now speaks very clearly to me. What does my little boy want? Love, play, creativity, fun, freedom, sharing. These things make me happy. Not scared of living. Thriving and accomplishing. Part of the world. Smiling and humming, rolling and flowing, deep and rich, even if something &quot;bad&quot; just happened. Material value doesn't show up in this equation. I don't look at my balance sheet for a clue to how happy I am. It isn't what you have, it's how much fun you have, that makes you rich."/>
			<outline text="It's nice that as I've lived more, I now understand what singers are singing about. Why flowers are so pretty. Why even a blistering hot summer day offers so many opportunities for fun and learning."/>
			<outline text="Take-away message: The little bird is you. Listen!"/>

Yes, the critical test case, more than one message being created at the same moment, happened several times. The synchronization semaphores worked perfectly. Some bugs were uncovered, of course -- and we hit some limits, but the workarounds are clear. There will be bugfixes and new features. Dig we must!"/>
			<outline text="I learned a lot about the user interface issues, and why the work I've been doing with the Netscape guys is going to pay off big time when they ship their next Macintosh release. We need more control of the user interface of the browser, specifically we need to be able to add commands to the browser's menu bar. Luckily, with the next release of Netscape we will be able to do exactly that. The various commands that now appear on each website page will be in the menu bar of the browser, where they always belonged."/>

			<outline text="I'm releasing the source code for the bbs. Yo! Anyone with a Macintosh running Webstar 1.1 can have an interactive website! This should be fun."/>
			<outline text="I just made a pass over the initial setup and in the process invented a fictional young couple, Don &amp; Marie Packard, who live in Telluride, Colorado. Don works for a major telecommunications company. Marie manages all the restaurants at the Telluride Ski Resort. They have an interactive website that they use to share news with their families, to discuss river rafting, and to help organize events for the local PTA."/>
			<outline text="After you install the BBS software, and connect to bbs.welcome.fcgi, you'll be greeted by Don &amp; Marie. Log onto their bbs, you'll see the three main discussion areas, and a &quot;Scratchpad&quot; section. Every BBS should have one, it's the place where all things that don't have a place belong. It's going to be the most active discussion section on every Home Page, I'm sure of it."/>
			<outline text="Then you should go in and change the topics and welcome text, using the text editor, outliner and table editor in Frontier. Set it all up for your stated purposes. Tell us who you are! Be a leader. By running a BBS that's what you're signing up for."/>
			<outline text="You'll need to download two things to get this setup working. First, you need the Aretha release of Frontier. That's at http://www.hotwired.com/userland/aretha/"/>

			<outline text="Launch the Frontier app, Double-click on the BBS Installer script. You now have a BBS. That part is really easy."/>
			<outline text="Then find a friend who knows Frontier and explore the new stuff in Frontier.root. A log is created by the installer script. Cmd-2click each name to jump to the newly installed tables and scripts. This is not for the faint of heart!

Be prepared for the suites.bbs table to change. "/>
			<outline text="But it's OK if you want to completely diverge from my release. If you get an idea of how to do it much better, go for it! I look forward to being able to kick back and watch you all improve on the foundation I've built."/>

			<outline text="For my July vacation I took an 11-day, 100-hour course in massage. I did this last year too. It was incredible experience the first time, and no less incredible the second time. "/>
			<outline text="One of my classmates said &quot;you learn so much more than massage at these classes.&quot; Amen! Eleven days with lots of stretching, and it's not only your muscles that get stretched. This time it was my view of the world, life and love, and most important, myself -- that got the big stretches."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I'm aware that some of my readers are uncomforable with talk about bodies. If so, skip this DaveNet piece, I promise to write about technology again, real soon. On the other hand, if you've been living exclusively in your head, like a lot of people do, you might find this piece to be an interesting stretch, a challenging change of pace in an intellectual way."/>
			<outline text="***I learned"/>
			<outline text="I learned that there are two fundamental opposing forces in the world, love and fear. Equal amounts of love and fear cancel each other out. Negative energy is pure fear. Positive energy is pure love. "/>
			<outline text="We invent a lot of words for love: fun, friend, play, share, create, passion. In the mathematics of the spirit they are identical to love, and they are equally cancelled out by fear."/>
			<outline text="I want my life to be love. To do so, I have to overcome my own fears, and the fears of other people. All the living I do comes from love. All the spinning comes from fear. I hide in my fear. "/>
			<outline text="It *is* possible to get your neck to release. If you can send a message of thanks and acknowledgement to the muscles of your neck, if you can send them pure love, they will relax. The trick is learning how to send that message. It can be done. I don't think it matters how locked your neck muscles are. "/>
			<outline text="Friends are great mirrors. Listen to how they view you. It can change how *you* view you. "/>
			<outline text="***Huge Wingspans"/>
			<outline text="I took a great half-day hike on this trip. Up a mountain. A twisty trail that leads to a steep dirt road that loops around a peak, ending at the summit. I round a corner. A spectacular vista opens. A river around a mountain. Swirling rippling twisting hiding. Finding a valley. A town. An airport. Planes taking off and landing. Back to the mountain. Birds with huge wingspans floating soaring flapping gliding searching looking. Back to the town. Streets and roads. Cars moving reflecting turning stopping."/>
			<outline text="Vistas like this are created by love not fear. Generations of mudslides, earthquakes, huge acts of creativity -- and small ones -- births, deaths, shovels, bulldozers, technology. A city in a mountain valley. All there just for me on a cloudless hot July Sunday afternoon."/>
			<outline text="In this spot I was myself. I connected with this place. Everything I gave to it came back to me. For the first time since childhood I wrote poetry. First I roared my lyrics to the valley then I spoke softly. My hands pointed, flowed, following the air currents, following the path of the birds with the huge wingspans."/>
			<outline text="***Look at the big picture"/>
			<outline text="Our world is that valley. Some people are caught in ditches with overheated radiators. And others are soaring and floating. Some are driven by fear. Others are empowered by love."/>
			<outline text="We all have a presence in this world -- our bodies. But we're the only people who can't see our bodies. We have a visual image of who we are, but how real is it? Have you ever seen yourself on videotape? How comfortable is that? It's reality! That's how *everyone else* sees you."/>
			<outline text="It can be confusing too. When I feel small and powerless the world doesn't make any sense. They're scared of me. Why? I couldn't hurt a fly. "/>
			<outline text="I'm a big guy! I'm large like Texas is large. There's a lot of distance between my shoulders. And between my ears."/>
			<outline text="When I feel small, things don't work for me. The world and I are out of synch. No happiness."/>
			<outline text="***What about lions? "/>
			<outline text="A lion's roar can be a fearsome thing. Or an expression of love. It depends on who you are. If you're a lion's prey it's a awesome and awful sound. Death coming! Run!!!!! But if you're a lioness it can be a beautiful sound. It means you are safe. Your babies are safe. There will be food on the table tonite. Your man is a strong being. His power is a source of safety. After dinner, babies asleep, you put your head on his chest and connect with his heart. Dreams are sweet. Your heart sings. Your neck is loose. This is safety. You share love. Everything you give to him comes back."/>
			<outline text="Until a week ago I didn't understand that my body could be a source of safety. Once I understood this, something else clicked, it's a challenge like my &quot;How Bout Them Niners!&quot; piece, released on 1/27/95. I want to confront a wound between our genders, one that we can start healing now. "/>
			<outline text="Men don't have to be abusive. We create them that way. We're one species, half women and half men. Men are created by women to suit their needs and vice versa. If women can let go of the idea that masculine power is something to be feared, there would be more positive masculine power in the world."/>
			<outline text="In other words, men have hearts too. Put your ear to his breast, let his arms come around you, your arms around him. Hold softly. "/>
			<outline text="Breathe. "/>

			<outline text="DaveNet is rolling again! I wasn't sure if it would come back to me. The massage class put me so thoroughly into my Texas-style body. The words just didn't flow like they used to. What, me worry? Of course I'll write again! Just put on a tune, and start writing. This time my back is straighter. My shoulders are loose. But I still have something to say. Thank god!"/>
			<outline text="In yesterday's piece I forgot to thank Annie Lennox for providing the background music for all my bodywork over the last couple of weeks. The song I tuned in to is &quot;Money Can't Buy It&quot; from her Diva album. Annie believes in the power of creation. In the good vibration. She believes in love alone. Yea yea! Annie says &quot;Give up your needs, your poisoned seeds, find yourself elected to a different kind of greed.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Right on Annie. Money can't buy it. I too believe in the power of love alone. "/>
			<outline text="***Namaste Y'all!"/>
			<outline text="If you've been reading DaveNet for a while, you must already know about my two main slogans -- Let's Have Fun! and Dig We Must! I'm always searching for new slogans that don't equate to one of these two. "/>
			<outline text="For example, a big slogan in the massage world is &quot;Namaste,&quot; a  word that means &quot;the divinity in my being acknowledges the divinity in your being.&quot; My American dictionary defines it more technically: &quot;a Hindu gesture of salutation made by placing the palms together, thumbs against the chest, and nodding the head slightly.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="When starting a massage, after grounding, and before touching the body, you can say a Namaste. When you're done, connect at the client's feet, your palms to their arches, breathe, and as you disconnect -- Namaste. The acknowlegement rituals are important, it's how you get ready to share a space with the other being, and it's how you resume your normal solo flight."/>
			<outline text="I added my own twist -- I'd say Namaste Y'all! to my classmates. Belt it out! Big grin on my face. Texas drawl. Down home southern boy. Drop my voice at the end. "/>
			<outline text="It's fun! That clued me in. I've heard this somewhere before..."/>
			<outline text="Let's Have Fun! "/>
			<outline text="Namaste Y'all! "/>
			<outline text="Yes, I think think they're the same thing. My divinity and your divinity connect. That's fun! "/>
			<outline text="Nuf said."/>
			<outline text="***Go with the Flow"/>
			<outline text="I think I found a new slogan, one that isn't covered by either of the previous two. "/>
			<outline text="Visualize this..."/>
			<outline text="You're reclined in an inner tube, your butt in the water, floating down a river. Something cool to drink in one hand. The other hand lingers and floats in the water. The sun is hot. The water is cool. "/>
			<outline text="Along the banks, wildlife lives. Great birds with huge wingspans. Tall trees, colorful flowers. Rocks and mountains. The river goes thru a town. Bridges, parks, picnics, boaters, swimmers. There are forks in the river. Go one way to visit a scenic canyon with cave dweller ruins. The other fork gets you to Pittsburgh. Both are interesting places to visit in different ways."/>
			<outline text="I believe the river can be most cleanly appreciated in a simple inner tube. The simpler the better. Sometimes we try to float with power. No drink in hand, paddling furiously to avoid something that scares you. But the inevitable is always inevitable. Struggling against the flow doesn't work. You get tired, then exhausted, your vision narrows, you spin. It's a whirlpool! There always seems to be a whirlpool waiting for you just after you get thru the rapids. And sometimes the rapids are inside of ourselves, they're not real, they're not the world."/>
			<outline text="No matter. I believe it's always best to just Go with the Flow. "/>
			<outline text="And that's the third DaveNet slogan. "/>
			<outline text="Welcome!"/>
			<outline text="***15,000 people"/>
			<outline text="I promised that I'd get back to technology. Here we go!"/>
			<outline text="Imagine a huge inner tube with 15,000 people on it. The river is too narrow. The water is shallow."/>
			<outline text="About half of the 15,000 people are stationed at the edges of the inner tube, operating huge earth movers. When the raft hits the shore, a common event, they panic, break the earth, trees snap, landslides, creating swamps and scorch. "/>
			<outline text="It's the only way for the huge inner tube to survive."/>
			<outline text="Or is it? Right around a corner is a broad lake. Deep cool water. There's a channel connecting the river to the lake. No earth movers needed. "/>
			<outline text="***Apple and Going with the Flow"/>
			<outline text="The huge raft is Apple."/>
			<outline text="The river is the corporate software market."/>
			<outline text="Developers are on the shoreline."/>
			<outline text="Ouch!"/>
			<outline text="The lake is the Internet client machine market. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of new machines to be sold. Home users. Apple makes sense here."/>
			<outline text="A paradigm shift just like the switch to personal computers, then graphic personal computers. Lots of growth and lots of fun. A coooool drink and warm sunshine."/>
			<outline text="It's sitting there, waiting for Apple to get smart about it."/>
			<outline text="Dig we must!"/>

			<outline text="PS: Flow is actually a technical term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. His last name is pronounced chick-suh- muh-hye-uh. He's from Chicago, via Transylvania, which is part of Rumania. My friend Bernie DeKoven, drfun@global.california.com, talks about flow and knows Csikszentmihalyi, so I asked Bernie for some pointers: &quot;Check out Beyond Boredom and Anxiety (least polished, my favorite), Flow (his most successful book) and The Evolving Self (chaos theory, complexity).&quot;"/>

			<outline text="Over the years I've made many trips to see Microsoft. Bundling deals, technology conferences, design review groups, I even made several trips in 1987 to negotiate Microsoft's acquisition of my first company, Living Videotext. That deal fell thru, but I learned a bunch about the company and the people in all these meetings, and as I've said before, I enjoy the energy of Microsoft."/>
			<outline text="There's an amazing continuity to the company. People who worked there ten years ago tend to still work there. The company has competence and enthusiasm nicely tempered by realism. Things tend to tie together, products have a purpose beyond serving their markets. "/>
			<outline text="There's an intricacy to Microsoft that's interesting to unravel. And you can tell that Microsoft people are trying to unravel it too, which makes them curious about what *you* think, which makes for interesting two-way conversations. I learn something, they learn something. It's cool."/>
			<outline text="***Edgar Martinez, the baseball player"/>
			<outline text="On June 27 I flew from San Jose to Seattle. It was hot and cloudless in San Jose. Same in Seattle! In all my trips up north, this was the first time the weather was perfect. "/>
			<outline text="My first stop was the Seattle KingDome to see the Mariners play the Oakland As. My host was Carl Stork, carls@microsoft.com, a Microsoft executive, co-owner of the Mariners and a DaveNet subscriber from way back. Carl manages Microsoft's relationship with hardware OEMs. We talked about the industry and baseball. "/>
			<outline text="I chuckled when they announced the name of Mariner outfielder Edgar Martinez. I have a Seattle friend whose cat is named Edgar Martinez. Now I know why! "/>
			<outline text="After the game we sat in the Mariners dugout and talked about the baseball business. A bunch of myths exploded. Baseball is in trouble. I could see why."/>
			<outline text="***Trouble at Microsoft"/>
			<outline text="There's trouble at Microsoft too. Like baseball, they've hit a wall, they're struggling to deal with it. The public comments, brave and bold, mask an underlying confusion. They're making a stand. The bundling of MSN isn't really the issue for Microsoft. It's on the battle line, it just happened to be the lightning rod."/>
			<outline text="Distribution of client software is an issue, but more realistically, throughput and uptime and the ability to grow to serve 15 million users are the real issues in the upcoming faceoff in online services. AOL has a huge lead on Microsoft and lots of strategic options. If I were an online information provider, I'd bet on both AOL and MSN.In many ways the bundling of the MSN client with Windows 95 is the best news possible for AOL. Microsoft is going to have trouble supporting all those users. "/>
			<outline text="I think the bundling controversy is a smoke screen. But Microsoft can't give in. For them, a bigger principle is at issue -- the right to evolve their operating system. Microsoft has ambitious plans for Windows. And they have competition: the Mac OS, all flavors of Unix, Oracle, Sybase, Novell, Notes, OS/2. All are planning major growth in the coming years, lines are blurring, even exploding, everywhere, and none of the competition has to deal with the Department of Justice as co-architect of their products."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is powerful. Rumors of a delay in Windows 95 sends the worldwide stock market into a dive. "/>
			<outline text="The Department of Justice is powerful. They're part of the US Government, which has a huge army, navy, air force, and nuclear weapons. "/>
			<outline text="How will this faceoff be resolved?"/>
			<outline text="***The impasse"/>
			<outline text="Something is going to have to give. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft hasn't pointed out, but I can, that if things are so closed on Windows, if Microsoft is so predatory, why doesn't one of their competitors take advantage of it? I've been lobbying Apple to withdraw from territory it can't hold, allowing safe havens for developers to plant products in newly uncovered niches. So far there have been no withdrawals by Apple, but the mood at Apple is right for this to happen. Limited opportunities on Windows? A few years later all the cool new stuff is on Macs. If Apple had the competitive smarts of Microsoft that's exactly what would be happening now."/>
			<outline text="Philosophical question: should we force Microsoft to come down to the competitive level of Apple or should we force Apple to meet Microsoft's standards? Why can't Microsoft be better and smarter than their competitors? The shift we're seeing at Apple is because of competitive pressure by Microsoft. There's no way Apple would have made these changes without being forced into it."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="If Steve Case thinks that Microsoft is being unfair, why can't he do a deal with Apple to give an unfair advantage to AOL? There are so many other ways to undermine MSN, why does this industry choose to bring nuclear weapons into it? Couldn't we find a more constructive way to co-exist with Microsoft?"/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, could Microsoft provide a statement of philosophy on its relationship with smaller developers and service providers? Are they willing to self-impose some groundrules, some limits on the direction of the operating system, in exchange for a few years of peace? "/>

			<outline text="I've been real busy. Last week I had lots of very important meetings with my bougainvilleas, marigolds, geraniums, roses, coreopsis, gardenias, nasturtiums and calla lillies. "/>
			<outline text="It's been a great summer!"/>
			<outline text="I bought a saw last week, cut out, then dug out some ugly old bushes  and replaced them with wild summer colors! Next year I'll figure out something more permanent. There's no time like now. Dig out the ugly old bushes, create space, plant nice summer flowers. What, me worry? No way!"/>
			<outline text="And this DaveNet comes courtesy of The Pretenders, their Learning to Crawl CD. A very steady slow methodical beat. I go back to Ohio.  From Seneca to Cahoga. My city was gone. Hey ho. Let's go back. "/>
			<outline text="But I'm not from Ohio! "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Censorship Hits DaveNet?"/>
			<outline text="On 3/31/95 I wrote about censorship on the net, specifically about the Exon bill, which has since passed in the Senate and set off a wave of anticipatory censorship on the net."/>
			<outline text="It's interesting because the bill doesn't have to even pass before the wheels start turning. All kinds of protection schemes that work, dammit! "/>
			<outline text="And now it appears that the censorship has shown up on my website! Check out:"/>
			<outline text="http://www.hotwired.com/userland/asocietyofparents_181.html"/>
			<outline text="I included a link to a picture of a beautiful woman with no clothes on. The server is in France, outside the US, and supposedly immune to our laws. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. You'll see a placeholder where a wonderful woman used to be. Try connecting thru the LIBIDO link. Access forbidden. It sounds like someone, somewhere, is censoring something."/>
			<outline text="I checked with Chip Bayers, chip@wired.com, managing editor at HotWired, to see if the link was getting killed by a firewall on the hotwired.com server. He says not. I didn't think it was likely, considering that HotWired has been a vocal proponent of unrestricted free speech on the net."/>
			<outline text="But somewhere along the line, the pointer is getting rejected. They haven't implemented a firewall for the United States yet (what a scary thought!) so the problem must be in France. If anyone has any ideas on what's going on, please send me email at dwiner@well.com. "/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Now it's a manuscript"/>
			<outline text="One of the projects I want to do in the fall is to get all the DaveNet writing out in book form. A hard-copy version of DaveNet. For the coffee table or nightstand. The physical manifestation of something from InternetLand. The Bridges of Madison County meets the WorldWide Web, in color. "/>
			<outline text="I want to work with a great designer to make it look better in print than it does on screen, but I want the design to be derived from the look of the web. I'm also looking for an editor to work with. Someone who knows their way around the web, but also knows how printed books work."/>
			<outline text="The first step down this path was to print out all the essays going back to Marc Canter Sings Again! released on 10/7/94. How things have changed! DaveNet started slowly, then there were two big pieces, Platform is Chinese Household and Bill Gates versus the Internet. Then Bill's reply. I'm on the map! It went to my head. Then settled down, and went off in twenty different directions. Some loops close. Topics get hot and then old. I'm proud of a lot of the writing. And I can forgive the not-great writing. I was learning. And having fun!"/>
			<outline text="So my view of DaveNet is shifting..."/>
			<outline text="It's not just email anymore; not just a website."/>
			<outline text="Now it's a manuscript."/>
			<outline text="Coooool!"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Dan Eilers and market share"/>
			<outline text="I read in MacWEEK a couple of weeks ago that Apple had shifted gears and was no longer in the market share business. Yes! The article said that Apple was going to focus on selling more computers and keeping developers and users happy with the platform. I almost wrote an I-told-you-so DaveNet piece. Market share is a head trip. How many times have I said that? It's infinite but countable."/>
			<outline text="I read in this week's MacWEEK that it was a mistake. Dan Eilers has market share graphs on the wall of his office. Win some lose some. But I have a sneaky feeling that no matter what Dan &amp; Co do, it's a setup -- the Mac will never be a market share winner when compared to the latest version of Windows. "/>
			<outline text="But there's no reason that developers and users can't be happy anyway. Disengage from Apple at an emotional level. Keep the space open for innovations that don't come from Apple. Eventually Apple may get it right. But we can watch from a greater distance, I think... Or at least I hope!"/>
			<outline text="And there are signs of balance at Apple. Even tho I keep saying what I think about OpenDoc and market share and the rest of it, they are promoting my product on their websites and doing a really good job of it! I'm happy to be accepted by Apple in the Mac developer community. We can have fun. Coooool."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Evangelism as god intended"/>
			<outline text="Maybe another sign of smarts at Apple is their hiring of Guy Kawasaki, kawasaki@radiomail.net, to lead their new evangelism efforts."/>
			<outline text="In the mid-80s, when Guy was Apple's lead evangelist, he was one of my most trusted friends in the software business. We did deals all the time. He warned me when Bill Atkinson was trying to get Apple to kill MORE because he thought it was competitive with HyperCard. Guy gave me one of the best ideas I ever had, bullet charts in MORE 1.0. And then, when Living Videotext went bankrupt with MORE almost ready to release, he got Apple to loan us $150,000, saving the product and the company. "/>
			<outline text="This is evangelism as god intended it to be done."/>
			<outline text="Like the hero in a Bruce Willis movie, Guy has a black and white sense of right and wrong. I've never heard Guy waffle on anything. Either you're a total putz or you walk on water. There's nothing inbetween in Guy's view of the world."/>
			<outline text="He's from Hawaii but he talks Yiddish like my mother! This comes from working in the Los Angeles diamond business. A colorful place to start a career, especially for a man with a Stanford MBA. "/>
			<outline text="Guy left Apple in 1988, and after a brief stint as a software company exec, he found his calling as a very successful book writer, consultant, columnist, software startup guy and then a cashout king. Guy must be a rich man now. That's very cooooool."/>
			<outline text="People who are smart don't stop being smart. Guy has clean fighting energy inside him. A strong sense of right and wrong. A pragmatic view of the software business. "/>
			<outline text="I think it's very interesting that he's back at Apple. "/>

			<outline text="I'd like to introduce you to Clay Basket. "/>
			<outline text="Up till now DaveNet and Clay Basket have been separate projects."/>
			<outline text="Clay Basket is a code name. It's a &quot;web outliner&quot; for Macs, designed to work with Netscape 1.1. "/>
			<outline text="You can use Clay Basket to edit the contents of Netscape's Bookmarks menu. It records all the sites you visit in an outline. Organize and annotate your URLs. It boosts your bandwidth in web browsing. If you've been somewhere, it's easy to get back there. Clay Basket is also a web authoring tool, it stores outlines as HTML text, which means they can be viewed in all popular web browsers."/>
			<outline text="You can read more and download a beta from the Clay Basket website at http://www.hotwired.com/userland/clay/."/>
			<outline text="Like the rest of my software, Clay Basket is lifestyle-ware. It's free. You're welcome to use it, and tell me how you want it improved. I have reasons to want to improve it -- there will be competition from Netscape and from a friend. And we're cooperating where appropriate. Clay Basket is an experiment, a laboratory for network-based software, something to play with. I'm having fun! That's what lifestyle-ware is all about."/>

			<outline text="***SIGGRAPH"/>
			<outline text="I'll be at SIGGRAPH, August 7-9, in Los Angeles. I'm totally psyched about the show. For the first time, I get to go to a great show as a press person. I registered with the PR firm. I get to hang out, no booth duty, no dealers or developers to meet with, just listen, soak up the energy then come home. "/>

People listen to live music there every night, I didn't hear Dead songs there last night. No memorial, just the scheduled group. The music never stops. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;I remember going to parking lot parties at Stanford to hear the Dead, or being in the city and they'd happen to be at the panhandle. It was never a big deal. It was just part of being out and about. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;The Dead never took themselves seriously and neither did we. It's eery, but I happened to be in Bolinas for the first time in a  couple of decades this last weekend.

You know you want to do the thing that the menu item does, but there's absolutely no path in the user interface to finding out how to make it happen. In a non-GUI, you can always command the system to do something, and it has to explain itself to you with an error message if it can't or won't do it.

			<outline text="I have some advice for General Magic, because unlike Newton, their software has utility outside of the PDA form factor. Go the route that Next went and get out of the hardware business. Focus on Mac and Windows client software. Break compatibility with the current user base if you have to. You need a critical mass of users. The only place you can find that critical mass is in the mass market platforms. Make Magic Cap relevent to current Internet users. The Motorola news is an important indicator that the PDA strategy isn't working."/>

			<outline text="***AT&amp;T and Netscape Sittin in a Tree"/>
			<outline text="After their stunning IPO, and the inevitable fall back to at least stratospheric valuation, Netscape has announced a deal with AT&amp;T to sell servers and clients for the worldwide web. Nothing amazing in the announcement, but it was coool to see my old friend Tom Evslin quoted in the press release. Tom is at AT&amp;T now, after a stint at Microsoft. Yo Tom! [What's his email address?]"/>
			<outline text="More on the Netscape IPO -- based on nothing more than gut, I'd short Netscape stock right now. The multiples are way too high. True, now that they're flush with cash, they could buy lots of product, and become the networking giant that investors hope they will become. My question: can Silicon Valley support a new huge competent company? Is the local talent pool deep enough to support the kind of growth that would imply? I'd bet that it isn't. They'll hit a wall, the people wall, real sooon now."/>
			<outline text="***Back to earth"/>
			<outline text="I made a choice back in 1988, to go with Think C and the Macintosh API. It's been a long run, seven years, but I can see things changing for me. Which way to go? Hmmmm. Time to go for a walk!"/>
			<outline text="I'm having trouble converting from my old Quadra 68040 setup to the PowerPC setup. Metrowerks is a big transition. I yearn for the familiar keystrokes and menu commands of Think C 6.0. I'm angry that Symantec dropped the ball and let Metrowerks take the cursor from them. "/>
			<outline text="When I choose a development environment, I want to pick one that's going to move where I want to move. I think it's amazing, in 1995, that I can't flip a switch on my Macintosh development system and have it generate a Windows 95 app. After all this time, why can't a PC emulate a Macintosh? A lot of people had to drop the ball for this to happen! "/>
			<outline text="What about those guys down in Monterey who had the Mac runtime environment working on a PC in 1989? Altura Software. Why didn't Microsoft buy them? Why didn't Apple? Such small-minded strategies. Microsoft wanted me to use their API. Apple didn't care if my software ran on Windows. Symantec was asleep at the wheel. Now, why doesn't Metrowerks make a deal with Altura and make me that much happier about learning their New Way of doing things?"/>
			<outline text="I don't like any of the choices in front of me. The user interface that I'm comfortable with is obsolete. Using Metrowerks feels foreign to me. I feel abandoned as a user.

			<outline text="***Randy Battat on PDAs"/>
			<outline text="We're developing a tradition here. I write about PDAs and my friend Randy Battat, battat@wes.mot.com, Motorola's exec in charge of wireless data products (i.e. PDAs) writes back. Yesterday I wrote about cutbacks in Motorola's PDA efforts, and Randy replied:"/>
			<outline text="You mentioned the article in the Wall Street Journal about our staff reduction and what it means for PDAs. While saying goodbye to good people is painful, I think the article got caught up in a little too much PDA hype (what else is new?) and missed what's really going on in the wireless industry."/>
			<outline text="The wireless data industry is where LANs were in the mid 80s. Remember the Year of the LAN? Which one? 1985? 1986? 1987? And then we woke up in the early 90s and discovered that 3COM and Cisco and Novell are all billion dollar companies. People don't take wireless computing for granted today, but they will. All of us in the industry expected the market to be much bigger by now, but so did everyone in the LAN industry in the early days.  "/>
			<outline text="Note that the issue is not about PDAs. Yes, we do make a couple of wireless PDAs. We're also just starting to ship a wireless modem on a PCMCIA card for notebook PCs. For the next several years, we'll sell far more PCMCIA cards than PDAs, but that's always been expected."/>
			<outline text="Frankly, our number one challenge is getting the wireless data communciations industry off the ground. It's not PDAs versus PCs. Our industry is primarily serving vertical markets today. At Motorola, in addition to serving vertical markets, we're also going after general business usage like Wireless E-Mail. Perhaps we're nuts (because nobody else is following suit), but we really believe in this technology and what it can do for people. "/>
			<outline text="The PDAs represent another belief.  Major computing architectures don't scale. Mainframes and minis didn't. PCs can't scale to be handheld devices.  Yet many people want something small and personal that they can use to help organize their lives and communcate.  Not instead of PCs, but in addition to them. In this way, I agree with a point you made a long time ago that we can look at PDAs as accessories to PCs, you called them peripherals."/>
			<outline text="But PDAs are fundamentally different than PCs. They embody a different usage pattern (work on a piece of a task, such as scheduling a meeting or jotting down a note, rather than a whole task).  They use a different user interface. They employ a different software model (high-level scripting languages and small apps vs. the giant monster apps of PCs).  And, I believe, they'll adopt a different economic model (software and services via subscription). All of this means that PDAs will take a long time to mature, just as PCs did."/>
			<outline text="***A few comments by Dave"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Randy! I have a few comments, of course..."/>
			<outline text="I agree that wireless technology will be in our lives not too far down the road. I look at my desk, and under my desk -- it's a tangle of wires! I hate them. If you can help me get rid of some of those wires, and thereby increase my mobility, bless you. I'll get my VISA card out. And I bet a lot of other people will too."/>
			<outline text="Bless PDAs too! Let's keep the space open for something wonderful to happen there. In the meantime let's stay focused on the exciting things that are really happening, like all the wireless PCMCIA cards you're selling and more fun with notebook computers. "/>
			<outline text="I don't buy the premise that we need new development tools to build small form-factor software. History doesn't support the assumption that a new scale begets fundamentally new approaches to software development. After 20 years, I'm still coding in C! Yeah, and I expect to be doing that forever. Carpenters still use hammers. Some things are too painful to change. I really believe that."/>
			<outline text="Of course I write lots of scripts now too. What goes around comes around. I did that on Unix in the 1970s! Gotta love it."/>
			<outline text="New friendly interfaces for the net built out of scripting software makes sense, but not just on PDAs, on desktop systems too. That's why I thought it was brilliant for Microsoft to choose Visual Basic as their development environment for their aborted attempt to produce a PDA operating system. A million developers. What a coup! Microsoft Network as the runtime environment. Too bad it didn't happen."/>
			<outline text="Also, the software distribution system for desktop software has already changed. Netscape is founded on free net-based software distribution. Creative distribution is the norm nowadays; it's the present, not the future."/>
			<outline text="If you're betting your company's PDA future on the assumption that desktop OSs can't scale down, could you support it with some specifics? Is ROM too expensive? Couldn't we IFDEF-out the incompatible pieces of the desktop OS? Couldn't I store files in a ramdisk on the PDA? Lots of software has TCP verbs built in, including scripting software. Meet them closer to where they live, and the Internet crowd will supply the scripts. "/>

			<outline text="I saw PageMill at the Expo and at first was incredibly impressed. I remained impressed until I got to ask a couple questions of the authors. &quot;Can it do tables?&quot; As I expected, the anwser was no. I can understand that. The table code in HTML can be very confusing and it would be difficult to do WYSIWYG tables. However, in elaborating, the person demoing it from Ceneca also said that it doesn't do left/right justified floating images either. Now that, in my mind, is possibly the most used and useful Netscape enhancement and a very serious oversight on their part. He stated that it's tough to code. Word processors have been doing it for years. What's the scoop? In my opinion, without that feature PageMill is useless. Sure it makes creating pages incredibly easy, but that one feature is an incredible oversight. I was all set to order a copy, but not now. I'll wait for the PageMill update that handles all of the image features."/>

			<outline text="***Xerox on the trail of tears"/>
			<outline text="Today's Wall Street Journal tells the story of Xerox and the dreams of the stock market. Xerox punted on a supposed monopoly in plain paper copying. Great R&amp;D. The ideas that founded Apple, Microsoft, 3COM and Adobe come from Xerox. Japanese competition in copiers. They try to diversify into finance and and personal computers. Couldn't do it. Retreat. "/>
			<outline text="Xerox is a trail of tears. "/>
			<outline text="There was a boom in Xerox stock in the early 70s, a correct euphoria, it turns out. Plain paper copiers *did* revolutionize our lives and Xerox did get a big chunk of the business."/>
			<outline text="In the background, while the Journal is telling the Xerox story, they relate it to Netscape and its founders. The valuation of the company, it seems, must be an incredible burden to the management of the company. Very little upside for them, from this point in time. The valuation has them pegged as gods. Nowhere to go but down from there. They aren't gods, nothing wrong with that, of course. If I were in their shoes, I'd feel trapped. I'd want a *much* lower stock price."/>

			<outline text="***Microsoft's strategy"/>
			<outline text="On my trip to Seattle in late June I met with Ben Slivka, bens@microsoft.com, the lead developer for their web browser. We had an interesting discussion, me talking from the point of view of a Macintosh web developer, and him coming from the Windows world. We spoke the same language and different ones too. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft has a new architecture that's deploying in the form of Windows 95, and they're using it. "/>
			<outline text="Ben demos. Microsoft's web browser, called Internet Explorer, is nicely integrated with the operating system and apps. Shortcuts, the Windows implementation of aliases, can be Internet addresses. Shortcuts can appear on your desktop, in folders and in any utility that builds spreadsheets or outlines of shortcuts. They can be email addresses, web site locations, downlodable apps or scripts, whatever the Internet can get you too. At the same time, they can point to files on your hard disk or on your LAN. "/>
			<outline text="Microsoft's web browser ships on August 24, one week from today. MSN Internet access goes on the air on August 24 too. They're matching Netscape's free distribution strategy. You can download the browser from Microsoft's website or from their CompuServe bulletin board. "/>
			<outline text="And they can put their browser in a place Netscape can't, on all PC clones that ship with Windows 95 pre-installed. Since the vast majority of personal computers will ship with Microsoft's browser pre-installed, and since they have a competent, perhaps elegant product, it seems like Microsoft will grab the cursor from Netscape."/>
			<outline text="Lots of new computers will be sold to new computer users in the coming years. This means a lot of flow of new net browsers to people who may be using the Internet for the first time. Microsoft, currently unchallenged by Apple, is poised to get the vast majority of these users."/>
			<outline text="And someone somewhere in the clone business is going to see the opportunity to build a fully easy fully configured Internet client machine. Intel understands this. I bet Compaq gets it too. And there's Acer, Packard-Bell, Toshiba, and a million other cloners to get the idea. It'll happen."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft wants to own the default web browser for Windows users. "/>
			<outline text="That'll happen too."/>
			<outline text="***A daring move"/>

A Windows presence is maintained using the code base that Netscape is developing. Take the best of OpenDoc and integrate it with the browser. And make a computer perfectly tuned for net browsing. Read back issues of DaveNet for details. I've been ranting about this for months and months."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft is forcing them to take a look at this option. If they don't make the move, we'll look back a few years from now the same way we view the lost opportunity in 1990 when Apple chose to ignore the shipment of Windows 3.0, and gave away the graphic operating system business to Microsoft."/>

			<outline text="***Chinese Household revisited"/>
			<outline text="As the prospects for Apple have dimmed over the last few years, it's becoming harder and harder to be a Macintosh developer. "/>
			<outline text="I started writing about this in &quot;Platform is Chinese Household&quot;, 10/29/94. It's great when the platform you're developing for is taking good care of you, and it's equally lousy when the platform treats you like an antibody -- something to be defined, then isolated and defeated. Yuck. Been there, done that."/>
			<outline text="The Chinese Household piece still makes good reading. &quot;Today, Macintosh is an empty loveless house. Not a home. All the developers walked but left the babies behind. Not because of market share, that can be fixed with economic tweaks. We walked because Apple is a lousy lover.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="The piece got its title from the following metaphor: &quot;A platform is a Chinese household. One rich husband. Lots of wives. If the husband abuses one wife, it hurts all the wives. All of sudden food starts getting cold. The bed is empty. All of a sudden husband isn't so rich.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Such clean anger! It's coooool."/>
			<outline text="So... one more time: market share is a head-trip, a distraction."/>
			<outline text="Growth comes from love. "/>
			<outline text="Platforms are for fun, profits follow."/>
			<outline text="***Yawn"/>
			<outline text="The Chinese Household piece painted a grim picture of the future prospects for Apple Computer. I get no happiness from being right. I'd have preferred to have been a catalyst for setting things right."/>
			<outline text="In the interim, since writing Chinese Household, I've held onto the hope that the Macintosh OS might have a better future than Apple. After all, it works, I don't particularly want any features from them, none of the Copland or OpenDoc stuff really gets my juices flowing. If Apple had to cut back development, so what, that would just create new space for me to play in. "/>
			<outline text="In the interim, Apple licensed the Mac OS. That seemed like good news for developers. If we can't make a deal with Apple, maybe we can work with a licensee? Unfortunately, the licensees are mostly approaching the market like cloners, looking for ways to add value to their package by bundling applications that are already popular. I don't think the cloners are approaching this as an opportunity to be creative, or try out new ideas. It's a simple formula, create a clone market for Macintoshes. "/>
			<outline text="Yawn."/>
			<outline text="***The end of the road?"/>
			<outline text="It seems that Windows 95 is the final deliverance for the Macintosh operating system, unless it heads for the hills, to niches like multimedia, education and publishing. I think, eventually, Microsoft will grab those niches too. That's the way it works."/>
			<outline text="Apple's trail of tears seems to lead right off a cliff, and there's no evidence that Apple management is doing anything to head in a different direction. Is Apple on its way to becoming the next Wang, left with no options, nowhere to go, selling off assets to make payroll?"/>
			<outline text="A few months ago Oracle put Apple into play, and a new idea took root. A smaller presence takes over Apple and provides it with a new direction. I started thinking about the situation differently. As the strategic PE ratio of Apple declines, it makes more and more sense for a technologist with a high PE, like Larry Ellison or now Jim Clark to play &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. What if the Mac OS was developed as a settop-box operating system? What if the Mac OS was packaged as the leading web browser platform? What if...?"/>
			<outline text="You know what I'm interested in -- the ideal Internet client machine. Built out of software that only runs on a Macintosh. Steve Dorner, Aleksandar Totic, Chuck Shotton, Peter Lewis, Leonard Rosenthol and a few others get together, with no one from Apple present, and we decide how the product goes together. The phoenix bird rises from the ashes. "/>
			<outline text="If you have to head for the hills, head for the hill with the maximum growth, and where Microsoft will have to zig when the market wants zag. "/>
			<outline text="A newly directed Macintosh could be a friend of the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="As I wrote in another seminal DaveNet piece, &quot;Bill Gates vs the Internet&quot;, 10/18/94, Microsoft must try to gain control of the standards of the Internet. I think that's inevitable. But another operating system vendor can let the net community drive the development of the platform. Apple already has lots of high ground in the Internet world. "/>

			<outline text="***Where I'm at"/>
			<outline text="As a developer, I like to work on the consensus platform, the one that everyone respects. The Apple II was no fun to develop for in 1983. Large installed base, but my ideas couldn't take root in that medium, the interesting people were using Lotus 1-2-3 machines, not AppleWorks machines. Same with the IBM PC in 1987 -- all the cool development was happening on the Macintosh. The tide started turning in 1990 when Windows 3.0 shipped. I stayed with the Macintosh."/>

			<outline text="I wonder how much my staying with the Mac platform is the result of fear, not love. I definitely have fear of trying to replace my Mac desktop with a Windows desktop. So much code to convert! But so many of my friends have already done it. And I get a sense that many more will switch in the next few months."/>

Apple has a low PE ratio, indicating low market confidence in the company. America OnLine's PE is very high, the market believes in the stock even though profits have been elusive.

		<outline text="What is a Platform?" created="8/22/1995;  12:00:00 AM" name="whatIsAPlatform" type="outline">
			<outline text="#title &quot;What is a Platform?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/22/95; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I first heard the word &quot;platform&quot; used at an Esther Dyson conference in the mid 80s. The word was showing up everywhere, in cocktail conversation, on stage, in Esther's talk, and in every other sentence from virtually every speaker."/>
			<outline text="Phrases and concepts run thru those conferences every year. They can be very ephemeral, lasting one year, like &quot;object oriented&quot; and &quot;convergence,&quot; or sometimes they show up year after year. Platform has stuck. Ten years later we're still talking about platforms. It's a valuble concept. "/>
			<outline text="We're even refining the concept -- yesterday I talked about a &quot;consensus platform&quot; without realizing that the base term had never been defined."/>
			<outline text="***Looking in the dictionary"/>
			<outline text="There are two interesting dictionary definitions: &quot;a raised horizontal surface of wood, stone or metal;&quot; or &quot;a statement of principals and policies, especially of a political party.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="I think both definitions contain elements of what makes something a platform."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Raised&quot; is important. It implies that there's something below that isn't raised. I think there's also an implication of &quot;flat.&quot; Maybe what's below is very rough and uneven, and the service provided by the platform is to simplify or flatten the concepts to make it easier to work with. Does this mean that platform is a recursive concept? I think so. Platforms build on platforms. But it's (hopefully) not a house of cards. More like those 3D chess games they play on Star Trek. Elegant, but a bit of a klooge."/>
			<outline text="Also, the &quot;raised horizontal surface&quot; phrase calls up an image of a party for me. Not a political one, but a celebration party. If I'm the only partygoer, it's not much of a platform. I want dancing, singing and lovemaking at my celebrations. It takes two to tango. Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="The second definition adds an element of morality and judgement. The author of the platform is making a biased statement. &quot;This is how it should be done,&quot; the platform author is saying. It's also a self-interested statement because the author of a successful platform has the right to evolve it, or at least try to. This is where a software company's PE ratio comes from."/>
			<outline text="But neither definition really covers what we mean in the software business, so it looks like I'm going to have to step out and offer my own definition, a third one, one that matches the way I use the term, and I think the way the industry uses the term."/>
			<outline text="***What does a platform contain? "/>
			<outline text="Every platform must contain an API. "/>
			<outline text="An operating system has an API. For Macintosh it's documented in a shelf full of books called Inside Macintosh. Although I've never written software for Windows, I understand that Charles Petzold's books are the backbone of the platform for developers. For the IBM PC platform, the character-based one, before Windows, it was Peter Norton's series of books, probably the best docs a platform ever had or IMHO ever will. For the Apple II it was pure folklore, information passed on from developer to developer. Sample code is OK for docs."/>
			<outline text="To be a platform at a theoretic level, you can stop there. Even an undocumented API with no developers, no users and no potential is a platform. But, to be interesting, a platform must have these other other things."/>
			<outline text="Users are very important. Lots of them. Interesting ones. People who are doing cooool things. Sometimes popular software or hardware doesn't become a platform until lots of people use them. An example: Lotus published APIs for their spreadsheet long after the product became popular. The Lotus platform had an installed base of users right from day 1. Lotus learned a lot from this experience; Notes was conceived as a development platform right from the beginning."/>
			<outline text="Just as important as users: other developers. There's strength in numbers. No one can solve every problem. Even competitors can be helpful. No product can be all things to all people. I could probably write a whole essay about this. Gotta have someone to bounce ideas off of. Competitors can be your best friend. No one understands you as well as your competitor, especially if the race has been running for a few years. But I digress."/>
			<outline text="A committment from the API author is also very important. How stable is the API? Will the API change in some major way, forcing developers to choose between the old way and the new way? In evaluating the stability of an API, a developer will probe the API, crawl inside it, and on the other side of it, imagining how it's implemented, to see how completely it solves the problem. If the solution is only partial, it may make sense to wait until it's more complete. No one wants to waste time implementing on top of an API that's going to change substantially."/>
			<outline text="A platform must have potential, or open space. I call this blue sky. The platform's API must show thru enough power so you can do *anything* on top of it. That's a very elusive idea, hard to define. You want an API to put limits on the problems it deals with, but you also want to leave open the possibility that any developer could pervert the API to make it solve problems that the inventor couldn't imagine. The author of an API is offering a challenge, saying &quot;blow my mind,&quot; to everyone who might take a stab at implementing something on top of the API."/>
			<outline text="***Definition"/>
			<outline text="Here's my proposal for a dictionary definition."/>
			<outline text="A platform is &quot;a blueprint for the evolution of a popular software interface or specification.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="How's that?"/>
			<outline text="***More food for thought"/>
			<outline text="I've said that a platform is a Chinese household. This implies a hierarchy. One platform vendor, often a company (at least in the PC software biz) and many developers. But in an ideal world, each developer is also a platform vendor, publishing an API for their product and supporting other developers, perhaps even the original platform vendor, in selling new technology to their customers. So a platform relationship can be very complex, not a simple hierarchy. To miss that point is to miss a lot of potential."/>
			<outline text="Want to understand the Internet? Once you understand the platform concept, you now have all the concepts you need to understand the Internet. It's just a system for inventing new platforms. You could call the Internet a meta-platform, or a platform machine, because it contains all the collaboration tools a platform proponent needs to define and deploy new platforms. Got an idea that no one has thought of yet? Put out a RFC paper. Boom. It's a platform!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: API stands for Application Programming Interface."/>
			<outline text="PPS: IMHO stands for In My Humble Opinion."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: RFC stands for Request For Comment."/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: Pet peeve time. When you see the word &quot;klooge&quot; in print, it's often spelled &quot;kludge,&quot; which gets mispronounced as rhyming with &quot;judge.&quot; I think this makes uninitiated geeks look silly, and we should change the official spelling to the phonetic one to avoid unnecessary embarassment."/>
			<outline text="PPPPPS: I heard that Esther Dyson is moving from NY to Palo Alto. Coooool!"/>
			<outline text="PPPPPPS: I've been getting a lot of email about a company claiming a patent on extending the worldwide web using helper apps or embedded scripts. If there's any legitimacy to this claim, it's a very big deal and a very big problem."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;8/27/95; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***20th Century Blues"/>
			<outline text="Want to understand what really ails you? "/>
			<outline text="Check out the 8/28/95 issue of Time Magazine, cover story, by Robert Wright, entitled The Evolution of Despair. He reports on a new field called evolutionary psychology. The premise is that by understanding how evolution created us, and looking at the differences between the real lives we live, immersed in technology, and the lives evolution designed us to lead, we can unlock the puzzle of human happiness. "/>
			<outline text="I'll give you the punchline first. To be happy, we need a social community to interact with, and to share trust and love with that community. The natural human structure is larger than a family, but not too large. Trust is absolutely essential. There are always struggles within the community, and threats from outside. But that's what we were built to deal with. We're good at it!"/>
			<outline text="The main conclusion of evolutionary psychology is that we spend too much time alone. We live in a society where we pay a premium for isolation. Suburbs and television. Many of us were raised in that environment. We compared ourselves to unrealistic ideals, Ozzie and Harriet, The Brady Bunch, the Monkees or The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and found ourselves lacking. No way for us to fit in. We stayed on the sidelines. More isolation."/>
			<outline text="Today we watch shows like Roseanne or Star Trek to calm our inner voice that's  calling out for human friendship. A familiar set of faces to understand and bond with. To trust and to honor, in feast or famine; in fight or flight; in sickness and in health. We want to get married to twenty other people. That's what evolution designed us for."/>
			<outline text="Cyberspace is an interesting addition to the mix. The question is -- does it serve to further isolate us from a social community, or will it help to create new community, more like the one evolution designed us for? Will the Internet make us happier, or lead us further down the path towards being less happy? "/>
			<outline text="In either case, if you're interested in this stuff, the Time piece is invaluble reading."/>
			<outline text="***I had a dream"/>
			<outline text="I want to tell you about a dream I just had. "/>
			<outline text="Bill Gates is introducing a new software product. "/>
			<outline text="We're sitting in a big tent floating on a green soccer field. Bright sun. Coool air. It's comfortable. "/>
			<outline text="Lots of faces from the past! An oldtime schmooze. Perhaps the last time this group of people gets together? Even Philippe Kahn is there, looking a bit like Pete Rose, exiled from power, but still fighting. Takes a licking keeps on ticking! Network TV cameras and famous reporters. Full color video screens perched in every nook and cranny. Every electronic recording goodie in the world."/>
			<outline text="It's been over an hour, we've been watching a TV actor ham it up. What does NBC stand for? Now Bill Compatible. We laugh. Just like Internet humor. Hooo. This is a funny dream! Yeah."/>
			<outline text="Bill talks about features. Long filenames, undo file-delete, more resources, easy upgrade process, platform for new technology. Corporate videos. The product is great. A very cute corporate type says of her friends: &quot;Yes, they hate me, and I love it.&quot; We love her too. Such confidence! All because she uses this wonderful piece of software. Hmmm. OK, why not?"/>
			<outline text="But when is the entertainment is going to start???"/>
			<outline text="Almost too late, someone backstage presses a button, and the curtains behind the stage open. Bright sunlight. Blue sky. A thousand smiling faces waving. Colorful flags and t-shirts. At exactly the same moment, another engineer presses another button and a rolling rock standard fills the field. Bill turns around, faces the people, smiles and waves. Hi! Welcome to Microsoft. &quot;I'm Bill,&quot; he says. His shoulders slouch, his hands in his pockets."/>
			<outline text="Slowly he starts to roll with the music, first with his hips, then with his shoulders and hands. He lifts one foot in front of the other. His index finger points in the air, rolling around the sun. Funky! Like the top boy at a Louisiana jazz funeral parade. Too bad he didn't have an umbrella. With tassles! One foot in front of the other. Hamming it up. He struts out of the auditorium and the first row follows, doing a parade-like dance, followed by the second row and on and on dancing to the music."/>
			<outline text="The crowd of smiling faces cheers to the music. They get on their feet and start dancing. Smiling and humming. They say it's a great day to be alive. We're a bunch of flowers. A realllly big one. Today we have Great Hair. Happy! Thumbs up everywhere."/>
			<outline text="Dreams can be realllllly funny!"/>
			<outline text="***What a trance!"/>
			<outline text="Windows 95 is a worldwide trance. The reporters write about other reporters. The next day there is some news. The Wall Street Journal reports that first-day sales for Windows 95 are $700 million. So it's a financial trance too. "/>
			<outline text="Sally Atkins, sally@world.std.com, asks &quot;The press for Win95 is like the auto companies used to put on in the 50s, isn't it?&quot; I wish I knew. I'm too young to remember that. And so are you!"/>
			<outline text="Apple and IBM run ads on August 24. I only heard about them, didn't see them. Bill heard about them too. In the press conference he announces that IBM has licensed Windows 95. &quot;The licensing program for Win95 is now complete.&quot; He smiles. What a difference from the way Bill viewed IBM in 1990 when Windows 3.0 rolled out."/>
			<outline text="Surprisingly, Bill had praise for Apple and renewed his committment to continuing to develop for the Macintosh. &quot;Apple views us as a competitor, but we don't see them that way.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="I believe if it weren't for Bill's personal committment to the Macintosh, Microsoft would immediately cut off all development for Mac. They are very resource-constrained. Macintosh is tangential to their primary need -- growth. There's only so much growth available in the Mac market, and they're advancing quickly elsewhere, notably in the commercialization of the Internet. All the programming juice at Microsoft going to the Mac platform could be applied to their battle with Netscape for the standard for the evolution of the worldwide web. Or to building content and tools for their new alliance with NBC, or other investments in other media."/>
			<outline text="Microsoft execs tell us that Microsoft is more than Bill Gates and it is. But he's holding up the Macintosh, at a time when it's surprising that he is. Don't miss this, and factor it into your thinking. "/>
			<outline text="It's a bit of a mystery to me."/>
			<outline text="***Zigging"/>
			<outline text="I finished the event at a table with several Microsoft execs and a board member."/>
			<outline text="The board member asked what's going on with Macintosh. &quot;If I were Apple, I'd do a product that depended on both hardware and software.&quot; Heads nod, they understand. Over the years the frustration for Microsoft has been that their OEMs for Windows were reluctant to follow their lead when it came to adding or changing the hardware of the standard platform. Things have changed slowly. Apple didn't have the extra baggage."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Apple should have zigged where Microsoft had to zag. They can't win by trying to be Microsoft,&quot; I said."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: FWIW, I've never been a proponent of licensing the Mac OS, although once it was an accomplished fact I was willing to play with the idea."/>
			<outline text="PPS: FWIW means For What It's Worth."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Correction: Esther is *not* moving to Palo Alto. The EFF, which she now chairs, is moving to San Francisco. The wires got crossed. Oooops. Another trance. Sorry!"/>

			<outline text="***From: Steve Wozniak, steve@woz.org&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="***Re: Apple is a Lousy Lover"/>
			<outline text="I concur strongly but not wholeheartedly with your Apple comments. "/>
			<outline text="Mike Markkula organized Apple as a marketing driven company. And Steve Jobs spoke out for buying the current technologies of the world and adding value by piecing them together to create complete, finished computers. "/>
			<outline text="So Apple is not the company I had hoped it would be."/>
			<outline text="I always thought that a major player in the personal computer business, with their label on the products, would be composed of top engineers and multiple labs full of scientists developing new devices out of physics and chemistry. I only worked for HP and Apple. HP had lots of such labs. In fact they had chip manufacturing plants in each division around 1976, for a technological edge. HP was known inside and out as an engineering oriented company. "/>
			<outline text="It seemed to me in recent years that new software diverted to the PC because of market share. You try to put the cause more on alienation of developers. Have you worked with executives of producers of major software titles who had full choice to choose which platforms to develop for? My experience tells me that they go for market share. But Apple had a lot of very dedicated fans who saw how right and good the Mac OS was, and would never switch. Extreme loyalty was perhaps Apple's strongest strength. "/>
			<outline text="I feel that Apple has hurt and alienated both the loyal developers and loyal users. The developer who finds his platform and libraries and development language yanked back and forth finally gives up the loyalty. The user who buys a PowerBook full of red stickers &quot;Ready for PowerPC upgrade&quot; (I leave mine on) finds that the computer is dropped from Apple's line before the upgrade is even available. "/>
			<outline text="You fall in love with one model of Mac and convince yourself what a great computer you have, and half a year later it's obsolete and uncertain to work with the niftiest apps of the future. Customer loyalty fades."/>
			<outline text="I think Apple lost a lot in the Microsoft lawsuit. Apple should have sued them for *not* copying the Mac as closely as possible. Had we gone to Microsoft and said &quot;do anything the way we've already found is good, for 25 cents&quot; the result might have been a commonality as beneficial to Apple as Microsoft. When you're comfortable with one OS because of all your skills, it's scary to change. Were the two platforms very similar, the comfort feeling wouldn't trap Mac users or PC users to their familiar machines."/>
			<outline text="John Sculley, and others, were outspoken as to the importance of Apple reaping great rewards by keeping everything proprietary, with examples of how US companies licensed away the world to the Japaneese. But the result is a totally owned and protected OS that leads to loyal users because it's hard to step out of it into an OS very different. So Mac users are trapped into Macs as long as the Mac is very different from the alternatives."/>
			<outline text="I feel most sorry that the best quality people are not solidly in the Mac camp anymore."/>
			<outline text="About me: I'm a private evangelist for the school district in Los Gatos, where I live. I had two goals in life, to be an engineer and to teach 5th grade. For several years I've been teaching computers to not only teachers but also 5th through 8th graders. "/>

			<outline text="She writes: &quot;Unbeknownst to me, while I was sleeping, my companion and well-meaning nerd lover installed Windows 95 on my personal PC, as well as on all four of the PCs in our house. I went down to check my email this morning and found my screen crawling with caterpillars. Ughh! Frantically, I hit a key.

			<outline text="***The Customer is Very Smart"/>
			<outline text="I had lunch on Tuesday with a friendly Macintosh user. We talked about lots of things, including what it's like to be a Macintosh 95 user. "/>
			<outline text="The conversation reminded me of things I learned about users when I ran my first software company in the mid 80s."/>
			<outline text="First, a user is a customer. In business, we have a saying about customers, and like all wise sayings it's true from every angle. "/>
			<outline text="The customer is always right. "/>
			<outline text="And it has a corolary -- the customer is also very smart."/>
			<outline text="How do you know your customers are smart? Because she or he was smart enough to buy your product. The market is a minefield of excuses for people *not* to buy your product. The ones that pay money to use your software are the smartest people in the world. They overcame every obstacle, every objection, to discover the greatness of your product. The customer's intelligence is a reflection of your belief that you have a great product. If that belief isn't built into your company, you're going down! It's over. Liquidate the assets. You may think you have a business, but you actually don't."/>
			<outline text="Read the pulse of the customers. You should feel a balance. You should feel good about meeting with a customer. If you're scared of your customers, take a look at it, behind that feeling is a fundamental problem in your business."/>
			<outline text="I flashed on this many years ago when I heard a few of my programmers shmoozing in the company kitchen. They were trading stories, trying to top each other with stories about how stupid our users are. This really bothered me. At first I couldn't figure out why. "/>
			<outline text="What unlocked the puzzle? I tried flipping it around, I'm not the president anymore, I'm a customer. Imagine overhearing this conversation. What does it feel like to hear the disrespect of a company whose product you bought? I've been there many times; so have you. Lots of customer reps for lots of products assume you're dumb if you don't understand something they do. It's a basic human mistake, it shows up everywhere you go."/>
			<outline text="It happens when you're a tourist -- visit a strange country -- some people assume you're stupid because you don't know the local customs. It's like going to a party where the host plays jokes at the expense of the guests. It works that way in the software biz too. A platform is like a household. An API is a party. Did you make me smart for supporting your last interface? Or were you playing a joke at my expense?"/>

			<outline text="Back to Mac customers. For the whole life of the platform, until last week, we had the confidence that even if we weren't using the consensus platform, we were still using the best platform. We knew something the other guys didn't know. Our choice made us smart, and made us right. But no more. Now we're using the minority platform, and there are features in the other platform that we've wanted in *our* platform for years."/>
			<outline text="We're not right anymore. Ooooops. Something important changed. "/>
			<outline text="Now, the chicken comes home to roost. For years Apple jealously guarded the right to upgrade the operating system, cutting off developer opportunities with the justification that they have the right to upgrade their own OS. Of course they do! But that could be a losing strategy. When you hog the fast lane with inadequate technology, eventually the competition catches up, and then passes. Apple can block their developers, but they haven't blocked the competition. "/>

			<outline text="An old software slogan at Living Videotext: &quot;We Make Shitty Software... With Bugs!&quot; It makes me laugh! We never ran this slogan in an ad. People wouldn't understand. But it's the truth. We make shitty software. And so do you! "/>
			<outline text="Software is a process, it's never finished, it's always evolving. That's its nature. We know our software sucks. But it's shipping! Next time we'll do better, but even then it will be shitty. The only software that's perfect is one you're dreaming about. Real software crashes, loses data, is hard to learn and hard to use. But it's a process. We'll make it less shitty. Just watch!"/>
			<outline text="Talking with an unhappy customer, first validate their belief that you've let them down. I agree that our software isn't perfect. You won't get an argument here. Let's move on, find a workaround, a way to get your data back. And we promise to take a look at this problem and, if possible, fix it in the next release."/>

			<outline text="If you *still* want to yell at me, please listen to the Indigo Girls song &quot;In Love with Your Ghost.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="A lover let her down. She's still in love, or thinks she is. But it's not actually love. She wants to avoid the pain that comes with growth. She could let go, move on, stop waiting for someone else to make her life make sense. But it's not time yet. And it's OK. You can't hurry love!"/>
			<outline text="It seems the Indigo Girls would have some advice for Macintosh users: find meaning elsewhere in your life. Just as there's more to a woman than the person she sleeps with, there's more to who you are than the kind of computer you use. Maybe Windows isn't so great. Maybe you will continue to use your Macintosh. And it's OK. But the truth is that, as of August 24, there are advantages to using both platforms. If you don't recognize that now, you're living in a fantasy world."/>
			<outline text="***The next thread"/>
			<outline text="DaveNet is a swirl of issues. They come and go. One week Microsoft is the focus of attention, next week it's Apple. Stay tuned, you'll hear more about the operating system faceoff. It ain't over till it's over. "/>
			<outline text="But it's time to re-examine another thread -- the evolution of standards for the worldwide web. The faceoff is between Netscape and Microsoft. The territory they're fighting over is the world of web content development. The weaponry is each company's web browser. Microsoft includes theirs with new PCs, gaining a likely installed base consensus on the platform that eighty percent of PC users use. Netscape gives their browser away, bundles it with lots of PCs, and it's freely downloadable from the web itself. I bet you can download the Netscape browser using the Microsoft browser. Cute! "/>
			<outline text="Q: What do Netscape and Microsoft want? "/>
			<outline text="A: The exclusive right to move the HTML standard forward."/>
			<outline text="They can't both get what they want, so this makes great fodder for DaveNet rants. A president of a large publishing company asked me last week how it was going to shake out. I said I don't know! He asked me to make a call. For the first time in a long time, I had to say I really can't make a call. "/>
			<outline text="Now that Microsoft's browser is shipping, we can see how the battle is shaping up. Did they make it Netscape-compatible? No. Many websites use a wonderful feature called &quot;tables&quot; that Netscape implements, that Microsoft doesn't. Sites that use tables look shitty when you browse them with Microsoft's browser, and they look great when you browse them with Netscape. What should the website designer do? Take the feature out of the site? It's hard or impossible to have one page for Windows users and one for Netscape users."/>
			<outline text="Although Microsoft people deny it, this is a shot over Netscape's bow. They're testing their power. Will the web developer community get in line with Microsoft? Certainly *some* of them will. "/>
			<outline text="Some site managers didn't use tables because it isn't in the common-denominator definition of HTML. Those guys look reallly good now. It's possible to make a great website without using tables. But more and more, when I see a pretty site, and I want to figure out how they did it, I view their source and find that they did it with tables. It's not an insignificant omission by Microsoft. It's extremely significant."/>
			<outline text="When I was in Seattle last week I had a meeting with Microsoft's Blackbird team, I got to play Twenty Questions, piecing together for myself Microsoft's current plan for evolving the worldwide web. They're not going to be humble! Pedal to the metal. They see a vacuum and want to fill it. The tables issue *is* just a shot across the bow. They're building battleships, getting the marines ready, loading up their bombers and training fighter pilots."/>
			<outline text="As usual, Microsoft's technology is not the best, but as usual it probably won't matter. Netscape isn't too entrenched to be displaced by a powerful Microsoft presence. But the natural ally of the web community is Netscape, they're too small to *not* respond to their needs. "/>
			<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;askNot&quot;&gt;I said Apple could run the JFK ad&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet.&quot; Here's an important point -- Netscape could run that ad too. And really embrace the concept. In fact, I think it's the only winning strategy for them."/>
			<outline text="***Jeffrey Veen on Web standards"/>
			<outline text="The faceoff between Microsoft and Netscape is great fodder for DaveNet, but it's an equally great topic for people who make their living putting up websites and keeping them on the air, people like Jeffrey Veen, jeff@wired.com. He's the chief interface architect at HotWired, the online zine that I write for. Jeff has been participating in the debate on HTML standards on the Apple Internet Authoring list. "/>
			<outline text="I asked Jeff for some comments, here's what he had to say..."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="&lt;b&gt;From: jeff@wired.com&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="To: DaveNet readers&lt;br&gt;"/>
			<outline text="Re: Web Standards&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"/>
			<outline text="I see pages all over the web that tell me their site is Enhanced for Netscape 1.1 or some such. I wonder what it would have been like if this had happened in other industries? Would we be watching Dateline NBC Enhanced for Zenith 19-inch Trinitron?"/>
			<outline text="On all the HTML newsgroups and mailing lists I follow, it seems that Netscape extensions vs the HTML 3.0 specification is the most heated debate, as hot as Mac vs. Windows, or Emacs vs. vi. People argue that they can't create effective web pages without the Netscape Extensions. But I think every time a Netscape tag is implemented, the value of HTML as a standard language is decreased. And that, I would argue, will severely *limit* web design creativity in the not-so-long run. Take a step back from the current crop of aesthetically pleasing web pages for a moment and think about this."/>
			<outline text="The web, as a medium, has proven its potential to replace all other media. Print, radio, television, telephone, and others not yet even dreamed of are all able to be distributed over a peer to peer network like the Internet. HTML is the first crude, infantile step toward describing those bits of information as they are transferred from one networked device to another."/>
			<outline text="In the beginning, way back in the prehistoric days of the early 90s, this could happen because a group of people decided to do it the same way. If we all speak the same language, we can all communicate effortlessly all the time whereever we are with whatever we are using. That's how TV works. That's why you can call anyone in the entire world with the phone on your desk."/>
			<outline text="The web works especially well because no assumptions were made. The creators of this system didn't assume you'd be using a &quot;standard multimedia computer with at least 256 colors, etc. etc.&quot; In fact, they didn't even assume you'd be using a computer. Therefore, for content to work at its most effective level, it needs to be formatted so that *any* device can render it. "/>
			<outline text="Imagine a web browser that plugs into the dashboard of your car, letting you listen to web pages read to you by a digital voice composite. I've seen a prototype. The color of a link becomes a bit less important when you need to render it as a sound."/>
			<outline text="Nicholas Negroponte argues in &quot;Being Digital&quot; that the most important bits in the universe are the &quot;bits about bits&quot; -- the ones that describe the rest. In his example of a football broadcast, you would be able to decide how the bitstream is rendered. You can have them rendered as a video representation of the game, which would be different from the audio-only rendering, which in turn would be different from the schematic diagram rendering of the plays and statistics. Or you could combine them. Or just have it printed to read later."/>
			<outline text="A company like Netscape fears giving the users this sort of choice, much as ABC and Time fear the new media. Giving users a choice means they can choose something else. &quot;If we control the media, the revenue can only flow to us.&quot; The opposite is what used to be bitchen about the Net. You just got the raw data, and could format it in anyway you want. My email looks much different in Eudora than my friend's Telnet window and Pine. We have a choice in how our media is rendered. [And then you have cable modems - 10 Mbits to the home, 19.2K back because all the happy consumer has to do is click the &quot;Purchase&quot; button. That, to me, is insulting -- but that's the direction we're heading.]"/>
			<outline text="Designing content that can only be rendered effectively in one application for three computer platforms is way too shortsighted. Just give me a choice, and suggest the presentation."/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="Thanks Jeff!"/>
			<outline text="BTW, HotWired is looking marvelous -- their pages look good in either Netscape *or* in Microsoft because they never used tables. They don't want to be beholden to one vendor. An interesting strategy and a courageous one, and a winning one (at least so far)."/>

			<outline text="***The Software Bar, revisited"/>
			<outline text="I remember coming to Silicon Valley for the first time in 1979, looking for the focal point of the computer industry, and being dismayed that I couldn't find it. &quot;These people must party *somewhere*,&quot; I said to myself. Nope. "/>
			<outline text="I've been here for 16 years. Trust me. There's no special place where the computer industry congegates for smalltalk and dealmaking and lovemaking. Maybe that's why there are so few interesting deals in the software biz? And maybe why there's so little love? Hmmm. There must be a social pulse to Silicon Valley, but it's hard to find."/>
			<outline text="Eventually the parties happened, but they weren't in the valley, they were at resorts in the Arizona desert, or in Las Vegas or Atlanta. Schmoozing is a twice-yearly event, held in hotel suites and ballrooms, and lately in stadiums and convention centers. Oddly, the number of conferences has grown to fill the entire calendar, except for brief periods at the end of summer and around the winter holidays. Want to go to a software industry conference? There's always one to go to."/>
			<outline text="***The San Francisco restaurant business"/>
			<outline text="I now have friends in the San Francisco restaurant business, so the Software Bar idea has gotten new life. Want to open a bar or restaurant? Now we know how to do it. At the same time, the concept of an Internet Bar has caught on. There are probably about 20 of them in the planning stages in San Francisco alone. "/>
			<outline text="A few weeks ago, I got involved in the planning process for a software bar in Palo Alto. I had partners. They were raising money. Then it became clear we were going to get the money! Millions of dollars. I started to panic! Oooops. I better figure out what the software is *really* going to look like. "/>
			<outline text="I resolved my panic. "/>
			<outline text="Gotta go talk with my friend Marc Canter."/>
			<outline text="***Marc and Devorah Canter"/>
			<outline text="I've known marc@mediaband.com for about ten years. Friends kept telling me there was this new guy making Mac software that I had to meet. I remember meeting Marc on the floor at MacWorld Expo in 1985. He had a lot of bluster. I thought he was a bullshitter, but a fun one. I met with him later that year in Las Vegas where he told me his grand vision about how graphics was going to bring taxi cab drivers into the software business. I didn't get it."/>
			<outline text="I learned later that Marc always has a grand vision, and he's always way ahead of the curve. He sees this as a curse, because people don't understand, they think he's bullshitting, and they never do what he wants them to do. Marc is searching the planet for evidence of intelligent life, and the world, for the most part, was letting him down! But I saw this as a blessing -- to be able to so uniquely see where things are going is a good thing, not a bad one."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, about a year after meeting Marc, I was in Chicago speaking at a Macintosh user's group, and had an evening to kill. I looked Marc up, and went over to his small Chicago office located on the first floor of the small house he shared with his wife devorah@mediaband.com."/>
			<outline text="At this meeting I learned that Marc isn't a bullshitter. He showed me an early version of his VideoWorks software, which eventually was renamed Director, and now is the industry standard multimedia development platform. Cute characters roam around the stage, opening doors, making wonderful sounds. Music punctuates the presentation, the characters dance. Smart guys working here, having a great time! That demo blew my mind just like my first demo of a spreadsheet did. Who ever knew a computer could be used for that kind of stuff? I sure didn't!"/>
			<outline text="Over the years Marc and I got to know each other better. He struggled with the company thing. They moved from Chicago to San Francisco. I introduced him to John Doerr and Nat Goldhaber, pitched them on investing in Marc's company, and they did. They hired CEOs, but for the most part, Marc and Devorah ran the parts of MacroMind that worked. "/>
			<outline text="Director became the standard because Marc has a wonderful way with C programmers and truly understands content developers. He gives good speech. He gets in your face. He's a human bridge. He's unstoppable. A force of nature. "/>
			<outline text="Devorah built the MacroMind developer program. She organized Marc's friends, holding developer's conferences, providing them with specialized tools, making introductions, training them and entertaining them. MacroMind developer conferences were great parties! "/>
			<outline text="Eventually Director became god, Marc left MacroMind, and it became MacroMedia. The company merged countless times with other companies, and eventually went public. Earlier this year Marc and Devorah's stock became liquid, and now they're rich. Coooooool."/>
			<outline text="***Let's party!"/>
			<outline text="All this time, I had a basic belief that someday Marc and I would work with each other. I have this feeling about a few other people. Stay in each other's loops, keep talking about what we're doing and what we're interested in, and stay creative. "/>
			<outline text="Someday, as the big wheel turns, our tokens will end up on the same square. It's an intuitive thing."/>
			<outline text="I focused on outlining, programming languages and collaborative structures, with brief forays into graphics. Marc focused on music, animation and storytelling, They needed an outliner and a programming language, so they did them -- but my stuff is more powerful and complete. I did bullet charts, but my graphics couldn't compare to his. In many ways Marc and I share a spirit, but we're diversified -- Marc can put characters on the stage, and I can wire a hundred stages together."/>
			<outline text="Over the last year, our loops have been circling very, very close to each other. And then, a couple of months ago, when Netscape and MacroMedia announced their strategic relationship, it became clear that we were arriving at the top of the mountain that Marc and I had been climbing from different sides. The web, which I made it my business to understand was merging with the multimedia world. Marc's tool, Director, his labor of love, was becoming compatible with my tool, Frontier, *my* labor of love."/>
			<outline text="So, when the Software Bar thing became real, I had to get Marc into the loop. We sat down and tried to brainstorm with the restaurant and money people, and then realized we had much bigger fish to fry. We split off. The number of combinations between my tools and his, my community and his, were too big to pass on this time around. Our opportunity is much greater than the Software Bar."/>
			<outline text="Now Marc and I are working together. The few people who know about this collaboration think it's great. I think it's great! Marc says &quot;I'm so glad you came into my life!&quot; Yeah man! It's love. It's so cooooooooooooool."/>
			<outline text="Now you know too. :-)"/>
			<outline text="Let's have a party!"/>
			<outline text="***You are media"/>
			<outline text="I've been zooming thru the multimedia world with Marc as my guide and now I realize that the software bar is much more than just a watering hole for Silicon Valley execs. Multimedia websites running over a 28K connection are going to make the web more beautiful. Little animations, sparkles of color and movement and music. It'll be great! But a high bandwidth connection, the kind of performance you can get from a local area network, is going to make even more incredibly beautiful collaborations possible. "/>
			<outline text="The bar will be a showcase for the very latest high bandwidth interactive technology, the stuff you can't get at home. If you want to impress your date, take her to Marc and Dave's Software Bar. Every week something new to blow your mind, and hers!"/>
			<outline text="Everyone has a presence in the bar, whether or not they're physically present. The bar is on the Internet, so you can connect to it from anywhere. You can see who's there. What they're playing with, even *who* they're playing with! Heh heh heh."/>
			<outline text="Over many years of being an online person, and a member of many online communities, I've learned that whenever a group connects at a cyber level, it isn't very long before they establish a physical connection. I want to see the body of my new friend. With a software bar as the meeting place, we will have a natural physical place to congregate. "/>
			<outline text="So here's the punchline..."/>
			<outline text="What's the result of the integration of multimedia technology with the Internet?"/>
			<outline text="People become media objects! "/>
			<outline text="Place your hand in front of your face. Palm facing your eyes. Quickly move your hand to hit your forehead."/>
			<outline text="Duh."/>
			<outline text="There's Dave and DaveNet. "/>
			<outline text="Marc and MarcNet."/>
			<outline text="Person and persona."/>
			<outline text="Go with the flow!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: We'll rent out the Software Bar for product launches and media events. We'll always have the latest and greatest software and hardware to showcase, to make *your* software and hardware look great. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: It has occurred to us that we could just be a software and content supplier for software bars. With so many opening all over the world, maybe that's the best way for us to make a contribution. But there will be one or two bars that Marc and I will hang out at. One or two that will get the new stuff first. Two likely locales -- San Francisco and Palo Alto. "/>

			<outline text="This piece is brought to you by the Rolling Stones, singing Start It Up from their Tatoo You CD -- the same song that Microsoft is using to promote Windows 95, but I wouldn't know -- I haven't been watching TV. But I was at the rollout in August. I remember, this was the song that Bill G *didn't* dance to. It was a worldwide trance. And a great song too!"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I was putzing around on my computer. Not really getting any productive work done. I decided to try out the Microsoft formula, to see if the Stones could get me started up. It didn't work! Instead I had to stand up and sway and roll my shoulders. Ohhhh. You make a grown man cry! I won't say what you make a dead man do. My hands are greasy. She's my fav-favorite shape. Wowowowowow. Yeah. Cooooooool. I'll take you places you've never ever seeeeeen. Never stop. I blow my top! Oooooooooooph. "/>
			<outline text="Those guys! I wish I could sing like that."/>
			<outline text="I'd love to put this Stones song on my DaveNet CD, but I'll have to start saving. Right now $12 million would blow my entire music budget. Cooool."/>
			<outline text="Maybe Marc and I could do the next Bill Gates promotional CD? In that CD, Bill would actually dance! Index finger in the air. Roll around the sun a few times. Strut and sway, roll and wind. It'd be cooool. He'd be running hot. What do you think? We could do the same for Scott McNealy or Michael Spindler or even Steve Jobs. We could rough it up!"/>

			<outline text="The software bar thread is staying hot."/>
			<outline text="One of the most interesting messages came from Nolan Bushnell, nolanb@aol.com. Nolan is a famous guy -- he started Atari in the 70s, made the cover of the newsweeklies a few times, fathered a phenomenon and an industry, and got credit for it. Bushnell is a technologist, and like Steve Wozniak, he's more of a teddy bear than a red meat eater. "/>
			<outline text="Bushnell tried again in the 80s with Pizza Time Theaters, but he was way ahead of the technology curve. Internetworking wasn't part of his venue operating system back then, but this time around, it's central to the plan. He's interesting because he truly understands entertainment and technology and venues. This time around I think he caught the market window perfectly."/>

			<outline text="We will connect all our facilities with T-1 links. Our game tournaments and competitions will feed into the IVDS game network that we are putting together with Wave Systems, NIN, Group Telecom and a whole group of others.  The Internet is lousy for game play because of the latency of the system and the added latency of today's modems. Thanks to the IVDS system to cure that problem at a low cost.  "/>
			<outline text="My real reason to do this is an attempt to put as much technology into people's hands as possible as a backstop to our failed school system. We will open our facility at 6:00 AM and operate until 2:00 AM while offering educational classes all day and in some cases into the evening. By paying for the facility and equipment from entertainment uses we can deliver computerized education to the masses at the lowest prices possible.  20% or more of our computer time will be actually given away to low income kids.

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/22/95; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="In the sixteen years I've been a developer for Apple Computer systems, I can't recall the chairman and co-founder of the company, Mike Markkula, ever saying anything publicly. "/>
			<outline text="He's been the invisible chairman -- an intriguing character because all evidence indicates that the real power at Apple is and always has been Mike Markkula. CEOs and visionaries come and go: Jobs, Scott, Sculley, Spindler -- but the man behind the scenes pulling the strings is Markkula. Want to do a big deal with Apple? Gotta talk with Mike."/>
			<outline text="So when Markkula says something publicly, that, in itself, is news."/>
			<outline text="This morning there's a report by Jim Carlton in the Wall Street Journal that includes a quote from an interview with Markkula. &quot;It would make a very, very powerful alternative if IBM chose the Mac operating system&quot; he says. He acknowledges that Apple and IBM have had discussions about this."/>
			<outline text="Reuters reports that IBM and Apple had buyout talks one year ago, but failed to come to terms. According to Reuters, the issue was a $20 difference in the per-share price and compensation packages for Apple executives. "/>
			<outline text="Too bad they didn't do the deal. Both company's fortunes have eroded quite a bit in the last year. The difference, a couple of billion dollars and some pride, seem like small things compared to the losses both companies have endured in the interim. As a Macintosh developer, I wish they had done the deal back then."/>
			<outline text="Regardless, I'm glad that Markkula is becoming visible. He's a DaveNet subscriber, and I'd like to invite him to tell our audience what his plans are for Apple Computer, its shareholders, its users its developers, its employees. A few weeks ago we carried the voice of Steve Wozniak, another founder of Apple. Till then the founders, Jobs, Wozniak and Markkula, had been silent about the Apple of 1995. "/>
			<outline text="Mike -- any time you want to use this space to tell your story, please let me know."/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: If there's a serious possibility that Apple and IBM might get together, I'd like to refer the parties to a piece I wrote on 10/20/94 entitled &quot;It's a Great Computer, Steve.&quot; It outlines a plan for IBM produced Macintosh that would be very hot. Of course it would have been better to have launched this product *before* Windows 95, but better late than never. The piece is at http://www.hotwired.com/userland/itsagreatcomputersteve_19.html."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;9/22/95; 12:00:00 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="Here's another short DaveNet piece. I'm writing a longer report on Netscape 2.0. It'll be ready on Monday morning. In the meantime, while checking stock prices this morning, two reports came up, one interesting, and one *very* interesting."/>
			<outline text="The mildly interesting one is another half-step by Apple, acknowledging that Internet applications and content development tools are the future of the Macintosh platform. As usual, no bold moves. I suspect that current Apple management is not capable of making the earth move. Here's proof. eWorld, the nice friendly interface for America OnLine that Apple adopted last year as their presence in the online world, is migrating towards the Internet. Same people, same mission -- but now they're asking for an Internet halo. It's not a big surprise."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="eWorld is a big loser. There used to be a vibrant online community gathered around Apple called AppleLink. But in the name of higher revenues, Apple gradually strangled AppleLink and eventually offered eWorld. But in the background, the geek world that Apple used to rule, had fallen in love with the Internet, the platform with no platform vendor. Instead of going with the flow, Apple plodded ahead with eWorld as if nothing had happened."/>
			<outline text="Macintosh system developers and managers need a real unabashedly Macintosh presence on the net. The perfect company for providing this service is Apple Computer. But so far, there's no indication that they plan to do this, or even that they understand this."/>
			<outline text="The acid test: will they be running their servers on Macintoshes? Will developers be able to run Mac software up in their cloud? Perhaps we could get some clarification from Apple management. None of this is clear from their press materials."/>
			<outline text="***A Bold Move by Quarterdeck"/>
			<outline text="I was going to suggest that Microsoft acquire StarNine Systems, the Berkeley company that's made it their business to supply server tools for Macintosh system managers. They make email gateways for all the popular mail systems, including Apple's moribund PowerTalk and Microsoft's moribund Mail and CE Software's wandering QuickMail. I assume it's proven to be a good business for StarNine because it allowed them to assume the dominant position in the Macintosh web server market by acquiring the popular MacHTTP from Chuck Shotton and relaunching it as WebStar earlier this year."/>
			<outline text="Well, it's too late for Microsoft to buy out StarNine, Quarterdeck Systems has already done it! So much for developers not being willing to invest in the Mac platform. Quarterdeck is a large, widely respected company, and now they own a vibrant business that's based in the Macintosh world. I suspect that porting WebStar to Windows NT is high on the new to-do list for StarNine. But at least in the meantime, the Macintosh community has a new large presence, one that to-date has only made (excellent) PC-compatible software."/>
			<outline text="Neither company's website carries news of this deal at this time. Check them out in the next few hours, they're at www.quarterdeck.com and www.starnine.com, I bet both of them will have reports, any minute now..."/>
			<outline text="See you early next week!"/>

			<outline text="***Don't doubt it"/>
			<outline text="I wonder how you feel about email? A year ago, when my life was pretty quiet, I checked my email with the hope that there would be some contact, real contact with real human beings. I was feeling pretty isolated. I was writing, but mostly just for myself and a few friends. Passionate and personal stuff, sometimes confused. "/>
			<outline text="I was processing what remained, within me, of a broken relationship. "/>
			<outline text="It worked. I learned a lot from all that processing, some of which I've expressed in my DaveNet pieces. Email works as an expressive medium. It's just writing, but it's writing where the reader can easily write back. And it has an immediacy and a personal nature that's unmatched by any other medium. "/>
			<outline text="Sometime later I realized that love and email are not contradictions. So many people are surprised to have emotional stuff show up in their box. But carefully read your email and ask yourself if emotions aren't showing up there even if you think they aren't. Or shouldn't."/>
			<outline text="Why am I thinking about this? Yesterday I got a powerful and honest email from my brother, pwiner@bigchief.com, that made me cry. Email is bringing us closer. It's coooool. He's my younger brother, now he's a father (I'm an uncle!). "/>
			<outline text="We've been close in the past, and I hope we'll be close again."/>
			<outline text="Yes, it's a new medium. It is possible to express real stuff via email. It's a fertile field. It's very coooool."/>
			<outline text="***A week from tomorrow"/>
			<outline text="Saturday October 7 is an important milestone for me -- it's the one year anniversary of DaveNet! Who would have thought that what started as an email campaign to get people to come to Marc Canter's press conference would turn into a new livelihood for Dave Winer. Life sure is strange!"/>
			<outline text="I'm working on expanding DaveNet to include more interesting lightly-edited comments from interesting people. It seems a waste to get all this great email in response to my DaveNet rants and not be able to share them. I want to expand the service. [You won't get more email, the comments will appear on the website version of DaveNet only.]"/>
			<outline text="Should we have a DaveNet conference? I think I would like to. We'd cover more than the usual industry stuff. Animation and music (multimedia!) of course. Web authoring -- yes! It would not compete with Stewart or Esther unless they're thinking about adding love and bodywork to their agendas. "/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, I offer to be a speaker at either conference, or someone else's -- I'd love to do &quot;DaveNet Live&quot; -- an early morning unrehearsed keynote presentation, where I rant in DaveNet style -- in person! Smiling and humming, dancing and weaving. Want to make your conference zooooooom? "/>
			<outline text="Service with a smile! We aim to please."/>
			<outline text="So we're in negotiations to turn DaveNet into a bigger Internet presence. No deal yet, but we hope soooooon, maybe by next Saturday. Along with DaveNet, we've made a deal with a famous net personality to do a website at least equal in stature to DaveNet. No announcement yet. Maybe next Saturday... Whatever it is -- it'll be a very cooooooool site!"/>
			<outline text="At the same time, the new version of Clay Basket is coming together nicely. I'm working with the alpha Netscape 2.0 to be sure that the new Clay is the firstest with the mostest. We've got a niche carved out for this online outliner that's really cooooool. You'll at least see the results of the new Clay Basket by next week, assuming all goes well. "/>
			<outline text="Hint: it's now a powerful authoring tool for web content development. But I'm zigging as others zag. It's not WYSIWYG. It *is* for nerds and geeks who like to do macros like:"/>
			<outline text="&amp;lt;!--#ftp (&quot;stuffit&quot;, &quot;clay.sit.hqx&quot;, &quot;Clay Basket 1.0b5&quot;)--&amp;gt;. "/>
			<outline text="If you have some idea of what that means, then you'll like the new Clay Basket."/>
			<outline text="BTW, it works real well in conjunction with the new WYSIWYG HTML editors."/>
			<outline text="***Confusion"/>
			<outline text="A bunch of people were confused by my statement in yesterday's piece &quot;Macintosh system developers and managers need a real unabashedly Macintosh presence on the net.&quot; I thought I explained it in the acid test I proposed: &quot;Will developers be able to run Mac software up in their cloud?&quot; "/>
			<outline text="But apparently not, I got a lot of email from people who are confused. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; OK. Let me try to clear this up. "/>
			<outline text="&quot;Cloud&quot; is a term that was coined, as far as I know, by General Magic. I really like the concept. There's my computer and your computer, and then there's the cloud, a nebulous place, not well defined, but a place nonetheless. Every web server is part of the cloud. And if I can put software behind a web server, then my software becomes part of the cloud too."/>
			<outline text="I've been lobbying online companies to let me run software on a server since the early 80s when I wanted to write BBS software to run on CompuServe's hosts. It's controversial because the system manager has to realllly trust you to let you run software on their host. They've not wanted to do it. But with the Internet, which is a totally open platform, there's no one to say no. But..."/>
			<outline text="I don't want to operate a web server in my house. I've said that before. Been there, done that. I want someone else to run my server. "/>
			<outline text="So, I would like to see someone offer a webfarm service for Macintosh web developers, where not only can I store pages, but I can also install CGI scripts and double-clickable apps that run on the server. That's what the acid test was about. If Apple means business, if it's unabashedly behind the Mac OS, you'll be able to do this. If this is still confusing, please let me know."/>
			<outline text="***John Doerr Retracts"/>
			<outline text="John Doerr, jdoerr@kpcb.com, the famous venture capitalist I referred to in &quot;Zooooooming&quot; writes:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Dave: Would you consider retracting your understandable misquote of an out-of-context San Jose Mercury-News summary of the Hot Chips conference? I believe the article quotes me observing something like 'some analysts want to convene war crime trials for Apple's management' because of the inroads the Wintel PC has made in the home market."/>
			<outline text="&quot;I did *not* call for war crime trials. Instead, said I thought Apple had done a terrific job smoothly migrating from 68K to PowerPC with the high-end, upper third of Mac product line and look forward to the entire Mac line being PowerPC by year end."/>
			<outline text="&quot;BTW, there is no single 'home market,' instead several important segments: education, soho, entertainment. Apple leads in several. Profits in the home market are every vendor's challenge.&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Thanks, glad to clear that up John!"/>
			<outline text="BTW, what does &quot;soho&quot; mean?"/>
			<outline text="***Apple VP of Developer Relations"/>
			<outline text="I got a call from an executive recruiter looking to fill a new position at Apple Computer, Vice-President of Developer Relations. I promised that I would ask my friends if they have any ideas. So here goes! If you have any ideas on who would make a great VP for developers at Apple please let me know."/>
			<outline text="It's encouraging to see Apple making developers such a high priority. They deserve someone who is very creative and unabashedly behind the Mac OS. Be creative and let me know what you think. I'll pass your suggestions on."/>

			<outline text="***Online Outliners"/>
			<outline text="Sorry for the hiatus -- I've been making love -- with my compiler. Workin away on a new version of Clay Basket, which has suddenly become a network hit! I was at a party last Saturday and word started going around that the author of Clay Basket was there. A group gathered asking questions. How are you going to make money? What's it like working with Netscape? It was kind of fun, but it wasn't what I came for. There were dateable women at this party! Cooool. Who wants to nerd out, talking about software, when beautiful women are present? Not *this* software author."/>
			<outline text="I also don't want to talk about features yet because I'm still divided on the direction for this software. I have two routes I want to pursue. And it's turning into a competitive market. Clay Basket is an online outliner. So is Ceneca's SiteMill (still unshipped) which was acquired by Adobe Systems last week for an undisclosed amount. Then yesterday, another online outliner from Collabra was acquired by Netscape for the staggering sum of $90 million. This ain't Kansas anymore. "/>
			<outline text="The online outliner category certainly is heating up. We have a few unique ideas. There's another software motto -- along with You Can't Hurry Love and We Make Shitty Software. It goes like this -- Loose Lips Sink Ships. An old World War II poster. Uncle Sam looks at you sternly. He's thinking about the letter you got from your boyfriend. He's coming home next week. Don't kiss and tell. He could get killed. Don't tell anyone! Loose lips and sunken ships. Not cooool."/>
			<outline text="So we keep our lips tight and hope for the best."/>
			<outline text="***Exploding PowerBooks"/>
			<outline text="From yesterday's Wall Street Journal, Apple is toast. They quote Eric Nee, the editor of Upside, www.upside.com, saying there's nothing left at Apple. The company is a miserable failure. Spindler should go. What's the board doing? John Doerr, the famous venture capitalist, is quoted in the San Jose Mercury-News saying a war crimes trial should be convened for Apple management. "/>
			<outline text="I think everyone is reacting too hastily. Their lips are too loose. This ship ain't sunk. Don't sign Apple's epitaph. Sure there are problems, you've been reading your DaveNets, haven't you? But, shit, it ain't as bad as everyone says it is! "/>
			<outline text="They can't make enough computers to keep up with demand. That's not the end of the world. Want to go to the World Series? Get in line. Want to buy a new Mac? Sorry, you might have to wait. In normal times, with no reality distortion, this would be good news. But starting with Steve Jobs there's always been a reality distortion field inside of and outside of Apple Computer Inc. To Spindler's credit, he's been trying to tone down the hype, but the reality around Apple isn't quite up to normal standards."/>
			<outline text="Apple *is* overheating and under siege. Then came the exploding PowerBooks. We can't help but laugh. Sorry Mike but it's funny! The exploding PowerBooks are just a karmic answer -- what goes around comes around, Apple. Don't clean up the mess in your back yard, and sooner or later your PowerBooks start exploding. "/>
			<outline text="Apple has done everything in their power to delete the Macintosh. Takes a licking keeps on ticking. Platforms with 20 million users don't just disappear. Big momentum. Proof: look at all the ways Apple has screwed the market, and the damned things are still selling!"/>
			<outline text="Apple's beautiful six-color logo is the sixth most recognized symbol in the world. When people think of Apple they think of Jobs and Wozniak in the garage. The six-color Apple means love. It's a friend. That's what sells Macintoshes. Kirk and Scotty. The brash young American entrepreneur and his teddy bear friend. Kirk and Scotty. "/>
			<outline text="The real Apple is exactly the opposite, totally driven by fear. That's what the world is finally tuning into and they don't like it. The market isn't disappearing. But reality is sinking in. The distortion field is flickering on and off."/>
			<outline text="Strategically, Apple *is* dead. They continue to think they're hogging the fast lane, but they aren't even on the highway anymore. But the machine is still running, so there's still time for a new strategy."/>
			<outline text="Once again -- an oft-repeated mantra by this columnist -- Apple should withdraw from key software technologies and allow other developers to lead in the newly competitive markets. "/>
			<outline text="***Checking in with Netscape"/>
			<outline text="I checked with my friend at Netscape last week. The 2.0 browser implements menu sharing, a common protocol that allows script writers to add commands to compatible menu bars. "/>
			<outline text="This is a big opening in the Netscape environment, but it isn't getting as much attention as it deserves. Macintosh script writers should take note -- web browsing on the Mac is considerably more powerful and open than on Windows. This will make a difference in the content development market. It means I can add smart commands to Netscape's menu bar. You can too."/>
			<outline text="***Getting Into Agreement"/>
			<outline text="I've been working on a day-to-day basis with Marc Canter for the last couple of weeks. "/>
			<outline text="I've learned that I often pitch ideas at people with the assumption that they disagree with me. Negative energy. I've got to prove something to you, and I treat you like a hostile witness. It's a feedback loop. People react negatively to my pitch, only confirming my belief that they disagree with me. It's a subtle thing, but as I look at my relationships, especially those within my family, I see this presumption of disagreement making these relationships unhappy and ungratifying."/>
			<outline text="Then I saw Marc doing the same thing! That's how I spotted it in myself. I took a look at what was going on. I said to him -- Marc, man, chances are actually 50-50 that any random person you pick off the street is going to agree with you. Why not be an optimist and assume they do agree? And consider this, we're business partners, we have basically the same view of the world. So the chance that I agree with you is actually closer to 90 percent. And I've agreed to always consider your point of view, so basically I've guaranteed to you that we agree."/>
			<outline text="It was a revelation for me! A way to be happy with your friends and also have opinions. Another reason that being positive works for you and being negative doesn't. I call this Getting Into Agreement, and I'm sure I didn't invent it, but I just learned the lesson."/>
			<outline text="Sometimes the ratio is reversed. Joe and Jane have fundamentally different views of the world. Joe can listen positively to Jane, and still find that they virtually never agree. A win-win deal is possible -- they can make their products work together. "/>
			<outline text="Competitors are in agreement with each other. They share the same view of the world. Competitors can be best friends. They can also make their products work together. "/>
			<outline text="Another observation. Never marry someone who doesn't share your basic view of the world. If you can't get into agreement with your spouse, you'll both be miserable. This goes for business relationships too."/>
			<outline text="I find that, as a person who was ahead of the times in his twenties, I'm really in synch with them in my forties. Basically, much of the world is in agreement with me. So why not assume that instead of assuming the opposite?"/>
			<outline text="***Zooooooming"/>
			<outline text="I'd like to introduce yet another concept -- zooooming. "/>
			<outline text="I started talking about zooming a few months ago, and now a bunch of my friends are using the term. Zooming is when you overcome your fears and trust the universe to make things right. "/>
			<outline text="You fly and float and hum and weave and sing."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="Opportunity knocks. Hello! "/>
			<outline text="I like playing with people who zoom. Win-win deals all the time. It's cooool."/>
			<outline text="How am I doing?"/>
			<outline text="I'm zoooooooooming!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: In the 9/11/95 issue of PC Letter, www.pcletter.com, David Coursey writes about free software. It's a new thread for the PC software industry. Blown away by the success of Netscape. Now the idea of giving away a whole suite of applications is out there. It's floating around the space. Someone will probably do it. This issue of PC Letter is worth reading. "/>

			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="Do you like speedbumps? "/>
			<outline text="I do. On the street, in front of my house, there's a huge one. As you approach the bump, slow down -- that's the point. If you don't, you and the contents of your car bounce around! It isn't painful, but it sure is uncomfortable. And I always worry that something's going to fall out of my car. "/>
			<outline text="It's nice to have a speedbump in front of your house, especially if you're in the software business. Thanks to my speedbump, when the FedEx truck rolls down the street, you never know what's going to end up on the sidewalk!"/>
			<outline text="The other day, I was going for a walk, passing the speedbump, and guess what was there? A nice little diskette. I turned it over. On the label it said Netscape 2.0a2. "/>
			<outline text="Hmmmm. "/>
			<outline text="Coooool! "/>
			<outline text="***What is it?"/>
			<outline text="The big new features in Netscape 2.0 are a plug-in architecture, frames, a built-in emailer, and a new bookmark editor. There are performance improvements -- support for client-side image maps and progressive JPEG. Text can be colored. It supports superscripts and subscripts. Pages can open new windows. And there's an interesting new command called Document Info."/>
			<outline text="The new bookmark editor is especially interesting to me because I've released my own outliner bookmark editor -- it's one of the things Clay Basket does. Previous versions of Netscape had a very limited and hard to use bookmark editor. That created the need for an elegant and powerful one. That's why I did Clay Basket. The new bookmark editor in Netscape 2.0 is nice. It's an outliner. You can expand and collapse submenus, you can drag a mark to a new location to move it to another submenu. It's what people need. "/>
			<outline text="The built-in mailer is nice because your email can be styled like a web page!  This is probably the biggest single immediate-value feature, and even though the mailer isn't as capable or rich as Eudora in its ability to store and manage text in mailboxes, styled text is a feature that everyone is going to want, and it's one that the Eudora folks are going to have a hard time implementing. And Netscape made their move -- buying Collabra ensures that the mailer is going to get very nice. It's good stuff. Eudora beware."/>
			<outline text="I haven't seen Netscape Gold yet, the version that allows you to edit web pages with WYSIWYG tools, but I assume those features are incorporated into the emailer, so if you were reading this message in Netscape's mailer, I could use &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italics&lt;/i&gt;. How long have we been waiting for this? A very long time."/>
			<outline text="Many of the new features are there for web content authors. Expect to see pages with multicolored text. And because pages can now open links in new windows, Netscape is becoming a window-happy program like the Finder or the America OnLine client. I expect people will start complaining as content authors use this feature, so it's best to use it in moderation."/>
			<outline text="These features are there for web users and content authors. But there's a major new feature called plug-ins, still mostly invisible, that's there for commercial-level software developers, people who work in C or C++ and for companies like Sun, MacroMedia and Adobe. And littler guys like you and me. I guess that they're using this architecture to implement the new Frames feature."/>
			<outline text="A plug-in can draw text and graphics into the browser window and it can handle mouse clicks and keystrokes. Instead of opening a new window to display an animation, for example, now it can play right on the web page. It's an important feature for Adobe -- finally they can integrate PDF display right into the web. I bet PDF still doesn't take off as a web content standard, but it has a better shot now. It's important for Sun because this is the mechanism by which they can add the Java language to the web world. But it's open too -- other scripting languages can plug right into the architecture of the web as viewed thru web browsers."/>
			<outline text="I'm most interested in the connection this opens for developers who work with MacroMedia Director. Director has a full suite of developer tools, Java doesn't. Director has a vibrant developer community. PDF doesn't. You can make truly beautiful stuff happen with Director. So far we've only seen demos of what Java can do, and they're very uninteresting compared to what's going on in DirectorLand."/>
			<outline text="The tools issue is huge. So many languages have been promoted with no answer to the tools question, examples include Telescript, AppleScript and ScriptX. But the tools make the environment. It's nice that you have an interpreter, maybe even a great one. But how do I develop my scripts? I need a great editor, debugger, storage system, verb set, sample code and docs and a developer community. All of this is lacking for Java, but in great supply for a mature environment like Director."/>
			<outline text="The plug-ins issue is where Netscape and Microsoft diverge. Netscape may support OLE. Microsoft has a great developer tool in Visual Basic, with hundreds of thousands of developers and lots of tools. And Director will probably be plugged into Microsoft's web browser too. Microsoft has Blackbird. But Netscape will probably get Blackbird and Blackbird will probably get competition."/>
			<outline text="Life got more interesting! More puzzles to piece together. Netscape is creating their own flow. And they're having fun. They've dug some holes for developers to fill. And they have a neat answer to Microsoft's shot across the bow. "/>
			<outline text="Coooooooooooooooooooooooool."/>

			<outline text="PPPS: I have more thinking to do about frames. Stay tuned."/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: Now that Netscape 2.0 is out, we won't be able to sell Clay Basket as the only solution for bookmark editing. Luckily, Clay already has lots of features that Netscape doesn't. And of course many more features are on the way."/>

			<outline text="This is totally spooky."/>
			<outline text="In the last few hours I've gotten three unsolicited reviews of Jean-Louis Gassee's BeBox personal computer."/>
			<outline text="I was in the loop for the early part of the development process of this computer, but I must admit that I lost patience for the product. As I watched Macintosh and then Windows advance, and then watched Be suffer major setbacks including the departure of the lead designer and a switch in processors from AT&amp;T's Hobbit chip to the PowerPC chip, I gave them little chance of success."/>
			<outline text="I admired my friend Jean-Louis Gassee for sticking with it, even if I thought of his staying there as going down with the ship."/>
			<outline text="So, it surprised me to get the following unsolicited messages:"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***From Fred Davis, fred@weblust.com:"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Can you help me get a BeBox for eval?&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***From Marc Andreessen, marca@netscape.com"/>
			<outline text="&quot;Did you see the BeBox demo at Agenda? If not, flag down Jean-Louis Gassee as quickly as you can and get a demo... it's great!&quot;"/>
			<outline text="***From Dylan Northrup, northrup@pobox.com:"/>
			<outline text="You don't know me, but I'm an avid reader of your columns and enjoy your straightforward manner and forthrightness. OK, enough kissing up, on to my question."/>
			<outline text="Have you seen the info on the BeBox? Or better yet, have you actually seen a BeBox? I've visited their web page, www.be.com, and must say that I'm at least impressed with the hype they've put up there. This machine looks like the blessed child of Macintosh and Amiga built on the carcass of PCs. Not having $1600 to spend on a basic system (when they actually *do* ship) I must say that I'll be waiting to see what other's initial reactions to the release of the machine is. It looks like it has promise, but who's to say."/>
			<outline text="Now if only they include a decent port of solitaire... ;-)"/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="These comments were totally unsolicited. I have *not* written about Be Labs or the BeBox. It's really amazing. Congratulations Jean-Louis. Sounds like you got a hot one!"/>

			<outline text="It's funny -- when I was at the Windows 95 rollout in August, almost every Microsoft person I ran into asked how much time I spend writing DaveNet pieces. I wondered why they were asking (I didn't ask). I assumed they were trying to figure out if I was spending much time writing software."/>
			<outline text="I *was* writing software, but not with the intensity of the current effort. There's a huge difference between the lifestyle programming I was doing for the first eight months of 1995 and the end-game mode I'm in now. It's fun, I'm accomplishing a lot. But there's less time to write essays."/>
			<outline text="Programming is still mostly a mysterious art because so few programmers write about their experiences. I hope when I pop up for air on this project I'll remember some of the lessons that I've been relearning. This is my tenth commercial release. There's a lot I can explain about the process of shipping software. In many ways it's the most ambitious I've ever attempted. That's OK, that's always the way it works. "/>
			<outline text="This afternoon I'm visiting Jean-Louis Gassee, jlg@be.com, to see what all the BeBox talk is about. It might make a fitting report for the one year anniversary of DaveNet, which is tomorrow! Flowers, virtual or otherwise, would be very welcome."/>
			<outline text="And let me be the first -- Happy Birthday DaveNet! "/>
			<outline text="It's been a great year, let's hope the next year is also a great one. "/>
			<outline text="Without any fear!"/>
			<outline text="Dave"/>
			<outline text="PS: I've been listening to The John Lennon Collection CD -- it's totally great music. There are a lot of Lennon songs I had never heard. It's as good as any Beatles collection. Lennon had a very open loving heart, and he didn't mind sharing his life experiences. These songs are mosly tear-jerkers, made even more moving because of his tragic death."/>
			<outline text="PPS: One of the few inside treatments of the development process is Writing Solid Code by Steve Maguire, published by Microsoft Press. It's an insider's book, written by programmers for programmers. But it's extremely well-written and could be interesting to DaveNet readers."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;Welcome Back Jean-Louis&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;10/7/95; 9:44:12 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="And welcome to the second year of DaveNet. Thank you all for making DaveNet so much fun for me. It has my name on it, but the birthday celebration is for all of us. Thank you so much for your support and indulgence. As long as there are stories to tell, I'll keep telling them. Keep me in your loop. We'll have fun. Year Two will be soooo great! "/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="***Welcome Back Jean-Louis Gassee"/>
			<outline text="It's fitting that Year One began with a story of a friend, Marc Canter, who was doing something heroic. And it's equally fitting that Year Two begins with another friend having fun and winning. "/>
			<outline text="So, my first Jean-Louis Gassee story..."/>
			<outline text="At a Living Videotext party in 1985 at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, Guy Kawasaki, Apple's chief evangelist, handed me a piece of paper, a handwritten list of feature requests and bugfixes for our then-current Macintosh outliner, ThinkTank 512. "/>
			<outline text="I recognized the requests. Every software product has a list of common features and fixes that every user wants. As the product gets old the mantras get old. Yes I know what you want! Coming soooon now. So I can tell when someone is really using the product. There's no way to snow the lead developer of a product you claim to be using."/>
			<outline text="The note was from Jean-Louis Gassee, the new Apple executive that John Sculley had imported from Apple France. I handed the note back to Kawasaki. I told him that I wanted to meet Mr. Gassee. An executive that actually uses software. What a concept! I had to find out what one looks like."/>
			<outline text="That's what makes Jean-Louis unique. He ain't no Dog Watching TV. When he barks, it's because there's something to bark about. He gets it. He knows his ass depends on engineers to make it all work. So he develops a trusting relationship with developers. He meets us more than half-way. He actually uses our stuff."/>
			<outline text="Go back to the Chinese household model of platform management. We like to cook great meals for husbands that enjoy great cooking. Look at the software companies that work. Look at the top. Every one of them has a Chinese husband who loves to eat. Some like spicy food. Others like American cuisine. "/>
			<outline text="JLG is a master of presence. It comes naturally to him. He's a short man, but you'd never know that when you see his face on those huge screens at MacWorld Expo keynotes. Big man. He walks comfortably around the stage. Tells a joke. Raises an eyebrow. Shrugs his shoulders. There's more meaning in what he doesn't say. Smiles. He's humming. He plays with our heads. We admire his confidence. It accrues to the platform. We're having fun here. We'll have even more fun when we make software that Jean-Louis can gloat over. "/>
			<outline text="If you get a chance to go to Gassee's first developers conference, go for it. It'll be great theater and great software. Without a doubt."/>
			<outline text="He attracts great developers and he makes them greater by inviting them to compete for his approval. It's a good system, it produces fun software. It can make a platform grow. We all appreciate that."/>
			<outline text="He got a standing ovation from the Agenda crowd. I wasn't there, but I know what they were standing up about. Yes, the Be Machine is wonderful, but they were cheering the man, and his joy! Welcome Back Jean-Louis. We were missing you. "/>
			<outline text="His space was never filled. "/>
			<outline text="***Features"/>
			<outline text="Fully threaded multi-tasking object-oriented operating system designed by a team led by Erich Ringewald, the original MultiFinder guy. Clean API, lots of room for connections between apps. Database integrated into the system. Development software by MetroWerks. Net-based software distribution. "/>
			<outline text="They are licensing the operating system for $50 per cpu. IBM, Apple, Gateway, Radius, PowerComputing, and Daystar should check this out."/>
			<outline text="Supports up to eight CPUs (a revolutionary idea!), comes with two PowerPC 603s. Lots of ports. Industry standard connections for disk, keyboard, mouse, etc. "/>
			<outline text="Details at http://www.be.com/TechInfo/BeBoxTechSummary.html."/>
			<outline text="In the age of multimedia, when people are media objects, Gassee will be a great persona. I'd like to get the Canter animators working on the essential Gassee movie clip. I even know what his basic gesture would be. "/>
			<outline text="Extend your right arm. Pull your pinky to your palm. Same with the fourth finger and your thumb. Extend your index and middle fingers and pull them together. Move your arm so that these two fingers are directly under your nose. Sniff shortly three times."/>
			<outline text="Smells good!"/>
			<outline text="***The value of space"/>
			<outline text="OK -- I didn't think this was going to work. I copped to that in the last DaveNet piece. I was sure that the underlying technology would be excellent. But I thought that Windows and Mac had so much momentum, that there wouldn't be any interest in the developer world for a new API, no matter how good it was."/>
			<outline text="It's fantastic to be so wrong. "/>
			<outline text="All that space! No word processor or spreadsheet. Of course it doesn't run the Mac OS! Thank god. Let's do a new word processor. It wouldn't have to inherit the limits of old word processors. Let's do a different application integration strategy. No OpenDoc, no OLE to mess with. Clean connections between apps. The same approach taken by the operating system, let's start over, do something new, could be applied to every kind of software we've ever done. "/>
			<outline text="New platforms create opportunities for new kinds of software. Ask Mitch Kapor, John Warnock or Paul Brainerd. "/>
			<outline text="I learned that with outlining software on the Macintosh. I also learned that old platforms don't accept new software ideas easily. I've had *lots* of experience with that one."/>
			<outline text="Gassee's pitch is working, I think, because, thanks to the Internet, the software world is reinventing itself now. Sun's Scott McNealy calls current operating systems &quot;hairballs.&quot; An interesting metaphor. Jean-Louis and company are making a new thing, a beautiful little baby of a platform. No hairballs!"/>
			<outline text="When you're starting over, everything is possible. That's why babies are so beautiful. Their perfection is totally visible. And their potential is unlimited."/>
			<outline text="On my visit to Be yesterday, I sensed a calm realistic excitement. In the past they were arrogant and that limited their power. All the arrogance is gone. They're happy but not ecstatic. They're emerging from a very rough trip. There are wounds, but they're healing. "/>
			<outline text="Benoit Schilling, one of the development leads at Be, told me that it was great for him to hear that people are excited about his platform. From his perspective, he can only focus on the flaws. That's his job. But it all hangs together. It's a platform. They'll fix the bugs. And we'll fill the holes. "/>
			<outline text="My message to other software developers -- a new platform would be fun. Jean-Louis would be a good man to run it for us. Lay your doubts to the side, go into a small trance, and just BELIEVE that it's going to work. The negative, limiting, distortion field was wrong. New platforms *are* possible. Thank you Jean-Louis and the BeTeam for showing us this."/>
			<outline text="Jean-Louis is starting over. We can too. The Be platform will work for new entrepreneurial development because it's solid technology that's being sold by a man who knows how to sell the stuff. People are buying new hardware now. A new kind of software economy will develop here. The world is ready for a platform with a net-based distribution system and clean new APIs. "/>
			<outline text="It will work."/>

			<outline text="Yeah man here's another DaveNet. Wowowowowow. Yeah. Coooooool. I'm happy. Hope you are too. I've been up to stuff. But I don't kiss and tell. At least I don't tell all. Hmmmm. Zooom."/>

			<outline text="Assuming I can remember. ;-&gt;"/>
			<outline text="***A new product!"/>
			<outline text="As previously advertised -- I've been making love -- with my compiler. That's done. Now I'm making love with my new product. It's a website builder. So I'm building websites! Of course."/>
			<outline text="I think this is a new category. Website building. Desktop Websites! "/>
			<outline text="Got a Mac? Want to do a website? "/>
			<outline text="It's at http://www.hotwired.com/userland/yabbadabba/ "/>
			<outline text="It's called Clay Basket 1.0b5."/>
			<outline text="Go get it!"/>
			<outline text="Cooool."/>
			<outline text="***What's free software about?"/>
			<outline text="I've learned a lot about free software in 1995. I spent the first few months pondering it. In May I flipped the switch and Frontier went from being a commercial product that wasn't working as a commercial product to a free product that's still troubled. We've invaded some markets, notably CGI scripting on the Mac. In other areas AppleScript still dominates. I find this frustrating of course, but I try to learn from the experience."/>
			<outline text="I also try to follow the stock market, and although I didn't buy or sell any high tech stock this year, I think I figured something out that a lot of other people may be figuring out too -- the market doesn't value distribution strength. It doesn't place a high value on the number of units you'll sell in the future, especially if your margins are staying the same or shrinking. The normal boring details of running a business don't interest the stock market. This is very contrary to my education! They always taught us that the purpose of business is to make profits. But we have to let go of that idea."/>
			<outline text="The value in a business these days is ownership of standards. To what extent does the company influence its own destiny? A company that's adrift in a market controlled by other companies has relatively low value. A company with lots of influence on standards even with few products and little revenue gets (and deserves!) a stellar valuation."/>
			<outline text="How many developers do you lead? Developers are C programmers of all kinds, script writers, animators and musicians, writers and editors. They all have computer screens in front of their faces; they have hard disks and they move stuff around on the net. And they need software. "/>
			<outline text="Thanks to the boom of networking, once again, there's a vacuum of tools. Yes! If you can provide a new tool, hopefully with new uncontested power, and if you can get people to use it, and thereby gain the aura of &quot;standard&quot; -- then your PE ratio will soar, and you'll get huge dollars to fund your future development efforts."/>
			<outline text="So, the free software strategy is actually just a tactic. What better way to establish a standard? You can use my software but you don't owe me any money. Then another phenomenon kicks in. People wonder what your intentions are. How could there ever be an upgrade if I'm not paying for it? They overlook the fact that somehow the software got developed to this stage without them paying any money. Why shouldn't it go to the next level? They have trouble believing. I know, just look at my inbox. [Well I can, you can't.]"/>
			<outline text="The issue isn't whether or not people pay for the software, the issue is will they build on it. When you see a web page that says Netscape 1.1-enhanced, you're looking at the value of Netscape's stock. If they can get people to say their pages are Netscape 2.0-enhanced, they continue to win. As soon as the developer community breaks with this, their stock could crash. We'll see how quickly Wall Street figures this out, or if investors have to learn the lesson the hard way."/>
			<outline text="That's how I'm navigating this landscape. I think I can make a contribution. As a developer I've always wanted to play an important role in the setting of standards. That's part of what being a developer means to me. I have actually authored some standards (one of them is supported in Netscape 2.0!) -- but I want to do more. So why should I let a little bit of money stand in the way? No way."/>
			<outline text="There's a role for high-risk developers, people who are willing to invest their time in exploring new standards. If they're right, they get a choice -- go public and sell their stock, as Netscape did, or partner with an already-public stock and lift their PE ratio. Either way the goal is the same -- to accumulate the financial resources to completely explore the standard you're playing with. "/>
			<outline text="I remember what it was like running a commercial software house in the mid-80s. When we'd ship a product we'd plow back every dollar into marketing the product -- up to a point, usually about six months into the cycle, when we'd try to go profitable. We'd put people in the air, on the road, on the phone, ads in the weeklies and monthlies. All this costs lots of money. The first six months of sales finances the effort. After six months, either you have a winner or you move in another direction. But rarely does this approach yield a standard. Especially so in the future."/>
			<outline text="The physical distribution infrastructure is already valueless, the stock market has adjusted for that. Computers need physical distribution, yes, but software does not. The system that makes software boxes show up on retail shelves is technologically obsolete. Companies that own standards will continue to give their software away and distribute it thru the net. Software companies that make boxes will find it harder to respond. "/>
			<outline text="I know this is an extreme position, and I can certainly see future uses for the boxes-on-shelves system, but I don't expect it to drive the process, and eventually I think it will go away. There just isn't enough value in shelves and boxes."/>
			<outline text="***Geeks rule the world"/>
			<outline text="I used to have a slogan at UserLand Software (another programming motto!) that went like this -- Script Writers Rule the World. This expressed my belief that users who were willing to learn to program would be very powerful people. "/>
			<outline text="It turned out that way. The web, that wonderful, enabling, PE-ratio boosting thing, is totally run by geeks who write scripts. "/>
			<outline text="But the Macintosh press and Apple, for the most part, don't get it."/>
			<outline text="The Mac platform enjoys a tremendous advantage in scripting tools. If Unix users only knew what we can do on the Mac! I know -- I grew up on Unix. The value in scripting is in the depth of the development tools and the throughput of the machine. The Mac has so much that Unix geeks would totally adore -- what a shame that they don't know. "/>
			<outline text="MacWEEK could help, but they don't get it. They systematically exclude user-programming news and issues from their magazine. I was struck by their front-page coverage of Netscape 2.0 in last week's issue. No mention of the Mac-only scripting enhancements in 2.0. These issues are tremendously important for web content development, much of which happens on Macs, but they're missing it over there at MacWEEK. "/>
			<outline text="This slant was also evident in their breathless review of PageMill, and very disrespectful slam of the deep and powerful BBEdit product that many content developers use."/>
			<outline text="They do get this much -- the web is a big thing. What they don't get is how thoroughly the geeks run this world. The platform that they cover is a leader in this area. But they refuse to acknowledge this. Their loss. And ours too, of course."/>
			<outline text="***Thanks for Bob"/>
			<outline text="Remember the hot debate back in March (see &quot;Taking Candy Seriously&quot;) about Microsoft Bob, and it being a good thing or a bad thing? I went contrary to public opinion and said that Bob is a good thing. As I'm popping out of intense development mode now, I realized, as I was making the decisions on how this software would come together, that Bob is a great thing, because it says that there are two types of software -- stuff that's trivial to learn but not very deep, and stuff that's non-trivial to learn but deep and powerful, perhaps even somewhat mysterious."/>
			<outline text="I'm glad someone else is making Bob-like software, because that means I don't have to!"/>
			<outline text="I prefer to make the other kind of software. Always have, always will. Certainly I do end-user stuff. Check out the yabbadabba site. But I always try to include depth and mystery in my software. And now that Bob is out there, I can say that I don't have to bend over backwards to accomodate the disinterested user. Use Bob if you like. I can make software for the intensely interested and intelligent user, and leave the other kind of software for other people to make."/>
			<outline text="I've had this argument with Apple over the last seven years. They wanted the Bob of scripting languages. I said that was silly. I was wrong. Over the weekend I got involved in an intense discussion on the Macintosh Scripting list. I asked why people were still using AppleScript now that Frontier is free. I learned a lot from this discussion, about other people and about my own goals and intentions."/>
			<outline text="We need more docs, I definitely got that message. We can meet the serious AppleScript geeks half-way. But I think some people get comfort from AppleScript that I can't give them. I believe programming in English is a lie. It isn't anything like English. This is English. AppleScript is programming. I think programs should look like programs. But maybe not for everyone."/>
			<outline text="I don't want to have this argument anymore. I want to move forward, and in doing so, will leave some people behind. That's OK. I strongly believe that if you really develop content on a Macintosh that Frontier is the only scripting framework that works. Our website building software works with both AppleScript and Frontier. Without tilting the table in favor of either scripting environment, I believe the mass of people using our website builder will use Frontier as the scripting software that backs it up."/>
			<outline text="Why? Because something other than perceived ease-of-learning matters. "/>
			<outline text="To me, and I think to other serious script writers, what matters first is -- Can I Do It? If you can do what you need to do in one world, but can't in the other one, which one do you use? Not much of a question! The second question, which is related, is How Does It Perform? If it's slow as a dog, it's a science experiment, not software. If you can't deploy it, it's just a proof of concept, not a tool."/>
			<outline text="Ease of learning counts only for people who are meek about making an investment. Geeks are not meek! Once you've learned how to do something, ease of learning is a non-issue. I'm already doing it. It's very easy to learn since I've already learned it."/>
			<outline text="So -- some people will use AppleScript and some people will use Frontier. Cooool. We'll continue to make it easy for people to run AppleScript inside Frontier, and hope that more AppleScript users will accept the invitation to learn the Frontier environment. We'll do more docs, even printed ones, that serve as great reference material and have tutorials with screen shots. But the cost to play in this playground is your own time and committment. If you're willing to invest alongside us, we can play together. If you won't invest, we can't play."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: This is the first time I've made the release of a piece of software coincide with the release of a DaveNet piece. That's why the gap in DaveNets. Software is harder than essays. You can't hurry love, the Supremes used to sing. Me too!"/>
			<outline text="PPS: My deal with Marc Canter is off for now. It's just me and another programmer doing Clay Basket. Last I heard, Canter &amp; Company are doing a super rollout of the Meet Media Band CD at the MacroMedia Developer's Conference in San Francisco at the end of the month. Tune into www.mediaband.com for info on Canter Technology's coooool stuff."/>

			<outline text="I just ran an old script, written a few years ago, in the native version of Frontier. I was shocked. Laughed out loud. Did it again! Expletive deleted! Zip zip zip. It's so damnnnnnnnnn fast!"/>
			<outline text="Yesterday I got a build of the native version of Frontier that had the last known deal-stopper bug out of it. So in the spirit of rock and roll, I decided to let the Macintosh scripting community have it. "/>

			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="This &quot;DaveNet&quot; piece can be sung to the tune of Bruce Hornsby's Walk in the Sun, from his Hot House CD. A mesmerizing jazzy beat and a chorus you can sing along with. A sad song. Someone come, come my someone, take the clouds from my eyes, my one. But it's hopeful too. One day we'll walk in the sun. Yes."/>
			<outline text="Hello!"/>
			<outline text="I'm back from Boston. The weekend was totalllly glorious. Warm, as warm as California. Sunny, but everything's wet. It rains in Boston, especially this time of year. I had a blast with my Boston friends. Went to &quot;Cybersmith&quot;, where Sally Atkins and I sent email to each other's ex-es. It must be nice to be thought of from so far away. "/>
			<outline text="Sally and I got wild, and we seduced all kinds of people at the bar downstairs. From there, on to the House of Blues and I danced and danced and danced. I never danced like this! Rolling and weaving. Humming and flowing. The usual dancing thing! It's Dave with his Texas sized body, moving and floating."/>
			<outline text="Yah man. We had fun!"/>
			<outline text="That night, buzzed and very loudly, I really appreciated Boston for the first time. I checked into my room with a view of the harbor. What a trip! "/>
			<outline text="And it had only just begun..."/>
			<outline text="***What I learned"/>
			<outline text="I felt I had to go to InternetWorld in Boston. The timing was right. I had just gotten thru a six-week burst of programming productivity. My geek persona gratified, having cooked a meal I was happy with, it was time to look at the smorgasbord of software that the rest of the world is producing for the Internet. InternetWorld, the &quot;Meckler&quot; show, is the place where we do this."/>
			<outline text="It's the third InternetWorld show I've been to. Yes, it was a tiny show in June 1994. All those venture capitalists roaming the aisles! Now their investments are starting to ship. It's a maturing show. The booths are large. "/>
			<outline text="The software funded by the venture capitalists is being created for corporate presences on the web. Their audience is IS managers at major corporations, a market that the venture capitalists understand. To these people InternetWorld is just an adjunct to InfoWorld. Same with the Meckler books. They have WebWeek and Web Developer, which interestingly is run by a high school friend of mine from the Bronx. He lives in California now of course."/>
			<outline text="InternetWorld is growing quickly but in other ways this community is in its infancy. The party scene is very new. I'm just getting to know the faces of the webmasters of the big sites out there on the net. I finally met Glenn Davis, the &quot;Cool Site of the Day&quot; man. He was surprised that my hair is brown, from the picture in &quot;Wired&quot; he thought I had red hair. Not true. Hair was a big topic for me. Someone asks how I'm doing. Great hair! I say. He hears Gray hair. Not true. I have brown hair."/>
			<outline text="I met some of my favorite webmasters at this show. We're all singing the same song. Some day we'll walk in the sun. The halceon days are yet to come. All right! Rock and roll on the web? Of course! But it ain't going to happen at those fear-driven corporate websites. "/>
			<outline text="I finally got to meet Barton, the author of the &quot;Love 101&quot; website. What a cutie! She works at &quot;AOL&quot; now. I think a lot of these young people with soaring imaginations are just waiting for the Big Wheel to spin to their number. Waiting patiently for this new industry to organize itself around its talent, as opposed to being organized around the head-trippy aspirations of technological and financial types. "/>
			<outline text="The advertising industry meets the web. Can you say Fortune 500? The VCs can! And they do. Often. The tools they make aren't necessarily for geeks. Cooool. More for the rest of us. Why yes I speak geek, but I've already said that. Platforms for web content development is the real game. The value of your investment is proportional to the number of geeks you successfully seduce. Let's have fun! Yeah. Smells good! Uh huh."/>
			<outline text="Advertising on the web is cool. But there's a fly in the ointment. It's a pain in the butt to erase the ads from commercial TV, but people are figuring out how to get the info from &quot;Yahoo&quot;, &quot;Infoseek&quot;, &quot;Lycos&quot; and &quot;WebCrawler&quot; without seeing the ads. I find this fascinating. I wonder what the VCs have planned when ad scraper agents start showing up? How will they pay for those web crawlers then? Hmmmm. I checked with the sysop of AOL's WebCrawler. They're aware of the problem."/>
			<outline text="&quot;Java&quot; is everywhere. At the DaveNet party on Monday night, at one table I was weaving a story around Java. Someone says let's check with the product manager. She's at the next table. Life is happening that way these days. Looking for something? Check out the next table. What you're looking for is just that close."/>
			<outline text="&quot;AOL&quot; announces &quot;GNN&quot;, their answer to Netcom. Now they're members of the &quot;Billions of Websites&quot; club. So is &quot;CompuServe&quot;. Which one is an open system? It's not clear at this time if either one actually is. Both companies do their own content development software. Can I use my own content development tools? They're not sure if they understand the question. They will, I'm sure of it. Check out the GNN booth at the next show. [If anyone figures out how to use &quot;Clay Basket&quot; to generate AOL or CompuServe websites, please let me know. That would be an acid test.]"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, the &quot;Apple&quot; booth was a prefab affair. Low budget and low flash. Shhhh. Don't let anyone know that there's heat on this platform! Can't afford to say it, I hear from my friends at Apple. It costs money to tell people that you're the coolest. Apple wants to hold onto its money. OK. "/>
			<outline text="The Macintosh web community didn't show up, as far as I could tell. Unix and Windows and NT were well represented. &quot;IBM&quot; struggles mightily to convince us that it &quot;gets&quot; the net, but their $3.5 billion buyout of &quot;Lotus&quot; speaks otherwise. "/>
			<outline text="And don't get me started about &quot;Larry Ellison&quot;! The totally precious Mr Opportunity speaks about media objects. It's a phallus-cy. Larry man, make some new software -- stop telling us how big it is. It isn't!"/>
			<outline text="***We &lt;a name=&quot;curtains&quot;&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; curtains"/>
			<outline text="The Larry Ellison thing is a perfect segue into the real meat of this story. I've said it before -- in pieces like &quot;Random Breathless Stuff&quot; and &quot;Billions of Websites&quot; -- there are two webs, the one that men like the VCs envision, and the one we will all live in, one that will be more like a home, that will connect people to people. A place where we will play! "/>
			<outline text="One of my favorite DaveNetisms is &quot;holding hands in cyberspace.&quot; We're almost there. The tools phase of this business, where the breakthrus are in ease of use and ease of access, is almost over. Starting real soon you'll be able to assume that anyone who can use a word processor and an outliner will be able to create a website and connect their pages to stuff on other people's sites."/>
			<outline text="When we cross that line, the web will fill with feminine energy. It's been proven, websites can make you laugh and can make you cry. We can speak the truth thru this medium. We can teach each other and learn from each other. We can make new friends. Our presences will roam the wires of the web like today's automated worms and web crawlers do. "/>
			<outline text="It's also been proven that if you want to have fun you need to have some women around. That's not a sexual thing, it's just the truth. Not enough men know how to let go. Guys, let the women mess up your hair. You'll see, it's fun! "/>
			<outline text="And women, please thank the male energy for making this place safe. Our new cave needs curtains and party favors. It's almost party time. "/>
			<outline text="Let's have fun!"/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: I found the watch! Thanks everyone for the positive energy."/>
			<outline text="PPS: An interesting fact: anyone whose last name is Atkins could spell it @kins. I suggested to my friend Sally that she could start kins.com, and corner the Atkins market. sally@kins.com. Nice business card!"/>
			<outline text="PPPS: What song do I sing as my machine reboots after a Netscape 2.0b1 crash? Netscrape Netscrape. Ohhh it's so funny! And I get to sing this song so often! Other people sing the same song. Or a variation. Nutscrape! A very male thing. Coooool."/>
			<outline text="PPPPS: On the wires this AM -- Dan Eilers is leaving Apple. Dan's a good guy. We, in the Mac community, need this like we need a hole in the head. Someday we'll walk in the sun. But not before Apple quiets down and lets the content community drive the platform. Now the business press will have more stories about how the Mac platform is dead. Remember the mantra -- repeat after me -- market share is a head trip, market share is a head trip, market share is a head trip, market share is a head trip, market share is a head trip, market share is a head trip. Market share is a head trip. Uh huh."/>

			<outline text="#title &quot;I Become Invisible&quot;"/>
			<outline text="#postTime &quot;11/6/95; 2:32:30 PM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Gooooood morning!"/>
			<outline text="I began last week intensely visible. Dancing in Boston. The first DaveNet party. Hangin with the Coooool Site man. Schmoozing and humming. Floating and playing. Dealing and being dealt. "/>
			<outline text="But I knew things were changing when I hopped on a non-stop United flight from Boston to SFO on Halloween night. A middle seat! My big body just barely fits. To my left, a hefty woman. To my right a young father with a very young boy in his lap. Take a deep breath and I invade another person's space. Who invented this system? How can such a grand person as myself can get so little space? I couldn't breathe. You wouldn't have been able to either."/>
			<outline text="Go with the flow, I said to myself. Breathe as best as you can. On the other end of this flight is my car, my music, eventually my house, my email and voicemail, my hottub and finally my bed. It'll be coool."/>
			<outline text="But after the six-hour flight, locked in a single position, a very unusual and awkward one, my body wouldn't straighten out. My energy flow was disrupted. "/>
			<outline text="I learned later that the problem was actually much worse. "/>
			<outline text="I had become invisible!"/>
			<outline text="It's the spookiest thing. Standing at Il Fornaio on Friday morning, waiting to be seated. People come in, stand next to me, the maitre'd seats them. She even smiles at me. I smile back. Coool. I stand there and stand there. I'm OK, not in any hurry actually. "/>
			<outline text="Eventually I spoke up and asked to be seated. Later, the waitress explains the specials, my eating partner orders, then as I'm speaking my order she turns and leaves. I'm stuck mid-sentence. I was going to ask for some bread! Ohhhhh. OK. It's really OK."/>
			<outline text="I get home, return some phone calls, leave a couple of voicemails. I don't really expect the voicemail system to actually record anything, because I'm beginning to get the picture, no one can see me, why should they be able to hear me?"/>
			<outline text="I've become almost totally invisible. "/>
			<outline text="It got worse. "/>
			<outline text="On Saturday morning I hear from friends about three great parties in San Francisco on Friday night. Was I invited to any of them? No. "/>
			<outline text="Of course!"/>
			<outline text="Makes sense."/>
			<outline text="***Good and bad"/>
			<outline text="From Tootsie -- Jessica Lange speaking: &quot;Just when I think I've found the perfect man, an even worse one shows up, and that's when I make my move.&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Good and bad, better and worse are all illusions too. If I'm invisible that's the best possible thing because that's what is. Jessica is looking for perfection -- but she perceives it as being bad. It's the truth and totally funny. That's just how people are. "/>
			<outline text="***Hello?"/>
			<outline text="Let's see how invisible I am."/>
			<outline text="You may not be able to see me, or hear me, but at least I can make some ones and zeros show on your hard disk. An experiment in existence. A proof (possibly) that I am not an illusion. That somehow this spacesuit called Dave actually is perceivable to other moving bits of space that we call people. "/>
			<outline text="Hello? Anyone out there? This is Dave. I'm OK. How are you?"/>
			<outline text="If you can read this then I exist. "/>
			<outline text="Maybe."/>
			<outline text="How do you perceive me? How well do you think you know me? Well I have news for you -- I *am* actually just a stream of ones and zeros that show up on your hard disk. Like my Scottish penpal, I may appear to be his mother, or even worse, *your* mother, or possibly much worse -- your father!"/>
			<outline text="Email is a wonderful medium because people can so easily project their own lives onto other people's lives. You know so little about me. I try to tell you what I can. But it's a very small slice of who I am. So people fill in the blanks, pretend I'm just like them, or someone in their family. Sometimes, when people really need to get something off their chest, and the people they'd like to be close with aren't available, I'll do just fine."/>
			<outline text="They begin &quot;I don't really know what you mean, but I assume you mean this. And I used to know someone who was just like you and I'm very very mad at you now!&quot; "/>
			<outline text="Often these emails go on for pages and pages. But they start with a mistaken assumption. I am complex! No, I disagree with that statement. The rest of your email is based on the wrong premise. Hellllp. Someone isn't listening to this person, and he or she realllly needs to be heard. "/>
			<outline text="Except in rare times of overload, I read every email that comes to me. I only respond if I have something to say and feel there's a reasonable chance that my reply will be understood. Sometimes I have to be blunt -- please stop sending me mail. I also try to thank people whenever possible. And I think I really mean it. Thank you. Please!"/>
			<outline text="I only want good energy in my life. People ask me to help them be heard. Glad to help, when I can."/>
			<outline text="***The message"/>
			<outline text="There's a pragmatic lesson in this whole visibility story. As we communicate more and more thru email and the web, we can connect with more people, we can become more visible. Our ideas travel further and do it much more quickly. But along with this new power, our ability to listen can and hopefully will evolve too. "/>
			<outline text="We can all be more careful, and remember that at the other end of the email connection is a real human being who you may not know very well. Please take all email messages at face-value, and don't infer too much. When your inner voice says &quot;If that were me...&quot; respectfully ask it to stop doing that! "/>
			<outline text="We can all learn more from each other, if we're open to it."/>
			<outline text="Coooooool."/>

			<outline text="Goooood morning!"/>
			<outline text="Last week I wrote about how invisible I'd become. What does that lead to? What comes after invisibility? I got lots of responses. Still not sure. Checking it out. But one thing it definitely can lead to is a bad cold! I must have caught it in Boston. I was totally grounded last weekend. "/>
			<outline text="At 40, I'm surprised to find that a cold has a bigger effect than it used to. Or maybe I'm paying more attention. Both things are true. I prefer feeling healthy! That's true too... "/>
			<outline text="So I called up my inner mom and held the hand of my inner child and proved that it's going to be OK. Lots of Vitamin C and soup. Rented movies. Saw Pulp Fiction again. Coooool. Let's just quiet down and get healthy. "/>
			<outline text="Uh huh."/>
			<outline text="Boy did I crank out code! Lots of shit happened. Check out http://www.hotwired.com/userland/yabbadabba/newfeatures_383.html."/>
			<outline text="Yeah. It's interesting that my body slows down but my head and my spirit don't! I'm totally excited by the stuff we're doing. And it's moving really fast. "/>
			<outline text="Here's a flash I had the other day -- I think I've got the most powerful computer on the planet. If they could only watch me use my tools. I can make big things happen. And it's just me! Yes it is. I swear."/>
			<outline text="My local network is more powerful. I have three computers with their own IP addresses, and room for nine more. The information superhighway runs thru my house! I can pick it up, look at it, show it to my friends. &quot;Look -- this is the Internet!&quot; Hmmm. I always thought the Internet was the ultimate in vapor. I'm fascinated when I see something you can touch and see. A wire. This is the Internet. Coooool. This is a server. It looks so small. I grew up in the days when big computer presences were actually physically big. Not no more!"/>
			<outline text="Looking at this coax cable running across my workbench, it's pleasant to think of all those little ones and zeros floating and humming along the wire. Put together they form a personna called Dave. Everything you know about me comes over those little coax cables. And they're just wires! Yea."/>
			<outline text="The net is so damned fast. Now I'm debugging at the TCP level. Maybe it's so amazingly fast because for the first time I have a real sense of how it works. Are phones fast? Yes, of course -- but I don't think of them that way because I have no idea how they actually work. But a Ping call across the Internet happens in a fraction of a second. I could be talking to a computer in Sausilito or Florida or Virginia or Austin. It happens in an instant. There's so much talking going on. And it's so simple. It's very low-tech stuff, but it works! Keep OpenDoc and OLE -- I'll go for a no-brainer any day. Thank you."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, the net is so damned fragile. I'm trying, finally, to totally automate my production system -- so I point at a folder on my desktop and run a script from the Finder's menu bar. I have totally smart scripts. But the whole system gets dumb when the result is FTPd across the net. It's fragile. It might not work. So the last step of the process remains manual. My flow of ones and zeros needs me to hold their hands while they travel from my desktop to a place where you can quickly download them."/>
			<outline text="Someday, hopefully sooon -- I'll just be able to point at something I want to share with everyone and the computer and the net can do the rest. It's almost there for me."/>
			<outline text="Pragmatically -- we need a friendly Internet Service Provider that's willing to work with us to debug the connection between desktop software and their server software. Everything has to be right -- high bandwidth connection, lots of managed disk space, and good people to keep it running and to work with us to get the glitches out. "/>
			<outline text="There's a position for quality in ISPs. Everyone's thinking coolness is the commodity, but they're wrong. A great on-the-backbone service-oriented service provider that emphasized throughput and reliability would clean up. Let guys like me create the glitz and glamor -- I want my server guys to be really square and professional and calm. And to get the job done."/>
			<outline text="I've written about this before. The Compaq of service providers. Please!"/>
			<outline text="If you build it they will come."/>
			<outline text="***Sysops"/>
			<outline text="Who are they? "/>
			<outline text="Sysops. System Operators. People who manage online communities. People who develop websites. The talent is developing. A lot of very young people. They need tools and they want a bigger ballpark."/>
			<outline text="We're talking about this on the claybasket-talk mailing list. We call it clay.webfarm.com. People develop and manage websites using my software. I come with a community of sysops. They need a stadium to play in. A show floor for their booths. Of course I have competitors, and their users will need this service too. We'll be compatible. FTP is a great platform. In other words, if a Compaq-style service provider provides the stadium, I want to supply some players. That's my dream. "/>
			<outline text="We can get it to work if we want it to."/>
			<outline text="The big financial entities in this business are missing a big opportunity. Apple has lots of cash. They're doing a dividend. Why not use cash to open up the most brilliant service provider? It's the kind of thing cash does best. Adobe could be a big winner here. AOL could attract a developer community if they wanted to. And Oracle, looking for a niche to own -- why not buy a bunch of SGIs or Suns or Nexts and set up the most massive network operations center in the world? And make it really work."/>
			<outline text="By the way, to make it really work, you have to answer the phone. Don't miss that. When we call and offer to work with you -- you have to say yes. If you don't say yes to all reasonable offers -- you aren't the winner."/>
			<outline text="***BeBox and Next"/>
			<outline text="When I wrote about Jean-Louis Gassee and his multi-CPU BeBox and its multi-tasking OS I got back a lot of mail comparing it to Next."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="I agree! I see Be as very comparable to Next and, guess what, that's why I think it will kick butt."/>
			<outline text="Huh?"/>
			<outline text="First, I think the Next platform worked. Too bad the platform vendor wasn't tuned in enough to realize it. The web was invented on the Next platform. The web is hot. Next still has a valued and respected position as a web server. Lots of Next boxes out their running websites -- check out http://www.webcrawler.com. And a bunch of sysops and webmasters who like their OS and their tools."/>
			<outline text="Anyway, I had lunch with Gassee yesterday, and I was very emphatic that he should configure his system as a web server and sell it to sysops and service providers. A new OS is an advantage here. No legacy code! It should be absolutely totally fast. Multiple PowerPC processors. New disk operating system. No installed base to support."/>
			<outline text="If Be went for it, and really got with the state of the art in web serving they could clean up."/>
			<outline text="Jean-Louis -- please think seriously about doing this."/>
			<outline text="Thanks!"/>
			<outline text="***The next OpenDoc?"/>
			<outline text="Is the loop closing on OpenDoc yet? I hear they shipped. "/>
			<outline text="Now the question is who wants it?"/>
			<outline text="When these proposed standards are launched, usually years before they're available, no one can say what they'll be good for. Eyes glaze over, everyone is impressed with the power. The nausea factor. A lot of money is spent, years pass, and eventually people start forgetting to ask about it. In the meantime lots of energy is spent worrying about what it means to this that or the other thing. "/>
			<outline text="Negative energy -- the proposed standard isn't a growth thing, it's a limiting thing. The Fear part of FUD. Dave Nagel is wrong -- there's no such thing as positive FUD. The irony escapes me. FUD is a negative thing, almost by definition."/>
			<outline text="So, Netscape is still where the action is. Are they the next Finder? Could be. In the meantime, HTML looks like the platform. It's still a crock, and it gets crockier. But it's the best crock we got. "/>
			<outline text="It's great to have a standard to feed on. It's how you have fun -- wrestling with a crock that has become a standard. Solving a piece of the puzzle and then executing. "/>
			<outline text="As Eric Schmidt of Sun said -- everyone he knows is working on HTML now. Me too."/>
			<outline text="So why bother with OpenDoc?"/>
			<outline text="And this raises the next question -- is Java the next OpenDoc? "/>
			<outline text="I'd like to run a short list of things Java is good for. Let's get this out in the open, early in the process. What are the top-10 compelling applications for Java? Why should we devote our energy to understanding it and developing tools for it? These are serious questions. Like a lot of developers I'm thinking about investing in Java. "/>
			<outline text="To Java's proponents -- what applications do you envision?"/>
			<outline text="***Steve and Apple"/>
			<outline text="Cathy Cloud, mcleanpr@applelink.apple.com, called last week to make sure I had seen a piece in the SF Chronicle by David Einstein, einstein@sfgate.com, about Steve Jobs possibly returning to take charge at a new Apple hypothetically owned by his friend Larry Ellison."/>
			<outline text="Cathy wondered what I thought of this. "/>
			<outline text="My answer: I don't like the idea. "/>
			<outline text="I can see why it appeals to Steve. He's always wanted the Mac to be the information appliance, the computer for the rest of us, a limited closed machine with very little power. A toaster of a PC. That's exactly what Larry Ellison is talking about. There's no doubt that this idea came from Steve. What goes around comes around. Steve still wants to hit the home run, to top the Apple II, or what he thought the Apple II was. "/>
			<outline text="Would Steve coming back make Apple stock more valuble? Probably. Maybe by a lot. There would be a Steve euphoria. He's an electrifying speaker. On stage, he can make you believe. I'm sure he can still do it. If he were chairman of an $11 billion company, people would pay attention. Steve would know what to do with the attention."/>
			<outline text="Steve Jobs is growing older, so maybe he's wiser too. But I've always found that there isn't a lot of room around Steve. So if it's either-or -- if everyone will look to Steve for brilliant product ideas, I think that's bad for the Macintosh platform, because they probably won't look elsewhere, which is where the powerful ideas are being implemented. "/>
			<outline text="Steve doesn't actually write code. He doesn't speak geek."/>
			<outline text="The ideas the Mac platform needs to win are already out there. The Macintosh net community is thriving. Steve doesn't understand the net community on his own much smaller platform, and he's had lots of time to get it. So I think Steve would be bad news for the Mac platform. It would distract our attention, again, from what's really going on and where the opportunities for growth are."/>
			<outline text="To make its stock more valuble, Apple should tap into the growth of the net. Maybe Apple needs a visible symbolic break with its past, but bringing back Steve Jobs is the wrong way to do that."/>
			<outline text="If Apple continues to dance the Microsoft dance they'll continue to have an undervalued stock, and Macintosh users will continue to feel like they're on shaky ground. "/>
			<outline text="Whoever runs Apple, they should pay attention to the needs of content developers, the tools they use, spotting opportunities for improvement in those tools, and recognizing the breakthroughs when they happen. It's a simple quiet job -- make the trains run on time. Keep the flower bed fertile and wet. Make machines, distribute them. And keep the noise level down so developers can make their own noise."/>
			<outline text="And please Apple, take better care of the operating system, which is your exclusive domain and protected from competition. Make the file system faster. Add a Windows menu to the Finder.  Simple little things that show you're tuned into the needs of your users and developers."/>
			<outline text="Dave Winer"/>
			<outline text="PS: A great website, showing how software docs on the web can really work --  http://web66.coled.umn.edu. "/>
			<outline text="PPS: I think sysops are a lot like gardeners."/>
			<outline text="PPPS: Once again, FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt."/>

			<outline text="***A New Infrastructure"/>
			<outline text="I wrote about Guy Kawasaki's return to Apple in &quot;Evangelism as God Intended&quot;, 7/29/95.  I was interviewed for a Business Week piece on Apple just before I left on my trip. They asked if Kawasaki coming back to Apple meant that Apple &quot;gets it&quot;."/>
			<outline text="I said no."/>
			<outline text="Evangelism should be a positive force, but lots of Guy's energy is negative. Instead of stressing the great stuff that's happening on the Macintosh platform, he's showing us the holes in Microsoft's strategies. I guess he's trying to drive the competition crazy. I also guess it isn't working."/>
			<outline text="Why all this emphasis on pain? Apple is hurting, and instead of feeling the pain and learning from it, then letting go, the healthy approach to grieving, they're trying to give the pain to someone else. They've chosen Microsoft. In fact I think Microsoft's strategic problems are very similar to Apple's. They already share the pain, without any help from Apple."/>
			<outline text="Apple, as usual, got there first. Mired in employee departures, and no high-growth direction for their technology, they're struggling to find ways to gather developer energy behind them given that the Internet has already happened, and proven them to be more or less clueless."/>
			<outline text="The real race between Microsoft and Apple is how quickly they can retool to be developers and marketers of Internet servers and clients and authoring systems. Yes, ease of use matters a lot, so Apple has something to offer. (But the Macintosh isn't really that easy to use.) And the Macintosh is the platform of choice for content developers. So there's a base to build on. "/>
			<outline text="But Apple is playing too fair, is still heavily invested in wrong ideas, and incorrectly perceiving the faceoff and not reorganizing their business quickly enough to be effective."/>
			<outline text="The shareholders of both companies, especially Apple, could be participating in the Internet boom (Netscape opened today at 140) but both companies missed the play. Microsoft is actually in worse shape than Apple, for ironic reasons, because to get into this loop, the company has to be acquired. Details follow. Apple is much more acquirable than Microsoft because Bill Gates won't give up control of Microsoft as easily as Mike Spindler and Mike Markkula will."/>
			<outline text="Check out &quot;Bill Gates vs The Internet&quot;, 10/18/94. I'm really proud of that piece. Bill Gates looks more and more like the old generation's Ken Olson. Yes, the Internet will push sales of related technologies like Encarta and Flight Simulator. As if that were all that mattered. Windows is a Chinese Household too, now. All their developers left to do Internet software. Why? The usual reason -- they left for love."/>
			<outline text="A lot of the new software runs on Windows. But the developers are looking elsewhere for leadership on what standards to support. The Indigo Girls said it best, Bill and Guy, stop trying to pretend there's more than love that really matters. Love. That's all that matters. Read that again. It's all that matters. That's all."/>
			<outline text="Bill will take care of himself. Guy doesn't have to worry so much about delivering him. Ken Olson didn't need Bill Gates, specifically. The PC business didn't fight fair, ignoring the economies of the minicomputer business, just like the Internet development boom isn't paying any attention to the limits of the boxes-and-shelves system. The interesting stuff on the web doesn't go thru Merisel or advertise in PC Week. A new infrastructure is developing. "/>
			<outline text="***Pure PE-ratio"/>
			<outline text="Someday there will be a company that's 100 percent PE ratio, offering no products, making no profits, but delivering infinite growth to their shareholders. The Ice Nine of technology. So cooool that it just grabs all the value in the universe, instantly. Whew! What was that? The supersonic bullet-train of a stock. On its way to the stars."/>
			<outline text="Netscape is the next approximation of the pure-PE ratio company. I haven't looked at their balance sheet, and I don't need to. As a developer I see it much more clearly. They've soaked up lots of the available love in the high tech world. But there's lots more to give, and he or she who bathes in that love will be the next approximation. "/>
			<outline text="Here's what it will look like -- a love castle for developers. The ultimate playground, attracting the most talented and ambitious software and content developers. If you just shipped a hot net tool, we want you to be part of the club. Lots of parties and lots of goodies. New hardware and all the latest betas. The best net connections. We want to empower you, not limit you. No waiting. Go for it! We'll be there to pick up the pieces, write your docs and specs, man the tradeshow booth, talk to your users. Put the curtains on your cave. You have the fun, we do the work. "/>
			<outline text="Platform management is a make-the-trains-run type business. The art happens outside. That's the diseconomy of Apple and Microsoft. They've bet heavily on art happening inside. Wrong!"/>
			<outline text="Here's what you have to watch for -- the developers will own this platform company. That's where the infinite PE ratio comes from. They will have the support of developers because it's owned by the developers. It's safe for users and content developers and investors to buy into the platform because it's going to have developer support. Guaranteed. They can't screw it up, like most platforms do, because art will own the platform. "/>
			<outline text="Don't look to Netscape to be this platform. They're spreading too thin and too broadly and hiring from the general talent pool of Silicon Valley. Their alliance with Sun seems pretty fractured. And Sun doesn't get it, any more than Guy Kawasaki does. And the developers certainly don't own Netscape. And their stock is so strong on its own, so it's not likely to happen."/>
			<outline text="On the other hand, it seems that Apple could be profitably be bought out by its developers. Apple stock is hovering around 40 and not going anywhere. With an organized net strategy, built from software components that are already shipping, the stock could get a Netscape-like lift. Even half of a Netscape lift is something worth thinking about. Even one quarter of the lift."/>
			<outline text="Platforms are about making the trains run on time. Curtains on the cave. Today's platforms come with too much face. The first one to get out of the way and stop trying to force their view of the world on the world is going to have infinite PE ratio. "/>
			<outline text="A day I hope to see. "/>
			<outline text="Soooooon."/>

			<outline text="***Welcome to Japan"/>
			<outline text="Microsoft stock is falling and Netscape stock continues to soar. People who had trouble believing that Netscape was worth $60 per share must be realllly scratching their heads -- it's at $110 as of Friday's close! Man. What's going on here? Is this OK? "/>
			<outline text="Yes, it's OK. Is Netscape really worth $110 per share? Yes. Of course it is. And if it crashes on Monday to $30 it will really be worth $30 per share. Value is a reflection of how everyone perceives an opportunity. There are no absolutes. Like life, the stock market is a ouija board. The price of Netscape says as much about us and our hopes for the future as it says about a company called Netscape Communications Inc. "/>
			<outline text="Something happened here, a fundamental change, and I have a perspective to offer on this that I haven't heard elsewhere. This might be a scoop. A DaveNet exclusive! Your attention please... "/>
			<outline text="Remember back in the 80s when execs of public companies were complaining that the stock market only rewarded them for quarter-to-quarter results? That longterm value seemed to mean nothing to American investors? That the Japanese were going to kick our butts because their money didn't care so much about what you did last quarter -- it cared more about your strategies and longterm value. "/>

			<outline text="***Compelling Java Apps"/>
			<outline text="In my last &quot;Sysops&quot; piece I asked for compelling Java applications, and I got lots! Here are three... "/>
			<outline text="***Philippe Kahn, 0002272940@mcimail.com says: "/>
			<outline text="Java is way cool. Check out the press release on http://www.starfishsoftware.com. We are getting great response. Such as &quot;This is the most compelling application of Java that I've seen...&quot; "/>
			<outline text="***Bill St. Clair, bitCraft@taconic.net, says: "/>
			<outline text="I wouldn't call myself a Java proponent, but I do think it will be a useful tool. "/>
			<outline text="The first project I want to do with it is to write a &quot;shopping basket&quot; for my friend's mail-order cassette and CD business. He wants something like CD-NOW and the other big guys have, but I don't want to deal with Unix CGI scripts on his web provider (he's too small to afford his own server). Most web servers also charge extra for CGIs. It makes more sense to use the local machine to frob local data. Java itself isn't important here. "/>
			<outline text="What is important is a standard web scripting language that runs on all platforms and that people can get for free or nearly free. Java appears to be the most likely candidate. It also moves C in a nice direction. Away from munging bits and towards a dynamic garbage-collected uncrashable model. With Guy Steele working on it, it's likely that the language will grow in a good direction. It's interpreted now, but soon we'll have on-the-fly native compilers for the portable byte-code. "/>
			<outline text="***Gary Teter, bulldogbeach@halcyon.com says: "/>
			<outline text="You should probably add the question &quot;what is LiveScript good for?&quot; I'm thinking that LiveScript could surpass Java in popularity, simply because you don't need another development platform. There are a lot of great websites being built out there these days with nothing more than Photoshop and BBEdit Lite, and there are a lot of sysops that don't want or can't handle the &quot;serious&quot; software development process that Java requires. "/>
			<outline text="Here's my short list of things Java's probably going to be good for: animations; automatically playing sounds when a document is retrieved or a link activated (note that Microsoft has already added this to Internet Explorer as an HTML tag -- without Java); networked real-time games where the app is local and the only net traffic is broadcasting player position changes and the like; &quot;worlds chat&quot;-type stuff (3d avatars, etc.); tech support applications: realtime remote control (Timbuktu/Telnet-like) with local system querying so a support technician (or sufficiently powerful expert system, I suppose) can diagnose and fix problems with non-net-related software (how do I make a newsletter in Word 72.5?); interaction between browser software and non-net-related software, especially for tech support and interfacing remote databases with local documents (including local databases, accounting systems, production systems, etc.); local browser agents (clipping services, price-hunters, etc.); besides the usual obvious boring dumb stuff like checking input validity locally before forwarding it on to the remote server (a 17-digit zip code? sorry!). "/>
			<outline text="Most of these applications have to do with increasing local control and local functionality, and decreasing back-and-forth net traffic overhead. "/>
			<outline text="An interesting note: if you look at the reserved words in the current beta of LiveScript, you'll see that several of my proposed uses for Java could be duplicated with LiveScript in one form or another. LiveScript will probably be nearly as capable as Java over the long run, and I think we'll see some cool stuff from the fringes of the web written in LiveScript before we'll see it in Java. "/>
			<outline text="---"/>
			<outline text="***Happy Thanksgiving!"/>
			<outline text="Many thanks to Philippe, Bill and Gary for their Java thoughts... "/>
			<outline text="I'm out of here. Zip zip zip. Or should I say zzzzzip? Whew! "/>
			<outline text="I got the next release of Clay Basket uploaded to the net. Check out the Yabbadabba site and the claybasket-talk list for details. "/>
			<outline text="It's raining in California! Cooool. I'm going to break my head of steam, take a chance, and relax and play and have fun with my uncle and his kids in Jamaica. We'll be swimming in the Caribbean on Thanksgiving Day. I'll be back in early December, just in time for Christmas party season in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Yeah! Get out the Christmas lights! Sooooon it'll be party time. "/>
			<outline text="Thanksgiving is a huge holiday in the United States, appropriately so, because we have so much to be thankful for. Soon it will be time to focus on 1996, but for now let's appreciate all we have in 1995. Friends, family, health, happiness, fun. "/>
			<outline text="Thanksgiving is a time to let go, to forgive and start looking forward. You can thank anyone for anything. Anyone who reaches inside you deserves your thanks. Even perceived negative things like pain and anger are great teachers. They show us more about who we are. The better we know ourselves the more we know what we want, and the more fun we can have! "/>
			<outline text="So please try to thank everyone. Include everyone because by its nature Thanksgiving is a celebration of inclusion. Thanksgiving is also a celebration of healing and acceptance because thanking is forgiveness. "/>
			<outline text="Thanksgiving can also be a way of life. Try to let the spirit of thankfulness stay with you even after you've finished the turkey. "/>
			<outline text="Thanksgiving is such a beautiful holiday. "/>

			<outline text="Good morning!"/>
			<outline text="Strrrrrrretch!"/>
			<outline text="Coooool."/>
			<outline text="There's so much to write about today and so little time!  Man."/>
			<outline text="Yesterday Bill Gates wrote his own DaveNet piece. Check it out at http://www.microsoft.com/internet/downloads/billg.txt. It's pure classic great Bill Gates. "/>
			<outline text="It's not Bill Gates vs the Internet, it's Bill Gates vs Netscape! And the stock market heard him. Netscape was down $28.75 yesterday. Wow! In all my time following stocks I've never seen a drop like this. It's 4:15AM in California. The New York Stock Exchange doesn't open for three hours. What will Netscape stock do today? I'll be watching, that's for sure."/>
			<outline text="***Big Companies"/>
			<outline text="It's a clue to a bigger theme -- the themes these companies sing may play well in print media, but they have almost nothing to do with the work that web content developers do. The message seems to be -- we want to own the web, but we don't want to love the people. OK."/>
			<outline text="Quick fixes, instant reactions, huge deals, standards set, but how much delivered software? Is anyone offering anything but Blue Sky? Do they really own it? Is it theirs to offer? Hmmmmm. Uh."/>
			<outline text="Sun, Oracle, Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, and now Netscape, are just companies. Big ones. Legendary ones. Respectable ones. But do they know how to make users and developers happy? No way. Because they aren't happy people. Companies are not people, and companies are not happy places. They emit what they have. Fear. Uncertainty. Doubt!"/>
			<outline text="In &quot;Sysops&quot; I asked if Java is the next OpenDoc. Never heard back from anyone at Sun. I left voicemail messages. No answer. I never go this far out of my way to get information about new technology! Maybe they aren't ready to talk to me? Both as a developer and as a journalist, I have all the credentials I could possibly need. "/>
			<outline text="The only big company that's responsive to my needs is Microsoft. They aren't scared of Dave. Cooool. Hey -- they just signed on to support Java. Bill -- could you send me some info about Java? Ideally I'd like a beta of the Java Runtime for the Macintosh so I can play with making my content development tools work with it. Maybe you can help me get the software. I do lots of websites."/>
			<outline text="To John Doerr and Marc Andreessen, and anyone in charge at Sun, this is silly. If you want a developer program, when a developer calls and asks if you want to make love, the correct answer is YES."/>
			<outline text="OK Dave, calm down. Please. It's coooool. "/>
			<outline text="Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="***It's Great Theater"/>
			<outline text="This is the kind of stuff that fills my mind. It's great theater. Bill Gates takes on Netscape. The man who owned the world on August 24 is scrambling. The investors are reminded that they're still scared of Bill. So when he barks, they sell. "/>
			<outline text="The world changes accordingly. But, this system doesn't serve the users. Your money, the dollars you pay software companies, go into defensive measures, not useful features. Into fear, not fun."/>
			<outline text="To the users -- wake up! You can't depend on the business press and trade weeklies to keep you informed on technological developments on the Internet. They're caught up in a huge trance, they believe this FUD crap really means something."/>
			<outline text="The front pages are full of air and fluff and posturing and messages designed to make the stock market react, not to give more power to the people who pay the bills."/>
			<outline text="I think I finally got it. Here's how the system works. An editor spends half day in a conference room with four product managers from the company. They explain products that the editor will never use or understand. Marketing materials are beautiful. The people are beautiful too, they use big words like presence, alliance, convergence, and media. It sounds like they know what's happening. "/>
			<outline text="So they write what the company wants them to write. They have big great products. Go with the flow. They're great. "/>
			<outline text="A lot of the energy is negative. This product must hurt someone. Fear and pain. But what about joy and love? I'm having a blast using my system! My web server is the prettiest piece of software I've ever done. Other people are having fun too. The negative energy encapsulating the old world is in our way. Why can't we have fun? The always-quotable Indigo Girls said it beautifully, we &quot;learn to pretend there's more than love that matters.&quot; Guys and gals, a reminder, maybe a wakeup call -- love *is* all that matters!"/>
			<outline text="But we get fear. The big company says &quot;PUFF!&quot; The editor-in-chief says &quot;Page One!&quot; &quot;Puffy headline&quot; says the copy editor. &quot;Rewrite the press release,&quot; says the writer. That's how your news gets delivered. "/>
			<outline text="But, as Bill Gates points out all the time, it's your money that's fueling this system. If your dollars moved in a different direction, eventually the system would be replaced with one that more adequately represents the interests of users."/>
			<outline text="And... please don't blame the journalists and companies. Bill Gates isn't to blame for using FUD because you let him do it. Apple isn't to blame for shutting down developers because the users let them do it. You can't blame Larry Ellison because Business Week puts his picture in an article about the leaders of the Internet. And you can't blame Business Week either."/>
			<outline text="You get the software you pay for. In every sense. To the nth degree. That's the way the world works."/>
			<outline text="So if the users want to let go of the pain, we can have fun again. It's all that really matters!"/>
			<outline text="***Who owns MORE?"/>
			<outline text="A little story. "/>
			<outline text="I wrote a piece for Guy Kawasaki's EvangeList mail service earlier this week. I talked about my software, my philosphy of software, and talked briefly about my track record as a Macintosh developer. I talked about ThinkTank and MORE, two early products. Both products were hits, lots of users, and lots of people still use MORE. "/>
			<outline text="I heard from a lot of MORE users this week because of the Kawasaki piece. The common message was -- we love MORE -- nothing is better -- but Symantec doesn't support the product, so we're worried and unhappy."/>
			<outline text="They offer a solution. They want me to buy MORE from Symantec and continue to enhance it and make it better. It's very tempting. I still use MORE. I do huge high-tech web pages in MORE. I've hooked it into Clay Basket so Clay automatically converts my MORE outlines to HTML outlines, totally automatically, as it builds my website. It's very powerful stuff, but like a lot of MORE users, I really want a few features that would make it even more powerful for me. So, I'd be very happy to work on MORE. But I don't want to own it. "/>
			<outline text="Instead of me buying it from Symantec, here's a challenging proposal for the users of MORE, why don't *you* buy it and contract with me to improve it?"/>
			<outline text="The bigger question -- why don't the users own a software company?"/>
			<outline text="Why not?"/>
			<outline text="***It's a communication system"/>
			<outline text="The user's software company would not be dependent on the press to reach its audience. It would be a communication system. It runs a mailing list for each product. A product manager is hired to run the list and keep a website current. A bug list is maintained and is publicly visible. A current top-10 desired feature list is maintained, and the product manager is compensated according to his or her performance at delivering the requested fixes or improvements. Programmers are paid for putting features into the software. "/>
			<outline text="Money flows into the company from users. The company is initially capitalized by a public offering. Users pay for stock. Users also pay money to be part of the community. Money is paid for every message delivered to the community. And money is paid to use the software. It's all distributed electronically. Updates are very frequent. If you want the latest version, you pay for the password that gains you access to the download site."/>
			<outline text="Money flows, software gets better, progress happens, FUD is impossible because delivery is all that counts."/>
			<outline text="It sounds pretty great!"/>
			<outline text="***Why not?"/>
			<outline text="The users represent an enormous economic force. "/>
			<outline text="The current regime isn't serving their interests. "/>
			<outline text="To the users, if you really want to see your software live and evolve, put your money where your mouth is. "/>
			<outline text="Take charge of the situation and solve the problem."/>

			<outline text="#postTime &quot;12/12/95; 7:06:49 AM&quot;"/>
			<outline text="Good Morning!"/>
			<outline text="A couple of weeks ago, on returning from my Thanksgiving trip to Jamaica, I decided to take the plunge, again, and open up my own web server."/>
			<outline text=""/>
			<outline text="It's at http://ws2.scripting.com. "/>
			<outline text="I had a server in June when I was working on my bulletin-board software, which I called my Interactive Website. I wrote about the bulletin-board in &quot;Don &amp; Marie Packard&quot;, 6/27/95."/>
			<outline text="Well it's back! And it's bigger and better. And it solves another problem. Now it's a web-based object distribution server. Huh. What's that?"/>
			<outline text="It's a spooky thing. You crawl around inside the object database that implements the server. If you know where to look, you can actually watch it serving you! It's like having dinner with the chef in the kitchen. Very revealing. Fun!"/>
			<outline text="When you see something you like, click on the Download link to download it into a local database. This makes scripting.com cloneable and it defines the replication mechanism. At least the manual replication mechanics. Worms will do a better job. "/>
			<outline text="Every cell in the database has a web URL. There's a magic incantation that gets your web browser to come look at any bit of text code or graphics in the database. Scripts are addressable via the web. Everything is."/>
			<outline text="This is the way of the future. Everyone's been talking about this stuff."/>
			<outline text="It's not a demo. It's new technology. "/>
			<outline text="Please have a look."/>
			<outline text="***It's a learning experience"/>
			<outline text="For the first time I can monitor hits in real time. I'm learning a lot. The feedback loop is much shorter. I'm learning about the relative enthusiasm of various groups that I belong to. I'm learning about the staying power of messages. I'm forming theories about where links are appearing to my stories. "/>
			<outline text="I've watched messages roll thru organizations. For example, on Friday, the http://ws2.scripting.com/billgates.html piece was read by 20 people at &quot;General Magic&quot;. I wondered how the news had spread thru that company. How did they all find out about the piece? Maybe the URL was forwarded around on their LAN? Why were they all so curious about what Bill says about the Internet? I never knew that my DaveNets run thru that company. Maybe just this one? Interesting. Why this one? We'll see how this piece goes."/>
			<outline text="As others have reported, &quot;Microsoft&quot; people seem to be very active web readers. Maybe they were attracted by a mention of their boss? "/>
			<outline text="A mystery man, scooter.pa-x.&quot;dec&quot;.com, seems to *always* be on the server. He seems to be reading every cell in the server database. I thought Scooter must be a worm script of some kind, but it's too slow. I think there's a human being at the other end of the pipe who's fascinated with the richness of my server. I think Scooter is a man, but some women are nicknamed Scooter too. I imagine that he's working on an object server for his employer, Digital Equipment Corp, and is getting ideas from my server. That's OK with me. If you're out there, Scooter, please send me email or leave a message on the BBS."/>
			<outline text="I look forward more people from &quot;Apple&quot;'s Advanced Technology Group coming thru my server. I did a talk at ATG a few weeks back and got to know and like the people there. I think they will realllly like &quot;scripting.com&quot;.

			<outline text="I pointed a couple of web worms at my site. "/>
			<outline text="One of them, spidey.webcrawler.com, came for a visit. But I didn't see it doing any crawling. Maybe it was just verifying that someone would answer the call when it gets around to doing a real search of my site. I also registered with LYCOS. "/>

			<outline text="***Thanks to PG&amp;E"/>
			<outline text="The power came back a few days ago. Cooool! "/>
			<outline text="But it wasn't clean power. :-( "/>
			<outline text="For a few days all my screens were flickering wildly. I thought maybe they all got hit by a power surge, melting or fusing coils or something. I'm a software guy, I don't know about hardware!"/>
			<outline text="Then on Wednesday, I figured it out. The energy flowing into my house had changed. When PG&amp;E turned the power back on I had been downgraded to dirtier electricity. I called the power company. Talked to an engineer. She listens (get this!) respectfully, even though I know almost nothing about what she does. I'm an engineer and so is she. I had isolated the problem. The next day (yesterday) I wake up and my screens aren't flickering anymore."/>
			<outline text="Thank you PG&amp;E!"/>
			<outline text="So who says that the spiritual world isn't effected by the tangible world? A storm hits California, knocks out the power. When it comes back my screens flicker. Call the power company. Give me clean energy! Coool. "/>
			<outline text="Next day, no more flicker. Their clean energy cleans up my energy. My writing juices flow again. New stories to tell. Here we go."/>
			<outline text="Yeah!"/>
			<outline text="***Is Java the Next OpenDoc?"/>
			<outline text="A few DaveNets ago I asked if Java was the next OpenDoc. I've been learning more about Java and more about OpenDoc. The answer is no, it's not the next OpenDoc. But it's interesting to compare the two. "/>
			<outline text="Apple shipped OpenDoc 1.0. The Macintosh version is on their website. You can download it at http://opendoc.apple.com/. I did."/>
			<outline text="I wanted to approach OpenDoc as a user would. I already knew that the APIs were horrendous. As a programmer I had no desire to get to know this thing. I've invested a lot in Apple APIs over the years. So far, there's been very little payoff in that investment. "/>
			<outline text="I decided that this time around I'd take the risk of being a late adopter. I'd experience OpenDoc as a user first, and then decide if I wanted to build on it."/>
			<outline text="I decided not to get out ahead of this curve. I was busy learning the Internet protocols and getting ready to build on them with my own code and APIs. My head stayed down, I focused on what I wanted to do, I let Apple and IBM and Novell et al blaze their own trail. When they were ready to set up camp, I'd look at it as a user would. If I found myself excited at that point, I'd consider making a developer investment."/>
			<outline text="My conclusions -- OpenDoc is a very airy place. And it's very different from the Macintosh environment I've gotten so used to. I don't like differences! The File menu is gone, it's replaced with a Document menu. I know they're just words, but this change makes their new world seem tilted. Document is such long word. And it's not File. This kind of stuff usually just fades into the background, until they change it. Then it's bothersome. Very!"/>
			<outline text="The OpenDoc menus are short. Not much there. The parts are clearly demos, like TeachText or a calculator desk accessory. No MacWrite or MacPaint in this package, no application of the technology that's so compelling to make you want to keep an OpenDoc window around. "/>
			<outline text="If they had a SimCity or a Lotus 1-2-3 part, something new and pretty with really nice legs, a part that only worked inside the OpenDoc environment, I think I might keep it open, but until that happens it stays closed, doc."/>
			<outline text="So Apple did Part One of the delivery of OpenDoc. Now they have to get energy to flow thru their new platform. The only energy that counts at this time are parts. "/>
			<outline text="So what about Java? It's got heat, it's got passion, it's got money, it's got fame. It's going somewhere. Unlike OpenDoc it's got magazines, books, tradeshows, and the endorsement of every major force in the software world. What juggernaut Java is! Takes your breath away."/>
			<outline text="So -- everything's going Java, but get this -- OpenDoc is more real that Java is! Ain't life funny? Both are airy places. But Java is more sparse. The parts are fewer. The potential isn't really understood. People still ask basic questions about what Java can and can't do. We're all confused. It's a puzzle. How do the pieces fit together?"/>
			<outline text="Java and OpenDoc are airy. Both need balloons and gliders and airliners to fly in their space. Both are very short of elegant air travel devices. "/>
			<outline text="OpenDoc has a couple of paper airplanes. "/>
			<outline text="Java hasn't decided if wings work in their airspace!"/>
			<outline text="Cooooool."/>
			<outline text="***Happy New Year!"/>
			<outline text="The Java world is so loose, its limits are so unknown. Who's going to do the new APIs that are needed for persistent storage, interapplication communication and node-to-node communication? Script editing and debugging? How will these protocols compare to the current protocols of the Internet and the single-system wires already in place on the desktop platforms? Will the APIs be horrendous or airy and easy and low-tech like the APIs of the Internet? These APIs will be hybrids of the APIs used in desktop operating systems and the protocols of the Internet. "/>
			<outline text="Java has Big Mo. It's clear that it's going to be a standard like the programming model for the Apple II was a standard. Like the model for all popular personal computers, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, Windows, and presumably the minis and mainframes that preceeded PCs."/>
			<outline text="We're about to realize the great dream of computing -- people connected to people interfacing thru their own computers. It's all coming together technologically.  The technical sociology of APIs will undergo a revolution. Then the people will. We'll walk a web of friendships, we'll hold hands in cyberspace. "/>
			<outline text="In 1996 we're going to define what it means to be a friend, in technical terms, and we're going to shape the fingers with which we touch each other. It's going to happen in 1996. "/>
			<outline text="Happy New Year!"/>
			<outline text="***Focus on Delivery"/>
			<outline text="Bill Joy is a player. So is Marc Andreessen. And Philippe Kahn. The icons of the software industry. We gravitate to their personas. We're a social species. Story-tellers. Stories need great heros. Each icon has a story. Bill Joy is the quiet and thoughtful introvert and Unix geek. Marc is the young rich brilliant rebel. Kahn is Pete Rose on the rise."/>
			<outline text="Read about these people in PC Week, Business Week and in Newsweek. The reporters need a dramatic hero to hang their stories on. I'm no different. "/>
			<outline text="Persona versus persona, great struggles, the writers often miss that the real battle is fought in terms of executable code and developer tools, not in personal mudwrestling matches between the titans of the software biz."/>
			<outline text="Sometimes whole companies get this kind of aura. Apple hasn't delivered any interesting software since 1987, yet they're still given (some) credit for being a hothouse of innovation. It's taking a long time for that heat to disipate."/>
			<outline text="John Sculley, former chairman of Apple, was seen as a technological visionary, when the truth is that he didn't even use a personal computer. I've given a few demos to Sculley. I don't think he ever understood what he was being shown, even though the products were end-user products for an easy-to-use computer, the computer that his company made."/>
			<outline text="Sometimes whole industries get lost in the wake of a really good credit-taker. I could list a dozen examples, but this sounds so negative, and I like to be positive. "/>
			<outline text="Please watch out for this."/>
			<outline text="Don't judge strategies by their pronouncements, judge them by delivery. There will be some new superstars in this platform, new companies no one has ever heard of. Keep your ears open. Delivery will be what counts."/>
			<outline text="Be skeptical. More than ever before, software has to be delivered for the pitch to have any credibility. Where would Netscape be if they hadn't delivered software? See where the power is now? Compare what's going on at General Magic (nothing!) to the clean energy that's flowing around Netscape and Java. "/>
			<outline text="Netscape delivered a mass platform for developers to aim at. General Magic never has delivered. General Magic's chairman did deliver some beautiful speeches and white papers. But they don't have anything that can run on my desktop or on my server. Other people got there first. Delivered software can't be displaced by clever metaphors or developer white papers. "/>
			<outline text="Features are what matters."/>
			<outline text="Totally."/>
			<outline text="***White Boy Welfare"/>
			<outline text="I've known Denise Caruso, the media columnist for the New York Times, since we were both rookies in the software business back in the mid 80s. I've always admired her spirit and intelligence. She's irreverent and experienced. There's a spike in Caruso's curve, a sharp edge, a clean anger. She's a powerful person."/>
			<outline text="Denise coined a great term -- White Boy Welfare. It's an angry term. And a elegant useful concept. "/>
			<outline text="There's a club, here in Silicon Valley, of people with great stage presence, people with interesting names, or interesting backgrounds, who make sense to investors and CEOs of big companies."/>
			<outline text="They run software ventures. "/>
			<outline text="Usually they run them right into the ground! "/>
			<outline text="They're all white. They're all boys. They make huge money. They get in the way. They contribute nothing. They know how to manage large things. (Not!) They speak at industry conferences. They get quoted a lot. Press releases are written about them. They form alliances. They buy things they don't understand. "/>
			<outline text="They move into something that's hot, and make it cold. They put out fires. They do this, and then they get another job, and put out another fire."/>
			<outline text="And they make shitloads of money doing this."/>
			<outline text="How does this lesson apply to our new world?"/>
			<outline text="They're coming! Watch out."/>
			<outline text="Nuf said."/>
			<outline text="***Postscript"/>
			<outline text="After running this piece, Caruso sent a correction. She didn't coin the term, Cathy Cook, an independent Silicon Valley public relations consultant did. Many apologies! And thanks to Cathy for the term. It's still useful. &quot;;-&gt;&quot; [DW 6/16/98.]"/>

Chuck is one of the sweetest guys I've ever worked with my 16 years in the software business. He's a great coder and community-builder. We're very lucky to have Chuck working to make Macintoshes such flexible and fast web servers. "/>

Even spookier: they call this guy Wavey Davey. When I was a high school student in the Bronx, they called me Gravy Dave. Sometimes even Gravy Davey. Ohhhh this is reallly spooky.

I read the docs, wrote my code, flipped the switch, tried things out, tweaked things up, and moved on. Things just worked. I got the browser to say Hello World. A dialog box that says Hello World. I did a multiplication table. Took a few wrong turns, but that's OK, it's part of the fun of exploring something new."/>
			<outline text="Along the way I learned how they report syntax errors (it's interesting) and found some holes and a few crashes. Nothing unusual. After a while things got realllly crashy. I never figured out why. It's OK now, or so it seems."/>
			<outline text="Looking thru the JavaScript verb set, it's clear that we're paying a major price for security. Yes, they clearly have a scripting language runtime in this thing. It's a nice one. Yes, it's safe. But what can we do with the language? Data validation for sure. What else? Let me know."/>
			<outline text="To be clear, JavaScript is not Java. It's related to Java, it's the &quot;light&quot; version, intended to be usable by people who author HTML.
