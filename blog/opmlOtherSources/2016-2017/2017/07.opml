				<outline text="The first is a duet with Amy Bellinger singing the theme song of &lt;a href=&quot;http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/amyGreenAcres.mp3&quot;&gt;Green Acres&lt;/a&gt;. She sang the Eva Gabor part and I did Eddie Albert's." created="Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:21:29 GMT" />

				<outline text="In both cases the recordings were created in a totally low tech way. Play the previous version on your sound system, record that and your vocal part and upload it. Next person does their part on a voluntary first-come-first-serve basis. No coordination, whatever happens happens. ;-)&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:21:31 GMT" />

				<outline text="PS: It seems as if Green Acres should come before Dixie but it's the other way around. We finished the Dixie on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/05/23.html#When:4:44:28AM&quot;&gt;May 23&lt;/a&gt; and the duet on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/05/29.html#When:8:16:31AM&quot;&gt;May 29&lt;/a&gt;." created="Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:21:33 GMT" />
