				<outline text="Yesterday, late in the afternoon, after a nice walk and bike ride (too cold, too much crazy NYE traffic in NYC) I ordered my favorite caffeinated drink at Starbucks using their iPhone app, which I adore because it lets me skip the two lines you have to wait in. It's a grande Pike Place coffee with three shots of espresso. I figured this would help me make it to midnight. I only had a few sips before my eyes were basically welded open. Enough caffeine. So in the morning I had an almost full cup of room temperature Starbuck's caffeine drink. What to do with it?" created="Sun, 01 Jan 2017 17:00:12 GMT" />
				<outline text="So I poured it into a big glass, filled it with ice, added a little half and half and let it sit for a minute for the cold to permeate all the caffeine molecules. " created="Sun, 01 Jan 2017 17:00:13 GMT" />

				<outline text="On my walk today I tried to listen to the Face The Nation &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/12100.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, but I couldn't make it more than five minutes in because the entire cast of the show were other reporters or writers. The amount of insight per sentence is low. Lots of repetition of themes. As if we haven't been listening since 9/11. I hit the same wall listening the Dickerson interview with Colbert from last week's show. I found Colbert has no wisdom to offer other than &lt;i&gt;Whoops! &lt;/i&gt;some big shit happened that we weren't expecting. We need much more. " created="Sun, 01 Jan 2017 23:04:02 GMT" />
				<outline text="They are all about normalizing everything, staying within the guidelines of their idea of how the political process works.

				<outline text="I think they mostly are historians, I think that's the path they are on, trying to fit our current situation into a historic context.

				<outline text="In July I wrote a piece called &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html&quot;&gt;Don't Feed the Trump&lt;/a&gt;, which was mostly about what I had learned from dealing with trolls in the 40-plus years I've been on the Internet. Imho there's a lot of wisdom in that piece, and if it had been heeded by the press, we'd probably be preparing for the Clinton presidency, not Trump's." created="Tue, 03 Jan 2017 15:46:42 GMT" />

				<outline text="But he's no longer a troll. I think that needs to be said clearly. A troll is someone who steals your energy and uses it to attract attention to himself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;POTUS&lt;/a&gt;, by definition &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; be a troll. He already has all the attention. If you respond to him, or RT him, or write a post about him, you are not doing anything to call more attention to him. It's analogous to pointing a flashlight at the sun. No one will notice, except for the few people around you." created="Tue, 03 Jan 2017 15:46:44 GMT" />
				<outline text="So at this point, we're in uncharted territory. A person who behaves as if he were a troll, campaigning for an office he has already won, making predictions that will come true or won't, being watched by everyone on the face o earth.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 03 Jan 2017 15:46:45 GMT" />
				<outline text="Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/816060244740673538&quot;&gt;RT'd&lt;/a&gt; one of his tweets with a simple question, asking why he thought the North Koreans wouldn't be able to launch an ICBM in the early days of his presidency. Famous author and former Wired colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevin2kelly/status/816061657726275584&quot;&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt; played back the advice I had given so many, and I acknowledged that he was right and I had indeed fed the troll. But on reflection, I realized the rules had changed.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 03 Jan 2017 15:46:46 GMT" />
				<outline text="So this morning I did it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/816299778640412672&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, stating that without ObamaCare I wouldn't have health insurance, and I didn't appreciate his campaigning and that it's time for him to get to work and start caring about the millions of Americans like me who depend on it for health care.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 03 Jan 2017 15:46:47 GMT" />
				<outline text="Our role at this point is to remind the soon-to-be commander in chief and remind ourselves that the job he is about to occupy works best if he at least pretends to care about all Americans, and instead of campaigning, he projects the impression that he is hard at work trying to make America (sigh) great again. The campaign is over Mr Trump. It's past time for you to get serious about the work you signed up to do. That should be our posture to his troll-like behavior, to remind him he is not the outsider he used to be. He's sitting in the hot seat, the one with the red phone and the big button that blows up the world.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 03 Jan 2017 15:46:48 GMT" />

				<outline text="There are at least three publications I should probably have a subscription to, but I only pay one. There are another twenty whose paywalls I hit regularly. If I paid for all the subscriptions whose paywalls I hit, I would be spending a lot more for news than I do for the Internet connection that gets me to the news, in addition to most of what I read which is not-for-pay.

And it's something that when said by a woman about a man is considered liberating. Too often we impose really harsh judgement when we could choose not to.

				<outline text="Frederic Filloux &lt;a href=&quot;https://mondaynote.com/a-new-model-for-medium-3ad7cc638c13#.2fk31pl69&quot;&gt;likes&lt;/a&gt; Medium. He says:&amp;nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;For elegant text-based publishing, there is a need for a simple, easy-to-use, well-designed platform such as Medium. WordPress was supposed to deliver just that, but it took a geeky turn, saturating its ecosystem with scores of third-party plugins — more than 48,000 at last count — whose quality can charitably be called uneven. Most WordPress sites end up using dozens of plugins, each one bound to create its own set of problems: slow page-loads, crashes, random behaviors or update cycles that don’t match WP's platform agenda. Unless you have sizable tech resources at your disposal, WordPress is a nightmare. Switching to Medium gives you the impression of going from MS-DOS to iOS.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:38 GMT" />
				<outline text="I think it is fair to say WordPress is to Medium as MS-DOS is to iOS, but for different reasons. T&lt;span&gt;o be fair you have to compare Medium to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;hosted version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of WordPress. There are no plugins there and none of the complications or management hassles he describes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:39 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;However the user interface of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;WordPress&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;is large and spread out, the commands you need are organized in a way that&amp;nbsp;makes them hard to find. A lot of the problems I have with WP could be solved by reorganizing its command structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:40 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;The second reason Medium is preferred is the editor. It was a major advance in browser-based editing when it came out five years ago. If you were to graft the Medium editor onto WordPress and reorganize the commands, you'd really have something. They could address the question he raises by providing a standard &quot;reference release&quot; of WordPress that includes a set of commonly used plugins that are known to work well with each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:41 GMT" />
				<outline text="Filloux then reviews the business problems that Medium has, most of which come from having raised a large amount of venture capital and because of that having to find a revolutionary product that changes the economics of publishing. A tall order. And every time they pivot, the confidence in them finding such a model dwindles. This is something that's not just felt by investors but by Medium users and it depresses the general blogging activity.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="In the meantime, all the content that continues to pour into Medium is at risk due to the missing business model. And this is where I part with&amp;nbsp;Filloux. I wonder why he only discusses Medium's interest and the interest of its shareholders. What about &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; interest and that of other people who use Medium as their publishing platform? Is this the best way?&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:43 GMT" />
				<outline text="I argue that it's not. That what we need is a better designed WordPress, or an open source Medium. Or something new that is inspired by Medium's smooth UI, and WordPress's open source heritage.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:44 GMT" />
				<outline text="We need lots of choices, not two.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:45 GMT" />
				<outline text="One more thing to consider. While Medium has been searching for its business model, open source software has been making the editing ease-of-use accessible to any JavaScript developer. So it's getting more plausible every year that users can get what they like about Medium, without waiting for them to find the revolutionary business model." created="Mon, 09 Jan 2017 14:49:46 GMT" />

				<outline text="They reached a conclusion, sort of, that there's a difference in ethos between reporters that came up through blogs and ones who write for New Yorker, a 90-year-old publication known for excellence and breaking big stories (no sarcasm)." created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:04 GMT" />
				<outline text="But it wasn't a satisfying conclusion, and I have some standing as part of the early evolution of the blogosphere whose traditions led Smith to the correct answer, to release the dossier. I just wish they had done it in time to make a difference in the election.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:05 GMT" />
				<outline text="So, to me there are two reasons, the first more important than the second." created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:06 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smith identifies with his readers. It would be outrageous for him to have valuable source material like the dossier and keep it hidden from his readers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;There had already been extensive dumps of Clinton campaign emails, but none on Trump's. Now we know why. The Democrats were being nice, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/harry-reid-letter-fbi-james-comey-clinton-emails-trump-russia-ties-hatch-act/&quot;&gt;pleading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with the FBI to release the dossier without telling the public there &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; a dossier, and the press were being even nicer, sitting on the dossier until after the election, though happily publishing Clinton's emails, and Comey's scolding and his 11th hour letter and 12th hour retraction. Somehow that was okay but it was not okay to release the Trump dossier? I don't get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:07 GMT" />
				<outline text="" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:08 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;Put a disclaimer on it, as Buzzfeed did, and trust the readers to be smart enough to figure it out for themselves. Trust is a two-way thing. If you don't trust your readers it would be unreasonable for you to expect that they would trust you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:09 GMT" />
				<outline text="I have yet to hear a convincing reason why any news org would hold on to the dossier." created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:10 GMT" />
				<outline text="BTW, it's offensive to think this difference in values is connected to age. Although Smith was careful not to say it, Remnick mentioned it several times. I'm older than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=how+old+david+remnick&amp;amp;oq=how+old+david+remnick&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.3199j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;, and I feel strongly that the blogger ethos is the correct one, because it's grounded in the connection between news and reader. That's really what matters in news, imho.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:11 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;The &quot;we know better&quot; idea that the press are inside, and will decide what the outsiders are entitled to know, is very old and isn't real anymore. The people own the means of publication now alongside the press. Eventually the dossier would have gotten out even if all the journalists agreed to embargo it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:12 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;There's a big trust problem because you guys make simple questions complicated, like this one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think on your feet, and stay focused on what your readers need and want, and stop being so fair to people who cut all the corners, including ones we don't know anything about, like Trump. He withholds vital information, don't you do it too. And the people, the readers, are the ones who have to decide, and then live with the consequences. It's better if they know what they're getting into.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 28 Jan 2017 21:58:13 GMT" />
