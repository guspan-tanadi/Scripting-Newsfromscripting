				<outline text="On Saturday I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/838146431198322688&quot;&gt;pngWriter post&lt;/a&gt; about a new requirement for the presidency. According to the proposal you would have to serve a full term as a governor before being president.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 06 Mar 2017 15:56:09 GMT" />
				<outline text="People pointed out that there have been good presidents who were senators. It's true, also representatives and generals. Now I will defend my proposal in light of that fact.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Truman was a good president. He was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman#As_U.S._Senator_from_Missouri&quot;&gt;senator&lt;/a&gt;. However there's no reason he couldn't have served as a governor before being president. Then he would be more qualified, not disqualified. Big diff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The job of governor is closer to the job of president than the job of  legislator. I believe a good governor is more likely to be a good president.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an otherwise qualified person was not elected, such as Obama or JFK, well there have been a lot of qualified people who did not get elected. Hillary Clinton is a great example.  It's not the end of the world. There are always many good people who could be president, the idea is to get one good person elected in each election.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to raise this question:  If we survive this catastrophe, how do we prevent it in the future without ripping up the Constitution and making our country a dictatorship. I thought the governorship-bottleneck would weed out exactly the kind of mistake we're experiencing now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" created="Mon, 06 Mar 2017 15:56:10 GMT" />

				<outline text="But some things resist that treatment." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:00:37 GMT" />
				<outline text="For example, if it were to snow two feet tonight in NYC, how would you treat that with market economics? When I go out my front door, would I have to contract with a shoveler to clear a path for me to the subway? But if I did that, the people following me would get the same service for free. So the natural thing is to pool our money and pay a shoveler to clear a path for all of us. That way each of us pays a fraction of what it costs. You can see where this is going. Pooling our money is another word for tax. It's been given a bad name by persistent marketing, but it's still a good idea, and for natural events like snowstorms, any other approach is basically unworkable." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:00:38 GMT" />
				<outline text="It takes a little imagination to see disease as a natural disaster like a snowstorm, but that's the best model for how it actually impacts a community. We don't know who will get sick, or when. So rather than take a risk that you'll be the one who gets the expensive disease, we pool our resources to pay a share of what the treatment would cost each year. And either way we're lucky. If we don't get sick but paid a small tax, we're happy. Not so happy if we're the one who gets sick, but at least we get the treatment we need, don't die, and also are not be bankrupted by our misfortune." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:00:39 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'm not going to go into all the detail here, but every way you look at it, disease follows the pattern of a natural catastrophe. So the only reasonable way to fund treatment is to pay taxes, and that's it. In the U.S. we've privatized the insurance, but maybe it's time to fully bite the bullet and just make it a tax. That's the debate we're having, over many decades, under all the noise.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 08 Mar 2017 17:00:40 GMT" />

				<outline text="I learned in 2002 that health insurance is mandatory for everyone. Really no exceptions. I needed life-saving heart surgery at 47. Totally off the scale in terms of probability. I had health insurance, a COBRA plan that was set to expire. Luckily it was still in force when I needed the surgery." created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:17 GMT" />
				<outline text="Of course, when it lapsed, I had a pre-existing condition. I didn't even try to get insurance as an individual. Instead I got a job, thinking it provided health insurance, but it didn't. It was at a university. I had a health &lt;i&gt;plan. &lt;/i&gt;Big difference. It meant I could use the university's health care system. I got my meds at a huge discount. But if I needed surgery, always a real possibility, I'd be out of pocket." created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="Luckily this was in Massachusetts, where they had ObamaCare before the rest of us. I still couldn't buy health insurance as an individual. So I started a company, with one employee, and we voted in a health plan. I was covered. Whew.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="In two years, after the university appointment lapsed, I was back on the road. I lived in Seattle, Florida, Calif and now New York. The insurance company had figured out that my mailing address was no longer in Massachusetts, and were making noises like maybe they didn't think I was covered. They kept paying for doctor's visits and meds, and I kept paying the huge premium, my fingers crossed that if I needed surgery, I would be covered. " created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="When ObamaCare came about, I switched immediately. I now was in a network, so I was limited in the doctors I could use. At times this was inconvenient. But I knew that in an emergency my health care would be covered. That's what really mattered. Confidence. I've since used it for a complete test of my heart two years ago. It was not cheap. But needed. I paid nothing, it was covered." created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="I still pay a lot. My premiums are not subsidized. But they are &lt;i&gt;half&lt;/i&gt; what my old Massachusetts premiums were. And have not gone up at all since I started with ObamaCare." created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:22 GMT" />
				<outline text="For me, an independent developer, ObamaCare was the answer. Without it I would not have insurance. I'm absolutely sure of it. " created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="One more thing, I am really offended by what the Repubs say about users of ObamaCare. I know how important health care is. Ryan and Chaffetz clearly have no clue. But they will find out, because we all get older, and life teaches you a lot, and one thing it teaches is how important health care is." created="Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:24:24 GMT" />

Of course they all have great health insurance, but maybe their cousins don't. Paul Ryan's neighbors in Janesville? Or Chaffetz's congregation in Utah? Do they talk with their preacher or rabbi about this? Do they understand the purpose of health insurance?

				<outline text="Over the years lots of cities have wanted to replicate the success of Silicon Valley. I have some ideas how to do that, and why the way they've been going about it is wrong.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:27 GMT" />
				<outline text="I migrated to Silicon Valley in 1979, from Wisconsin, where I was previously a graduate student in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;. I had an idea for a product, and a working prototype, and couldn't find people to partner with in Madison at the time. There were no computer stores, just a few consultants, and very few people with personal computers. I had one of course. I couldn't wait until they were commercialized. Too good an idea.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:28 GMT" />
				<outline text="I also got &lt;a href=&quot;l&quot;&gt;BYTE Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and all the ads were for places in California, places like Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Cupertino, Los Gatos. I looked at a map and saw they were all in about the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California&quot;&gt;place&lt;/a&gt;. So I figured that was where I should go. So I loaded up my hippie van and drove there, and found lots of people who, like myself, were excited about the future of personal computers.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:29 GMT" />
				<outline text="If I were a country musician I'd go to Nashville. But I made software so I headed to Palo Alto. That's how I explained it to my friends at the time." created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:30 GMT" />
				<outline text="I was drawn to the original Silicon Valley, very early for PCs, so I have some idea what the appeal is and how I decided to go there. The most important thing was seeing that other people like me were already there. That was what drew me there." created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:31 GMT" />
				<outline text="Today there is no BYTE Magazine, but there are other ways developers find out where they should go. If I were going to do it today, I'd try to build an association between my locale and a popular open source project, or a new project started by someone who has credibility as the leader of a project. It's the technology and personal leadership that matters. Company names matter too, but only if you're hosting the company headquarters." created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:32 GMT" />
				<outline text="Usually localities go for large capital investments, tax breaks for big corporations, or infrastructure like high-speed networks. Your small state or city might find the money to do that, but that's not your advantage, there almost always are other places with more money to throw at BigCo's and infrastructure. and the money is better spent on education and open source, where it will have a more lasting effect.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:33 GMT" />
				<outline text="Those two things, education and projects, will do more to fuel the development of your tech culture than the presence of an outpost for a company headquartered in the valley. They will always see it as an satellite, the important jobs will still be in Menlo Park, Cupertino or Sunnyvale.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:34 GMT" />
				<outline text="Expanding on this idea -- a &lt;i&gt;university-sponsored&lt;/i&gt; open source project would be even better. It can easily and inexpensively host conferences. People will come to your school to get educated on the project, and graduate having already made contributions. Mid-career project participants could return to university to teach, or to gain new skills. And the students in turn would put down roots in your community so they'd be more inclined to stay there after graduating.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:35 GMT" />
				<outline text="In my own case, had Madison had enough other people to work with, I might have stayed in 1979, because it has a lot of things going for it as a tech center. At least it did at the time.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:36 GMT" />
				<outline text="So what would step one be? Recruit the people who start open projects, and give them incentives to relocate. Treat them the way you'd treat talent for your local sports teams. Money is a good thing, but you should also have liberal laws, great things to do. Even if nerds never go out they like to think they could, and their families like it.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:37 GMT" />
				<outline text="Consider Boulder as an example, they have the Rockies and a fine university. Good places to eat and hang out. Bike paths. Denver, a major city, is nearby. A big airport. All the basic ingredients for booting up a tech culture, and that's exactly what's happening in Boulder.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Mar 2017 14:09:38 GMT" />

They are the majority party in Congress. If they don't want hearings, then there are no hearings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They knew the Democrats would do what they did. It made the Democrats look good with their constituents. In normal times that alone would be a non-starter for the Repubs (and for the Dems if they were the majority party). But these are not normal times. They have acknowledged that by scheduling the hearings and providing a stage for the Dems and the directors of the FBI and NSA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before you give them too much credit, however, if Trump's approval rating weren't low and going lower, none of this would be happening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They come from districts that, for the most, voted for Trump. Their constituents need to see them defending him. Even though it's a charade, because as I said in #2, they knew the Democrats would ask the questions they couldn't.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only thing they could do that's better is start a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_or_special_committee&quot;&gt;select committee&lt;/a&gt;, or call on the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor. With yesterday's testimony, that seems more likely than it did before. I suspect this is the goal of Nunes and the other Repubs in the House (and of course the Democrats as well).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading tea leaves, but it's not much of a leap, the Repubs in Congress have decided, correctly, that Trump must go. They are doing what they have to do to both make that happen and to not commit career suicide if at all possible. The Repubs are taking a risk that they will be discovered, or that Trump's approval rating could suddenly go up, which could happen, if for example if there were a 9/11 level terrorist attack on American soil. So there is some courage involved. Trump knows he's being crossed, and in order for it to work he must stay weak.

				<outline text="I wonder why no one has designed a restaurant that solves this problem. I used to do sound work for music when I was a kid, in a strictly amateur way, but I learned the basics. The acoustics of a room is determined by its surfaces. If the walls are hard, like brick or stone, sound reflects, and the room is loud. If you put soft stuff on the walls, they absorb the sound, and the room feels quiet. This is why recording studios have thick sound-absorbing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ATS-Wedge-Acoustic-Panels-Charcoal/dp/B00QH2RJW2&quot;&gt;foam&lt;/a&gt; on the walls. They want just the sound coming from the instruments and the amps, nothing reflective. If they want that effect, they can add it. They don't want the room to add any sound of its own.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 22 Mar 2017 14:21:41 GMT" />

				<outline text="What would I do if I were the owner of Medium and were free to be creative with new business models?" created="Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:45:41 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'd merge with or acquire an ongoing news organization, or maybe two. Both well-known for excellent editorial, with fantastic writers and the ability to draw more. Medium would inherit their business model. And it would become the editorial system for the publication and it would also be the Letters to the Editor software.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:45:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'd raise more money from the VC community to hire new editors, whose sole job it is to read what's posted on the service looking for people who are either talented writers, or people with extraordinary intelligence, insight or experience, who are writing about what they love, know and see. When such a writer is spotted their stories are promoted to the readers alongside the stories written by the pros. They are compensated either with stock or money (they would be encouraged to take stock).&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:45:43 GMT" />
				<outline text="In other words Medium becomes the farm system that drives, over time, a rapid expansion of news coverage, with much more first-person writing of news. News by the newsmakers. Sources go direct.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:45:44 GMT" />
				<outline text="Now instead of facing the same hurdles that existing pubs face, without any of the advantages (Medium has no editorial voice, as far as I can tell none of the execs or devs are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html&quot;&gt;NBBs&lt;/a&gt;) they can tap into the natural way news is growing in the post-print news world. If you think about it, this is why Facebook and Twitter became the phenomenons that they are, without the advantages that Medium has (a real CMS with the ability to link and style).&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:45:45 GMT" />
				<outline text="Evan Williams &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.medium.com/our-approach-to-member-only-content-cfce188261d1#.vyxrbgs2y&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; they have new reading technology coming. That's great but I'd insist that these tools work with open formats, so they can benefit the web at large. It would help spread the idea that Medium is not just standing behind writers, it's also an enthusiastic proponent of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/27/0724.html&quot;&gt;open web&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="One of the favorite talking points of Repubs re health care is that people can still go to the emergency room, so no one will be allowed to die in the streets. That is so totally wrong. For more than one reason.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You still have to pay for it even if you don't have insurance. The hospital will bill you. And if you have a job, or assets, they will get paid. And it's a lot of money. So guess what, sick people don't go to the emergency room if they don't have insurance if it's at all avoidable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going to the emergency room is not health care, it's treatment. Health care is where the doctor does tests, and if there's a problem does more tests, and sends you to see a specialist. An emergency room handles emergencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's also preventative care. Getting a colonoscopy (ugh) every so often. Or learning how to do self-examination. Or working with a doctor on losing weight, or stopping smoking, or getting off drugs, or getting birth control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should aspire to being a nation of healthy people. It's in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness&quot;&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. We're here for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it doesn't say anything about &quot;not dying in the streets.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Bottom line, going to the emergency room isn't even treatment, and treatment isn't health care. That's the amazing thing about the ACA, it used the experience of the medical system to make the economics of health care work better. If the Dems hadn't tried to get some Repub votes it would have matched reality even more closely. It's a lot like climate change. The Repubs confuse weather for climate. And confuse treatment for health care.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 24 Mar 2017 13:49:25 GMT" />
