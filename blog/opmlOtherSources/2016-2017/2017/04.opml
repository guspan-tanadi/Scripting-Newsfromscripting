				<outline text="Once upon a time, I was 30 or so years younger, and had just sold my angel-backed tech company to a VC-backed company, stayed six months, and then left to start something new. I was young, successful, a minor tech god in Silicon Valley, the whole world at my fingertips. And I wanted a job at Apple.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:22 GMT" />
				<outline text="My success had come from being one of the first to ship a product for the Mac in 1984, and then having the ability and courage to stick with it through a couple of bad years. This had endeared me to people at Apple. I knew a lot of the top execs there. They all used my software. It seemed natural to me that I'd continue my career at Apple, instead of as an outside developer." created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="I knew the reality that the world didn't, that being independent was a precarious existence. It was either feast or famine, but mostly famine. I wanted the security of a regular paycheck, health plan, an office, a boss even. And I wanted the benefit of shipping my software to all those people who used Macs. Instead of reaching a small fraction of the users, my software would reach them all, I reasoned. I envied the people who worked at Apple. (I would find out much later that they envied me too.)" created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:24 GMT" />

A witty Frenchman, he explained I would not like to see how the sausage was made. He said it in a funnier way. It would be better for everyone he said if I continued to be independent. But I persisted. And nothing good came from that persistence. As convinced as I was that I should be &quot;inside,&quot; the big company culture at Apple, contrary to the hype, prevented individuals from being powerful. Even if people were brilliant and driven, there was only so much a person could do." created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:25 GMT" />
				<outline text="A few years later, after developing a product that should have been system software, and being copied by Apple, my small team of three people met with the team at Apple that was doing what we did. We sat in a corner of a supersized conference room. The Apple people filled the room. There must have been 30 people there who did &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than what we did. No matter, we eventually had to give up. There was no way to co-exist. They didn't want us there, even though they said they did. And when the platform vendor doesn't want you there, you won't be.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:26 GMT" />
				<outline text="I tell this story now, as I'm getting ready to go to a journalism conference in Italy, six timezones away. I see journalism making the same mistake I made in the early 90s. They look at the advantages what they call the &quot;platforms&quot; have over trying to make a go of it independently. They want those advantages. But also like me in the 80s, they want to keep their independence. They want to be mavericks, Woodwards and Bernsteins, and, at the same time, be paid by the people and companies they will have to challenge.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:27 GMT" />
				<outline text="I know tech culture now in a way I didn't then. GassÃ©e probably thought I'd have to learn the lesson myself back in 1988, but he shared the learning anyway. There was no way to bring independence into a large company. It just doesn't work that way. If you want to be independent, you have to make your own way. Independence means the same thing no matter what direction you approach it from.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:28 GMT" />

				<outline text="PS: In hindsight, I couldn't have developed blogging, RSS and podcasting inside Apple. Unthinkable. Apple came at the web from the opposite direction, viewing the world as elite creators providing vision and products to a mass of consumers. My philosophy, more in line with the original Apple view, and the original vision of the web, was to view everyone as both a creator and a consumer. I think this is the struggle inside journalism as well, long-term. And the reason Facebook has all the money, imho, is that they embraced the non-elite view, that the technology enables.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:33 GMT" />

				<outline text="So much of what people report seems to be showing that Trump is inconsistent and ill-informed, and irresponsible. But this is already factored in. The guy is a shameless kleptocrat. He's almost certainly maneuvering the country to make himself richer. He probably already is much richer than he was when he took office. Before long he will pass Putin as the richest person in the world.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 17:52:46 GMT" />
				<outline text="As with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy&quot;&gt;kleptocrats&lt;/a&gt; who ran the Bush II government, Cheney and the defense contractors, this is a very inefficient way to transfer wealth. Too much waste. Someone should try to make a deal with Trump and the Repubs. Resign, you get to keep all you stole plus a premium. Surrender your Twitter account and finish your days playing golf all around the world with other rich folk. They can even teach you how things work, how exciting for you, now that you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2017/4/12/15279654/trump-north-korea-xi-10-minutes&quot;&gt;seem&lt;/a&gt; to care!&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 17:52:47 GMT" />

Or maybe he and his hackers can figure out how to get him to leave sooner? We can make it worth his while. I bet by now Putin has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_remorse&quot;&gt;buyer's remorse&lt;/a&gt;. If POTUS blows up the world, Putin and Russia are blown up too.

We talked about the usual thing tech people and journalists talk about when we get together. What's the future of journalism on the Internet? I have some strong ideas about that, all based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html&quot;&gt;Sources Go Direct&lt;/a&gt; philosophy, but I was surprised to find that Chris and Mary were totally on board.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:45 GMT" />
				<outline text="Here's the idea." created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:46 GMT" />
				<outline text="Chris and Mary do a weekly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/11/20/radio-talk-host-christopher-lydon-returns-wbur-after-year-absence/jLC042johF7aRALtnvWlNK/story.html&quot;&gt;NPR show&lt;/a&gt; that's also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radioopensource.org/category/podcast/&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. (Chris is the host, Mary the producer.) Since the election they've been talking with scholars and political insiders about the state of government in the US.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:47 GMT" />
				<outline text="I wasn't listening to it, sad to say, until a friend told me I should, that it's the best thing out there on politics in the US. I started listening, and enthusiastically concur. It's the adult stuff, reality-based, not the mush you get on the cable networks, or the investigative details you get from the Washington Post and the NY Times (these are valuable but they don't provide a big picture that Chris's collaborators do).&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:48 GMT" />
				<outline text="Okay, so if you were trying to figure out where the value is in Chris's program, you'd have to put the Chris/Mary combo at the top of the pyramid. It's their rolodex that makes it work. It's the extensive reading and listening they've done, over twenty &amp;nbsp;years, that means they know who to call and can ask the right questions.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:49 GMT" />
				<outline text="Next level down the pyramid are the people in their rolodex. They know their shit because they've spent a lifetime studying the history of kleptocracies, the Soviet Union, Russia, fascist movements around the world and in the US. Or they've been inside politics for a long time and have memory of Nixon and perhaps even McCarthy. Watergate and Iran-Contra. The buildup to the war in Iraq. People who knew the people with the levers of power.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:50 GMT" />
				<outline text="One more level down the pyramid, where the greatest value is, by sheer volume, are the people who are smart enough to be listening to Chris's show. Probably a very large number of them are in Boston, because his show is broadcast on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbur.org/programs&quot;&gt;WBUR&lt;/a&gt;. But because it's 2017 and his show is distributed as a podcast, his &lt;i&gt;braintrust, &lt;/i&gt;as I call it, is distributed around the world.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:51 GMT" />
				<outline text="To summarize, Chris/Mary orchestrate, the people in the rolodex opine, and the braintrust listens.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:52 GMT" />
				<outline text="Let's imagine a number that represents the quality of the Chris Lydon braintrust. That number would be very high. And another number that represents the size of the braintrust. That number would be low because most of the smart people in the world don't know about it. (And of course it's their goal to change that.)" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:53 GMT" />
				<outline text="Now let's take the Washington Post and NY Times. They probably have relatively high quality numbers, and large size numbers, compared to Radio Open Source. The product of these values is large. Another publication that I think of in these terms is The Economist. Their readership is really powerful, intelligent, educated. Their quotient would be high.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:54 GMT" />
				<outline text="So here's the question this thinking raises, given the new distribution medium. How can a podcast like Chris's or a pub like the NYT, WP or Economist, take advantage of the breadth and depth of their braintrust to improve the product, make it more relevant and more profitable? I have some ideas about that. We'll discuss it at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heymancenter.org/events/the-unplugged-soul-a-conference-on-the-podcast/&quot;&gt;Unplugged Soul&lt;/a&gt; conference, where Chris and I are doing the keynote interview tonight. :balloon:" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:55 GMT" />
				<outline text="PS: Last night on Maddow for the first time I heard her use the term &quot;open source&quot; to refer to reporting about the Trump/Russia scandal. Fascinating. She used it many times, so it was deliberate. I wonder if I missed something in the week I was traveling and if she's explained how she's using the term. Clearly it's not the way we use it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software&quot;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; world. I must ask Chris how they arrived at that as the name for his podcast.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:56 GMT" />

There's no question the reporters knew this was bogus, yet they accepted what the president said as legit. When they do that, I as a seeker of truth, and believer in the values of the US, am betrayed.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 14 Apr 2017 12:46:57 GMT" />

				<outline text="Some takeaways from this weekend's podcasting &lt;a href=&quot;http://heymancenter.org/events/the-unplugged-soul-a-conference-on-the-podcast/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; at Columbia.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Primarily this conference was by and for producers of podcasts. I was the only developer who spoke, and not in any detail about how podcasting works, other than to say it's open and not dominated by silos and that's where the freedom comes from.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As far as I can tell there is not much awareness of the technology of podcasting among producers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a podcast-listening glitch earlier today, walking around town. I thought I had Chapter VI of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stownpodcast.org/&quot;&gt;Shit-town&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone, but I didn't. It took me five minutes of navigating through confusing sites, the app store, iTunes, who knows what, to get to a place where I could just click a link to listen. The state of the UX for podcasting is awful. Unacceptable for a technology that's 14 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lack of improvement imho is due to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonyclassics.com/fogofwar/&quot;&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; of companies and developers who think they dominate or expect/plan to, and won't talk with others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Podcasting should be a pleasure. Finding new great stuff to listen to should be easy and instant. And you should be able to get that without giving up the freedom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have to figure out how to cut through the fog and plot a course and ignore the people who refuse to talk, and just fucking go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are always silos trying to start up. I really doubt any of them will gain traction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm going to keep building with Electric-River as the base. Next up I want to teach it to download podcasts to a user-accessible folder on a desktop. If you have MP3s on your disk, you can control where the shows are and don't have to have so many connectivity surprises when you're out and about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shit-town is great. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/04/15/mrPutinShowSomeMercy.mp3&quot;&gt;star&lt;/a&gt; of the show on where we're at in America and what Putin can do to help us out of our misery. I'm writing this post in the style of John B, if you're wondering why I sound so pissy and uppity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Berners-Lee is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tim-berners-lee-inventor-web-plots-radical-overhaul-creation/&quot;&gt;right track&lt;/a&gt;, preaching that users should control their own data. I'm concerned that this is going to come with another prescription that we all use RDF. We get a lot of interop from OPML and RSS, both of which are variants of XML, a format developed by his W3C.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/we-could-make-history-349109119cee&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Evan Williams in 2012 suggesting that we make history by helping to undo the siloisity that was creeping into the blogosphere. No response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's very likely there would be no podcasting today if we had not gotten early and steady support from NPR. That's because in 2003, Tony Kahn at WGBH listened, and thought podcasting was a good idea, and spread the gospel throughout NPR land. We got lucky, we found the guy at NPR that everyone there listened to, and he believed. Tech should have more people like Tony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BTW, Martin Nisenholtz at the NYT played the same role for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;. Without the support of the NYT, it's likely that the RSS community would have melted down into many competing incompatible standards, neither reaching critical mass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" created="Sun, 16 Apr 2017 14:19:40 GMT" />
				<outline text="Moral of the story: Don't ever doubt that technology users can have enormous power. And as a technologist, don't be shy about searching for these people and listening to them and trying to help them win. Be careful about the first impulse to dismiss. Great things can result from these collaborations. The myth of the lone inventor dreaming up the future ensconced in a lab isn't how it works.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 16 Apr 2017 14:19:41 GMT" />

				<outline text="At the Perugia journalism &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journalismfestival.com/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; they had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2017/communicating-the-news-to-young-people&quot;&gt;panel&lt;/a&gt; with a 10-year-old boy and several adult journalists. The goal, I guess, was to find out what the boy thought about the news. It was a noble idea, but imho it didn't work. Kids in the midst of adults will act more or less as they think the adults want them to act. I remember what it was like being a kid myself. Perhaps a panel of kids, with the adults in the audience, might have worked better. But I suspect they wouldn't have stuck to the topic." created="Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:48:16 GMT" />
				<outline text="It occurred to me much later that this is typical of developer conferences. They might have a panel where developers are on stage and the platform vendor employees are in the audience, but only heavily supervised developers, and ones not likely to rock the boat too much. Thus depriving everyone of what could potentially be a lively and useful discussion." created="Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:48:17 GMT" />
				<outline text="What if instead they had a panel with &lt;i&gt;adult&lt;/i&gt; users of news, telling the professional journalists, in the audience, what frustrated them about the way the news was covered. There's a lot of potential in that. But news people, like the people who run big platform companies, seem reluctant to take the risk of letting their users speak freely in their presence.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:48:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="When I did my session at the Perugia conference I spoke as a technology developer who wanted to work with journalists. I saved my criticism in that session for other developers, so the journalists seem to enjoy it. I could just as easily have led a discussion about how journalism led us off a cliff in the 2016 elections, and how if we want to save what's left of democracy, it's going to a require radical transformation in how news works. I suspect if I had done that, the journalists would have walked out of the room." created="Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:48:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="I am experiencing this frustration watching some of the same people who were at Perugia, who I spoke with over meals and in the hallways about the dire state of news, tweeting about a journalism conference they're at in the US this weekend. As in Perugia, they talk about users of news the same way platform vendors talk about users of their platforms. In aggregate. Theoretical terms. And missing the point, imho.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sat, 22 Apr 2017 15:48:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="Bottom-line: Have the guts, if you're going to have a professional conference, of giving &amp;nbsp;substantial time to the users of your profession's products.

				<outline text="What podcasting needs more than anything is a quick easy answer to the following question --" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Find me something good to listen to now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's personal. Note I didn't say find anyone a good podcast to listen to now, I said find &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; one. It should be a podcast that I, an individual person, will find good to listen to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's immediate. I don't want to subscribe to a podcast that will someday yield something good to listen to, I want it now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="For the last 17 years podcasting has been answering the wrong question: &lt;i&gt;I want to subscribe to this.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;That question doesn't come up often, if ever. And podcasting doesn't even answer it very well." created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="Think about it. Where are you when you decide you want to subscribe to a podcast. That's a trick question. How about nowhere. How about it never happens. I'm never looking at something on the web or elsewhere and think oh that's something I want to subscribe to.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:22 GMT" />
				<outline text="There are shows that I like so much that it's almost certain that I want to listen to whatever they have available right now. Planet Money, Fresh Air, West Wing Weekly, Radio Open Source are examples. But it's never guaranteed that their latest thing is something I want to listen to now. It might be a rerun. Or maybe I find the subject distasteful or disturbing or the person they're talking with or about is of no interest.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="Okay so if the question is &lt;i&gt;Find me something good to listen to now, &lt;/i&gt;then how do you do that? What information do you need to be able to get that done?&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:24 GMT" />
				<outline text="It's collaborative. You need to know what I've listened to that I liked. And you need to know what my friends have listened to that they liked. So we can serve as recommenders for each other." created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:25 GMT" />
				<outline text="Facebook's social graph is good enough to get this started. I know because I tried it manually a couple of years ago. I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/337761226431289?pnref=story&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; asking my friends to recommend podcasts. I then made that into a subscription list and fed it into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/04/17/introducingPodcatchcom.html&quot;&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/&quot;&gt;Podcatch.com&lt;/a&gt;. It's highly personalized. It works well enough that I get an answer to FMSGTOLTN pretty much 100 percent of the time.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:26 GMT" />
				<outline text="To do this for other people we just need to systematize it. Make it so that it works for anyone's friends, and it's dynamic, it's kept up to date. When my friends' interests change, then the recommendations change.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:27 GMT" />
				<outline text="Also to really work, Facebook isn't the right place to accumulate the data because amazingly you can't listen to a podcast in Facebook. They're too busy reinventing human senses I guess." created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:28 GMT" />
				<outline text="&amp;nbsp;A podcast listening client would be able to accumulate the data. But here's the catch, I don't want to be locked into any one client. So if they aren't giving the user access to their own listening data, and they aren't making it easy to share with others, then I'm not going to use it. It's possible that such clients exist, and if they do I want to know about them.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:29 GMT" />
				<outline text="How important is this? Very. A similar problem was there for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; in the early days and it was never solved because the reader vendors were unwilling to accept leadership. They all assumed they were going to dominate, or their investors wouldn't let them share the data. Then along came a silo that didn't use RSS, Twitter, and it solved the problem. RSS languished with no love from the dominant vendor, who eventually left (Google Reader). Today RSS still works, amazingly, but it's not a happy ecosystem. It serves as a cautionary tale for podcasting, in how it can go very wrong.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:30 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'd say this is the big challenge for podcasting in 2017. It's why I'm worried about it getting siloized. The practical problem is that then there will be a gatekeeper, who behaves like Facebook and controls an opaque algorithm and the medium is closed off to non-Facebook developers, and we lose the freedom that has made podcasting such a wonderful thing.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:46:31 GMT" />
