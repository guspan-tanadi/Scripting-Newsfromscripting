I have it posting, but it has to login every time I load the app, which causes a window to open, and on my tablet this causes a dialog confirming that it's okay for the app to open a popup. This is annoying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The earlier version would get the URL of the new post by accessing an element of an array called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;actions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that's part of the info you get about a post when you ask Facebook.

				<outline text="Josh Marshall &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/827888362921017344&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that even if Trump doesn't want to be a dictator, he thinks like one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;We've known this for a long time. And I don't think there's any question that he wants it. Of course he does.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sat, 04 Feb 2017 15:14:33 GMT" />
				<outline text="Starting early in the campaign he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=trump+asks+why+hillary+was+allowed+to+run&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; why Hillary Clinton was allowed to run. I always wanted to ask a followup: Who does he thinks decides? The answer is of course, in the US, no one. We are all equal. There are rules about who can and can't run, you have to be a citizen, over 35, and born in the US. I think that's about it." created="Sat, 04 Feb 2017 15:14:34 GMT" />

This is a basic core value. That's the opposite of how Trump sees it. He thinks that &lt;i&gt;he's&lt;/i&gt; the government. We're the subjects. This is the clash of values between the people and the president. I doubt if many of his voters see him as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_for_Life&quot;&gt;President For Life&lt;/a&gt;, but there's no doubt that Trump does.

				<outline text="There were other clues. The &quot;Lock her up&quot; slogan. An insult to the Constitution. It isn't up to a crowd whether or not someone is locked up. That's the point of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights&quot;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="Journalism plays dumb, worse than &quot;view from nowhere.&quot; Can't ask who is in charge until someone says Trump isn't." created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:16 GMT" />
				<outline text="It seems journalism has at least two functions. 1. Reporting facts in evidence. 2. Asking questions. What are the rules governing #2?" created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:17 GMT" />
				<outline text="Was journalism allowed to ask if Obama was born in the US, because someone made a big deal of it? (Clearly no. And they, largely, didn't.)" created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="But they were allowed to question Hillary's honesty because other candidates raised it as an issue. They did. Even though scant evidence." created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="This is one of those conventional wisdom vs obvious reality things. I think it's obvious Trump is not in charge. Isn't it? Objectively." created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="But the press plays along with the (imho) farce that Trump is on top, ready to respond to crises, or even driving what his admin is doing." created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="Perhaps instead of 1984 or Brave New World, we all ought to be reviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNo0BicRM8k&quot;&gt;Wag the Dog&lt;/a&gt;?" created="Sun, 05 Feb 2017 17:20:22 GMT" />

				<outline text="I admit that I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wolff_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Michael Wolff's&lt;/a&gt; work. Most of his colleagues in the press don't. I've never been able to figure that out. And no, I don't want it explained, because I've heard it all, and find it unconvincing." created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:52 GMT" />
				<outline text="Yesterday I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/828399122138931200&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, to some &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesaurus.land/?word=acclaim&quot;&gt;acclaim&lt;/a&gt;, that he was right that the press is self-obsessed, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/narcissism&quot;&gt;narcissistic&lt;/a&gt; as our president, and as a result, misses big stories that we really need them not to miss.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:53 GMT" />
				<outline text="For example..." created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:54 GMT" />
				<outline text="We hear all the time, in the op-ed pages of venerated pubs, how Facebook is stifling the news, but never how Facebook is killing the web. A few very simple additions to Facebook would help bring the web into Facebook, but they are deaf to this. As is the press. Why? Presumably because it isn't 100 percent about them.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:55 GMT" />
				<outline text="Also when we hear how Facebook is stifling news, we never hear the other side, how news ceded its distribution to Facebook, and how we still don't know it wouldn't work, if the news industry just replicated what Facebook does, without the mistakes that Facebook makes. I think it &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; work. And as a user of news, I wish they would just do it. In America, we have a word for this -- competition, and like the First Amendment, it's one of our core values. You can't prove someone has a monopoly if you haven't even tried to compete with them. As the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Nisker&quot;&gt;Scoop Nisker&lt;/a&gt; says, &quot;if you don't like the news, go out and make some of your own.&quot; That includes the news itself, imho." created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:56 GMT" />
				<outline text="Then just now I heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, famous news-about-news pundit say, on the BBC News Hour, that journalism must be better at self-examination. Right there that's the bug. They need to not so much depend on self-examination, but rather learn how to listen to their users, not as amorphous mindless &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry&quot;&gt;slurry&lt;/a&gt;, but as sentient beings." created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:57 GMT" />
				<outline text="For an industry whose existence depends on its ability to listen, news has become a ghoulish imitation of itself, sort of the Walking Dead of listening. They just can't do it. Most of what they do is recycle fumes. Yes there is some actual news in the fumes, esp in 2017 when the news is so rapid and real, but it would do better if instead of gradually reforming, news underwent a revolution of relevance. Let the people take over for a while. Find ways to radically listen. Extreme listening. It'll be painful at first, but no pain no gain. On the other side, we'll all be better for it.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:40:58 GMT" />

				<outline text="A couple of months ago I went to a studio across from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Public_Library_Main_Branch&quot;&gt;NY Public Library&lt;/a&gt; on 42nd St and did an interview with people from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/&quot;&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;, who were in Toronto, I think. We talked about the work I did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon&quot;&gt;Chris Lydon&lt;/a&gt; when we were both research fellows at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkman Center&lt;/a&gt;, in 2003.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:12 GMT" />
				<outline text="I always worry about interviews, they can be like &lt;a href=&quot;http://contactsheet.org/cgi-bin/ransom.pl?thedata=This+is+an+example+of+a+ransom+note.&amp;amp;Button=Generate+Ransom+Note&quot;&gt;ransom notes&lt;/a&gt;, you never know how they're going to reassemble your words and if the result will make sense or accurately represent what you believe or know.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:13 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'm happy to report they did a good job of putting the story together. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/thursday-feb-16-2017-paying-tribute-to-stuart-mclean-1.3982583/how-podcasting-became-the-medium-for-the-people-1.3983769&quot;&gt;8-minute podcast&lt;/a&gt;, and if you've been following this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, it's imho totally worth a listen.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:14 GMT" />
				<outline text="I should add that podcasting started before I met Chris, and continued after I left Berkman. CBC chose this thread, but there are others they could have just as easily picked up.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:15 GMT" />
				<outline text="And it's nice to see Chris get the credit he deserves. A lot of people thought it was too weird an idea. When I pitched him, he showed up, and while they don't mention this on the CBC show, his series of podcasts are the only audio documentation of the early political blogosphere. His interviews were first class, and he picked a very interesting group of people to cover, some of whom went on to have amazing careers as bloggers and political leaders.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:16 GMT" />

				<outline text="I imagine that most of the entertainment industry is scared shitless of Trump and the rise of fascism in the US. Since Trump is a product of TV, and now we understand how powerful that is, I wonder if the power will be turned in support of self-government and freedom and the rule of law." created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 03:11:09 GMT" />
				<outline text="TV created the nasty &quot;You're Fired!&quot; mentality. But they also created Friends, and Will &amp;amp; Grace, Seinfeld and other shows I've never watched, but heard about, that are credited with having eased our culture into being okay with different lifestyles." created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 03:11:10 GMT" />
				<outline text="TV, in my earlier years when I was paying more attention, helped us purge hate, by helping us laugh at a Queens bigot (I'm from Queens, as is our president) named Archie Bunker, and accept that blacks can elevate via The Jeffersons. I wonder what Norman Lear thinks about Trump? The people who did The Sopranos and The Wire?" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 03:11:11 GMT" />
				<outline text="I wonder if TV will now help us undo the damage they unwittingly begat. Perhaps by having a Trump-like character get what's coming to him. Put him in Archie Bunker's chair, and see what happens. :balloon:" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 03:11:12 GMT" />

				<outline text="There's an idea that keeps coming up that the tech industry ought to give a huge amount of money to the journalism industry.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:09 GMT" />
				<outline text="I first &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/17/ifYouDontLikeTheNews.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the idea after hearing it on a panel discussion at the J-school at UC-Berkeley in 2009. &quot;Give us money because we're losing&quot; seemed to be the argument.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:10 GMT" />
				<outline text="The idea came up yesterday in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cjr.org/tow_center/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fix-journalism.php&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://towcenter.org/academics/emily-bell/&quot;&gt;Emily Bell&lt;/a&gt; on the CJR website. Same argument as the Berkeley panel:&lt;blockquote&gt;What independent journalism needs more than ever from Silicon Valley is a significant transfer of wealth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:11 GMT" />
				<outline text="I forwarded the post on Twitter with a single word comment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/834174579497107456&quot;&gt;Pathetic&lt;/a&gt;. I was going to leave it at that, but then I found myself ranting in DMs to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/author/mathew-ingram/&quot;&gt;Mathew Ingram&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist friend. What came out was somewhat coherent, here's what I wrote.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The reason I think it's pathetic is that it's a way of avoiding the changes that journalism has been avoiding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead of competing with Facebook, which would lead journalism to its new relevance, they want a handout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well I want a handout too. Who wouldn't want a handout?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But this is a request to avoid growth, and no one is entitled to that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's immoral, it's lazy, it's unsupportable. And btw, practically speaking it's powerless. It just &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/834393027863072768&quot;&gt;isn't&lt;/a&gt; going to happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So journalism ought to have a good Plan B. It's right here, ready for you all to use, it's called the web. It's made for journalism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Postscript&lt;/h4&gt;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:12 GMT" />

				<outline text="Facebook sucks for news. We can create something so much better. I have tried to work with them, to get them to change in small ways that would help the web, and make Facebook a more adequate surface for writing, and keep hitting the same wall. &lt;i&gt;They like their business the way it is. &lt;/i&gt;That imho makes them ripe for competition.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:14 GMT" />
				<outline text="They might give journalism some money, but that isn't the answer. Journalism has to become what Facebook refuses to become. It's tough. But that's the way human evolution works.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:15 GMT" />
				<outline text="Yes we need journalism, but the journalism we need is not what Bell describes, we need something re-born out of the web. I've been right about a lot of stuff over the years, and the journalism thinkers have never understood until it actually happens.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:16 GMT" />
				<outline text="It won't go the way Bell wants it to go. But journalism will thrive on the net, I'm sure of it. Further it can't thrive in the environment Facebook has created. And as long as they're on top and generating all that money they have no incentive to change. And once they feel the heat, it'll be too late for them." created="Wed, 22 Feb 2017 13:44:17 GMT" />

They provided a &lt;b&gt;level playing field&lt;/b&gt; for news, at scale. But we already had the level playing field, the web. And because 2016 was not a good year for Facebook as a news system, imho, it's a perfect time for us to turn our attention to the web. To let a thousand flowers bloom.
