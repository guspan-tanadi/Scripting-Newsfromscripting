				<outline text="A few weeks ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)&quot;&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; backups of my internal hard drive started failing. The error message (which is no longer available so I can't quote exactly) says that I should check the disk that I'm backing up to. I did, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_Utility&quot;&gt;Disk Utility&lt;/a&gt;. It's okay. " created="Mon, 01 May 2017 14:54:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="So I did a backup with another disk, and another, and another. I even bought a brand new disk, formatted it freshly, and the backup there failed too." created="Mon, 01 May 2017 14:54:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="So I conclude that the error message is lying, that the problem isn't with the media I'm backing up to, it's the source disk that has the problem. So I checked it with Disk Utility. It says it's fine. " created="Mon, 01 May 2017 14:54:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="So now I have a conundrum. I wanted to do a backup and then start using the new drive as my boot disk. But I obviously cannot do that. Unless one of the brilliant people who reads this has an idea what I can do to get one good backup from the internal disk, before saying sayonara!" created="Mon, 01 May 2017 14:54:21 GMT" />

				<outline text="The best art ignores money. It's driven by the desire of a human to express what's inside. &quot;I am human and I have something to say.&quot; " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:14 GMT" />
				<outline text="I wish Medium had strived to make crazy-great editing software, and had created a server that they operated for free, and free of advertising, and open source with a liberal license that let others build new kinds of collaborative systems with great editing at its core. " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:15 GMT" />
				<outline text="How do you make money from this? We don't have an opinion about that." created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:16 GMT" />
				<outline text="Think of it as a way for a man who made billions from the open web to give back. It was never about any individual's greatness or worth, it was and is about our need as a species to apply our collective minds to our evolution. We still have fundamental changes to make for our species to survive. " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:17 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'd add that the whole idea of a Great Thinker solving our problems is itself part of the problem. It worked for us until we conquered and controlled nature. Now we have to find a new purpose for ourselves, a new mission.&amp;nbsp;&lt;h4&gt;Re JSON feed&lt;/h4&gt;" created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="People have asked what I think of JSON feed... " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="My longtime friend and collaborator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2017/05/17/json_feed&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the two guys who designed the format. In fact I am in Seattle right now visiting Brent, talking about another project, though of course we have discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://jsonfeed.org/version/1&quot;&gt;JSON feed&lt;/a&gt;. I knew it was coming. Brent and I emailed about it about a month ago." created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="My opinion is pretty neutral. Kind of a shoulder shrug. It reminds me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bOy3RNyWME&quot;&gt;slogan&lt;/a&gt; from Battlestar Galactica. &quot;All of this has happened before and will happen again.&quot;" created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="The hype around this effort reminds me of the hype at the start of Atom. Thankfully the personal stuff does not seem to be coming along with it this time." created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:22 GMT" />
				<outline text="Is this something we should be focusing on?" created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="I think we have to work on climate change and the fascism that's trying to boot up in the US. Our systems for news suck, and there are obvious ways to improve them if we put our minds to it. And I think a new incompatible feed format not only doesn't move us toward solving those problems, in a very small way (not worth worrying about) it moves us &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; from solving them. By using bandwidth that could be used to foster working-together, perhaps. By making things that would otherwise interop, not interop. " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:24 GMT" />
				<outline text="If developers have a hard time using XML in their apps, if that's the problem, why not attack it right there? Work to make it easier. I work in Node and the browser, and in both places XML and JSON are equally easy to use. The same could be done for any environment. In fact in the browser, XML is integrated deeply into the programming model, because the web is made out of XML. " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:25 GMT" />
				<outline text="As a developer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/04/19/electricRiverV041b.html&quot;&gt;feed reading&lt;/a&gt; software, if any new format gains traction, my software will support the format. I don't believe in locking users in or out. So a new incompatible format makes my life slightly more difficult. But once the work is done, it moves out of the way, hopefully never to be thought of again." created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:26 GMT" />
				<outline text="As a writer, and developer of feed-creating software I am going to stick with good old &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://source.smallpict.com/2014/07/12/theSourceNamespace.html&quot;&gt;source namespace&lt;/a&gt;. It has served me well, and doesn't want for any features. If it did, I would just add them to the namespace. " created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:27 GMT" />
				<outline text="One more thought, a few years ago we played around with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140218231452/http://rssjs.org:80/&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; of JSONified RSS, a simple translation of the XML elements and attributes to JSON. Two observations. 1.  It didn't invent new names for things that already exist. 2. It didn't catch on." created="Sun, 21 May 2017 16:07:28 GMT" />

			<outline text="One enclosure per item or multiple?" created="Sun, 21 May 2017 18:16:41 GMT" type="outline" >
				<outline text="Over the years one of the criticisms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the version of RSS that enabled podcasting, is that it only allowed one &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt&quot;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt; per item." created="Sun, 21 May 2017 18:16:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="This was a deliberate decision. I was aware at the time that there was a choice. I went with the one-to-one correspondence. There were two reasons, a design question and to keep it simpler for developers and podcast listeners.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suppose you allowed an arbitrary number of enclosures. Wouldn't you want to be able to describe each? If so, an enclosure would morph from being a simple three-attribute element, to a structure. What would be the new sub-elements? One obvious one would be &amp;lt;description&amp;gt;. How about a title? A date? Category? Author? I'm sure you see where this is going. We just created a new &amp;lt;item&amp;gt; inside an enclosure. And could an enclosure have an enclosure? Why not? Isn't that more powerful? (The reason usually given for having more enclosures.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The second reason is that you made life more complicated for the aggregator developer. When they look for an enclosure they somehow have to decide which of the multiple enclosures the user wants, or offer a choice to the user. Does the user really care what format the podcast is in? When I'm listening what I want is to hear the podcast. You want me to choose? My life is already too complicated. Too much software interrupts the flow of my thought with questions I have no interest in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" created="Sun, 21 May 2017 18:16:43 GMT" />
