# Archive from 1999.io blogging

Between August 2016 and May 2017, I wrote Scripting News in 1999.io, and the source was in a format called chatLog.json which was fairly easily converted to OPML, which I did in December 2021. The result is in this folder, along with the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017/chatlogToOpml/chatLog.json">original chatLog.json file</a>.

All stories had titles in this period, this was before Old School where I declared my freedom from the restrictions of the long-gone Google Reader. 

Before installing these files in the Daytona collection for Scripting News there were 8953 posts in the database. After loading the OPML files here there were 9480 posts.  

### Source code

Here's the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/2016-2017/chatlogToOpml">source</a> for the Node app that did the conversion from chatLog.json to OPML.
