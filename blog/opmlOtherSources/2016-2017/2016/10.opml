The American Zombie Party.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Sun, 02 Oct 2016 15:58:46 GMT" />
				<outline text="This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-problem-with-trump-isnt-his-debating-skills?mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker that inspired the outburst. And the specific excerpt:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet Trump continued [in the debate] his self-congratulations for compelling the President to [provide his birth certificate], along with the grotesquely racist notion that it was “good for him” (i.e., for the President). It slowly dawned on the listener that this was all of a piece with the rest of Trump’s racial attitudes: he believes that, as a rich white man, he had a right to stop and frisk the President of the United States and demand that the uppity black man show him his papers. Stop-and-frisk isn’t just a form of policing for Trump; it’s a whole way of life. The idea that he had a right to force a black man to go through what Obama rightly saw as the demeaning business of producing his birth certificate showed his fundamental contempt for any normal idea of racial equality. It was of a line with his equally bizarre notion that owning a country club that doesn’t actively discriminate against black people is not a minimal requirement of law but a positive achievement of the owner. This isn’t the case of someone misarticulating an otherwise plausible position; it was just a case of someone repeating, once again, not only a specific racist lie but also the toxic underlying set of assumptions that produced it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4&gt;We still have a choice&lt;/h4&gt;" created="Sun, 02 Oct 2016 15:58:47 GMT" />
				<outline text="The world that Trump grew up in, the one that I grew up in only ten years later, was like this. Enough people remember it. First a black president, now a woman president. That's a lot of change to swallow." created="Sun, 02 Oct 2016 15:58:48 GMT" />

My choice is to help my friends, family, other members of my species, the earth that gave us life." created="Sun, 02 Oct 2016 15:58:52 GMT" />
				<outline text="The confusion over Black Lives Matter, that it doesn't in any way devalue other types of lives, is also true of the dominance of white males in politics and economics. Not being dominant doesn't mean we don't count. However it does mean that when we have a clear choice of competence vs incompetence, we can choose a woman over a man.

Curtis Granderson made a circus catch in center field, the kind of thing that makes postseason baseball so incredibly intense. The Mets threatened to score a couple of times, if you were generous in your estimation, but they were still our team, always. The Giants? Good luck with the Cubbies.

				<outline text="I created a new blogging tool that is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.1999.io/2016/06/01/0028.html&quot;&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; to be as easy to write for as Twitter and Facebook. There's a text box at the top of the page. Start typing in it. That's how you create a new post. But you can go past 140 chars. You can go really long.

				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;The thing I learned is there is no reason you can't use this kind of &quot;quick&quot; tool to write &quot;serious&quot; posts. As a software designer, this is an important observation. So you'll see posts of all length on my blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 13 Oct 2016 19:47:51 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;I'm not sure if this would work for Jay though. His PressThink posts are more substantial than even my most ambitious post. I rarely spend more than an hour writing a post. I see blogging as fresco writing. If I have more to say about a topic, I write a new post and link back to the previous one. This isn't optimized for readers, I know, but it does make it more likely I will write something. So in a way that's there for the readers too.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 13 Oct 2016 19:47:52 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;So maybe Jay needs two separate spaces.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 13 Oct 2016 19:47:53 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;But -- as a reader, who primarily finds out about Jay's new stuff through his feed, now the newest quickest bits of Jay-wisdom are not available to me unless I visit his site?

				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;I have blown through those objections many times in the past, and no doubt have lost readers because of it.

The short ones had permalinks that took you to the archive page for the day. It really worked because I had a tool that made it really fluid. And it was pretty good for reading and it all flowed through the feed. Twitter kind of broke that up. And Google Reader finished the job. ;-)&lt;/span&gt;" created="Thu, 13 Oct 2016 19:47:59 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;An aside, I've always felt posting on WordPress involved too much thought on how to get the software to do what you want.

And therefore you can let the sources, esp ones who are good writers, and who have an ability to put their own interests aside, and write passionately about the issues and opportunities of the day, speak directly to the readers, without having reporters filter and dumb-down what they say. If you've ever had the experience of being interviewed by a reporter and then see how your thoughts are expressed, you know how valuable it would be sometimes to cut out the middleman. They go for the salacious, try to make you look like a hypocrite, on the theory (I guess) that that sells subscriptions. Why should I as a reader care if it sells subscriptions? I read in order to be informed and inspired (and yes, titillated and amused)." created="Tue, 18 Oct 2016 13:22:02 GMT" />

Something happens, a new leaked email shows that Hillary has a nasty habit that we think is awful and disqualifies her. Or Trump turns out to be a sexual predator (oops that's already factored in).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is likely to vote? A poll respondent who isn't going to vote won't be part of the result, but they might be counted in the polling. You can't simply take them at their word.

				<outline text="" created="Thu, 20 Oct 2016 13:40:11 GMT" />
				<outline text="The statisticians at FiveThirtyEight know about these errors, based on past experience with polling vs actual elections, and have theories about how much they affect the outcome. And that's weighed against how close it is. If 9 of every 10 respondents say they are going to vote for Clinton, no matter how big the errors are, they're going to say she's got a near-lock on the election. Not much chance the errors could be so big as to turn that kind of polling into a losing result. On the other hand if it's just 6 of 10 then the errors matter a lot and the election becomes a tossup, &quot;within the margin of error,&quot; a pollster might say." created="Thu, 20 Oct 2016 13:40:12 GMT" />

				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;I'm as surprised as anyone at how powerful journalism has been in this election season. They seem to control how the mood swings in the country. I think they could probably make it so one candidate wins and the other loses. Is that rigging? Yes, I think it is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 25 Oct 2016 12:44:50 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;I agree with many of the things they say about rigged elections. But I don't think it was a secret, so if you entered the race in 2015, thinking you'd run for president, you don't get to call a do-over just because it is what it obviously was. That's bad sportsmanship. We wouldn't tolerate it in the NFL or NBA, why should we put up with it in politics?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Social media mirrors what's said on TV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;" created="Tue, 25 Oct 2016 12:44:51 GMT" />

A process that yields a result, the mechanics of journalism." created="Tue, 25 Oct 2016 12:44:55 GMT" />
