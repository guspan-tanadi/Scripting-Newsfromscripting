				<outline text="For background I recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/11311.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of the Slate daily podcast.

				<outline text="I see so many people discussing what went wrong for the Dems in 2016. But most are written by journalists, so they miss (imho) their own role in what went wrong.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:12 GMT" />
				<outline text="Imagine you're watching an NBA basketball game, and one team is being called for every infraction, but it turns out that most of the calls end up inconclusive, it just appears that they might have been thinking of doing something that could be seen as inappropriate, but probably not illegal, or even dishonest." created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:13 GMT" />
				<outline text="On the other hand, the other team is not only fouling a lot, several times on every play, they're also getting hauled into court for committing &lt;i&gt;crimes&lt;/i&gt; on the court, not &amp;nbsp;crimes of the sport, but actual legal crimes. And when they explain what they're doing, they commit technical fouls, back in the game." created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:14 GMT" />
				<outline text="And in the crucial final minute of the game, they call the first team for a huge blatant foul, but then the call is reversed, but after the game is lost. Oh well. Shit happens." created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:15 GMT" />
				<outline text="I think that's a pretty good telling of the role the press played in the 2016 election. They could have run Trump University ads showing the candidate selling snake oil. Caught red-handed. And then explain the devastation he brought to Atlantic City. Show how his employees and customers feel about him as a businessperson, since that's how he's presenting himself. Very germane to voters. They probably would have helped us understand what it would be like to be governed by him. Give us some idea how to view what he was saying in his stump speeches." created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:16 GMT" />

				<outline text="I'm not saying the journalists are bad people, or if I would have done better in their shoes. The NBA has never seen a team like Trump/Pence in 2016. But it's good to really look at things dispassionately, to see how you all can do better in the future. And for that imho you have to listen to how your work was viewed by others, not just by asking other journalists.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="PS: I have to call out the New Yorker for doing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term&quot;&gt;outstanding piece&lt;/a&gt; of journalism that tried to give us a sense of what a Trump presidency would be like. I think it is the single most valuable bit of writing in 2016 politics.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Dec 2016 19:03:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="PPS: It's hard to analyze a story in which you are a central character. You're likely to miss your own role.

				<outline text="I've almost pulled the trigger a few time on a public release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/15/demoOfPngwriter.html&quot;&gt;pngWriter&lt;/a&gt;, only to change my mind and be glad I did. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:10:01 GMT" />
				<outline text="I often release software too early. Later, when I realize that I need to change the software, after the initial release, there can be three big problems. " created="Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:10:02 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It might mean renaming, redesigning or removing a feature. Users are usually very unhappy about any of that. If I wait, I get to tweak the feature set and there are no users around to give me grief. And knowing that they're going to be unhappy makes me conservative, and ultimately hurts the product. And it stops being fun for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I might have to change the product in a way that makes the new version incompatible with previous versions. That means migrating the users, and these days that means doing it so they don't even know it's happening. Those &quot;corner turns&quot; can be complex, and require a lot of thought and work, and it's precarious. If there's a bug in the transition code, it shows up in awful ways. If there are no users, no migrations!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also, if I limit the initial user base to people I know will report problems if they see them, I get something back from having users. It's been really disappointing for me providing software for net users the last few years. You never hear from them except to tell you that you fucked up, even when they treated the software disrespectfully, sometimes &lt;i&gt;incredibly&lt;/i&gt; disrespectfully. People these days are often selfish, uncaring, rude, and demanding when it comes to software. Sometimes it's hard to see why I should ever release it, actually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" created="Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:10:03 GMT" />

That's one of the reasons I've made my pngWriter RSS feed &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/12/19/myPngwriterFeed.html&quot;&gt;public&lt;/a&gt;, so at least a hidden competitor can see how to be compatible, if they don't want to hold their users hostage.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:10:06 GMT" />

At one of these shows &quot;Dick&quot; had been given the space next to me. He always talked so loud that the people I talked to couldn't hear me.

I never liked him, but at times I thought of him as a &quot;friend,&quot; I guess because I didn't believe in myself enough to think that I deserved real friends who liked me and treated me well.

I said okay. " created="Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:34:17 GMT" />

I didn't know. I waited outside ten minutes in the cold, and under my heavy jacket I'm sweating, because I walked 40 minutes to get there. So, after ten minutes I get a text saying he'll be 15 minutes late (on top of the ten minutes he's already late). So I left. I took the subway home. 45 minutes after when we were supposed to meet, I got another text from him asking where I was. I ignored it. When I got home I unfriended him.
