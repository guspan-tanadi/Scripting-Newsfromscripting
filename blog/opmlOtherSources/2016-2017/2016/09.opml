				<outline text="Here's why." created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="First, if you put the two of them together, you'd have a great blogging surface. Medium handles linking, styles and titles. No podcasts, but that's the fourth item on the list for a reason. Most of my posts don't have podcasts attached. If there was one must-have feature I could live without that's the one (though giving up podcasting is giving up a huge win in interop). And Facebook handles updates, so if I make a change to a post after initially publishing it, those changes percolate to the Facebook version. So if you add the two together you get pretty close to the ideal." created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="But Facebook doesn't do links, styling, titles or podcasts. And Medium doesn't do updates." created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="I gave both a good shot, but the tradeoffs just aren't worth it." created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="It's true more people read my full posts on Facebook than click the link to read it on my blog. By a pretty wide margin. But the limits are confusing my writing. My reason for writing is not just engagement, but also to get mind-to-mind connections. And my mind is confused when I write for this hybrid medium, and my blog suffers. I suffer. I'm more confused, and that's not a good thing.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:22 GMT" />
				<outline text="And Medium is published-and-done. I end up either manually updating the posts, or I put up with incomplete or inaccurate writing on Medium. It might be worth it to maintain two versions manually, if I was getting engagement on Medium, but there are very few comments or readers there. I think I've given it fair shot of most of a year. If it hasn't started happening yet, I figure it isn't going to happen.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="I'm back to posting links on Facebook, as I do on Twitter. And I'm thinking about posting links to Medium, so people who have been reading me there have a way of knowing when I've written a new post." created="Sun, 04 Sep 2016 16:20:24 GMT" />

He's the first billionaire to run for President. Or so he says. Let's see if he's telling the truth. There's so much at stake, and I think he's wrong, people very much do care about who he's in debt to and who he's in business with. What are his conflicts of interest?&amp;nbsp;

				<outline text="I was just reminded why I went with Harvard as the place where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt; resides permanently. And why the further work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html&quot;&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt;, resulting a great new medium in the last few years, happened there as well.&amp;nbsp;Harvard deserves a lot of credit for enabling that. " created="Tue, 06 Sep 2016 15:41:07 GMT" />
				<outline text="So why did I push so hard to do the work at Harvard, instead of MIT which would seem a more straightforward choice? The two universities, at opposite ends of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Avenue_(metropolitan_Boston)&quot;&gt;Mass Ave&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge have great reps, but at opposite ends of the spectrum between engineering and the humanities." created="Tue, 06 Sep 2016 15:41:08 GMT" />
				<outline text="I've always believed that it was the human side of technology that had the greatest potential. When I was coming up in the 70s and 80s this was a contrarian view. So in 2003 when RSS needed a home to cement it as a standard, I chose the Cambridge university with the stronger rep as a place to be human as opposed to being a nerd. Not that the two are in any way exclusive. My point was, that through the technology we were working on, they would become the same thing." created="Tue, 06 Sep 2016 15:41:09 GMT" />
				<outline text="I guess the disadvantage of going the contrarian route is that it isn't so intuitive to the people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; today that the university should have played such a great role at the leading edge of technology thirteen years ago.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 06 Sep 2016 15:41:10 GMT" />

				<outline text="First, false equivalence is the smaller of two issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;The larger issue is that the many scandals of the Trump candidacy are going unreported.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The concern is that he will be elected and the scandals will only be investigated after it's too late, after we're committed to four years Trump as president. For example...&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:02 GMT" />
				<outline text="He has a special relationship with Russia. What is it based on? And what might this mean for a Trump presidency. &amp;nbsp;How might it affect our relationships with our allies? We've never, as far as I know, had a president with such a large potential conflict of interest. Or have we? Again something I would expect the NYT to cover in great detail.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:03 GMT" />
				<outline text="The tax returns. What other conflicts would they uncover? Is there any chance the tax returns will leak?" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:04 GMT" />
				<outline text="The voters he attracts. Hillary calls them the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=basket+of+deplorables&quot;&gt;basket of deplorables&lt;/a&gt;. Who are they? What are we learning about our own country?" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:05 GMT" />
				<outline text="The threats to free speech. He's litigious as a private citizen. How will he use the power of the presidency to further limit free speech?" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:06 GMT" />
				<outline text="His love of authoritarianism. When he praises Putin he reveals a streak of what some would call fascism. Is it real? How will this affect Americans' lives?&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:07 GMT" />
				<outline text="Conflicts with other Republicans in government. What might Speaker Ryan do, assuming Republicans retain a majority in the House. Senate Majority Leader McConnell? Will there be a purge in the Republican Party? What do your sources say?" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:08 GMT" />
				<outline text="His connection with the KKK and other white supremacist groups. He's never denied that they exist, and he has been challenged on this topic. It's fair game." created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:09 GMT" />
				<outline text="Trump is like a minor league pitcher in the majors who has a real chance of winning the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award&quot;&gt;Cy Young award&lt;/a&gt; because the batters he faces refuse to swing at his slow fat pitches. Why? Almost any pitch he throws could be a home run. Why do you take the strikes? What are we supposed to think about the NYT?&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:10 GMT" />
				<outline text="All of this is totally independent of Hillary Clinton's candidacy, which is why false equivalence is a distraction from the core issue: Trump's many problems as a potential President. Spayd is putting the cart before the horse, confusing the cause with the effect. For me, it's not at all partisan. I am voting for Clinton &lt;i&gt;because of the problems with Trump's candidacy&lt;/i&gt; as well as my belief that she would make a good President. If it were the other way around, I would vote Republican, as I have many times.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:11 GMT" />
				<outline text="So the assumption that this is partisan is beneath the NYT. It's insulting, shows disrespect for their readers, and is logically incorrect. And it skirts the issue. Why is the NYT not doing a much more thorough job of vetting Donald Trump as a candidate for President?" created="Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:01:12 GMT" />

				<outline text="Then, holding the lids open, put the lens on the eye. Apply light pressure. Hold it there for a moment. Then lift the finger away from the eye, keeping the lids open. Pause. Be sure the lens isn't on your finger. If it's not on the finger, it's almost certainly on the eye. The lens sticks to the eye without much pressure. &amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 20 Sep 2016 16:35:50 GMT" />
				<outline text="Take a breath or two and then let go of the lids. Blink a few times. If you have good vision in that eye, the lens is in. Otherwise look around on the eyelid.

In software I call these &quot;base of the spine&quot; operations. They have gone from intellectual puzzles to instinct.

				<outline text="Thanks to Frank Leahy, I believe I now understand what's causing the persistent but intermittent Node.js fs.writeFile problem, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/09/27/aPersistentButIntermittentNodejsFswritefileProblem.html&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; earlier." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:31 GMT" />
				<outline text="Here's the story..." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:32 GMT" />
				<outline text="fs.writeFile is not an indivisible operation. It makes lower-level filesystem calls each of which is asynchronous. That's cool, usually -- unless for some reason that a request to write the same file comes in while it already has one outstanding. Then havoc can ensue as explained in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/4965&quot;&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; on a Node.js developer site." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:33 GMT" />
				<outline text="appPrefs.json is probably the most written-to file in an app built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodeStorage&lt;/a&gt;. It's where the state of the user's system is stored. So every keystroke when editing, if the app saves your writing automatically, could result in a write to appPrefs.json. But here's an important constraint, the write can't occur more often than once a second. So if you type three keystrokes in a second, that will just generate one write, not three. And in most apps it's not even that frequent, usually there's a max of three seconds. But in some apps there is no max. So once a second writes will happen." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:34 GMT" />
				<outline text="But add to that the time it takes for the message to be sent to the server, and intuitively it seems that the two writes can't interfere with each other.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:35 GMT" />
				<outline text="But.." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:36 GMT" />
				<outline text="What if the machine is busy. What if there are a lot of users all writing at the same time. What if who knows what else determines the time it takes for a write to complete." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:37 GMT" />
				<outline text="And if one write should happen to be triggered while the previous one hasn't completed, the file could get garbled. It says so in that note, and it explains why, convincingly." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:38 GMT" />
				<outline text="And..." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:39 GMT" />
				<outline text="The file doesn't get screwed up very often. It happens rarely and only seems to happen with appPrefs.json, the most often-written file.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:40 GMT" />
				<outline text="So..." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:41 GMT" />
				<outline text="Here's the change I made." created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="When I start to write a file, I add the path to the file in a JavaScript object named &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/lib/filesystem.js#L202&quot;&gt;filesCurrentlyBeingWritten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. When the write completes I remove the path. And before I start the write I check to see if the file is already being written, and if so, I simply call it an error. The important thing is I don't begin a second write.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:43 GMT" />

				<outline text="This way the user might not get his or her appPrefs.json file updated this one time, but it won't get corrupted. No havoc. It seems unlikely anyone would even notice, because it's probably just text being saved against a different (also unlikely) app failure. In any case, losing a little data is vastly preferable to losing it all. ;-)" created="Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:04:45 GMT" />

NYC drivers are impatient enough when you're in your own lane, but when you're in theirs, even if it's because a car or truck is using the bike lane, well tough shit bike rider, some car drivers are not very understanding.

				<outline text="Repubs decided a long time ago that they could maneuver conventional wisdom as far as they want to their liking using the press.

				<outline text="Jay said something very Ward-like at the end of his piece.&lt;blockquote&gt;Here's the bigger lesson. A real, living democracy draws on the talents of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of its citizens. Problems in press coverage are not &quot;owned&quot; by journalists or people like me who study journalism. Contributions can come from anywhere. That's the way I see it, and that's the way Ward Cunningham saw it. Everyone has a stake in this election.

When Bill Clinton was in the Rose Garden giving another apology, this time after his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/senate-acquits-president-bill-clinton-1999-article-1.2109502&quot;&gt;acquittal&lt;/a&gt; by the Senate, a historic and dramatic scene, she was upstairs in a conference room with aides, and a map of New York State spread out, planning her own life &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/06/04/senate.2000/hrc.senate/&quot;&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; of Bill. And we're coming up to the season finale of the story that started that day.
