				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;1. The Clinton emails show a Secretary of State interacting with other people in the way of people who run large organizations do. There's nothing surprising there. It's exactly what you would expect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 01 Nov 2016 13:04:30 GMT" />
				<outline text="2. Clinton ran her own email server, as did the two previous Secretaries of States, both Republicans, neither of whom were investigated by Congress." created="Tue, 01 Nov 2016 13:04:31 GMT" />
				<outline text="3. Whether or not you blame her for the deaths of four diplomats in Benghazi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErlDSJHRVMA&quot;&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican Secretary of State in 2003, is responsible for &lt;i&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/i&gt; of deaths when he told the United Nations and the American people that Iraq had &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction&quot;&gt;WMDs&lt;/a&gt;, thereby forming the basis for the war in Iraq. At the outset, not only did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2016/02/hillary_clinton_told_the_truth_about_her_iraq_war_vote.html&quot;&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt; believe him, I did too. Most of us did, with reservations. When a high-ranking officer of your country says a war-starting country like Iraq has nuclear weapons, what choice do you have but to believe him? (BTW, this is one of the reasons we're so concerned about Trump as president, we would have no choice but to live with the consequences of him going to war as well.) Many hundreds of thousands of people died as result of Powell's lies. I hold him accountable even if the Republicans don't.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 01 Nov 2016 13:04:32 GMT" />
				<outline text="4. I don't know if she destroyed emails, I've only ever heard Trump say that, not anyone else, and I don't think Trump ever tells the truth (or if he does it's the same way a broken clock is correct twice a day). But I remember when the Republicans were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy&quot;&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; deleting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/g-w-bush-lost-22-million-e-mails/&quot;&gt;22 million&lt;/a&gt; very relevant emails, having to do with firings of US Attorneys covering up for some horrible crimes committed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegelman#Karl_Rove_connection&quot;&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;, political director at the Bush White House. We knew about it, but it didn't make headlines. And the entire White House was using a private email server for emails they didn't want to be evidence in an investigation that clearly should have happened but didn't." created="Tue, 01 Nov 2016 13:04:33 GMT" />
				<outline text="The &quot;email scandal&quot; was manufactured by Republicans to try to win the election. If she hadn't run for president I am sure there would be no FBI investigation. They have convinced Comey I guess that they can make him part of the scandal unless he bends over to do their bidding, which he has done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;One party is willing to do any damage to the country to get their way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 01 Nov 2016 13:04:34 GMT" />
				<outline text="I would love to see Comey get up, after the election (for now he should STFU and let us try to have an election without the interference of the FBI) and admit he was wrong, and reaffirm that the FBI is non-partisan. After that we have to do something to reign in the Republicans, so they start acting in the interests of the country." created="Tue, 01 Nov 2016 13:04:35 GMT" />

				<outline text="I was driving from Seattle to Palo Alto on the day after &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/11/02.html&quot;&gt;Election Day&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. I was going to run the third BloggerCon at Stanford. I had taken up residence in Seattle, so I would have a meaningful vote. Washington was a swing state that year." created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 15:17:41 GMT" />
				<outline text="I was driving through the mountains when the results were coming in, bad radio reception, so I didn't know what had happened until I checked into a dim motel in Medford&amp;nbsp;and watched in disgust, awe, fear, etc that my fellow Americans had voted for another four years of war. I couldn't believe, given a choice we had signed up for more of that. But we did." created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 15:17:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.podcatch.com/manila/gems/un/cnNov3.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2004/11/03.html&quot;&gt;next morning&lt;/a&gt;, in my car, as I did in those days. The actual MP3 is lost to me (maybe someone has a copy? -- it was found!) but I remember what I said. We have to figure out what the Bush voters are saying. They have something to say and it's not making sense to me. It can't be they want this war to go on. [The war was immoral, imho -- we paid for it with debt, not taxes, and there was no draft, so the pain of war was not felt by those who could afford to keep their kids out of the military. And by now we know the foundation of the war, that there were WMDs in Iraq, was a lie.]" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 15:17:43 GMT" />
				<outline text="And sure enough we paid the price in the financial collapse of 2008. And the moral collapse we're experiencing now full-force in 2016. Thing is, the collapse was well under way in 2004, and of course earlier. But we kept on going as if nothing happened. When we elected Obama in 2008, I remember thinking I can afford to look away now, it's going to get under control. And it did, for a couple of years. But the problem didn't go away, it got deeper and more organized. Opportunists arose to feed it and off it.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 15:17:44 GMT" />
				<outline text="So the question is, fellow elite coastal intellectual types, if we dodge the bullet this time, are we going to tune out again, only to wait for the next stronger version of the wave, or are we going to find out what the people in the country want, and try to negotiate? Climate change may not be the biggest threat as we all thought it was. The war that our fellow Americans want may kill us first." created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 15:17:45 GMT" />

			<outline text="Does Microsoft interop with Slack?" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:33 GMT" type="outline" >
				<outline text="Microsoft's strategy of Embrace and Extend is well-documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=site%3Ascripting.com%20%22embrace%20and%20extend%22&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of this blog. It's how a second or third entrant in a market gains access to the users of the earlier products (embrace) and how, once they've become the leader, they take users with them without sharing them with competitors (extend). This approach really worked for them in the 80s and 90s. But then they lost their hunger, and the tables got turned on them in subsequent decades.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:34 GMT" />
				<outline text="So now they've shipped a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techmeme.com/161102/p16#a161102p16&quot;&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; clearly aimed at Slack, which has become a juggernaut largely by being a backplane for bot-like apps. Slack, as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?q=site%3Ascripting.com%20slack#safe=off&amp;amp;q=site:scripting.com+slack&quot;&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; here in the summer of 2015, got there by having a wonderfully open and web-like API. They are to be commended for this." created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:35 GMT" />
				<outline text="So the big question for Microsoft and for the future of the market is this: Do they interop with Slack? Can I use the Microsoft client without forcing my teammates to adopt it? Can they continue to use Slack while I use Microsoft? If so, they will certainly gain a user base.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:36 GMT" />
				<outline text="And, if they interop, then Microsoft is returning to a playbook that worked for them once, and (my belief) probably would work again." created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:37 GMT" />
				<outline text="A lower level of interop would be the ability to run Slack-compatible apps. That would mean they wouldn't have to be rewritten to work in Microsoft's new environment. That means more utility for users. But it's more work for Microsoft.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:38 GMT" />
				<outline text="BTW, the Microsoft of the 2000s would have considered this a silly question. We're Microsoft, people interop with us, not vice versa. That didn't work very well. Humility is a good trait, even for market-dominant giants.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:20:39 GMT" />

I tried to remember how I felt in 1969 and 1986, but it wasn't the same thing. In 1969, I was too young to understand that the world wasn't magical that way. It just seemed the way it should be, that the Mets go from being the worst team ever to winning the World Series, in a few short years. And in 1986 I was in Calif, and busy with my company, and while I did get to share it with other Mets fans, I couldn't focus on it for more than a day or two. And while 1986 was as much of a miracle as 1969, the Mets never had a drought anything like the one the Cubs just broke." created="Thu, 03 Nov 2016 15:12:39 GMT" />

				<outline text="It's been four days since I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/02/doesMicrosoftInteropWithSlack.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; asking whether Microsoft Teams interops with Slack. What little I've heard indicates that it doesn't, that there is no meaningful interop." created="Sun, 06 Nov 2016 14:32:40 GMT" />
				<outline text="Microsoft has clearly positioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software&quot;&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt; as a Slack-alike or Slack-killer. Maybe they don't use those words, but the message comes through anyway. They want their product to be compared to Slack. And Slack has taken the bait, running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://slackhq.com/dear-microsoft-8d20965d2849#.g2xloywek&quot;&gt;full-page ad&lt;/a&gt; in the NY Times that's similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/11/06/applead.jpg&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; Apple ran when the IBM PC shipped in 1981. I'm sure that's what they were thinking of. Really bad idea, imho. Why? Because Microsoft has to earn the right to say they're competitive with Slack. And since Slack is more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/08/20/iWouldLoveAnOpenSourceSlackClone.html&quot;&gt;backplane&lt;/a&gt; than an app, if you don't interop with it, well you've kind of missed the point of Slack. It's all about interop." created="Sun, 06 Nov 2016 14:32:41 GMT" />
				<outline text="The old Microsoft, the one I knew in the 80s and 90s not would have missed this. They would have &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/05/23/embraceextend.html&quot;&gt;latched&lt;/a&gt; onto every bit of openness in Slack. At the outset, advertise how it's not either-or, it's &lt;i&gt;and.&lt;/i&gt; Your team members can use either Slack or Teams to participate in a formerly Slack-only network. That would have been a reason for Slack to run the full-page ad, maybe. Or sell out to a bigger company quickly so they can match Microsoft with distribution and financial strength.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 06 Nov 2016 14:32:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="And it's important to note that if Microsoft had chosen the embrace-extend model, that would have been a win for the open web, at least a temporary one, which is another reason I asked the question. It takes a second vendor to ratify Slack's open protocol to give them a real chance of being a standard. Support from Microsoft would have certainly helped.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 06 Nov 2016 14:32:43 GMT" />
				<outline text="Since I haven't heard from either company a definitive yes or no, the possibility is still there that Microsoft did chose the interop path." created="Sun, 06 Nov 2016 14:32:44 GMT" />
				<outline text="BTW, the victory is only temporary for the open web if neither company dominates, esp not the bigger one, Microsoft. If they do, they're likely to use their power in the market to add special features that only work in their product. So it's in the interest of the market that it be a two-party system.

The best I could come up with is this: The world is basically always tottering on the edge of catastrophe. Sometimes you can see it, other times it's hidden. Clearly the last few years have been a lot more dangerous than we've appreciated. So the best thing to do is to do the most good you can, for others and for yourself, and enjoy life the best you can.

				<outline text="The voters of Indiana similarly rejected Evan Bayh, an ex-Senator of theirs.

				<outline text="Second thought, and this really shook me -- I voted for George W. Bush in 2000 for the very same reason. I was exhausted by eight years of Clinton. As much as the scandals were Republican inventions, the way Clinton handled it really pissed me off. And the lack of respect for the institution of the Presidency. The image of him getting a blow job in the Oval Office was something I would expect to read in Penthouse letters, not in the Washington Post and the New York Times.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 14:00:18 GMT" />
				<outline text="I know HIllary is not Bill, that's why I was a fervent supporter of hers, but I know the feeling. It wasn't just the Lewinsky affair and the lies about it that got me, it was also his signing of the Communication Decency Act. The willingness to cut corners, to stand for nothing. So I voted for Bush, and lived to regret it. By 2004, I was working for Kerry.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 14:00:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="If I had to do it over again, there's no question that I would vote for Al Gore. These kinds of tradeoffs are no good.

That's how you get presidents like Bush and now Trump." created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 14:00:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="What will happen now? A lot of sleazy awful people will be leading our country. I thought we were done with all the Trump surrogates, but it's just beginning. Now MSNBC won't have a choice but to give them airtime, they will be the executive branch of the United States. But they had a choice the last few months. They could have devoted time on each show to getting expert opinions on what a Trump presidency would be like. Might have shaken a few of the third-party voters into voting for Hillary and we'd be facing a different, better reality this morning. Even if it didn't, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-had-one-job&quot;&gt;they say&lt;/a&gt;, you had one job to do and you didn't do it. The journalist's job, as they seem to have forgotten, is to provide their users with information about the events of the day. That doesn't just include the salacious and mockable rantings of a TV reality star playing the part of presidential candidate, they must give a voice to and represent the interests of the people who would be governed by such a person. They did not in any way do that.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 14:00:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="I think this is the final straw, the one that finally broke the back of American journalism. They really did this number on us. They could have made sure the Comey letter didn't get the play it didn't deserve. Didn't make it out to be what it obviously was, a small part of the government putting its finger on the scale for one candidate. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; was the story, and that clearly was the turning point for the campaign. Hillary didn't run a great campaign, but it was starting to get great. Instead all the energy transferred to Trump.

				<outline text="1. Sullivan says we won't be able to deprive Trump of Congress for four years, but technically that's not true. There will be midterm elections in 2018, and 1/3 of the Senate and all of the House will be up.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 10 Nov 2016 12:33:27 GMT" />

				<outline text="He can repeal ObamaCare by getting rid of the worst parts (so he will say) and replace it with &lt;i&gt;TrumpCare&lt;/i&gt; which contains just the good parts.

				<outline text="I agree with the scenario that Sullivan describes. There will be a terror attack. A &lt;i&gt;Black Lives Matter&lt;/i&gt; protest will turn violent. Order will need to be restored. This is predictable. And he's right that the only hope is to protect the courts, and hope the police and military stand up for the Constitution.

				<outline text="But, on the other side, I think at least some people who voted for Trump either feel the same remorse now, or will soon.

				<outline text="First, go listen to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Gregg-Popovich-uncensored-Discusses-the-10609311.php?cmpid=twitter-desktop&quot;&gt;audio interview&lt;/a&gt; with NBA coach Gregg Popovich.

				<outline text="Conventional wisdom tells us that the electoral college requires that the person who lost the popular vote this year must nonetheless become our president. That view is an insult to our framers. It is compelled by nothing in our Constitution. It should be rejected by anyone with any understanding of our democratic traditions  — most important, the electors themselves." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:22 GMT" />
				<outline text="The framers believed, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp&quot;&gt;Alexander Hamilton put it&lt;/a&gt;, that “the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the [president].” But no nation had ever tried that idea before. So the framers created a safety valve on the people’s choice. Like a judge reviewing a jury verdict, where the people voted, the electoral college was intended to confirm — or not — the people’s choice. Electors were to apply, in Hamilton’s words, “a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice” — and then decide. The Constitution says nothing about “winner take all.” It says nothing to suggest that electors’ freedom should be constrained in any way. Instead, their wisdom — about whether to overrule “the people” or not — was to be free of political control yet guided by democratic values. They were to be citizens exercising judgment,  not cogs turning a wheel." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="Many think we should abolish the electoral college. I’m not convinced that we should. Properly understood, the electors can serve an important function. What if the people elect a Manchurian candidate? Or a child rapist? What if evidence of massive fraud pervades a close election? It is a useful thing to have a body confirm the results of a democratic election — so long as that body exercises its power reflectively and conservatively. Rarely — if ever — should it veto the people’s choice. And if it does, it needs a very good reason." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:24 GMT" />
				<outline text="So, do the electors in 2016 have such a reason?" created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:25 GMT" />
				<outline text="Only twice in our past has the electoral college selected a president against the will of the people — once in the 19th century and once on the cusp of the 21st. (In 1824, it was Congress that decided the election for John Quincy Adams; likewise in 1876, it was Congress that gave disputed electoral college votes to Rutherford B. Hayes.)" created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:26 GMT" />
				<outline text="In 1888, Benjamin Harrison lost the popular vote to Grover Cleveland but won in the electoral college, only because Boss Tweed’s Tammany Hall turned New York away from the reformer Cleveland (by fewer than 15,000 votes). In 2000, George W. Bush lost the popular vote by a tiny fraction — half a percent — and beat Al Gore in the electoral college by an equally small margin — less than 1 percent." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:27 GMT" />
				<outline text="In both cases, the result violated what has become one of the most important principles governing our democracy — one person, one vote. In both cases, the votes of some weighed much more heavily than the votes of others. Today, the vote of a citizen in Wyoming is four times as powerful as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://votes.equalcitizens.us/&quot;&gt;vote of a citizen&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan. The vote of a citizen in Vermont is three times as powerful as a vote in Missouri. This denies Americans the fundamental value of a representative democracy — equal citizenship. Yet nothing in our Constitution compels this result." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:28 GMT" />
				<outline text="Instead, if the electoral college is to control who becomes our president, we should take it seriously by understanding its purpose precisely. It is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people. It is meant to be a circuit breaker — just in case the people go crazy." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:29 GMT" />
				<outline text="In this election, the people did not go crazy. The winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation. Like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. Choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people." created="Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:20:30 GMT" />
