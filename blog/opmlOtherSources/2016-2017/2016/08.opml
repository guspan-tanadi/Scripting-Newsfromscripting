My family rode bikes everywhere. We used no paper products. And the film got quite a lot of attention. I wasn’t used to the success. I’d written two history books before then. And they were good books, but they didn’t have much of a readership. Now all of the sudden I was being interviewed, and celebrated, and invited on Good Morning America. And then people started attacking me. Gawker wrote several articles calling me self-righteous, and an opportunist, and said I was imposing my values on my family. People said I didn’t care about the environment and only wanted to make money. And all the attention really caused a crisis for me. For the first time, I had a personhood that was completely different than my person. And that was exhausting. When someone called me a hero, I wanted to prove them right. When someone called me a devil, I wanted to prove them wrong. It took a lot of self-examination to realize that I was neither. There is a fullness to a person that is gigantic and nuanced and indefinable. It was equally impossible to be a hero or a devil. I couldn’t be contained by a single word.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Tue, 02 Aug 2016 16:49:35 GMT" />

				<outline text="Well, after much difficulty I have learned how to put a contact lens into my eye. I know that sounds weird, but I only need correction in one eye, the other has already been fitted with an artificial lens. This has been a huge problem because with glasses, I have really awful vision because it's impossible to correct this situation with glasses, without lots of distortion and double-vision. Hence the contact lens." created="Thu, 04 Aug 2016 14:26:35 GMT" />
				<outline text="It took a lot of lessons from a very patient teacher to get me to be able to do it. I can. A feeling of accomplishment." created="Thu, 04 Aug 2016 14:26:36 GMT" />
				<outline text="So I have to wear reading glasses to be able to read the computer screen. And they don't work very well, so what I'm seeing as I write this is very blurry and varies a lot as I move my head. I suspect I have the wrong reading glass strength. What strength do I have? I can't read the glasses without the glasses. &lt;i&gt;Arrrrrgh!&lt;/i&gt;" created="Thu, 04 Aug 2016 14:26:37 GMT" />

				<outline text="Eventually I will have to get the artificial lens in the other eye, and then presumably my vision will go back to being fully correct without any contact lenses or glasses. But that operation will be risky, for reasons I don't want to go into at this time. So it has to be put off as long as possible. One thing I've learned from this whole experience is to avoid surgery whenever possible. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease!&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 04 Aug 2016 14:26:39 GMT" />

				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;I'm friends with Walt Mossberg and Larry Magid on Facebook. Both are accomplished journalists who I have known through their work for decades and have enormous respect for. This isn't about them, rather it's about how journalists try to maintain neutrality when faced with a candidate who lies openly and admittedly in bold and dangerous ways.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:10:21 GMT" />

				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;There's truth and journalism truth. When Trump calls for the assassination of his opponent journalism runs out of words to say what he just did. I was thinking of collecting the various descriptions, just to show you guys how ridiculous it has become. It's a mishmash of attribution and qualification.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:10:23 GMT" />
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;Why can't journalism make a direct and true statement: The candidate called for the assassination of his opponent after he loses the election. That's what actually happened. Or, at least put someone on a panel who can say that. All the sources are as conflicted by the rules of their own trade that prevent them from saying what's obvious to every adult watching or reading.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:10:24 GMT" />

				<outline text="The reporting, to users, and I'm a serious user of news, has little or no value. If you were relying on a journalist's description of Trump and didn't hear his actual words, you wouldn't be able to make sense of it.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:10:26 GMT" />
				<outline text="I wonder if journalist ethics aren't obsolete at this point, and if they haven't been obsolete for a long time, and if that is what got us into this mess. All the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence&quot;&gt;false equivalence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/public-editor/16pubed.html&quot;&gt;he-said-she-said reporting&lt;/a&gt; has gotten us to a place where an objective reporter &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; maintains that &quot;they both do it.&quot; You see that everywhere, if somehow the scale of Hillary's dishonesty is in any way comparable to Trump's. Adult to adult, it's not. And the journalist's &lt;a href=&quot;http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/&quot;&gt;view from nowhere&lt;/a&gt; has always been dysfunctional, but now it's so far from reality that it's like the emperor with no clothes.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:10:27 GMT" />

				<outline text="I am voting for Hillary and contribute to her campaign. But my complaint about the press is very similar to Trump's. I never have felt you guys gave me a chance Walt. I stopped worrying about it in 1994 when I found that I could communicate directly with users, without going through the press. I was very effective that way, far more effective than I had been by hiring PR people and going through the tech press, which always thought I was somehow incompetent or insignificant. My competitors, the biggest tech companies, used the press. We still were able to gain traction with blogging, RSS and podcasting, without the press support. I still read your stuff, always have, Walt, but I think your view of the world has been proven incomplete, and that proof has been out there for a decade or more now. You're still not accepting it, when it's risen to the point of a presidential candidate circumventing all the gatekeepers." created="Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:10:31 GMT" />

				<outline text="First, I should say, and as will be obvious in the podcast, I have history with Tim. He was one of the original designers of XML, and I was working in XML starting in the late 90s and extending into the mid-00s. Tim was also one of the authors of the Atom spec, which was an attempt to replace RSS. My software supports both formats, but I was skeptical of the need to replace RSS. I felt that the people who were behind Atom didn't understand what RSS was being used for, or how widely deployed it was, and how unlikely it was that it would be replaced." created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 15:27:19 GMT" />
				<outline text="Now Tim wants to change JSON. I first heard about it in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/08/20/Fixing-JSON&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; of his. I knew I'd be seeing Allen in Portland, and since he has been involved in JavaScript for quite some time, I asked him what he thought of Tim's post. He said there's a story behind it. And that's what we discuss in this podcast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;" created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 15:27:20 GMT" />
				<outline text="Along the way we get a lot of interesting tidbits about how JavaScript and JSON evolved.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 15:27:21 GMT" />
				<outline text="Allen was the author of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/&quot;&gt;Ecmascript 6 spec&lt;/a&gt;, and has been a longtime language developer at Microsoft and Mozilla. It was Allen's idea to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/20/podcastWardCunningham.html&quot;&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; and myself together last year in Portland.

				<outline text="In Seattle, I spent a day with Brent and Sheila Simmons, two longtime friends. Brent and I worked together at UserLand. He's also an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/&quot;&gt;writer&lt;/a&gt;. His interest in blogging stemmed from his literate side, which made him an excellent web developer imho. Making software for yourself is a path to success.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 16:07:42 GMT" />
				<outline text="And in Portland I met with Ward Cunningham. We went bike riding in 100 degree heat, all over town, saw the sights, and talked software philosophy. We share the same basic values. It's amazing to meet someone like that. I regret that we didn't hook up 20 years ago. But maybe we each had to finish our work on our respective ideas -- mine which is blogging and his of course is the wiki." created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 16:07:43 GMT" />
				<outline text="In Brent's and my world, writing is episodic, chronological. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is what I wrote on August 23, 2016. And then there's what I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/1999/08/23.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on August 23. 1999. And almost every other day in between.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 16:07:44 GMT" />
				<outline text="Whereas in Ward's world, there's the writing about a topic, say &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Antarctica&quot;&gt;The Wildlife of Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_career_home_run_leaders&quot;&gt;Home Run Leaders in Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;. Chronology is an attribute of each bit on a page, but it is not the structure of the site as it is on a blog." created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 16:07:45 GMT" />
				<outline text="Thing is, I yearn for what Ward's world has. I'm so frustrated that my blogging doesn't have a concordance of all that I think on this topic or that. I repeat themes here all the time. And my memory is not very good. At times I can read things I wrote and published and have no recollection of writing them. Sometimes I even have trouble &lt;i&gt;understanding&lt;/i&gt; them!&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 16:07:46 GMT" />

				<outline text="One of the things I said repeatedly at the Portland meetup: &lt;i&gt;It's All About People. &lt;/i&gt;I said it because this is something we don't always remember in Nerdland.

It's legal to do this in the US, but until now as far as I know, no one has crossed this line. Now that the line has been crossed, it's fair to assume it will become standard practice for billionaires like Thiel to finance &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/768107982529912832&quot;&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; until the publication loses and has to sell itself to pay the judgment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webat25.org/&quot;&gt;25th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of the Web because 25 years ago a generous visionary named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; invented something that would benefit humanity more than it would benefit him. And many other visionaries saw it, and because it was open, were able to build anything they could imagine using it as a basis. And they did, making something like Facebook possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook is a silo for web writing. And while it would be easy for them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html&quot;&gt;create paths&lt;/a&gt; for ideas to flow in and out of Facebook, at very low cost, and they have the features already developed, and use them internally, they refuse to share them with users. I suppose we could just explain this as they're a very large tech company and that's what tech companies do, but they also have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah&quot;&gt;chutzpah&lt;/a&gt; to pretend to support the open web. They have been happy to accept its bounty and have done nothing to return what they've taken from the commons to the commons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And finally, remember Peter Thiel, the guy&amp;nbsp;who thinks his wealth entitles him to shut down publications he doesn't like, not only did he make billions &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel#Facebook&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; Facebook stock, &lt;i&gt;he's &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-votes-to-keep-peter-thiel-on-facebook-b-1782276509&quot;&gt;still&lt;/a&gt; on the board of Facebook. &lt;/i&gt;Zuckerberg has had plenty of time to ask him to leave, or to fire him, and he hasn't done it. Again, you could just shrug it off and say Zuck is like Thiel, but he's extra special in that he wants you to believe he appreciates the gift of the open web, as he strangles it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" created="Tue, 23 Aug 2016 17:32:38 GMT" />

				<outline text="The Clinton person gives a decent answer, she's done 300 interviews this year. And there have been plenty of gotchas and fake controversies. That's why reporters want to interview her. To help perpetuate the idea that she can't be trusted and won't give a straight answer. Which is both ridiculous and not news. She does answer the questions, answers that they would be delighted to get from her opponent, who rarely answers any of their questions, when they can get an interview, and these days he won't even be interviewed by any reporter, unless you count Fox News people as reporters (they're more like PR people or campaign flacks)." created="Thu, 25 Aug 2016 18:54:43 GMT" />

				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;As a voter I watch this and see the press as even more of the enemy than Trump. We may dodge this bullet, but will they cover the next one and the one after that?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Tue, 30 Aug 2016 14:49:28 GMT" />

				<outline text="Let's go to a baseball game, or a football game or basketball, it doesn't matter, and when they play the national anthem, with great love of country, stay seated in a moment of reflection on what makes our country so great.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:13:35 GMT" />
				<outline text="The US was established without a standing army. We didn't have a standing army until after World War II. This was intentional. We were meant to be self-governing, and we were meant to fight for the country only when the country needed an army. &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; were to be the militia, not professional soldiers.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:13:36 GMT" />
				<outline text="I've always been scared to do this on my own. That a young man decided to stand up for his country by remaining seated, that's a great act of courage, and the people who condemn him are cowards.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:13:37 GMT" />
