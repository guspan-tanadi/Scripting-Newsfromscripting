The reason, he says, is he's black.</p><p>My two cents...</p><p>I don't think any of us have the luxury. We just don't know what a Trump presidency would bring.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally I don't think he'd ever take office, even if he wins. I think there would be a coup first.&nbsp;<span>I don't think the oligarchs who really run this place would ever let him run the military and the economy. They may be greedy bastards, but they're not stupid.&nbsp;</span></p><p>And in a police state even privileged white people are not safe. But we are safer than we'd be with a loose cannon like Trump in the White House. It would be the right choice, but an awful one.</p><p>And blacks would have it worse, for sure. But I'm not so sure Jews wouldn't be in trouble too. And of course Muslims and Hispanics. No matter how you try to think it through, it wouldn't be America anymore. It would be Crazy Fucked Up Land, <i>for everyone.&nbsp;</i></p><p>BTW, sometime before there was the coup, the stock market would crash.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr McKinnon is just being a responsible citizen and parent. Someone who thinks they have the luxury to experiment with our form of government, are not only very wrong, they are very selfish.</p>",

So why are <i>you</i> politicizing this poor family? When is it too much? Where is <i>your</i> line? (Any pretense that Hayes is not a Democrat is ridiculous.)</p><p>And then the two Khans were on Lawrence O'Donnell. They've been on news shows continually all weekend. I couldn't even watch the beginning of it. I wanted to tell them that it's time to stop talking publicly about Trump and his black soul. They said what had to be said. We understand. Let this whole thing die down now. To prolong this is to make a mockery of their pain and the memory of their son. It's time to regain perspective. Quiet things down. And then let's talk about all this in a week.</p><p>Because this election has gone far enough. Let's all be adults about this.</p><p>There are so many imbalances, they're trying to extract the most minute truth from Hillary about the emails yet we still haven't seen Trump's tax returns, and they're denying they put an exemption for Russian hostility re Ukraine in the Republican platform. That's so sinister. Trump has a lobbyist running his campaign and he's obviously manipulating Trump's inability to even govern his own campaign to manipulate the policy of the Republican Party. If it goes much further this will be happening to the government of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: <i>Trump cannot even govern his own campaign.</i></p><p>Father Khan's statement about rising above politics was very right. And the Democrats need to do it too now. We all need to step back and regain our perspective.</p><p>The Democrats need to sit down and negotiate with the Republican leadership in Congress. Privately. Come to some kind of agreement that allows many Republicans to vote for Clinton. Compromise now. Let's take this opportunity to really unify. Let the campaign run out. No debates. Trump can tour all he wants. It's over.</p><p>This really has gone far enough.</p>",

My family rode bikes everywhere. We used no paper products. And the film got quite a lot of attention. I wasn’t used to the success. I’d written two history books before then. And they were good books, but they didn’t have much of a readership. Now all of the sudden I was being interviewed, and celebrated, and invited on Good Morning America. And then people started attacking me. Gawker wrote several articles calling me self-righteous, and an opportunist, and said I was imposing my values on my family. People said I didn’t care about the environment and only wanted to make money. And all the attention really caused a crisis for me. For the first time, I had a personhood that was completely different than my person. And that was exhausting. When someone called me a hero, I wanted to prove them right. When someone called me a devil, I wanted to prove them wrong. It took a lot of self-examination to realize that I was neither. There is a fullness to a person that is gigantic and nuanced and indefinable. It was equally impossible to be a hero or a devil. I couldn’t be contained by a single word.”</blockquote><p>This is exactly what I concluded when I attained some fame and tried to understand how other people dealt with it. What they expected from me changed, and vice versa. I expected happiness, but what I found was disillusion. It isn't who I am, and I was never able to reconcile it. In the end all I ever wanted was to be loved and accepted for who I am. Fame is not a way to get that.&nbsp;</p>",

So let's get serious about this.</p><p>Maybe MSNBC will stop broadcasting his speeches at some point?&nbsp;His words are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_bites_dog_(journalism)\">no longer news</a>. Time to price that into the reporting and to stop letting him crowd out issues of his competence with the nonsense controversy of the day. It's a tactic that must stop working.

And you can start by cutting the Republican reps some slack. We need everyone working together to stop this. Including them. Let them speak openly on your show. Stop trying to box them into corners you know they can't go into at this time. It serves no purpose other than to shut them up. What's the point of that??</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>",

Didn't you say you were going to act as if he didn't exist?</p><p><span>Well, no -- I didn't say that he doesn't exist, unfortunately he does, and it would be ridiculous to pretend otherwise, and possibly dangerous. What I said was that I wouldn't be writing about the crazy shit he says and does because I understand that would crowd out other ideas that need to circulate. And because I learned from experience that what trolls value most is control. When he calls the shots he wins. Anything else is just fine. We need to know what we're up against.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For example, Trump is never on his own going to make an issue of his tax returns, yet that is a big issue.</span></p><p><span>Does he have a business relationship with Russia? If so, that needs to be discussed. And that's likely something he wouldn't bring up himself.</span></p><p><span>What do we learn from the Trump University trial?</span></p><p>Did his wife, Melania, enter the US <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/melania-trump-immigration-donald-226648\">illegally</a>?

I don't have the time or energy to read it myself, but I hope others do. Whatever is in that book is totally on-topic and potentially useful.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The only thing that's not productive, imho, is talking about the latest outrageous thing he said.

The way I like to do it is first we spend 1.5 hours or so in a classroom-style venue, a place where everyone can hear everyone else. We'll talk about writing for the web, generally. I'd like to talk specifically about the software I'm working on, <a href=\"http://1999.io/\">1999.io</a>, <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/\">LO2</a> and the various server snacks. I hope Ward will be there, and we can talk a bit about connecting our software, which is very important, and something we both believe in. We need a little leadership there, and it takes two to get the interop ball rolling.</p><p>After the meetup, let's go to dinner, for more focused conversation and imbibing. &nbsp;</p><p>Send me an email at dave.winer@gmail.com or a tweet at @davewiner, and I can get a sense of how many people want to participate. And if you have an idea for a venue that would be great. If the group is small enough we can meet in a park or a Starbuck's, but of course it would work better if we had a projector that I can hook my Mac up to.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward! :-)</p>",

I know that sounds weird, but I only need correction in one eye, the other has already been fitted with an artificial lens. This has been a huge problem because with glasses, I have really awful vision because it's impossible to correct this situation with glasses, without lots of distortion and double-vision. Hence the contact lens.</p><p>It took a lot of lessons from a very patient teacher to get me to be able to do it. I can. A feeling of accomplishment.</p><p>So I have to wear reading glasses to be able to read the computer screen. And they don't work very well, so what I'm seeing as I write this is very blurry and varies a lot as I move my head. I suspect I have the wrong reading glass strength. What strength do I have? I can't read the glasses without the glasses. <i>Arrrrrgh!</i></p><p>I remember when I was in fifth grade getting glasses for the first time. I loved them. I didn't know my vision needed correcting. So when I put the glasses on for the first time I saw all the details I didn't know the world had. I wish this experience were like that, but it's not.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually I will have to get the artificial lens in the other eye, and then presumably my vision will go back to being fully correct without any contact lenses or glasses. But that operation will be risky, for reasons I don't want to go into at this time. So it has to be put off as long as possible. One thing I've learned from this whole experience is to avoid surgery whenever possible. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease!&nbsp;</p><p>But I have nothing to complain about. When I go for my bike ride later, I'll be able to do it without glasses. That might be interesting!&nbsp;</p><p>PS: I'm not going to edit this piece. So you can see what my unedited writing is like. Hope there aren't too many confusing overly elaborate or typographically awkward sentences. (I know there are no misspellings, thanks to Chrome's built in spelling and grammar checker.)</p><p>PPS: For people who may be having trouble learning how to get the lens in your eye, the trick is keeping your eye fully open and learning to apply pressure to your eyeball with your finger. Up until this experience I had never touched my own eyeball. I hated the idea of it. Now it doesn't bother me one bit.&nbsp;</p><p>PPPS: I lied. I did a light edit on the piece. I am if anything an obsessive editor. ;-)</p><p>PPPPS: The big diff -- peripheral vision! Makes a huge difference when biking.</p>",

He was 48 and died while surfing. Sounds like a heart attack.</p><p>I've found it's impossible when hearing of someone dying, no matter how close they were to me, to experience it in any way other than how it relates to me. When my grandmother died it was the realization that I'd never see her again. When my uncle died, it was how close in age he was to me, and of course that a lifelong friend was gone forever. (I am now older than he was when he died.)</p><p>I was 47 when I had bypass surgery. My feeling on coming home from the hospital was that I was in a dead man's house. I decided at that point that the best way to digest the incredible events that had just happened was to act as if I <i>had</i> died, and I was watching the world as it existed after my passing.</p><p>The realization as I watch the tech industry digest the passing of this very young man is how true that premonition was. To the extent I am part of the tech industry now, it is as a memory, as if I really did die in 2002. I get that feeling from people I occasionally hear from. They have memories of me, but no knowledge of who I am, what I am doing, today.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Anyway if you can actually hear me, and you were a friend of Krikorian's, I feel for your loss. I am experiencing it in a personal way, the same way I would if we had been close, as the idea bounces off me. Death for such a young person with so much promise is a wake-up call for everyone who hears of it. Tick tock. The grim reaper waits for us all.&nbsp;</span></p>",

I wrote my own glue for Frontier, and used it for years, but now that I'm working in JavaScript, I needed to convert to use Amazon's JavaScript API. Unfortunately, while I love AWS services, their APIs are often incomprehensible. They do a lot, and it seems you have to understand it all before you can write a simple Hello World app.&nbsp;</p><p>Then last week I came across a Node.js package called <a href=\"https://github.com/chilts/nice-route53\">nice-route53</a>, which claims to be \"the API you really wanted to Amazon's Route53 service.\"&nbsp;</p><p>It's true. The simple stuff is right up front.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a few minutes I could see all the zones and all the names I had defined over the years, and which zones were clogged with old obsolete names, and which zones had none. Both extremes are problematic, the latter is wastefully expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Route 53 is surprisingly expensive. Of all the services I use, DNS &nbsp;is the single most expensive. I never could understand why. It seems like it's just a database application, but at least now I have an idea how to simplify it. Which has been on my todo list for quite a while.&nbsp;</p><p>I got a lot of value out of nice-route53, right from the beginning, so I decided to give something back. I created a small-but-useful utility called <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/myRoute53\">myRoute53</a> that creates a map of your names and zones, and saves them as JSON files on your local computer. From there, armed with the source, you may be able to write your own utilities that go deeper.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/myRoute53\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"https://github.com/scripting/myRoute53\">https://github.com/scripting/myRoute53</span></a></p><p>Hope it helps!</p>",

And hopefully many other interesting users and developers from the Portland area.&nbsp;</p><p>Why: I'm in town, and have never done a meetup in Portland, and thought it would be interesting to meet you all.&nbsp;</p><p>What: I'd like to talk about blogging in 2016, why it's great that podcasting is taking off (again), and how the big silos are in the way of progress, and how they could help. Also how to combine wikis and blogs, and why callback hell is actually a lot of fun once you make your peace with it. And pretty much anything else people want to talk about.&nbsp;</p><p>Demo: I'll demo <a href=\"http://1999.io/\">1999.io</a>, my latest blogging tool, which I am using to write this post.</p><p>Thanks: <a href=\"http://www.red-bean.com/~jimb/\">Jim Blandy</a> at Mozilla for generously offering to host the meetup!&nbsp;</p>",

Because it isn't long before the outrage will be directed at you. Or should I say us.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been warning about this forever. Users eventually figure out that you're screwing them. The tech industry is built on the idea that they don't. Contradiction. You lose, eventually. So many times we've been around this loop, and every time the tech industry thinks it won't happen again. Yet it always does.&nbsp;</p><p>Look at the ad-blocker revolt for a demo. Ads aren't a good business model because the users figured it out. Finally someone gave them the software they need to stop being slaves to your business model. You might argue that ads were never a good business model. As the ads get better you might as well just let people use search.&nbsp;</p><p>People <i>want</i> commercial information. You don't have to force it on them. &nbsp;(For example, I am now contact-lens-enabled, so I can wear sunglasses for the first time. What brand should I get? How do you pick one pair over another? I've tried to provide signals to the ad services, but they don't seem to get it. I use search instead.)</p><p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/11/13/onlineAdvertisingIsNowDead.html\">2008</a>: Perfectly targeted advertising is just information.</p><p>So if Google wants to preserve their ad business they have to cripple search. Which they are doing! Long-term that won't work. Just give me a way to tell you what I want and show me how to get it. It's really simple. Unfortunately it isn't advertising, and you can't charge for it. Ooops.&nbsp;</p><p>The smart money must be exiting tech now. The Trump phenomenon is a sell signal. Find a safe place to park your money. Only thing is there really aren't any safe place, because the disease has progressed so far that it's now trying to infect the US economy, it already has infected the political system. Not sure where you park your money that's safe.</p><p>Maybe the best thing to do is to start unilaterally giving the users more power over their own online presence. Stop trying to own everything. Because there's no way to win that game. Even if you win you lose.</p>",

The walking is easier on that side because there are a bunch of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/new-yorks-billionaires-row-is-dead-2016-7\">Billionaire's Row</a> apartment buildings going up on the north side.&nbsp;</p><p>On the south side are shops and office buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>It was hugely hot and humid yesterday. It was okay I guess if you kept moving, but if you had to stop and wait for a light or an emergency vehicle (there were lots) you baked and dripped so much sweat it felt like you were taking a shower.</p><p>As I passed shops with their doors open, they emitted deliciously cold air, bathing the sidewalk in air conditioned relief. New Yorkers rush by, we all appreciate the chill, until you realize this is quite bad, climate-change-wise. Burning all that fossil fuel to cool off the sidewalk. Probably long term not a good strategy for staying cool.&nbsp;</p><p>And those emergency vehicles!

It's now time in my career to think about passing off, so I want to be sure to cover the important stuff. But first we have to talk about the foundation, and for me that was C and Unix and how they were one and the same, how a language could be the core of an OS and how an OS could be the core of a language. And how C was both a machine language and a high-level language (something I did not go into great detail in, in the podcast).</span></p><p><span>C and Unix integrated two big concepts in two dimensions.

It was good, but I can imagine if you're not a Hillary fan you might think it's dorky or self-promotional.

It's not the same idea. They're creating a platform for her to talk directly to her supporters. It'll be a weekly thing, not daily. It clearly won't be edgy, newsy or comedic.

In the first show the star was Newt Gingrich. We got everything including his admonition at the end to not quote him out of context. I actually really like that. I've been hearing Gigrich interviews for 30 years, never heard that part before.&nbsp;</p><p>This week they interviewed a former Trump exec and tried to answer the question we're all wondering about -- What <i>exactly</i><span> is going on?</span></p><p><span>A good contribution to the political podcastsphere.</span></p>",

Both are accomplished journalists who I have known through their work for decades and have enormous respect for. This isn't about them, rather it's about how journalists try to maintain neutrality when faced with a candidate who lies openly and admittedly in bold and dangerous ways.</span></p><p>Here's a link to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10157197574810063&amp;id=685700062\">Facebook thread</a> where these comments originated.&nbsp;</p><p><span>There's truth and journalism truth. When Trump calls for the assassination of his opponent journalism runs out of words to say what he just did. I was thinking of collecting the various descriptions, just to show you guys how ridiculous it has become. It's a mishmash of attribution and qualification.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Why can't journalism make a direct and true statement: The candidate called for the assassination of his opponent after he loses the election. That's what actually happened. Or, at least put someone on a panel who can say that. All the sources are as conflicted by the rules of their own trade that prevent them from saying what's obvious to every adult watching or reading.</span></p><p>Supposed ethics give the atrocious candidate a fig leaf to hide his sins.</p><p>The reporting, to users, and I'm a serious user of news, has little or no value. If you were relying on a journalist's description of Trump and didn't hear his actual words, you wouldn't be able to make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder if journalist ethics aren't obsolete at this point, and if they haven't been obsolete for a long time, and if that is what got us into this mess. All the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence\">false equivalence</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/public-editor/16pubed.html\">he-said-she-said reporting</a> has gotten us to a place where an objective reporter <i>still</i> maintains that \"they both do it.\" You see that everywhere, if somehow the scale of Hillary's dishonesty is in any way comparable to Trump's. Adult to adult, it's not. And the journalist's <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/\">view from nowhere</a> has always been dysfunctional, but now it's so far from reality that it's like the emperor with no clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>And the danger, also, is totally obvious.</p><p>The reporting no longer serves any purpose other than to demonstrate how tortured journalist ethics are by a candidate who pushes it to its limits.&nbsp;</p><p>One more thing -- I noticed the other day that Chuck Todd on MTP Daily was taking objectivity a little less seriously as the crowds at Trump rallies started chanting \"Lock Them Up\" where \"them\" refers to journalists.</p><h4>The thread continued...</h4><p>I am voting for Hillary and contribute to her campaign. But my complaint about the press is very similar to Trump's. I never have felt you guys gave me a chance Walt. I stopped worrying about it in 1994 when I found that I could communicate directly with users, without going through the press. I was very effective that way, far more effective than I had been by hiring PR people and going through the tech press, which always thought I was somehow incompetent or insignificant. My competitors, the biggest tech companies, used the press. We still were able to gain traction with blogging, RSS and podcasting, without the press support. I still read your stuff, always have, Walt, but I think your view of the world has been proven incomplete, and that proof has been out there for a decade or more now. You're still not accepting it, when it's risen to the point of a presidential candidate circumventing all the gatekeepers.</p>",

The topic, how JSON came to be and the back story about how Tim Bray came to be interested in its evolution.</p><p>First, I should say, and as will be obvious in the podcast, I have history with Tim. He was one of the original designers of XML, and I was working in XML starting in the late 90s and extending into the mid-00s. Tim was also one of the authors of the Atom spec, which was an attempt to replace RSS. My software supports both formats, but I was skeptical of the need to replace RSS. I felt that the people who were behind Atom didn't understand what RSS was being used for, or how widely deployed it was, and how unlikely it was that it would be replaced.</p><p>Now Tim wants to change JSON. I first heard about it in a recent <a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2016/08/20/Fixing-JSON\">blog post</a> of his. I knew I'd be seeing Allen in Portland, and since he has been involved in JavaScript for quite some time, I asked him what he thought of Tim's post. He said there's a story behind it. And that's what we discuss in this podcast.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Along the way we get a lot of interesting tidbits about how JavaScript and JSON evolved.&nbsp;</p><p>Allen was the author of the <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/\">Ecmascript 6 spec</a>, and has been a longtime language developer at Microsoft and Mozilla. It was Allen's idea to get <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/08/20/podcastWardCunningham.html\">Ward Cunningham</a> and myself together last year in Portland. And we all got together again at the meetup at Mozilla last Friday night.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/allenWirfsBrock.m4a\">podcast</a> is 31 minutes. We did it at a picnic table in a forest in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoyt_Arboretum\">Hoyt Arboretum</a> in Portland. You'll also hear from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Wirfs-Brock\">Rebecca Wirfs-Brock</a>, Allen's wife, a noted expert on software methodologies.</p>",

            "text": "<p><span>Last week I visited Seattle and Portland.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In Seattle, I spent a day with Brent and Sheila Simmons, two longtime friends. Brent and I worked together at UserLand. He's also an excellent <a href=\"http://inessential.com/\">writer</a>. His interest in blogging stemmed from his literate side, which made him an excellent web developer imho. Making software for yourself is a path to success.&nbsp;</p><p>And in Portland I met with Ward Cunningham. We went bike riding in 100 degree heat, all over town, saw the sights, and talked software philosophy. We share the same basic values. It's amazing to meet someone like that. I regret that we didn't hook up 20 years ago. But maybe we each had to finish our work on our respective ideas -- mine which is blogging and his of course is the wiki.</p><p>In Brent's and my world, writing is episodic, chronological. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/gettingBlogsAndWikisTogether.html\">This</a> is what I wrote on August 23, 2016. And then there's what I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/1999/08/23.html\">wrote</a> on August 23. 1999. And almost every other day in between.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas in Ward's world, there's the writing about a topic, say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_of_Antarctica\">The Wildlife of Antarctica</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_career_home_run_leaders\">Home Run Leaders in Major League Baseball</a>. Chronology is an attribute of each bit on a page, but it is not the structure of the site as it is on a blog.</p><p>Thing is, I yearn for what Ward's world has. I'm so frustrated that my blogging doesn't have a concordance of all that I think on this topic or that. I repeat themes here all the time. And my memory is not very good. At times I can read things I wrote and published and have no recollection of writing them. Sometimes I even have trouble <i>understanding</i> them!&nbsp;</p><p>I've written letters to execs at Google at various points in time, suggesting they have the tools to create such a resource. Supporting writing on the web is something we should all get behind. The 25th <a href=\"http://www.webat25.org/\">anniversary</a> of the web is a good day to remind us what it is we're trying to do here.&nbsp;</p><p>One final thing to tie this thread together. Ward has a friend, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holden?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mike Caulfield</a> who is also a web writer who also makes software. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/08/23/podcastAllenWirfsbrock.html\">Allen</a> sent me a link to his <a href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\">piece</a> about the diff betw chronologic writing and wiki-writing, and I thought man this is just like what I was talking about with Brent the other day in Seattle. It illustrates what I have now and what I want to create.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things I said repeatedly at the Portland meetup: <i>It's All About People. </i>I said it because this is something we don't always remember in Nerdland. We're creating tools to connect people. Not just people on one company's network or another's, but all people everywhere, in the belief that smart people may have the answer we seek even if they don't have a <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-votes-to-keep-peter-thiel-on-facebook-b-1782276509\">billion dollars</a> to make their voice louder or to silence others.</p>",

It's legal to do this in the US, but until now as far as I know, no one has crossed this line. Now that the line has been crossed, it's fair to assume it will become standard practice for billionaires like Thiel to finance <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/768107982529912832\">lawsuits</a> until the publication loses and has to sell itself to pay the judgment.&nbsp;</li><li>It's the <a href=\"http://www.webat25.org/\">25th Anniversary</a> of the Web because 25 years ago a generous visionary named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Tim Berners-Lee</a> invented something that would benefit humanity more than it would benefit him. And many other visionaries saw it, and because it was open, were able to build anything they could imagine using it as a basis. And they did, making something like Facebook possible.</li><li>Facebook is a silo for web writing. And while it would be easy for them to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/04/30/1229.html\">create paths</a> for ideas to flow in and out of Facebook, at very low cost, and they have the features already developed, and use them internally, they refuse to share them with users. I suppose we could just explain this as they're a very large tech company and that's what tech companies do, but they also have the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chutzpah\">chutzpah</a> to pretend to support the open web. They have been happy to accept its bounty and have done nothing to return what they've taken from the commons to the commons.</li><li>And finally, remember Peter Thiel, the guy&nbsp;who thinks his wealth entitles him to shut down publications he doesn't like, not only did he make billions <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel#Facebook\">from</a> Facebook stock, <i>he's <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerberg-votes-to-keep-peter-thiel-on-facebook-b-1782276509\">still</a> on the board of Facebook. </i>Zuckerberg has had plenty of time to ask him to leave, or to fire him, and he hasn't done it. Again, you could just shrug it off and say Zuck is like Thiel, but he's extra special in that he wants you to believe he appreciates the gift of the open web, as he strangles it.&nbsp;</li></ol><p></p>",

Since both outliners use OPML as their file format, it should be easy to convert. You'll have nine-plus months to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>And even when the API stops working, the files will still be in your Dropbox folder. No need to export them, they are already in a standard format, ready to be imported into any outliner that supports OPML.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm sure some users will feel let down, but this is the reality of software. It's not all based on ads. We have to get enough users to sustain a growing effort. Fargo didn't make the cut. It's great software, but there are other choices. I have provided a path forward with <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/\">LO2</a>.

They were stifling progress.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many other tech companies that do the same.</p><p>But Gawker tended to go after individuals, and often not individuals at big powerful companies, just individuals, some who didn't even have a job. And when they did go after big execs it was often because they were caught being human. Which meant they became even more private, and less accessible, and their thinking became more introverted, narcissistic and inbred, even paranoid. So Gawker while it was sometimes a force for good, was often a source of pain for the people of the tech industry, and as a result had a negative net effect.&nbsp;</p><p>News orgs have to strike a balance, and they have to appeal to the good nature of their readers. I know Nick doesn't think this way, but that's why I so rarely pointed to them, and why I so rarely wrote for them. I didn't trust them.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot I didn't know about Gawker as a result.</p><p>Reading some of the postmortems, I think wow I should have tried to write for them. But then I remember how they attacked people I knew who were struggling to make a go of it in tech, and how they treated me even. They once wrote about a trip to the bathroom at a conference that I never took, another time criticized me for a personal ad that had run 15 years prior when I was in better physical shape.&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly they were a source for bad in tech.

She does answer the questions, answers that they would be delighted to get from her opponent, who rarely answers any of their questions, when they can get an interview, and these days he won't even be interviewed by any reporter, unless you count Fox News people as reporters (they're more like PR people or campaign flacks).</p><p>And her opponent has real controversies not these bullshit ones. Is he owned by Russia? Where are the tax returns? How badly did he screw the Trump U students? Was he raised as a member of the KKK? Why did it take him so long to disavow their support? That's just the beginning! And what are you worried about with Hillary? It's so stupid I can't even find words to describe it.</p><p>Look I don't give a shit if you trust her. You're so confused about what's real and not that your trust doesn't mean anything. 90 percent of the time you're just interviewing each other about optics and impressions as if they had any substance. I have an almost permanent eyeroll as I watch you guys discuss politics. You just recite the same bullshit over and over. You never get an expert in to tell us what it might be like to have a Russian puppet in the White House or a President who's just now learning what the Constitution is.&nbsp;</p><p>Has anyone looked into his education? Did he learn anything in school? Ask him a basic history question next time you're granted an interview and see if he can answer it. Hey Trump, can you name 10 former US presidents? I would be surprised if he could. Name the wars the US has fought in in the 20th century. What year was the Constitution signed? Who was the second president? Third? First?</p><p>And where are the fucking tax returns?</p><p>Anyway, reporters, I think people who care know exactly what you're doing. The only difference between a one-on-one interview and a press conference is that in a press conference there are 50 reporters asking gotcha questions and in a one-on-one interview there's only one. <i>The number of ridiculous questions is exactly the same, either way.&nbsp;</i></p><p>If your listeners were stupid, your tricks might work, but even the dumbest among us have probably figured it out, because you've repeated the same bullshit over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>Reporters who ask about a Clinton press conf are like post-truth Repubs. She's running a good campaign. That's why you're so stuck.</p><p>BTW, my guess as to why no press conferences is that she doesn't like them. But your thesis that she's hiding from the press is a lie. She's not hiding from the press.&nbsp;</p>",

Of course that's coming after I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/08/24/fargoTimesOutOnJune2017.html\">told</a> the users that Fargo will not make the transition to the new Dropbox API, and it will stop working in June of next year when the current API is turned off. &nbsp;</p><p>I made this choice because I now have better technology for storage, that isn't dependent on one vendor, and neither users or Dropbox showed much interest in the product. As a developer I depend on that interest. The way I do software is user-driven. If there aren't smart people using the product, and if I don't hear from them, I can't do my work.</p><p>This is kind of ironic because Fargo is designed for people to communicate. If people had something to say about the product, they could write a blog post and send me a link. That way I could: 1. Read what they have to say and 2. Share it with other people who might be interested in the product.</p><p>I can see from Google Analytics that there are some people using Fargo. But what are they doing with it? Hard to say.</p><p>Imho, when you're using a free product, and you want to see it continue developing, you have a responsibility to be part of the word of mouth of the product. Help introduce people to it, provide useful feedback to the developer. Not just when it isn't working, but also when it is.&nbsp;</p><p>What you like, what features you'd kill for. Put some effort back into the product, and you may be rewarded with new features, and continued development. If no one is talking about the product, then there's nothing I can do.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we have <a href=\"http://1999.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://1999.io\">1999.io</span></a>&nbsp;and the new <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/\">Little Outliner</a>. Some people seem to be using the products, but I don't hear much about it, so neither do potential new users. I have heard from a few users that they'd like some of the features of Fargo to show up in LO2. I know how to do that. But you have to give me a reward if you want me to work for you. It's so hard for people to understand that the person who's developing the software is human being just like they are, and we need support.&nbsp;</p><p>Users aren't without responsibilities. I've said this all along. When I have an active user base, I am interested. If I don't hear from you, I find other things to motivate my interest.&nbsp;</p>",

I want to cross-post on Facebook without losing the links, styling, titles, and enclosures. That's it. That's the problem. Once Facebook supports this, the problem goes away and we can stop bothering them. Until it's solved we will watch the web continue to decline, and a very good art, linking, will diminish.

I'm no longer doing that.</p><p>Here's why.</p><p>First, if you put the two of them together, you'd have a great blogging surface. Medium handles linking, styles and titles. No podcasts, but that's the fourth item on the list for a reason. Most of my posts don't have podcasts attached. If there was one must-have feature I could live without that's the one (though giving up podcasting is giving up a huge win in interop). And Facebook handles updates, so if I make a change to a post after initially publishing it, those changes percolate to the Facebook version. So if you add the two together you get pretty close to the ideal.</p><p>But Facebook doesn't do links, styling, titles or podcasts. And Medium doesn't do updates.</p><p>I gave both a good shot, but the tradeoffs just aren't worth it.</p><p>It's true more people read my full posts on Facebook than click the link to read it on my blog. By a pretty wide margin. But the limits are confusing my writing. My reason for writing is not just engagement, but also to get mind-to-mind connections. And my mind is confused when I write for this hybrid medium, and my blog suffers. I suffer. I'm more confused, and that's not a good thing.&nbsp;</p><p>And Medium is published-and-done. I end up either manually updating the posts, or I put up with incomplete or inaccurate writing on Medium. It might be worth it to maintain two versions manually, if I was getting engagement on Medium, but there are very few comments or readers there. I think I've given it fair shot of most of a year. If it hasn't started happening yet, I figure it isn't going to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm back to posting links on Facebook, as I do on Twitter. And I'm thinking about posting links to Medium, so people who have been reading me there have a way of knowing when I've written a new post.</p><p>If either of them change the way they work, I'll take another look.&nbsp;</p>",

The whole thing, beginning to end.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that I'm finished I find the background chatter in my brain is Spanish, with lots of curse words mixed in. It was like watching Deadwood, which made me talk like the barkeep <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Swearengen\">Swearengen</a>. Cocksucker this guy, cocksucker that one. Or The Wire which taught my inner-voice to speak like a black man in Baltimore. Now I speak to myself in Spanish, not having much of an idea what I'm talking about, but I do know what <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=puta\">puta</a> means and <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=puta%20madre\">puta madre</a>. It seems in Spanish they use that word a lot especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar\">Pablo Escobar</a>. I know how to pronounce Pablo btw, the b is almost but not quite silent. And I know how to tell someone to <a href=\"http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/192032/if-i-ask-someone-to-calm-down-should-i-say-tranquila-or-tranquilo\">relax</a> in Spanish.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe that's what made Narcos so interesting. It's mostly in Spanish with English subtitles. So I was able to learn and practice a new language while watching it. I like doing that.</p><p>There's a great line near the end of the last episode which will be iconic among Narcos fans, because it's such a surprise and so well done. I'm not going to spoil it here, for that you'll have to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/05/spoiler.png\">click a link</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway if you like The Sopranos, or Deadwood, The Wire or any other violent HBO-type series, Narcos is for you.&nbsp;</p>",

The two universities, at opposite ends of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Avenue_(metropolitan_Boston)\">Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge have great reps, but at opposite ends of the spectrum between engineering and the humanities.</p><p>I've always believed that it was the human side of technology that had the greatest potential. When I was coming up in the 70s and 80s this was a contrarian view. So in 2003 when RSS needed a home to cement it as a standard, I chose the Cambridge university with the stronger rep as a place to be human as opposed to being a nerd. Not that the two are in any way exclusive. My point was, that through the technology we were working on, they would become the same thing.</p><p>I guess the disadvantage of going the contrarian route is that it isn't so intuitive to the people at <a href=\"http://www.harvard.edu/\">Harvard</a> today that the university should have played such a great role at the leading edge of technology thirteen years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><span>No small thanks to the people at </span><a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/\">Berkman Center</a><span> for their love and support at the time. ;-)</span></p><p>And in retrospect -- it worked. Took a long time to shake out. But all is quiet in RSS-land and it still rages as a standard for interop that continues to bear fruit.</p>",

I've suffered through early generation products that would disconnect at random times. You may have seen me stopped on the street in NYC trying frantically to get my headphones to re-pair with my iPhone so I could continue listening to a podcast. Some of them are so stubborn, nothing could convince them connect when they don't want to.</p><p>I'm happy to say I have found a reasonably priced <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MR8Z28S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Bluetooth headphone</a> that aggressively stays connected to the phone. I just got my second one, the first one was drowned in a rainstorm last week and the Bluetooth connectivity died with it. I got plenty of hours of happy use of the first one.</p><p>That said, in another context I must have the wired connection, when I connect the iPhone to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Pill-Portable-Speaker-Black/dp/B00GJVF766/ref=sr_1_2?s=aht&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473340713&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=beats+pill\">Beats Pill</a> that's mounted on the handlebars of my bike. For whatever reason, the Bluetooth connection is very unreliable in that mode. So I found a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iXCC-Universal-Auxiliary-3-5mm-Enabled-Devices/dp/B00ZS6QPTQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473340842&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=male+to+male+mini+plug\">male-to-male</a> mini-jack, and use that to hook the two together. Without the headphone jack, no music for Dave while biking. I totally love having the music, for that moment when I reach the top of the first hill in Central Park, and have a long stretch of relatively level riding, that's just perfect for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/06/27/1331.html\">Terrapin Station</a>, which has become my cycling anthem. (Yes NakedJen, Jerry is still dead.)</p><p>That said, I'm happy to pay a few hundred for the new camera, so there's my dilemma. I love to take pictures with my iPhone and I want the best. But I really like having the headphone jack. I don't feel very conflicted yet, but I probably will once people are posting the new pics you can take with the iPhone 7 that can't be taken with the iPhone 6.</p>",

She says it's bad thinking. She didn't say much more than that, imho.&nbsp;</span></p><p>And I strongly disagree. Here's why.</p><p>First, false equivalence is the smaller of two issues.&nbsp;<span>The larger issue is that the many scandals of the Trump candidacy are going unreported.&nbsp;</span><span>The concern is that he will be elected and the scandals will only be investigated after it's too late, after we're committed to four years Trump as president. For example...</span></p><p>He has a special relationship with Russia. What is it based on? And what might this mean for a Trump presidency. &nbsp;How might it affect our relationships with our allies? We've never, as far as I know, had a president with such a large potential conflict of interest. Or have we? Again something I would expect the NYT to cover in great detail.&nbsp;</p><p>The tax returns. What other conflicts would they uncover? Is there any chance the tax returns will leak?</p><p>The voters he attracts. Hillary calls them the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=basket+of+deplorables\">basket of deplorables</a>. Who are they? What are we learning about our own country?</p><p>The threats to free speech. He's litigious as a private citizen. How will he use the power of the presidency to further limit free speech?</p><p>His love of authoritarianism. When he praises Putin he reveals a streak of what some would call fascism. Is it real? How will this affect Americans' lives?&nbsp;</p><p>Conflicts with other Republicans in government. What might Speaker Ryan do, assuming Republicans retain a majority in the House. Senate Majority Leader McConnell? Will there be a purge in the Republican Party? What do your sources say?</p><p>His connection with the KKK and other white supremacist groups. He's never denied that they exist, and he has been challenged on this topic. It's fair game.</p><p>Trump is like a minor league pitcher in the majors who has a real chance of winning the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award\">Cy Young award</a> because the batters he faces refuse to swing at his slow fat pitches. Why? Almost any pitch he throws could be a home run. Why do you take the strikes? What are we supposed to think about the NYT?&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is totally independent of Hillary Clinton's candidacy, which is why false equivalence is a distraction from the core issue: Trump's many problems as a potential President. Spayd is putting the cart before the horse, confusing the cause with the effect. For me, it's not at all partisan. I am voting for Clinton <i>because of the problems with Trump's candidacy</i> as well as my belief that she would make a good President. If it were the other way around, I would vote Republican, as I have many times.&nbsp;</p><p>So the assumption that this is partisan is beneath the NYT. It's insulting, shows disrespect for their readers, and is logically incorrect. And it skirts the issue. Why is the NYT not doing a much more thorough job of vetting Donald Trump as a candidate for President?</p>",

It's really incredibly simple. If you're nearsighted the lens makes the image bigger, if you're farsighted, the image gets smaller. I'm both, so I need both kinds of lenses. A lens rated -1 is a mild correction for farsightedness. +4 is a substantial correction for nearsightedness.</p><p>The secret was getting an eye doctor who would work with me, over a period of months to figure out what the right combination was, and to patiently teach me how to put the lenses in and take them out.</p><p>I assumed I wouldn't be able to do it. I've always had eye doctors who put me on a conveyer belt and didn't listen well. But my eyes are weird, and to get it right so I can see reasonably well required patience. Previous eye doctors didn't offer that.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this is cheap, of course. My insurance doesn't cover it. But having functional vision is worth a lot.&nbsp;</p>",

They beat up Jews and homosexuals in dark alleys. A few nights ago they broke all the windows in Jewish businesses.&nbsp;</span></p><p>On the other hand Mother Teresa has set up soup kitchens to feed the poor, free health clinics, and daycare so single moms can go to work. They hand out flowers at their rallies and preach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_love,_not_war\">Make Love Not War</a>.</p><p>So when you report on the campaign do you say that Hitler's supporters are awful people, but there have been reports of people saying nasty stuff at Mother Teresa's rallies too, so you figure it out.</p><p>The point, in case it isn't obvious, is that elections are never balanced, there's always a difference between the candidates. Never has it been more clear than in the 2016 presidential race. Of course Hillary is not a saint, and we don't know yet what's really on DJ Trump's mind. But we do know that one looks like a pretty normal candidate for president and the other scares the shit out of almost anyone with a sense of history, or who isn't white and Christian (and probably a few of those people too).</p><p>Also, this is not a logical fallacy. &nbsp;If you have a rule that says that all candidates are the same you can prove it false by showing an example where they clearly are not.&nbsp;</p>",

It's a fair question, because they always put the ads up front, and then they meander and chit chat and tell inside jokes, etc while you're waiting to find out if this ever gets interesting, and finally after ten minutes with no end in sight you give up and move on to the next one.</p><p>There are podcasts that should be good that I've never gotten to the good parts of. Shows dedicated to TV series that I love, featuring the writers and actors, and there are so many things I'd like to know about them, but... I never get to that part, if it exists.</p><p>So now I'm doing my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/15/whatHerokuWasntDoing.m4a\">fourth podcast</a> in three days and this one is 22 minutes, and I have to admit I ramble a lot before I get to the point. And this one is pretty technical, though the punchline is more of a business development one. But there are probably only a few people who would get something out of it at first.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, it's been a long time since I switched off <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/07/1240.html\">Heroku</a>, and the dust has settled, and I've got most of my stuff ported to plain old Linux now, and am spending time thinking about where I want to go next, and I swung back around to Heroku, and what a good idea I thought it was, whether or not it was ever meant to be what I thought it was meant to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, if you think about models for entrepreneurship in software, and would like to hear what I think is missing where the independent developer world intersects with the angel investor world, or if you're in bizdev at Saleforce or some other entrepreneurial-minded big company (a rare thing) or if you ever thought as I did that Heroku was a super kickass idea, it might be worth 22 minutes.</p><p>I deliberately wrote this description in a long-winded manner to give you an idea of how long-winded the podcast itself is.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry, in advance. ;-)</p><p>PS: BTW, I started work on the new <a href=\"http://dev.opml.org/2005/10/28/\">OPML Validator</a>. It's what got me thinking in this direction in the first place. In the podcast I say it dates back to 2001, which was wrong. The initial post, linked above, was in 2005.&nbsp;</p>",

It's the first time I've heard her in a long form interview, with no other panelists to cut her off. She's very fluent, but I gotta say the glaring contradiction that the more competitive interviews reveal comes through more clearly, and I couldn't just pass on the link without commenting.</p><p>First she talks about the Trump supporter, a person who feels left out and what they like about Trump he makes them feel dealt-in. This is reasonable, and I think likely true.</p><p>Then she talks about her friends who are Republicans and the sympathy she feels for them as their world is falling apart.</p><p>But...</p><p>What about Molly Ball? </p><p>What about <i>her</i> world?</p><p><span>What does she fear?</span></p><p>This is the old <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/\">View from Nowhere</a> thing.</p><p>Come November we may all know what it feels like to be one of her Republican friends. The system <i>we</i> believe in will be falling apart. The things we took for granted may be either falling away by popular demand, or at least in question. Ideas like whether or not Molly Ball can write her columns for the Atlantic and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-peter-thiel-supreme-court_us_57d80d57e4b09d7a687f9b03\">be</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\">freely</a> critical of the government and the president-elect.</p><p>This is imho the bug in our system. The true royalty are the entitled journalists who feel above the concerns of a normal person. They wield a lot of power. Unfortunately for all of us that power isn't grounded in the world we all live in, including the journalist. I can't remember when that idea has been more obvious than it is right now.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/776526169046917120\">PS</a>:&nbsp;After writing this piece about Molly Ball at Shorenstein, I realized Harvard should have the equiv of Shorenstein, for blogging.</p>",

Right away they will ratify a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia\">Scalia</a>, restoring the previous ratio on the Court.</p><p>ObamaCare will be repealed by Congress and the President will sign the bill. How many people will lose their insurance? What happens to people who are dependent on health care? WIll we revert to a system with pre-existing conditions? If so, will they revert to when you let the previous insurance lapse? Will people who switched to ObamaCare be able to restore the policies they let lapse?</p><p>Did he make a deal with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reince_Priebus\">Priebus</a>, will Trump actually govern or will he be a figurehead. There were rumors that he offered president-in-fact to Kasich. Did he offer the same deal to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence\">Pence</a>?</p><p>Or will there be a purge? Will Ryan and McConnell be forced out? It seems the majorities in Congress will be managed by people loyal to the president.</p><p>What will happen to the stock market? When will it start reflecting the likelihood of a Trump presidency? Seems likely (to me) it'll crash. Should we be looking for signs of that now?</p><p>Foreign alliances. What will change immediately, and what will change over time. What will Russia do in the confusion after the election?&nbsp;</p><p>How should/will Obama prepare for the transition? What steps might he take before Trump takes office?</p><p>Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-democrats-should-panic-if-the-polls-still-look-like-this-in-a-week/\">said</a> it's time for the Democrats to panic if the poll numbers stay the same. When will everyone else panic.</p><p>The banking industry. Trump has promised to repeal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act\">Dodd-Frank</a>. Is it actually working, doing any good? If so, what will change immediately? Will we return to subprime loans? Or have we already resumed that?</p><p>What will the 11 million people who he has threatened to deport do?</p><p>I'm sure other questions will occur. The press hasn't asked these questions presumably because they thought Trump would not win. If they're going to do their jobs it seems they have to start shifting now. We have to have some info/ideas about this. News is getting real.</p><p>Update: The New Yorker has been working on this story all summer, and it just came out <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term?currentPage=all\">with this</a>.

I didn't watch the actual show. I just watched what people were saying about it on Twitter. Not only didn't I miss a thing, but it was much more interesting. And a lot more entertaining!

Huge defenses.</p><p>I suppose their view is that everyone outside their circle is a uniform mass of nasty. I know that some of them know the role I played in building the network they use. You'd think I could get an idea in there, at least in the area of my expertise. But nothing. Crickets. For many years. I can't get in there.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to figure out a way to bust through this. It would work if I could get on the inside and talk from in there about how to connect better into a more varied set of people and ideas. They are dying because of all the inbred practices and all the lying.

            "text": "<p>Yesterday on Facebook, a longtime friend posted a message saying he was burning out on people's political missives there. I am too. Most of it is powerless and judgemental. There's no listening going on, just people talking over each others' heads. That thread was behind my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/19/thisShouldBeALawOfTheInternet.html\">post</a> of a new Internet law that says \"No one has or ever will be persuaded by an argument.\" (Law in the sense of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, not the Bill of Rights.)</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1sONfxPCTU0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p>I'm surprised I had so much to say. Mostly what I wanted to do in this post is remind people who read my blog of what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King\">Rodney King</a> said, so eloquently, during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots\">Los Angeles riots</a> of 1992.&nbsp;</p><p>My missive continues...</p><p>I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, and get online with my iPad. When I did last night I saw a post, on Facebook, from another friend saying everyone should vote. She went on to say that most of the people she knows who aren't voting are white men. I am of course a white man, and I am <i>most definitely</i> voting, even though I live in the bluest of blue states.</p><p>Imho, the problem with both these posts is they aren't about specific people, so they cast a wide net, and in doing so catch innocent people, some of whom incorrectly think the post is about them.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought perhaps Chuck was admonishing me, because I post links to stories on Facebook (also on my linkblog and Twitter). And with Callie's post, I <i>know</i> she wasn't talking about me, but it burned me up anyway. No doubt she thought she was doing good, but it felt very un-good to me. I have strong reasons for voting, I don't need anyone to tell me why to vote, and further, I don't like being judged unfairly &nbsp;because of my gender and race. Same as anyone else, any gender or any race. I don't know why it's so hard for people to get that men are real people, as are white men, and we process bigotry the same way everyone else does, as injustice, as a threat.&nbsp;</p><p>She posited that it's because white men are in charge, but Callie, I don't feel at all in charge. I feel marginalized, as if no one listens to me. I might as well hang it up. I'd better get my strength from within, because none of it comes from outside.&nbsp;</p><p>My ancestors emigrated to the US during the Holocaust, fleeing for their lives. I suspect, even though Trump has a Jewish son-in-law, that we are in trouble too if he gets elected. So if you really want to say it, you'd have to say <i>Christian</i> white males, because there are quite a few Muslim white males. Carve out an exception for them too.&nbsp;</p><p>Or you could just forget the generalizing and say something simple and more gentle like \"I'm voting and I hope all my friends do too.\" You're on solid ground there because you're talking about your own plans and your hope. Pretty safe.&nbsp;</p><p>I can't tell anyone what to do, but I can unfollow. That was Chuck's advice. I have a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/10/06/iGenerallyDontTag.html#aTODAT\">motto</a> for such occasions -- Don't slam the door on the way out. It can be hard to remember such a rule. I didn't post an objection, but I did unfollow. And in the light of day, I wrote this blog post.&nbsp;</p>",

You have to be sure your fingers have control when that happens.</p><p>Be sure the fingers you use to hold the lids are dry and be sure the eyelids are dry. Rub them with a towel to be really sure. Top and bottom.</p><p>Practice keeping the lids open. Nothing works unless you can do this. I'm repeating this because it's so important.</p><p>Okay, now get the lens on the tip of your index finger. As with the eyelids, be sure the finger is also really dry. And make sure the lens is <i>lightly</i> on the tip of the finger. One point of contact.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, holding the lids open, put the lens on the eye. Apply light pressure. Hold it there for a moment. Then lift the finger away from the eye, keeping the lids open. Pause. Be sure the lens isn't on your finger. If it's not on the finger, it's almost certainly on the eye. The lens sticks to the eye without much pressure. &nbsp;</p><p>Take a breath or two and then let go of the lids. Blink a few times. If you have good vision in that eye, the lens is in. Otherwise look around on the eyelid. Or perhaps it fell off. Look around. But it probably didn't fall off, it's probably on your eye.</p><p>It took me a long time to figure this out. Now I get the lens installed first time every time. Amazing. Never thought I'd get there!

Jews they are and Jews they remain. For our Volk they are poison.”<br><br>“Like the poisonous mushroom!” says Franz.<br><br>“Yes, my child!

Of course since Trump isn't a normal Republican that doesn't mean they would cooperate on everything, and it's unlikely the Republicans would have a 60-vote majority needed to override a filibuster.</p><p><span>But here's the thing -- it's hard to stop a president using the constitutional checks and balances if he's determined. The court moves slowly and it doesn't have a means of enforcement. Congress can pass laws, but previous presidents have ignored laws that are in their way, so why wouldn't President Trump? If Trump decides to use the military to stop protests, for example, which is against the law, it will be hard to stop him.</span></p><p>The story points out that when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon\">Nixon</a> wanted to use executive power in questionable ways, Cabinet officers intervened. Nixon backed down. Maybe that will happen with Trump, but maybe not. It'll be a Republican Senate ratifying his choices for Cabinet officers.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the relevant excerpt:</p><blockquote>The courts, Posner added, are slow. “If you have a President who is moving very quickly, the judiciary can’t do much. A recent example of this would be the war on terror. The judiciary put constraints on President Bush—but it took a very long time.”</blockquote><p>It seems we're in for a roller coaster ride when (if) Trump takes office.</p>",

Brent and I worked together on UserLand's products in the late 90s that led to many cool things like blogging, RSS, Facebook, Twitter.</span></p><p>Anyway, this was the first trip I took as a contact lens wearer. Or I should say a <i>would-be</i> contact lens wearer. I was having a lot of trouble, and most days I gave up and just wore my glasses. I had a lot of trouble getting the lens to stay in my eye. I hadn't yet learned the Zen of Contacts, as explained in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/20/theSecretOfContacts.html\">yesterday's piece</a>.</p><p>Anyway, something Brent said stuck with me. He's been using contacts since he was a teenager. He said he just puts them in. He forgot how he does it. He just does it. I do so many things like that myself. Walking for example. Riding a bike. Typing! Even writing itself is a process I do without <i>thinking</i> too much. But none of these things were automatic when I started. Watch a toddler learning to walk. Do you remember when you learned to ride a bike? You'd struggle, living in your head until you relaxed and just did it. There's a process underneath, but you've incorporated it into your subconscious mind, it's not forgotten but it feels that way. In software I call these \"base of the spine\" operations. They have gone from intellectual puzzles to instinct. That's why emulating an existing product makes adoption easier, and breaking users can be so jarring. All of a sudden you have to think about things that used to be automatic.</p><p>That's why I wanted to write the piece explaining the 1-2-3 of contacts.</p><p>But JY Stervinou, another longtime friend, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jy/status/778341539483381760\">pointed out</a> that I had already incorporated some of the Zen at the base-of-spine level. My story was really 1-3-4. I left out the second essential part. The mirror!</p><p>So this morning when I did the task I watched myself to see how integral the mirror is and if I could do without it. No way. <i>It's all about the mirror.</i> Proving that the process of incorporation has already begun.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll link to this from the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/20/theSecretOfContacts.html\">earlier piece</a> as a postscript.</p><p>PS: The title of this piece is from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPzY30v9mtg\">great Who song</a>.</p>",

Repubs have promised to repeal it. They will be able to do it if they control the White House. How many people dependent on ObamaCare will vote against it without knowing?&nbsp;</p><p>I've done jury duty and totally see the parallels. The lawyers train the jurors to vote for the verdict they want. It's always at an emotional level. Same with voting. The emotional core is much more powerful than the intellectual. The campaign must make its case by getting the voter's emotions and intelligence to work together. At least the campaigns I want to support do that.</p><p>I'm not sure Hillary gets this. It's why people say she's confusing. I read her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/opinion/hillary-clinton-my-plan-for-helping-americas-poor.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;_r=2\">op-ed</a> in the NYT today, and there had to be a better way to explain how she planned to help the poor. I'm sure her plan actually does do it, but only because I think she has integrity, not because I understood what she was promising. I'm college-educated, and more. So if she isn't explaining it so I can understand I suspect there aren't many others who will either.&nbsp;</p><p>Too bad, because a con-man is offering us the moon and he sounds somewhat believable if you want to believe badly enough.</p>",

He is most famous for suing Gawker out of existence because they published an article saying he's gay (he is). There was nothing illegal or improper about that, so he funded a different lawsuit, probably more than one, and the judgement in that case forced Gawker to <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/8/16/12504008/univision-is-buying-gawker-media-for-135-million\">sell out</a> to a media conglomerate, and sidelined its founder <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton\">Nick Denton</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckey <a href=\"http://qz.com/789359/palmer-luckey-sold-oculus-to-facebook-fb-for-2-billion-now-hes-funding-a-group-that-shitposts-anti-hillary-clinton-memes/\">sold</a> Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion. His stake was worth $700 million. Yesterday it <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html\">came out</a> that he's using some of that wealth to fund an online&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing\">astroturf</a> campaign to make it look like there are lots of assholes who hate Hillary Clinton. These fake assholes don't exist. The joke is that if you know a little about tech, <i>very little, </i>you can make it look like they do exist.</p><p>The thing that's so galling is that the money Luckey made was based on the work we did to create a world where people could freely share ideas and life experiences. To make the world more real. To pervert it the way Luckey has is humiliating to the very technology that made him rich.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn't make wealth our first goal, though I did okay, thank you. No one needs the amount of money Thiel or Luckey have, and they are living proof of it. No one should be able to sue a publication out of existence in a country that was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\">founded</a> on free speech. And Luckey flipped it around, creating fake people with simulated&nbsp;speech. As with Thiel, using wealth he has no idea what to do with. Not that anyone with that much money would.&nbsp;</p><p>More proof that people come in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/31/1296.html\">one basic size</a>, and that if you pretend you're bigger or others tell you you're bigger, just because your bank balance has lots of digits, you're going to end up doing some awful inhuman things with it. Meanwhile we have to live in a world where they, and presumably others like them to come, throw their financial weight around in thoughtless ways.</p><p>PS: I just gave $100 at <a href=\"http://hillaryclinton.com/\">hillaryclinton.com</a>. My small way of helping undo the damage Mr Luckey did.&nbsp;</p><p>PPS:&nbsp;Palmer Luckey <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/palmer.luckey/posts/10209141115659366\">says</a> the&nbsp;&nbsp;story about him is incorrect, and he did not write the post attributed to him.</p>",

It was a remarkable piece, I don't remember seeing it at the time, I think if I had I would have written something about it.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a time capsule, and it was passionate and opinionated. Great writing.&nbsp;</p><p>At that time there was already lots of history about <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS 2.0</a>. There was a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2006/04/feed-validator/#comment-73005\">comment</a> under Matt's post linking to a <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2003/06/25/There-is-no-FAQ\">thread</a> at Sam Ruby's site that was started by a comment by me. I played a super-large role in this community, which was good and bad, it was bad in that it prevented me from even asking questions about stuff, because they would always read lots into what I said. And there was a lot of confusion at the time about what RSS was used for. I didn't understand what they didn't understand, you can see that clearly in the discussion at Ruby's site.&nbsp;</p><p>Also I wrote a <a href=\"https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/03/08/a-busy-developers-guide-to-rss-20/\">BDG for RSS 2.0</a>, something I had no memory of. Probably shouldn't have called it that. They were just some practices I used in my own feeds, and saw others using successfully, that I wanted to point out to people. I should have been more self-deprecating and less grandiose. In the comments there you can see how that created trouble.&nbsp;</p><h4>&lt;guid&gt; vs &lt;link&gt;</h4><p>One of the big controversies was what's the diff betw &lt;link&gt; and &lt;guid&gt;.&nbsp;</p><p>&lt;link&gt; came first. People were mostly using it the way I imagined &lt;guid&gt; would work, but there were exceptions, and those were legal, and they were out there, and I'm sure they wouldn't change just because some spec text changed somewhere. So if we wanted a workable way identify an item, we'd need a new element.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why both are there. As with all mature formats there's history. Some of it is less than optimal, even inelegant, but so are all systems that are deployed and work. If you don't believe me try using the NYC subway sometime.&nbsp;</p><h4>No linkrot!</h4><p><span>This is fantastic: I didn't encounter any linkrot in my travels around the RSS 2.0 discussion space. One thing you can say for blog developer types, we do archives well. With any luck it will be possible to study this community with the benefit of ten years of hindsight.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>This is just a blog post</span></h4><p>I don't have any conclusions to offer at this time, just wanted to gather these links together so I can find them again later.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>",

No clear cause and effect.&nbsp;</p><p>So here's what I know about the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>The app calls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback\">fs.writeFile</a> to save a JSON file. The file is called appPrefs.json. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/149e777648db5c410bd6dc25f0f8415f\">This</a> is what the file contains (or something like it, depending on the app) when it's working. However, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/6c8a476c879a4e344c55c3da4bc52ef3\">this</a> is what ends up in the file, very rarely, when it fails. Note that it is not valid JSON (the problem is at the end of the file) and the app can't proceed. The user is stuck until the file is fixed. Not good since very often the user is not even aware that the file exists! :-(</p><p>What appears to have happened is that the file has gotten smaller, and there's a bit of the old version of the file still hanging around after the real contents of the file.&nbsp;</p><p>This seems to indict fs.writeFile. But it's really hard to imagine it has a bug like this, intermittent or not. I've searched for any other reports like this, but haven't found anything.&nbsp;</p><p>This only seems to happen with JSON files, and only one type of JSON file, appPrefs.json. Which seems to un-indict fs.writeFile. The culprit might be <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify\">JSON.stringify</a>? Again, doesn't seem very likely. And why just this particular type of JSON file? And since the problem has yet to show up when using S3 storage, it seems to be limited to fs.writeFile or the Linux OS? (All my servers run Ubuntu.)</p><p>There are many layers to the code, distributed between the app running on the user's machine, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage\">server app</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I might try to work around it in one of two ways, that I can think of.</p><p>1. If I'm writing a file with a .json extension, after writing it, try reading and parsing it. If it fails, write it again. This would be based on the theory that the problem is in fs.writeFile.</p><p>2. Before writing any file, delete it and then call fs.writeFile. This might work if the problem is in the filesystem (I'm running on Linux).</p><p>This is the number one support problem for 1999.io, and it came up last night in screen2.io. I want to get this behind me. Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>I turned on <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/27/aPersistentButIntermittentNodejsFswritefileProblem.html\">comments</a> for this post. Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp;</p>",

It makes lower-level filesystem calls each of which is asynchronous. That's cool, usually -- unless for some reason that a request to write the same file comes in while it already has one outstanding. Then havoc can ensue as explained in this <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/4965\">note</a> on a Node.js developer site.</p><p>appPrefs.json is probably the most written-to file in an app built on <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage\">nodeStorage</a>. It's where the state of the user's system is stored. So every keystroke when editing, if the app saves your writing automatically, could result in a write to appPrefs.json. But here's an important constraint, the write can't occur more often than once a second. So if you type three keystrokes in a second, that will just generate one write, not three. And in most apps it's not even that frequent, usually there's a max of three seconds. But in some apps there is no max. So once a second writes will happen.</p><p>But add to that the time it takes for the message to be sent to the server, and intuitively it seems that the two writes can't interfere with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>But..</p><p>What if the machine is busy. What if there are a lot of users all writing at the same time. What if who knows what else determines the time it takes for a write to complete.</p><p>And if one write should happen to be triggered while the previous one hasn't completed, the file could get garbled. It says so in that note, and it explains why, convincingly.</p><p>And...</p><p>The file doesn't get screwed up very often. It happens rarely and only seems to happen with appPrefs.json, the most often-written file.&nbsp;</p><p>So...</p><p>Here's the change I made.</p><p>When I start to write a file, I add the path to the file in a JavaScript object named <i><a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage/blob/master/lib/filesystem.js#L202\">filesCurrentlyBeingWritten</a></i>. When the write completes I remove the path. And before I start the write I check to see if the file is already being written, and if so, I simply call it an error. The important thing is I don't begin a second write.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of this as a Poor Man's Semaphore. Since there is no way to tell a thread to yield in Node (as far as I know) a full semaphore system isn't possible. But the tradeoff seems reasonable.</p><p>This way the user might not get his or her appPrefs.json file updated this one time, but it won't get corrupted. No havoc. It seems unlikely anyone would even notice, because it's probably just text being saved against a different (also unlikely) app failure. In any case, losing a little data is vastly preferable to losing it all. ;-)</p><p>I'm have checked these changes into the nodeStorage repo and they will make it out to all servers that have auto-updating turned on.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: The new version is running on this blog, and so far it seems to work. Knock wood. Praise Murphy!</p>",

In the spirit of <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/presidential-debate-on-twitter-facebook-raises-ratings-participation-143623898.html\">open source</a> debates, I'm linking to a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/scripting/e6cf93411a32843ae663e5eae7341d33\">copy of the file</a> from last night. Hopefully it will survive to be part of last night's record.</p><p>Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/27/screen2ScreenShot.png\">screen shot</a> of what <a href=\"http://screen2.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://screen2.io\">screen2.io</span></a>&nbsp;looked like at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>And btw, here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/26/screen2Scheme.html\">schematic</a> that I drew while I was making it work.&nbsp;</p><p>As noted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/780609332937383937\">elsewhere</a> there was a lot of innovation around the web last night. All the hot news orgs had their own fact-checking sites running, and that included hillaryclinton.com. I don't think any of them got the combination of video and scrolling text and Twitter integration that we had going at screen2.io, but of course I'm biased.</p><p>I'm going to think about what the next steps are. There are some obvious features to add. But the real challenge will be finding events, like last night's debate, that can help bring communities together.</p><p>I like this because it feels bloggy, but as with blog software it eventually became part of the toolkit of professionals. Podcasting is going through that kind of adoption now. I really believe second-screen tech will be equally as big, and given the nature of politics now, much needed.</p><p>Blogging and then Twitter led to plenty, to what Dick Costolo <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/11/25/twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-says-events-one-thing-company-can-better/#gref\">calls</a> the \"roar of the crowd.\" Now it's time to focus on smaller groups. Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter are not the only ways to arrange people. The crowd gave us those systems, the antidote, the opposite force, will be smaller.&nbsp;</p><p>As with blogging, I hope to create software that's easy for everyone to run, so everyone gets a chance to do it, not just big news orgs. That's the spirit that drives innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>And most important think about events with embeddable video that can help drive this bootstrap.&nbsp;</p>",

            "text": "<p>As you may know I ride a bike in NYC, in Manhattan, on city streets.&nbsp;</p><p>Until a few years ago I didn't imagine anyone could do it, but the city has really embraced bike riding and there are bike lanes that go pretty much where ever you want to go.</p><p>But there are still problems.</p><p>Lots of people use the bike lanes as extra sidewalks, even when they don't have to, when the sidewalks are empty.</p><p>And cars use the bike lanes as extra lanes. They park in them. In some places it makes bike riding a lot more dangerous, because where there was room for a car and a bike before now there isn't enough room. It's especially dangerous on an uphill, where bikes are going &nbsp;slower than cars. NYC drivers are impatient enough when you're in your own lane, but when you're in theirs, even if it's because a car or truck is using the bike lane, well tough shit bike rider, some car drivers are not very understanding. It's NY culture.</p><p>There's one particularly bad place, on 54th St between 9th and 10th Aves. There is a west-east bike line on the street. And there's <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/54th-street-auto-center-inc-new-york\">54th St Auto Center</a>, that has at least five tow trucks that they park, permanently, in the bike lane. It's on an up hill, and the street gets a lot of car traffic as well as bikes. It's a good street for a bike lane, but the 54th St Auto Center has taken it over, using it as if it were private property.</p><p>What's really weird is that in the next block, between 8th and 9th Aves on 54th St is the NYPD <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_018.shtml\">Midtown North Precinct</a>. Lots of cops all the time. A few days ago I asked one was guarding a barrier on the street if he could take a look and possibly help us do something about it. Maybe if they got tickets, they would stop doing blocking the bike lane. He said he would, and it sounded like he meant it. He agreed that biking is a good thing for the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Today there were five tow trucks blocking the bike lane. So I stopped on my way past the precinct and asked a group of cops about this. They were pretty helpful. They said they do ticket them, but they just pay the tickets. \"A cost of doing business?\" I asked. Yup. They said they need to park their trucks somewhere, to which I said that we need to ride our bikes somewhere, and that's what the bike lanes are for.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly the tickets need to be more expensive.</p><p>I think if we really want bike riding to work in the city, we're going to have to start identifying the bugs in the system, and keep (friendly) pressure up with NYPD to help keep the lanes clear. Maybe instead of tickets they could tow the trucks. Take them off the road altogether. The street is not their property, it's the city's.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: Here's a Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/54th+Street+Auto+Center/@40.7664036,-73.9881047,3a,75y,98.14h,56.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sZKKQt_AznRwfZImaMZO20Q!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DZKKQt_AznRwfZImaMZO20Q%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D46.027782%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25859efc91dbb:0xb08c6d6f27d5eb97!8m2!3d40.766473!4d-73.9880097!6m1!1e1\">street view</a> of the street.

About 20 people showed up, and there were about ten people two hours later when the show ended. I don't know if they were all the same people, but some did stay for the whole thing.</p><p>While it was nice that PBS provided the embeddable stream, after about 15 minutes, the stream shut down and my browser was redirected to their site, where it picked up with the video at the place where it left off. This was too jarring. I was totally into the reality of the show by that time, and the people I was watching with. Suspension of disbelief is a very real thing, and they screwed it up for us. Why? I welcome comments from people at PBS if they are listening, and would like to provide feedback -- don't do this.&nbsp;</p><p>It was noted that they had a version of the video on YouTube, so in the future when there's a Frontline episode we want to do this with, we'll use the YouTube version.</p><p>Here's a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/29/screen2today.png\">screen shot</a> of the <a href=\"http://screen2.io\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://screen2.io\">screen2.io</span></a>&nbsp;app this morning, after the party.</p><p>It works better with live events that start at a well-known pre-set time. The debate was perfect. The next <a href=\"http://debate.longwood.edu/\">debate</a> is for the VPs, next Tuesday, Oct 4, and we'll try it again for that one. And the second presidential debate on the following Sunday, Oct 9.</p><p>I wish the NBA or MLB would try this, I'd love to see what we can do with the live broadcast of a sporting event.</p><p>Thanks to the steady contributors. The people are the thing. We have a critical mass. I really enjoyed having them there while I was watching. This is a classic bootstrap. Without interested people nothing happens.&nbsp;</p><p>We now have the ability to easily selectively send cross-posts to Twitter, and it worked perfectly, exactly the way I hoped it would. I don't think the Twitter followers were confused. I got some replies and RTs over there, even though I was primarily talking to the people on screen2.io.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: After I wrote the title for this piece, I had to go register <a href=\"http://watchparty.io/\">watchparty.io</a>. Too good to pass up. I think online watch parties are going to be a big thing.&nbsp;</p>",

A real, living democracy draws on the talents of <i>all</i> of its citizens. Problems in press coverage are not \"owned\" by journalists or people like me who study journalism. Contributions can come from anywhere. That's the way I see it, and that's the way Ward Cunningham saw it. Everyone has a stake in this election. Everyone's talents are needed to survive it.</blockquote><p>That's of course been <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/03/17/ifYouDontLikeTheNews.html\">my</a> <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInterne.html#17\">theme</a> too.

He's an anti-hero like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Soprano\">Tony Soprano</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)\">Walter White</a>. He's weak and flawed and evil, but somehow some people identify with him. I wonder if anyone has done a poll and seen if the deciding factor in supporting Trump is whether or not you watched him on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(U.S._TV_series)\">The Apprentice</a>. I don't and didn't.</p><p>They make an important point. We know the TV characters much better than we know the candidates. But we can talk about them effectively using the characters as communication tools.&nbsp;</p><p>An aside, that was what was so valuable about the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/video/2365848966/\">Frontline episode</a> we <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/29/notesFromLastNightsScreen2WatchParty.html\">watched</a>. It's the interweaved biographies of Hillary and Donald going back to childhood. They tell a story I hadn't heard before. When Bill Clinton was in the Rose Garden giving another apology, this time after his <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/senate-acquits-president-bill-clinton-1999-article-1.2109502\">acquittal</a> by the Senate, a historic and dramatic scene, she was upstairs in a conference room with aides, and a map of New York State spread out, planning her own life <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/06/04/senate.2000/hrc.senate/\">independent</a> of Bill. And we're coming up to the season finale of the story that started that day. Next we'll find out if it ends like The Sopranos, or if it gets renewed for another season.</p><h4>Hillary as a TV character</h4><p>Hillary Clinton, like Trump, is already a TV character, but she didn't craft her own persona.&nbsp;</p><p>She's like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Florrick\">Alicia Florrick</a> in The Good Wife, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope\">Leslie Knope</a> in Parks and Recreation, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Flick\">Tracy Flick</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_(1999_film)\">Election</a>. A more dark interpretation of Hillary is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Underwood\">Claire Underwood</a> in House of Cards.&nbsp;</p><p>The character that really connects, imho, is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmela_Soprano\">Carmela Soprano</a>, the mob boss's wife.&nbsp;<span>There's a scene in The Sopranos when Carmela and her mob wife friends actually discuss HIllary Clinton. I'm so glad they found this at Run-up, and it's also on YouTube. Kick back and enjoy it, it's utterly perfect.&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqlfgMIZlSw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

That it is.</p><p>One of the reasons we stopped investing in ping servers is that the size of the tech blogosphere overwhelmed anyone's ability to keep up with it.</p><p>But as things have quieted down now, all of a sudden some of the things we did on the way up make sense again.</p><p>And what's cool is that servers are now much cheaper and we know better how to scale apps. So the services we created in the early days of blogging will go further. Probably much further.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This reminds me of the arguments about market share in what were assumed to be the last days of the Mac in the early 90s when Windows was surging. I said then who cares, there are more Macs than ever now, if it was a good-size market last year then it's even better this year.

The American Zombie Party.</blockquote><p>This is the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-problem-with-trump-isnt-his-debating-skills?mbid=social_twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter\">piece</a> in the New Yorker that inspired the outburst. And the specific excerpt:</p><blockquote>Yet Trump continued [in the debate] his self-congratulations for compelling the President to [provide his birth certificate], along with the grotesquely racist notion that it was “good for him” (i.e., for the President). It slowly dawned on the listener that this was all of a piece with the rest of Trump’s racial attitudes: he believes that, as a rich white man, he had a right to stop and frisk the President of the United States and demand that the uppity black man show him his papers. Stop-and-frisk isn’t just a form of policing for Trump; it’s a whole way of life. The idea that he had a right to force a black man to go through what Obama rightly saw as the demeaning business of producing his birth certificate showed his fundamental contempt for any normal idea of racial equality. It was of a line with his equally bizarre notion that owning a country club that doesn’t actively discriminate against black people is not a minimal requirement of law but a positive achievement of the owner. This isn’t the case of someone misarticulating an otherwise plausible position; it was just a case of someone repeating, once again, not only a specific racist lie but also the toxic underlying set of assumptions that produced it.</blockquote><h4>We still have a choice</h4><p>The world that Trump grew up in, the one that I grew up in only ten years later, was like this. Enough people remember it. First a black president, now a woman president. That's a lot of change to swallow.</p><p>As you get older you can take one of two approaches to the world.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ol><li><span>This is my last hurrah and if I don't get my way now I never will. Or,</span></li><li><span>I don't personally have a stake in the future, but I care about others, and want to leave the world better than I found it, in any way possible.</span></li></ol><p></p><p>To think that all white men are responsible for the continued dominance of white men, is to miss that as individuals we still have this choice. No one has to be committed to the first approach, they can change. When presented with such a gross caricature of white maleness as Trump, we can say no fucking way, this isn't me. I'm human, I care. My choice is to help my friends, family, other members of my species, the earth that gave us life.</p><p>The confusion over Black Lives Matter, that it doesn't in any way devalue other types of lives, is also true of the dominance of white males in politics and economics. Not being dominant doesn't mean we don't count. However it does mean that when we have a clear choice of competence vs incompetence, we can choose a woman over a man. That our loyalty is to the union of all the people, not just to gender and race.</p>",

I was looking for a way to export all the files as text files.

I finally <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/04/endingAnExperiment.html\">gave up</a> on trying to get them to turn it into a decent blogging surface. Without links, simple styles, titles and podcasts, it was stifling my online writing to try to make it fit into Facebook's limits. If I were them I'd be embarrassed. It's 2016. That shit was innovative in 1992. Facebook is a very serious step backward.</p><p>So instead of full text, my posts <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/486563118217765?pnref=story\">appear</a> as links. And now going to Facebook has become a much less interesting thing. I decided that's fine. Perfect in fact. They decided that they don't want me to have an interesting time there, by imposing the limits. So I'll create my own fun. It'll take some time, but what's the rush. ;-)</p><p>When <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/14/eatdrinkandbejerry.html\">Jerry died</a> in 1995, I wrote:</p><blockquote>Like the big tree that fell last March, the death of a huge human being like Jerry Garcia frees up a huge amount of space. Once there was a tree, now there are seedlings. After the sadness, there will be huge creativity.</blockquote><p>Same would probably be true if Facebook ever relented and stopped stifling the web and embraced it instead. Then the growth could flow through them instead of around them. Ultimately I think the web will go on, treating Facebook like the outage that it has chosen to be.</p><p>PS: It's worth mentioning that my posts still appear in full text on mobile, with styling and links using <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/04/13/1182.html\">Instant Articles</a>. That I get zero engagement on those is also interesting. Not one comment, ever. Zero. <i>All</i> the engagement apparently was coming through the web version of Facebook.</p>",

They are imho making a bad&nbsp;bet on the ability of internal development at Twitter to generate the breakthrough needed so that Twitter can achieve its destiny (no sarcasm) as the News System of the Future.&nbsp;</p><p>I've said many times over the years that Twitter is at least the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site%3Ascripting.com%20prototype%20%22news%20system%20of%20the%20future%22%20twitter\">prototype</a> of the news system of the future. Now I'd go a step further and say it <i>is</i> the news system of the future.</p><p>It is. Maybe just for the moment, but all news happens on Twitter these days. I once thought it was extreme to predict that the entire Congress would be made up of blogger and tweeters, but now the presidential campaign of 2016 is happening on Twitter. O<span>ther parts of the Internet are important too. But the center of news flow is Twitter.&nbsp;</span></p><p>It's a layer of the Internet. And the company must let it be that. The business model should be like that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services\">AWS</a>. If you want to build an app on their infrastructure, you pay per message sent. Set up a banking system to make it easy for app devs to collect revenue from users.&nbsp;</p><p>And link storage to each Twitter account, the way Amazon does with S3. Developers use the storage for their apps.</p><p>And boom a new app type is born. An app that lives entirely in the cloud and is EASY TO WRITE.&nbsp;</p><p>The easy part is important for the millions of new programmers who will come online in the next few years.</p><p>And btw, do the same as Apple did with schools and universities in the early days of the Mac. For students the service is virtually free.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the kind of reorg that Twitter needs. Undo the mistakes of earlier management, when they moved away from developers. If you're looking for the analog to Apple, and everyone always is, this is similar to how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs\">Steve Jobs</a> undid the licensing deals done by Spindler.</p><p>Twitter should be the platform that developers love. It doesn't have to change the way the current management thinks it does. It just has to do much more of what it already does.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: I've always encouraged the news industry to care about what happens in the tech industry, as it's clear the two are merging in interesting ways. This transaction matters to journalism. I hope the thinkers and visionaries of news are paying attention.</p>",

It's not private, don't upload anything with information in it that you don't want made public. 2. No guarantees that anything will come of it, nor what will come from it.

Bumgarner stayed in. And as with the Toronto-Baltimore game the night before, a three-run late-inning home run, which would have been bedlam in Flushing had the Mets hit it, knocked the wind out of the New York faithful. A few ne'er-do-wells in the row in front of us, wearing freshly bought Mets clothing, left after that half inning. How like Los Angeles I said to my fellow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Noahsyndergaard/status/783896639626940417\">heart-broken</a> Metsies. What weak <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy&amp;oq=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.6759j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">philosophy</a>. Good riddance I muttered under my breath. They probably are secretly Yankees fans.</p><p>We all stayed till the bitter end, and watched the opposing team celebrate on our field. This is the first time Citi Field has been so defiled. We had to tear down Shea Stadium because it was host to the infidels, the New Jork Jankees, who celebrated their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_World_Series#Game_5\">world crown</a> on our field. Call out the bulldozers, so say we all. It's time to tear this baby down.&nbsp;</p><p>No such fate awaits the current home of the Mets. The Giants won the game, fair and square. But the news reports that say the Mets were humbled are unfair and just plain wrong. The Mets were in the game all the way to the bottom of the ninth. Our ace, the only uninjured pitching star in the Mets season-starting rotation, was unhittable. Curtis Granderson made a circus catch in center field, the kind of thing that makes postseason baseball so incredibly intense. The Mets threatened to score a couple of times, if you were generous in your estimation, but they were still our team, always. The Giants? Good luck with the Cubbies. It would be nice to see a match between Los Angeles and San Francisco. For now, I'm going to focus on presidential sports.</p>",

Then 2008, the crash, and I figured at that point Americans had surely woken up. We elected Obama. We're on our way back! I figured at that point it couldn't revert. But it did. The people who were bitter then are even worse off now, I guess, and they are looking for someone to blame. They're white, so people of color, Muslims, Mexicans, blacks, of course, are who they blame. Which brings out the anti-semitism and we're off to the races.</p><p>On Friday we learn that after all the things Trump did, the one that causes his fellow Repubs to jump ship is that he boasted of sexual assault, on camera, in a very Trumpian way. <i>That's</i> it? After calling for the assassination of his opponent? Refusing to disavow support from the KKK? Giving comfort to the enemy? Pussygate is what causes his downfall? I doubted it then, I still doubt it now. I think that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/785125865520783360\">Josh Marshall</a> called it. Trump is certain to lose and the Repubs are trying to salvage what's left of their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, he did okay in the debate, so maybe the Republicans will get back on board..&nbsp;</p><p>But did he do okay in the debate?</p><p>Now he's <a href=\"http://www.memeorandum.com/161010/p33#a161010p33\">saying</a>&nbsp;that he'll put his opponent in jail when he's elected. He said it in front of millions of Americans. That is imho disqualifying. The Repubs should be denouncing that. But I have a feeling that instead they're going to just ignore it.</p><p>When did the Repubs decide that their careers matter more than the country? How could they swing back to him just because his bluster fit the template of a Repub presidential candidate? Never mind that his talk was a nonsense word salad of sniffs and barks and threats to dissent.&nbsp;</p><p>We are truly fucked.&nbsp;</p>",

I want to tell you about it, with comments mixed in on Jay's approach, to the extent that I understand it.</p><p>I created a new blogging tool that is <a href=\"http://blog.1999.io/2016/06/01/0028.html\">designed</a> to be as easy to write for as Twitter and Facebook. There's a text box at the top of the page. Start typing in it. That's how you create a new post. But you can go past 140 chars. You can go really long. And unlike Facebook, you can link to other places on the web, you can style text, or add a podcast. Posts can have titles.</p><p><span>The thing I learned is there is no reason you can't use this kind of \"quick\" tool to write \"serious\" posts. As a software designer, this is an important observation. So you'll see posts of all length on my blog.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I'm not sure if this would work for Jay though. His PressThink posts are more substantial than even my most ambitious post. I rarely spend more than an hour writing a post. I see blogging as fresco writing. If I have more to say about a topic, I write a new post and link back to the previous one. This isn't optimized for readers, I know, but it does make it more likely I will write something. So in a way that's there for the readers too.</span></p><p><span>So maybe Jay needs two separate spaces.</span></p><p><span>But -- as a reader, who primarily finds out about Jay's new stuff through his feed, now the newest quickest bits of Jay-wisdom are not available to me unless I visit his site? Or is there another feed to subscribe to? This is something I imagine Jay should think about, because I bet a lot of people read his stuff in the feed as opposed to \"visiting\" the website.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, I could see some long-time followers of Jay, the most vocal ones of course, saying they don't like change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I have blown through those objections many times in the past, and no doubt have lost readers because of it. People ask me to do a separate feed for podcasts, but I won't. It falls under the same idea of \"if it's too much work I won't do it,\" something I've observed about myself. I often won't use my own tools if it takes me too far off course. It's the web lifestyle, quick multi-tasking. It's too late for me to get off that train.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin\">Dan Bricklin</a>, imho, had the canonical observation on this topic.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>You look for software features that reward you for using them one percent of the time, and unfortunately there are a lot of products that penalize you for not using them 100 percent of the time.</blockquote><p><span>He was commenting on a feature I was trying to create that would make it super-easy to categorize my posts. I couldn't discipline myself to do it regularly, I figured if I over-designed it for quickness, that I might get myself to do it. Nope. Still my writing will only be categorized well if an algorithm does it for me (which seems totally doable).</span></p><p><span>Back to the short-posts thing. What's funny is I had this problem totally solved in the period before Twitter. The home page of my blog could have short items and long ones. The long ones were also archived on separate pages, with comments. The short ones had permalinks that took you to the archive page for the day. It really worked because I had a tool that made it really fluid. And it was pretty good for reading and it all flowed through the feed. Twitter kind of broke that up. And Google Reader finished the job. ;-)</span></p><p><span>An aside, I've always felt posting on WordPress involved too much thought on how to get the software to do what you want. The most common thing for a blogging tool is to create a new post. It is also the barrier to entry. Which says to me that writing should be up front and everything else should be subordinate to it.</span></p><p><span>Jay has identified a space that has gone underserved since Twitter became the place where our short posts go, and our blogs focused on long-form writing to please Google Reader. And more important, he's experimenting with solutions. I hope more people do this as well.</span></p><p>PS: I could only find one reference to Dan's quote, in an <a href=\"http://scripting.com/myTwitterProfile/davewiner/rebootNews/rss.xml\">archive</a> of an RSS feed for the podcast Jay and I used to do! It must be out there somewhere else?</p>",

But to the people inside the family, it's just normal, it's life as usual.</p><p>A story...</p><p>I once dated a woman, I'm not going to say her real name, so let's call her Beth. An attractive, smart woman. I met her at a workshop and we hit it off. We went out a few times and it became a relationship, if you know what I mean.</p><p>She invited me to spend the weekend at a house her family owned in the mountains north of San Francisco. She had two brothers, and that weekend they were there too. It was a large house.</p><p>Something weird was going on. The brothers were incredibly rude to her, and then after a bit it started to get physical. They would bump into her. Push her. Not exactly hitting her, but the contact was deliberate, and clearly not affectionate. They called her ugly names.&nbsp;</p><p>Privately I asked her what was up. She said they had always been like that and I shouldn't worry about it. But I did! I wanted to say something to the men, hey Beth is a good person, stop fucking around. But there were two of them, and it wasn't my family and it didn't seem to bother her. So I didn't say or do anything.</p><p>We spent the weekend apart from them. We ate by ourselves. Went for hikes, went to a movie in town.&nbsp;</p><p>But I never saw her the same way. I was aware this was happening to me, that something was shifting, and I tried to figure it out. The way her brothers treated her still disturbs me to this day. But to her, and presumably to them, it was normal family life. Each of them had their role to play. Her role was to be the outsider, part of the family, but not really.</p><p>I wonder where this behavior originated. Did their father have a sister who the family treated this way? Was the mother a sister of brothers who they pushed around? How does a family get to a place where this is normal?</p><p>I mention this now because I see friends trying to figure out Donald Trump. The answer is that we have no insight into what happened in the house he grew up in. What his relationship was like with his parents and siblings. We have little clues, but it's likely even DJT himself couldn't tell you much about it. He doesn't seem like the type of person who has done a lot of self-discovery and digging through his past. It seems as if he just accepted what was given to him as the normal way things are.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2005/09/08.html#When:9:06:36AM\">September 2005</a>: \"Ask a fish to describe water.

I mean if beings in human-like bodies could be intelligent robots, why not mere pieces of software flying around at the speed of light over a computer network?</p><p>This is of course one of the reasons geeks loved Battlestar Galactica so much.

Why wouldn't they. And even if the emails weren't disclosed, they could still be useful to the hackers.

            "text": "<p>On John Naughton's <a href=\"http://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2016/10/18/23550\">blog</a>, a link to an <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1208056?journalCode=rjop20&amp;\">article</a> that suggests it might have been a mistake for news orgs to go \"digital first.\" Why? Most of the readers and money are still in the print versions of the news.</p><p>A disclaimer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnnaughton\">Naughton</a> occupies a warm spot in my heart because he was the only print journalist to acknowledge the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/12/happy-20th-anniversary-dave-winer-inventor-of-the-blog\">20-year anniversary</a> of the blog. None of the other great news orgs thought it was newsworthy, either when it happened, or 10 or 20 years hence. That might appear random, but actually it's not.</p><p>See it's not exactly a good controlled test they've done in journalism-land, which is more of a <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=priesthood\">priesthood</a> than a hotbed of innovation. Yes, there were some journalists in the early days of the web who thought it would revolutionize their art, I even learned from them early-on in an experiment I did with the striking <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/11/07/davesautomatedwebster.html\">San Francisco newspapers</a>. But for the most they have gone to the Internet with a feeling of necessity not wonder. You almost never hear a journalist or a journalism exec speak of all the possibilities that open up with electronic distribution, in the way a tech person ponders the exciting future opening up in front of them.</p><p>The big missed opportunity of electronic distribution of news is that there is no cost of goods. You can include as much content as there is. And therefore you can let the sources, esp ones who are good writers, and who have an ability to put their own interests aside, and write passionately about the issues and opportunities of the day, speak directly to the readers, without having reporters filter and dumb-down what they say. If you've ever had the experience of being interviewed by a reporter and then see how your thoughts are expressed, you know how valuable it would be sometimes to cut out the middleman. They go for the salacious, try to make you look like a hypocrite, on the theory (I guess) that that sells subscriptions. Why should I as a reader care if it sells subscriptions? I read in order to be informed and inspired (and yes, titillated and amused).</p><p>As with everything, the net offers the opportunity to disintermediate. But journalism has instead approached the Internet as the electronic equivalent of the paper distribution system. Nothing more than that. So why should we be surprised if it fails to achieve the potential promised by the hype?</p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something\">Upton Sinclair</a> once said:&nbsp;\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!\"</p><p>Imho, that is exactly what's been happening in journalism.</p><p>Once blogging took hold, there was no excuse for reporters and their bosses to not see the opportunity to help the sources to go directly to the readers. We're still waiting for journalism to embrace that opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that other activities online haven't stagnated the way news has. Discussions (Facebook), singles (Tinder), classifieds (eBay), Amazon, airlines, pornography, gaming, entertainment, politics -- all have all embraced online distribution, and all those activities are forever changed.</p><p>And even news hasn't waited for the news industry. It happens on Twitter now. Why didn't one of the established news orgs see the opportunity to give newsmakers a platform from which to make news? Instead it happened by accident, to a tech org that still doesn't understand how revolutionary what they've created is.</p><p>Sometimes it's good to flip a statement around and see if it makes sense. \"Journalism will always be printed on dead trees.\" How does that sound? Does that even begin to make sense?&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, when the web started carrying news I noticed that my print subscriptions to the NYT and WSJ were staying unread, so I cancelled them. I can't even read a printed newspaper anymore. I've tried. I used to have a ritual where I'd buy a printed paper for a plane flight, or treated myself to breakfast out with a printed newspaper. Last time I did it, I took out my iPhone and read the news there instead. It just works better electronically. I can't imagine ever going back.</p><p>PS: The study cited by Naughton in his blog post is also cited in this <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/newspapers-digital-first-214363\">story</a> by Jack Shafer on Politico.</p>",

A car weaves in and out of the bike lane in front of me and forces me to hit the brakes to avoid getting hit by him. This is a dangerous move, if you brake too hard you go over the handlebars. Not a good thing, it happened to me a couple of years ago and I was in bed for a week. Lots of blood.&nbsp;</p><p>But I didn't go down, and continued west till I came to a red light and I could see the car that cut me off waiting for the light. As I passed I tapped his window and said he cut me off, very loudly so he and everyone else could hear. This is the kind of loop-close you dream of. Usually the cars just speed away and you're left with all that anger and adrenaline in your blood and nothing to do with it.</p><p>So I pull up about four car lengths in front of him and wait for the light to change. I hear him getting out of the car, and I think oh shit what if he's a big guy, but I see he's not. He's a little creepy dude.&nbsp;</p><p>As he approaches, he pulls a familiar west coast passive-hostile line.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Why all the aggression?\"&nbsp;</p><p>Deep breath. I said firmly \"Because you almost killed me.\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Oh I get it. I have all this metal around me, and your bumper is your skeleton, so I'm sorry I almost killed you.\" He gets back in the car and we're all okay.</p><p>But that isn't what happened.</p><p>Instead..</p><p>He said \"I want to give you a hug.\"&nbsp;</p><p>To which I thought, my god a hug is the absolute last thing I want from this piece of shit. I want him to implode and disappear from the face of the earth, or at least get back in his fucking car. But he comes and hugs me. What can I do? Strangle him? I'd go to jail. So I had to let this piece of shit do his thing. And the whole ride and the rest of the day I couldn't get this ugly feeling of having been invaded by something vile and corrupt.&nbsp;</p><p>And that was just an unwanted hug.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want to even think what it would be like if it was more than that. And yes, I had the option at any time of snapping his neck, an option most women don't have.&nbsp;</p><p>So I have a small idea, a very small idea of how awful it can be.</p>",

My mood goes up and down with the percentage chance that Hillary Clinton will win.&nbsp;</p><p>I've always wondered what exactly does the number mean?</p><p>Look at it this way. If the polls accurately measure people's votes, then there is <i>zero</i> probability that she will lose, because the votes add up to enough electoral votes to win the election.&nbsp;</p><p>So why is there a non-zero chance of her winning?&nbsp;<span>What could happen that would cause her to lose if the chance of winning is accurate at approx 84 percent?</span></p><p>I gave this some thought and listened to Tuesday's edition of the <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/10332.html\">Run-up podcast</a> and came up with this way of expressing it.</p><p><i>The polls do <b>not</b> accurately measure people's votes.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Here are some ways errors are introduced.</p><p></p><ul><li><span>Pollsters don't weigh demographics accurately. They make assumptions about what percentage of voters will be white or black; Hispanic or Asian; college-educated or not; rural, urban or suburban; rich, middle-class or poor, etc. Those assumptions are wrong. That's a fact. How wrong? That's part of the uncertainty.</span></li><li><span>People don't always tell the truth. </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">The Bradley Effect</a><span>. They tell the pollster something that makes them feel good about themselves (I'm voting for Mother Teresa) but in the end they vote for someone bad (Adolf Hitler).</span></li><li><span>People change their minds. Something happens, a new leaked email shows that Hillary has a nasty habit that we think is awful and disqualifies her. Or Trump turns out to be a sexual predator (oops that's already factored in).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Who is likely to vote? A poll respondent who isn't going to vote won't be part of the result, but they might be counted in the polling. You can't simply take them at their word. How should you weigh that?</span></li></ul><p></p><p>The statisticians at FiveThirtyEight know about these errors, based on past experience with polling vs actual elections, and have theories about how much they affect the outcome. And that's weighed against how close it is. If 9 of every 10 respondents say they are going to vote for Clinton, no matter how big the errors are, they're going to say she's got a near-lock on the election. Not much chance the errors could be so big as to turn that kind of polling into a losing result. On the other hand if it's just 6 of 10 then the errors matter a lot and the election becomes a tossup, \"within the margin of error,\" a pollster might say.</p><p>So when they say it's an 84 percent likely Clinton win, that means the numbers overwhelmingly say she's going to win, enough to give the statistician a lot of confidence in the prediction. How much? 84 percent. Heh.</p>",

He seemed like a nice guy, and even though our politics at that time were opposite, I thought it was nice that we got along.</p><p>Over the years however he has gone more and more off the deep end. If he has any knowledge or intelligence, he's suppressing it. I guess it's a business model?</p><p>I let it slide, there are a lot of jerks in right wing blogging. But <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2016/10/on-accepting-election-results.php\">this howler</a> on his site got me thinking. Like a lot of others in right wing media, he's comparing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_election_recount\">recount</a> in Florida in the 2000 election with the 2016 election.</p><p>There is no comparison. Gore didn't contest the results of the election, everyone did. I can say that with some authority because I voted Republican in that election. I wanted Bush to win. And I remember the torture leading up to the Supreme Court decision, which we all felt, not just Gore. And I applauded him when he conceded, saying he took one for the country.</p><p>That race hinged on which way Florida went, and it was a virtual tie. A few hundred votes either way made the difference. And there were enough voting irregularities in that election so that the outcome was in question.</p><p><span>Nothing like that has happened in this election. For crying out loud we haven't even </span><i>had</i><span> the election yet!&nbsp;</span></p><p>Where Gore showed grace, Trump is putting his own greed ahead of our democracy. He is the opposite of grace. He's not taking one for the country, he's forcing the country to take one for him. So what if we have a 240-year tradition of peaceful transfers of power. Anything to keep himself in the news. Even shitting on the continuity of our government.&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder what it will take to get the Hinderakers of the world to sober up.

You end up being pitched on things you already have or things you don't want. Occasionally they hit the bulls eye and offer you something you really want. But that doesn't happen often.&nbsp;</p><p><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing\">3D printing</a> is an example of Doc's VRM idea. The vendor provides the means of manufacturing, you specify exactly what you want. The product is created, sent to you, and theoretically you're happy and the vendor makes a profit. But it depends on the customer becoming a product designer. I might not want to do that. I might just want the perfect product and am willing to pay for someone else, an expert, to design it for me.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Responsive advertising</span></h4><p>A more satisfying version of VRM goes like this.</p><p>I am watching a lot of TV these days, with the election and World Series, and the NBA season starting on Tuesday. I like my couch, but since I'm spending so much time on it, maybe it could be optimized. Or maybe I could add a new piece of furniture specifically for TV watching.&nbsp;</p><p>How this works in the post-VRM world: I find a way to express the desire, and make it available to vendors, either making it public or putting it somewhere the vendors I've authorized can access. Their bots scan all the requests as they come online, decide if they have a product that might fit the bill. If so, they send me a proposal, otherwise known as an ad.&nbsp;</p><p>But it's different from the ads we have today, it's <i>responsive,</i> to borrow a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design\">term</a> from web design. They know what I'm looking for, because I told them, and it can present itself to me in that context.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p>Other things I would put in my VRM outbox --</p><p></p><ul><li><span>I'm always thinking about a new place to live, here's what I'm dreaming about now. A place where I can afford a house with a hot tub and a pool, reasonably close to a major airport and at least one good university. Good bike riding. Nearby friends. Also if you find any AirBnB-type rentals in such a place, let me know, because it'd be great to try it out before doing something more permanent.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I'm tired of the usual computer conferences. I don't want to pick up a new skill, or meet programmers, or venture capitalists. I'm interested in academic-style conferences about the convergence of news and technology. Or a conference about creating online spaces for reasonable people in red states and blue states to discuss the issues of the day in a civilized manner. I don't mind meeting other programmers and investors in that context, btw.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I am tall, but my legs are average size. I have a very large torso. I have trouble finding a good fall or spring jacket that fits. No problem in summer (no jacket needed) or winter, (bulky jackets are fine). It's that inbetween season that's awkward. Send me a catalog of choices.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I have </span><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/20/aVrComputerMonitor.html\">newly configured vision</a><span>. I have yet to find reading glasses that work well for computer use. I know there are people with experience with this, are there any vendors who specialize in such products?</span></li></ul><p></p><p>These are just examples meant to illustrate the idea. I think when this idea is fully realized it'll feel something like a search engine combined with email-based alerts. And because it's centered on commerce, on money changing hands, there should be plenty of investor money available. Yet I don't see any evidence that investment is flowing this way.&nbsp;</p><p>Someday commerce will work like this and it will be as revolutionary in comparison to today's net-based shopping as it was to physical-world shopping a few years ago.</p><p>BTW, on a humorous note, you could think of this post as a VRM query for VRM itself.</p>",

When they say this is the best keyboard or router, I very often buy it, sight-unseen. The Bluetooth <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-on-or-over-ear-headphones/\">headphones</a> they recommended are my favorite. I've bought a second pair (the first was spoiled in a rainstorm) and get them as gifts for friends. They really are <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/25/0710.html\">that good</a> and are also a good <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-MOVE-Wireless-Bluetooth-blue/dp/B00MR96TFW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477337890&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=jabra+headphones+bluetooth\">deal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I view Wirecutter as my gadget-savvy friend. I have one in real-life, David Jacobs, who started the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1997/05/fetish-43/\">Fetish</a> column in the early days of Wired. When you know someone who knows what's good and can tell you why, just do what they say. It's a way of benefiting from their know-how without having to attain it yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel the same way about NYT reviews. If a movie gets a Critic's Choice from the Times, I go see it. Even if I end up not liking the movie, and that does happen, I still feel it's interesting to see how my point of view differed from theirs.&nbsp;</p><p>If they got a cut from the sale of a movie ticket, I have no problem with that. I am pretty confident that their recommendation would be the same, either way -- as I am confident in Wirecutter. And it's&nbsp;<span>good because it helps flow cash through the NYT and the readers know that, but as long as they're finding you good products, this is exactly the kind of stuff you like to pay for.</span></p><p>And maybe along the line, their editors will discover niches where there <i>should</i> be products, but aren't. It's good to write those things up too, and some of them could be projects the NYT Co could invest in.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're gathering the best information first, that can have a lot of benefits, beyond getting people to pay for subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>It's good to see the Times find other businesses that make more sense online than they did in print. Wirecutter and the things that follow from it are certainly one example of such a business.</p>",

I think they could probably make it so one candidate wins and the other loses. Is that rigging? Yes, I think it is.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I agree with many of the things they say about rigged elections. But I don't think it was a secret, so if you entered the race in 2015, thinking you'd run for president, you don't get to call a do-over just because it is what it obviously was. That's bad sportsmanship. We wouldn't tolerate it in the NFL or NBA, why should we put up with it in politics?</span></p><h4><span>Social media mirrors what's said on TV</span></h4><p>On social media, a lot of what you see are just rehashes of what's said on the cable news talk shows. And they just rehash the same talking points over and over. Someone should make a list of them. Basic common-sense ideas that people say to fill the time. It feels at times like its an opera, with each singer asked to sing a part at various times by the conductor, Chris Matthews or John Dickerson or Rachel Maddow.</p><p>I guess that's journalism? Seems it fits the basic definition. It's not imho good journalism, but that isn't the point. (It's not good because questions that concern voters often don't get asked, just questions that concern insiders. Which causes all discourse, even among voters, to center on insider issues.)</p><h4>What is journalism?</h4><p>Then you have to ask the obvious question -- what is journalism? Here goes..</p><p>You can look at journalism as a process that yields a result. It begins with an interest or a question. Are young blacks voting for Hillary? Find young black people, ask them. Get expert opinions -- talk to pollsters and sociologists. All the time you're doing searches, read what people say on Twitter or their blogs. Write it all up, edit it, add pictures, maybe a video, give it a title, hit Publish. Feedback. Corrections. A process that yields a result, the mechanics of journalism.</p><p>Of course journalism is also a set of ethical rules. If you have an interest in the topic you're writing about, disclose it. Include context so you reflect not only what the person said, but also their intent. Never include something you know to be false without saying so.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: This piece was inspired by a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/10/citizen-journalism-is-a-catastrophe-itll-only-get-worse.html?mid=twitter_nymag\">passionate essay</a> in New York Mag about \"citizen journalism.\" I think the author is correct, but the amateurs are doing it the way the pros do it.&nbsp;</p>",

Did he try? Did he invite them to a meeting at the White House to discuss policy? If not, why? Afraid to go over the heads of the Republican leaders in Congress? I think they made it pretty clear early-on there was nothing to lose in doing that.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things he said in the video which is still true today is that there is a remarkable confluence of economics that pretty much solves all the problems that Trump has taken advantage of in this election.</p><p>1. Unemployment in manufacturing jobs in the US.</p><p>2. Low interest rates.</p><p>3. Need for infrastructure investment.</p><p>If you laid it out to Limbaugh et al, sought their opinions, as galling as it might be to do so, perhaps that would help break the logjam? Offer them jobs consulting with the new Department of Infrastructure. It's a sort of bribery of course, but relative to the benefit for the economy the price is small. (I can't imagine Al Sharpton would like it though.)</p><p>Anyway, assuming this never happened, perhaps Hillary Clinton, if she is elected, can reach out to them.&nbsp;Also the Koch's and Shelley Adelson too. And the billionaire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer_(businessman)\">hedge fund guy</a> who's backing Trump. The worst they can do is say no.</p><p>To the purists who say you can't do business with these guys, you're wrong. You have to. They have power. If you want to get something done, they can help or hurt. We've had plenty of presidents come to Washington saying they're going to \"drain the swamp.\" This is not a new idea. They always fail. You can pretend that it was possible they wouldn't but it's not.</p>",

I wrote my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/26/trumpInHisOwnWords.html\">review</a>&nbsp;in an earlier post. It's all about Trump's personality, based on audio interviews conducted two years ago, before he was running for president. No surprises, exactly, but some blank areas filled in.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people, not everyone, feel as Trump does. Not enough recognition for my contributions. The key is to realize other people feel this way, not just you. And you can be their source of recognition. Spread a little happiness. Just recognize someone. \"I see you,\" or some variant of that.</p><p>I know that many people feel too miserable to do that. \"I can't recognize someone else until I myself am recognized.\" But it doesn't actually work that way. The surprise you'll feel when you say something kind, at random, is actually a great form of recognition.</p><p>Remember, each of us is a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/19/yourManyVoices.html\">community of voices</a> inside. The place we're searching for love is in that community, basically inside ourselves. But you can ease those voices into self-acceptance, by simply accepting others, and in doing so help your set an example for your internal voices.</p><p>Once, when I was picking discussion leaders for a conference my boss asked if I knew that I would be helping people's careers by giving them such an honor. I remember being surprised at this. It had never occurred to me that I had that power. I imagined then that there were many times I had the power, but just didn't realize it.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wrote the You Are Many Voices <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/19/yourManyVoices.html\">piece</a>, a correspondent wrote back (link is long-gone, sorry) that he has that too, but the voices all get together when he plays music.

You can keep making Vines. Nothing changes.</p><h4>Disclaimer #1: This was written very quickly</h4><p>Sorry for typos and mistakes and fantasies.</p><h4>Disclaimer #2: This section is pure fantasy...</h4><p>This announcement is the product of a meeting where some exec said we have to kill some products to go with the layoffs, what can we kill? He or she goes to the whiteboard, and asks for names of products. Little non-strategic things come up, then the boss writes Vine. Because Jack told them to do that, or it was Jack at the whiteboard.</p><p>This happened because at the board meeting they said we have to cut back on something, and they decided it would be Vine, probably because they don't use it and the numbers aren't growing, or they don't have an ad strategy for it, or the person running Vine isn't popular inside the company.&nbsp;</p><p>That's how decisions like this get made.</p><h4>Back to reality</h4><p>Of course there are so many problems in cutting off a service, that the best they could do is <i>announce</i> they're cutting it off, not actually cut it off.</p><p>A better approach would have been to find a buyer for Vine, they must have tried this and failed. The stench of Twitter now among investors is a powerful repellant.</p><p>Second-best: Spin it off as an independent company, endow it with some cash and your best wishes. At least it'll have a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, cut things you can cut right now. It's bullshit to announce to the world that you plan to at some point kill a product. That's like telling an employee that they're going to get laid off sometime in the next few months. You just lost the employee when you did that. They may come to work, but they're not going to do anything. Users respond like that too.</p><p>Cut things users want to see go. Mentions. Start there. Get back the screen real estate.&nbsp;</p><p>I would then boldly restructure the product, by licensing the API to the world via a liberal open source license, one that can not be reverted. Enable Twitter-compatible server products to be developed. Then create a pool of money to invest in projects building on that API. Want to be really bold? Make grants not investments. This allows the work to be done anywhere, by anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter is too good a product to let the whole thing die on the (sorry) Vine.&nbsp;</p>",

Couldn't come at a worse time when Google came out with a conspicuously iPhone-like Android phone, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13310942/walt-mossberg-pixel-phone-by-google\">Pixel</a>. Samsung, with even bigger problems, can't fill the gap.</p><p>I just took a walk around Manhattan and did an informal survey of people's headphones. Except for me, they all had wires. Bluetooth headphones are great, but haven't made a big dent yet, and as we know Apple's famous wireless buds are <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/apple-earpods-indefinitely-delayed-beyond-original-late-october-window/\">delayed</a>.</p><p>Second, well at least all developers use Macs right? But the problem is the new laptops are not going to be great <a href=\"https://blog.devteam.space/new-macbook-pro-is-not-a-laptop-for-developers-anymore-d0d4b1b8b7de#.98kvyajpu\">development</a> machines. And again, the timing isn't great. Microsoft is achieving serious buzz with their new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/26/microsoft-surface-studio-hands-on/\">Surface</a>. I haven't tried it, changing platforms is such a huge pain. I can go a long way with the iMac I use on the desktop and a relatively new MacBook (with a full keyboard). But if they keep impressing people as they have, who knows?</p><p>Platform vendors do this a lot, much more than car vendors do, for example. Have you ever heard of a car without a steering wheel? It's going on 100 years. Sure it's old technology, but you can't beat the installed base!</p><p>I still own Apple stock, btw -- I may think they're blowing it but I haven't sold out yet.&nbsp;</p>",

He could have said something like this:</p><blockquote><i>For now, we're not actively investigating Secretary Clinton's emails. However if any new information shows up that's relevant we will look into it.</i></blockquote><p>At the time I guess the Clinton campaign wouldn't have liked that very much, because it didn't offer a clean bill of health, but it would have made announcements like the one he made yesterday unnecessary.</p><h4>Trump surrogates</h4><p>Meanwhile, when any Trump surrogate gets on TV saying that Hillary is a terrible choice for president because she is hiding stuff, remind them that their candidate has yet to release his tax returns. If we could see those, I bet he'd have a few questions to answer.&nbsp;</p><h4>I'm still voting for Hillary</h4><p>In any case, I'm <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/10/26/whyImVotingForHillaryClinton.html\">voting for Hillary</a>. If they had early voting in New York, I would have already voted. Nothing is going to change my vote. Trump is still a disaster even if Huma used Anthony's computer to do email.&nbsp;</p><h4>Critical sections</h4><p>In software, there's the concept of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_section\">critical section</a>. It's a bit of code that, when executed has to not be interrupted, because while it's running the machine is not in a consistent state.&nbsp;</p><p>We're in a critical section in this election.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why Comey was wrong to make this announcement at this time. Some time in October the transition started from President Obama to whoever comes next. We're at our most vulnerable right now. We could have expected Putin to throw a wrench into the gears now, but our own FBI Director? That's unacceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/fbi-reviewing-more-clinton-emails-514825\">why</a> he did it, so the Repubs couldn't cry foul after the election. But that's a relatively small thing, Repubs do that at the slightest <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=provoke\">provocation</a>. We needed Comey to cover us, for the good of the country. Take the hit when it comes, and let the election draw to a conclusion, which it was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>If we lose this election there will be hell to pay. Not the kind of hell Trump supporters promise if they lose, but the hell that comes from letting a bull run loose in a china shop. From letting the fox guard the hen house. From letting a mob boss run the country.</p><h4>Let it drop</h4><p>I think we understand what happened.</p><p>There are two possible ways to approach it. Insist that the FBI release the information they have, or just leave the whole thing where it is.&nbsp;</p><p>The two campaigns obviously have to insist that there be a release. But one of them doesn't have to repeat the message at every campaign stop.</p><p>Comey can now take the hit for us, and refuse. Let the press chew on nothing until they run out of things to say.&nbsp;</p><p>A week from Tuesday we'll elect a new president and she can worry about it.&nbsp;</p>",

People who are reluctant to criticize him now will be even more careful.

It's exactly what you would expect.&nbsp;</span></p><p>2. Clinton ran her own email server, as did the two previous Secretaries of States, both Republicans, neither of whom were investigated by Congress.</p><p>3. Whether or not you blame her for the deaths of four diplomats in Benghazi, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErlDSJHRVMA\">Colin Powell</a>, the Republican Secretary of State in 2003, is responsible for <i>hundreds of thousands</i> of deaths when he told the United Nations and the American people that Iraq had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction\">WMDs</a>, thereby forming the basis for the war in Iraq. At the outset, not only did <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2016/02/hillary_clinton_told_the_truth_about_her_iraq_war_vote.html\">Clinton</a> believe him, I did too. Most of us did, with reservations. When a high-ranking officer of your country says a war-starting country like Iraq has nuclear weapons, what choice do you have but to believe him? (BTW, this is one of the reasons we're so concerned about Trump as president, we would have no choice but to live with the consequences of him going to war as well.) Many hundreds of thousands of people died as result of Powell's lies. I hold him accountable even if the Republicans don't.&nbsp;</p><p>4. I don't know if she destroyed emails, I've only ever heard Trump say that, not anyone else, and I don't think Trump ever tells the truth (or if he does it's the same way a broken clock is correct twice a day). But I remember when the Republicans were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy\">caught</a> deleting <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/g-w-bush-lost-22-million-e-mails/\">22 million</a> very relevant emails, having to do with firings of US Attorneys covering up for some horrible crimes committed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegelman#Karl_Rove_connection\">Karl Rove</a>, political director at the Bush White House. We knew about it, but it didn't make headlines. And the entire White House was using a private email server for emails they didn't want to be evidence in an investigation that clearly should have happened but didn't.</p><p>The \"email scandal\" was manufactured by Republicans to try to win the election. If she hadn't run for president I am sure there would be no FBI investigation. They have convinced Comey I guess that they can make him part of the scandal unless he bends over to do their bidding, which he has done.&nbsp;<span>One party is willing to do any damage to the country to get their way.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I would love to see Comey get up, after the election (for now he should STFU and let us try to have an election without the interference of the FBI) and admit he was wrong, and reaffirm that the FBI is non-partisan. After that we have to do something to reign in the Republicans, so they start acting in the interests of the country.</p>",

I was going to run the third BloggerCon at Stanford. I had taken up residence in Seattle, so I would have a meaningful vote. Washington was a swing state that year.</p><p>I was driving through the mountains when the results were coming in, bad radio reception, so I didn't know what had happened until I checked into a dim motel in Medford&nbsp;and watched in disgust, awe, fear, etc that my fellow Americans had voted for another four years of war. I couldn't believe, given a choice we had signed up for more of that. But we did.</p><p>I recorded a <a href=\"http://static.podcatch.com/manila/gems/un/cnNov3.mp3\">podcast</a> the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/11/03.html\">next morning</a>, in my car, as I did in those days. The actual MP3 is lost to me (maybe someone has a copy? -- it was found!) but I remember what I said. We have to figure out what the Bush voters are saying. They have something to say and it's not making sense to me. It can't be they want this war to go on. [The war was immoral, imho -- we paid for it with debt, not taxes, and there was no draft, so the pain of war was not felt by those who could afford to keep their kids out of the military. And by now we know the foundation of the war, that there were WMDs in Iraq, was a lie.]</p><p>And sure enough we paid the price in the financial collapse of 2008. And the moral collapse we're experiencing now full-force in 2016. Thing is, the collapse was well under way in 2004, and of course earlier. But we kept on going as if nothing happened. When we elected Obama in 2008, I remember thinking I can afford to look away now, it's going to get under control. And it did, for a couple of years. But the problem didn't go away, it got deeper and more organized. Opportunists arose to feed it and off it.&nbsp;</p><p>So the question is, fellow elite coastal intellectual types, if we dodge the bullet this time, are we going to tune out again, only to wait for the next stronger version of the wave, or are we going to find out what the people in the country want, and try to negotiate? Climate change may not be the biggest threat as we all thought it was. The war that our fellow Americans want may kill us first.</p><p>And of course if we don't dodge the bullet who the hell knows what comes next. It won't be good.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: John Harnett <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnHarnett/status/793840135121108993\">found</a> the podcast on archive.org! Amazing. So I was able to link up the word podcast to restored MP3. It's a little confusing but I'm glad to get it back. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>",

But then they lost their hunger, and the tables got turned on them in subsequent decades.&nbsp;</p><p>So now they've shipped a <a href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/161102/p16#a161102p16\">product</a> clearly aimed at Slack, which has become a juggernaut largely by being a backplane for bot-like apps. Slack, as we <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?q=site%3Ascripting.com%20slack#safe=off&amp;q=site:scripting.com+slack\">explored</a> here in the summer of 2015, got there by having a wonderfully open and web-like API. They are to be commended for this.</p><p>So the big question for Microsoft and for the future of the market is this: Do they interop with Slack? Can I use the Microsoft client without forcing my teammates to adopt it? Can they continue to use Slack while I use Microsoft? If so, they will certainly gain a user base.&nbsp;</p><p>And, if they interop, then Microsoft is returning to a playbook that worked for them once, and (my belief) probably would work again.</p><p>A lower level of interop would be the ability to run Slack-compatible apps. That would mean they wouldn't have to be rewritten to work in Microsoft's new environment. That means more utility for users. But it's more work for Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>BTW, the Microsoft of the 2000s would have considered this a silly question. We're Microsoft, people interop with us, not vice versa. That didn't work very well. Humility is a good trait, even for market-dominant giants.&nbsp;</p>",

It just seemed the way it should be, that the Mets go from being the worst team ever to winning the World Series, in a few short years. And in 1986 I was in Calif, and busy with my company, and while I did get to share it with other Mets fans, I couldn't focus on it for more than a day or two. And while 1986 was as much of a miracle as 1969, the Mets never had a drought anything like the one the Cubs just broke.</p><p>So I tried to figure out when I had a feeling like the one you must have today, and I believe found it.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://scripting.com/2016/11/03/howIFelt.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" alt=\"A picture named howIFelt.png\"></p><p>It's somehow very connected to this whole thing.</p>",

All he has to do is be entertaining, and they put him on TV.&nbsp;</p><p>The press isn't so much \"corrupt,\" they're scared and lazy and unimaginative and foremost they're employees. They work for the same guys that the Republicans and Trump (btw) do. You think they're going to look out for you? Hah! No they're not going to do that. They're going to look after the interests of their billionaire clients. Why? So they can retire with a fat bank account, and be one of them. You're going to get screwed just like before because you're buying the hype from the very same people who screwed you last time. So please spare me the bullshit about how what you're doing is a movement. Talk to me again in a few months if your guy wins.&nbsp;</p><p>Am I being scammed by voting for Hillary? Yes I guess so, but to a lesser extent than you are. I'm getting something out of this, health insurance. I like ObamaCare. I have a pre-existing condition. Before ObamaCare, I basically had to live in Massachusetts, the only state that had ObamaCare before the country did.&nbsp;</p><p>Your guy is playing a dangerous ugly game with your health. You need insurance too. And you might lose it if Trump is elected, and the Repubs are actually stupid enough to try to repeal ObamaCare. If they do, there's your proof that they don't love you. ObamaCare is for you and me. The rich guys hate it because they're babies. If it doesn't benefit them they don't want you to have it. Do you know <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns\">Mr Burns</a> on The Simpsons? That's who Trump really is. <span>And his backers, even more so.</span></p><p>And Hillary <i>is</i> paid by the same people, but they don't like her (that's why they're backing Trump) not because they don't like the way she dresses or the way she looks or sounds, it's because she's also going to invest in rebuilding infrastructure and education and btw, those things do something that you say you want -- they create jobs, American jobs. Jobs for you and your family. She has a track record there. You might want to look past the bullshit your candidate spews and find out.</p><p>It might not be totally too late yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Your supposed friends have already moved their money out of the US. They don't give a shit if you have a job. They just want to continue raiding the treasury of the US. As soon as they're done you won't hear from them again.</p><p>So go ahead and vote Republican if you must. But you won't have my respect. I think you're selling us out, in the worst way. If you vote for Hillary things will continue more or less as they have. If you vote for Hillary and a Democratic Congress, you'll get those jobs and your kids will get educated and if they get sick they'll get health care. That's the difference that matters. Forget the other stuff, about how relatable they are. You aren't hiring someone to take you out for coffee, you're hiring someone to run the economy and keep us out of wars.&nbsp;</p>",

Sometimes Facebook uncovers something I wrote only on Facebook that really should be out on the open web. Here's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/391690384371706\">such a piece</a> written on this day last year, the full text of which appears below.</i></p><p>I was once at a workshop where we all hung out in a room together for 48 hours, mostly strangers, people who had never met before. About 20 people. All ages, male and female.</p><p>The format -- we all talk, supposedly just about ourselves, but since it was 48 hours long, it got personal, at times very personal.</p><p>At one point I was challenged by a young man, a frequent thing you hear from them, Why do you think you know so much more than me? I had never said that I know more than anyone, I wasn't talking about him, just about myself. I was more than twice his age, so I assumed he was referring to my age.</p><p>I asked how old he was. 22. I asked if he had learned anything since he was 12. Yes, of course. Do you think learning stops at 22. A long answer but basically yes. At this age, he believed, he fully understood how everything works.</p><p>Well, we have to tiptoe around this bug of youth. I'm 60, and a man in his thirties gave me a very long personal lecture via email about my character flaws. I said to him that I don't want to get embroiled with him, that took one sentence. In the second sentence, I indulged in a little advice since he gave advice so freely to me.</p><p>\"Try to let it roll off you, that's what I do.\"</p><p>That's all I said. I thought it was good advice. And yes at 60 I do think I know more than you about life.</p><p>I'm really tired of tip-toeing around the weak egos of the young folk. I'm going to try to not do it so much.</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p><p>PS: One of the best <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/391690384371706?comment_id=391695997704478&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D\">comments</a> on the Facebook post came from Liz Terry. \"You seem to be a wanker-magnet.\" She's obviously British. I said in response that I was going to put that on my business card. I don't actually have a business card.</p><p>PPS: That same day I linked to an <a href=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/452880fbc096be78b96edfbfe301d178/tumblr_nqp8vqYlxf1tlb56zo1_400.gif\">image</a> of unknown origin that made me LOL again.&nbsp;</p>",

            "text": "<p>It's been four days since I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/11/02/doesMicrosoftInteropWithSlack.html\">posted</a> asking whether Microsoft Teams interops with Slack. What little I've heard indicates that it doesn't, that there is no meaningful interop.</p><p>Microsoft has clearly positioned <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software\">Teams</a> as a Slack-alike or Slack-killer. Maybe they don't use those words, but the message comes through anyway. They want their product to be compared to Slack. And Slack has taken the bait, running a <a href=\"https://slackhq.com/dear-microsoft-8d20965d2849#.g2xloywek\">full-page ad</a> in the NY Times that's similar to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/11/06/applead.jpg\">one</a> Apple ran when the IBM PC shipped in 1981. I'm sure that's what they were thinking of. Really bad idea, imho. Why? Because Microsoft has to earn the right to say they're competitive with Slack. And since Slack is more of a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/08/20/iWouldLoveAnOpenSourceSlackClone.html\">backplane</a> than an app, if you don't interop with it, well you've kind of missed the point of Slack. It's all about interop.</p><p>The old Microsoft, the one I knew in the 80s and 90s not would have missed this. They would have <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/05/23/embraceextend.html\">latched</a> onto every bit of openness in Slack. At the outset, advertise how it's not either-or, it's <i>and.</i> Your team members can use either Slack or Teams to participate in a formerly Slack-only network. That would have been a reason for Slack to run the full-page ad, maybe. Or sell out to a bigger company quickly so they can match Microsoft with distribution and financial strength.&nbsp;</p><p>And it's important to note that if Microsoft had chosen the embrace-extend model, that would have been a win for the open web, at least a temporary one, which is another reason I asked the question. It takes a second vendor to ratify Slack's open protocol to give them a real chance of being a standard. Support from Microsoft would have certainly helped.&nbsp;</p><p>Since I haven't heard from either company a definitive yes or no, the possibility is still there that Microsoft did chose the interop path.</p><p>BTW, the victory is only temporary for the open web if neither company dominates, esp not the bigger one, Microsoft. If they do, they're likely to use their power in the market to add special features that only work in their product. So it's in the interest of the market that it be a two-party system. I've written about that many times in other contexts.</p><p>I'll turn the comments on in this post if people have information they can add that sheds light on compatibility between the two products. As usual the comment <a href=\"http://guidelines.scripting.com/\">guidelines</a> apply. I delete comments that don't respect them.&nbsp;</p>",

It documents the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_More_Perfect_Union_(speech)\">speech</a> then-Senator Obama gave after recordings of Rev Wright had become a public controversy. What a speech, and it was so true, and it's still true today. Very personal. And on-topic now because we have a chance as a country to re-affirm that choice we made in 2008, or revert to our racist past. We're as enmeshed in race today as much as we were then.&nbsp;</p><p>Then I listened to the podcast about the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-dean-scream-sounded-so-different-on-tv/\">Dean Scream</a>.&nbsp;They observed that it likely would have happened differently if we had social media then that we have now. It's funny because there's an untold part of that story, that social media <i>was</i> ready to step in, but the top people on the Dean Campaign didn't know that. I was there that night, and we had the means to go around the TV networks even in 2004, before Twitter and before Facebook. Here's the story, briefly.</p><p>I was at Dean Headquarters in Burlington as an observer. I was a Berkman fellow at the time, in nearby Boston, and we were following the New Hampshire primary closely as part of the development work we were doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't have a candidate at that time, but I was of course interested in the Dean campaign because they were using blogs so effectively. I also knew a couple of people there, and made new friends that day, and they trusted me enough to give me the password to their blog, and I was posting during the returns from the Iowa caucus that night. It was a thrill and an honor.&nbsp;</p><p>I was there when the scream was broadcast, and replayed, and here's the thing, <i>there was audio available </i>for publishing, on the web, and they had the distribution ability through their much-watched blog. It would have shown what they explained in the 2016 podcast. The story could have been killed. I have no doubts of that. But it didn't happen.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a chance to ask Howard Dean himself about this, at the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/07/23/conventionbloggers/\">DNC</a> later that year, at the blogger's breakfast. A lot of my blogging friends were there. Dean said it didn't matter because they had already lost the nomination at that point, but with all due respect I don't remember it that way. We got Kerry as the nominee. I don't think Dean would have done any better against the Repubs. They could probably have found something to stick on him that would scare people. At that time the Dems were doing a pretty good job of that without any help.</p>",

The military likes him, as does the FBI. As do the police, and I'm sure the NSA and CIA. And we know the Russians like him. And we have not much of an idea of who he is. Remember, we never got to see his tax returns. There was a reason to want to see them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For me, it's disturbing because everything I planned to do professionally and creatively doesn't seem to make sense anymore.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And change won't wait until the inauguration, it'll start tomorrow. Actually it's already started.</span></p><p><span>I'd like to put this program on pause now, and resume it when I'm ready to deal with it, and of course I can't. And that's probably exactly what the people who voted for Trump were thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>",

            "text": "<p>Good morning!</p><p>I really didn't want to get out of bed today, but I saw a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jpalfrey/posts/10103243717870181?pnref=story\">question</a> from a former colleague, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey\">John Palfrey</a>, who is now the headmaster at Phillips Academy, and that got me up, and thinking. He was looking for suggestions on what to say to his students this morning.&nbsp;</p><p>Last night I was talking on the phone and via chat with two young people, about the age of his students, who I am close to. They looked to me to help them process this. Both are sweet earnest people, who want to do good, and have a great deal of empathy and intelligence. The best I could come up with is this: The world is basically always tottering on the edge of catastrophe. Sometimes you can see it, other times it's hidden. Clearly the last few years have been a lot more dangerous than we've appreciated. So the best thing to do is to do the most good you can, for others and for yourself, and enjoy life the best you can. An older friend said that to me many years ago, when I was their age.</p><p>It's not like anyone gets out of this alive (one of my favorite lines for dire situations).&nbsp;</p><p>I of course have read much of what has been written about last night's event, and the story that left the greatest impression so far is Maureen Dowd's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/opinion/absorbing-the-impossible.html?module=ConversationPieces&amp;region=Body&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=article\">column</a> in the NY Times. She talked with her brother, who lives in Maryland, who voted for Trump. He explained why he voted for him, and it was an eye-opener. Basically \"I was tired of the Clintons.\"&nbsp;<i>Tired</i>&nbsp; probably isn't a strong enough word.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of thoughts about that.&nbsp;</p><p>The voters of Indiana similarly rejected Evan Bayh, an ex-Senator of theirs. At first he was thought to be a shoe-in, much as Hillary was, but eventually the voters decided they didn't want to go back, and chose the devil they don't know over the one they are tired of.&nbsp;</p><p>Second thought, and this really shook me -- I voted for George W. Bush in 2000 for the very same reason. I was exhausted by eight years of Clinton. As much as the scandals were Republican inventions, the way Clinton handled it really pissed me off. And the lack of respect for the institution of the Presidency. The image of him getting a blow job in the Oval Office was something I would expect to read in Penthouse letters, not in the Washington Post and the New York Times.&nbsp;</p><p>I know HIllary is not Bill, that's why I was a fervent supporter of hers, but I know the feeling. It wasn't just the Lewinsky affair and the lies about it that got me, it was also his signing of the Communication Decency Act. The willingness to cut corners, to stand for nothing. So I voted for Bush, and lived to regret it. By 2004, I was working for Kerry.&nbsp;</p><p>If I had to do it over again, there's no question that I would vote for Al Gore. These kinds of tradeoffs are no good. You always vote for the most intelligent and principled person you can for a job like president. You don't use your vote for president to \"send a message.\" It's too important. That's how you get presidents like Bush and now Trump.</p><p>What will happen now? A lot of sleazy awful people will be leading our country. I thought we were done with all the Trump surrogates, but it's just beginning. Now MSNBC won't have a choice but to give them airtime, they will be the executive branch of the United States. But they had a choice the last few months. They could have devoted time on each show to getting expert opinions on what a Trump presidency would be like. Might have shaken a few of the third-party voters into voting for Hillary and we'd be facing a different, better reality this morning. Even if it didn't, as <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-had-one-job\">they say</a>, you had one job to do and you didn't do it. The journalist's job, as they seem to have forgotten, is to provide their users with information about the events of the day. That doesn't just include the salacious and mockable rantings of a TV reality star playing the part of presidential candidate, they must give a voice to and represent the interests of the people who would be governed by such a person. They did not in any way do that.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is the final straw, the one that finally broke the back of American journalism. They really did this number on us. They could have made sure the Comey letter didn't get the play it didn't deserve. Didn't make it out to be what it obviously was, a small part of the government putting its finger on the scale for one candidate. <i>That</i> was the story, and that clearly was the turning point for the campaign. Hillary didn't run a great campaign, but it was starting to get great. Instead all the energy transferred to Trump. He found his bearing, and campaigned like a champ for the last week and a half of the campaign. I don't think he would have won if he hadn't gotten that injection of purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course the press supported Trump through the entire campaign, the same way they kept reminding us in 2000 what a jerk Gore is, even though the stories they kept repeating were garbage, not true, or trivial, insignificant. They kept telling us Hillary has trust issues. How do they know? Well we keep saying it, it must be true. In fact, and they knew she was a very trustworthy candidate. And probably would have been a great president. We were cheated, and we know who cheated us.&nbsp;</p><p>I know this piece isn't well-organized. My thoughts this morning are not well-organized. I'm going to publish it anyway.</p><p>Update: Here's what <a href=\"https://jpalfrey.andover.edu/2016/11/09/all-school-meeting-post-election-november-9-2016/\">Palfrey said</a> to his students.</p>",

We got the prize four years early.</p><h4>You can't miss what you never knew you had</h4><p>Entitlement and a false sense of security are embedded into the current generations of America. A country with totalitarian experience, given the choice we had yesterday, would never have chosen this path.&nbsp;</p><p>However, once we appreciate the power of the choice, we will no longer have it.</p><p>We haven't had to fight for our freedom, despite all the hype about the current wars, since WWII. We didn't even pay for them (the Repub admin that started it put them on a credit card, hired volunteers, there was no draft, no pain for Americans who could afford to not sign up).</p><p>The people who used their vote to \"send a message\" imho will eventually wish they had used it instead to hire a competent fair-minded person to manage the economy and keep us out of wars, as our system was designed to force them to do. And one who would willingly leave office when their term is up.&nbsp;</p><p>BTW, the title of this section is a riff on the title of a Muddy Waters <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxwSH_9-kmE\">song</a>.</p><h4>How long before President Trump starts a war?</h4><p>Will he wait until he takes the oath of office?</p><h4>Will Trump leave gracefully?</h4><p>Embedded in the speeches given by Obama and Clinton today was the hope that when it's time for Trump to leave office, there will be an election (he suggested during the campaign that we shouldn't bother) and that if he loses, he will be anything near as graceful as Clinton. </p><h4>Watch out for people who give good concession speeches</h4><p>When Kerry lost in 2004, I was driving from Seattle to the Bay Area, and heard his speech a dozen times on the radio. Here's what I wrote <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2004/11/03.html#When:4:09:12PM\">then</a>.</p><blockquote>Listened to Kerry's concession speech about a dozen times on the radio. It was great. Next time, be careful about nominating a guy who gives a great concession speech. The best concession speech is an overdose of sleeping pills, or a self-inflicted bullet wound in the head. You want a guy who can't conceive of losing. The Democrats have had too many great losers. I want a great winner in 2008.</blockquote><h4>The FBI/Russian coup</h4><p>I couldn't help but feel today, watching Obama, that he's being a gentleman, but he doesn't have a choice. After we saw what the FBI did, and what the Russians did, there's no choice for him but to go easily. The military would escort him off the premises if he didn't. Pretty sure that wouldn't happen with Trump.</p><h4>Will Trump jail Hillary?</h4><p>He said he would on the debate stage, with tens of millions of people watching. He wasn't hiding his intentions. With the <i>Lock Her Up</i> chants at his rallies which he encouraged it's almost a campaign promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember what Maya Angelou <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/335-when-someone-shows-you-who-they-are-believe-them-the\">said</a>: When someone shows you who they are believe them; the first time.</p>",

Sullivan says we won't be able to deprive Trump of Congress for four years, but technically that's not true. There will be midterm elections in 2018, and 1/3 of the Senate and all of the House will be up.&nbsp;</p><p>The House is gerrymandered so that the Repubs own it, and many of the Senators up for reelection in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2018\">2018</a> are Democrats in red states.&nbsp;</p><p>But between then and now the Republican Party will be re-made. It's conceivable that some part of what's left will be opposed to Trump.&nbsp;</p><h4>He'll easily slip out of his promises</h4><p>2. Sullivan says that Trump has to deliver on his promises, build a wall, repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better, bring millions of jobs back, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>He says it's a long list, and not easily achievable.</p><p>But come on, we saw how <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=deft\">deft</a> Trump is at moving on from from controversy.&nbsp;</p><p>He can repeal ObamaCare by getting rid of the worst parts (so he will say) and replace it with <i>TrumpCare</i> which contains just the good parts. He'll present it as something all new. What he'll care about is putting his name on it (and in a very weird pun Obama <i>won't</i> care).</p><p>He'll fess up that no one really thought he would actually build a wall. It'll never be an issue. His supporters don't care about the actual wall. It was something to focus on during the campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>People don't know that Obama is deporting illegals. Trump won't tell them. He'll just provide the numbers that he's deporting and say they're the worst ones, real rapists and murderers, and call it progress, and that \"issue\" will fade away too.</p><p><span>Bush II was very good at this, coming up with slogans like \"don't micro-manage\" or talking about the \"surge\" in Iraq. And that would lead to the next slogan and the one after that. Trump is way better at being slippery than Bush ever was.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I agree with the scenario that Sullivan describes. There will be a terror attack. A <i>Black Lives Matter</i> protest will turn violent. Order will need to be restored. This is predictable. And he's right that the only hope is to protect the courts, and hope the police and military stand up for the Constitution. Like Sullivan I am worried about this, esp because there was a lot of support for Trump in the police and military.&nbsp;</p><p>He will probably want to impeach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, he even mentioned her in a <a href=\"http://qz.com/814290/presidential-debate-donald-trump-started-the-debate-by-complaining-about-ruth-bader-ginsburg/\">debate</a>.</p><h4>What does he actually want to do?</h4><p>The thing I really worry about is what Trump wants to do now, not what he told the voters he wanted to do. And we won't have much visibility into that. We'll just get the results and the blowback.</p><p>During the election I had a theory that Trump was like the Joker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0\">chasing cars</a>. I still think it's pretty likely that his goal was to win the election, not to do anything with the job.&nbsp;</p>",

It's very rambly. But after nine minutes I get going on what I think is a powerful idea. (One of these days I should learn how to edit an audio file.)</p><p>I propose new kind of social structure that, unlike the ones we have implemented so far, is about compromise.&nbsp;</p><p>We're at an interesting point in American democracy. Many of us are now highly motivated to make it work, and feel a sense of urgency we've never felt before.&nbsp;</p><p>The key is to find thoughtful people with similar life stories that span the redstate-bluestate divide. Good people, who love America, and want to see what we, as citizens, can work out.&nbsp;</p><h4>It's all about compromise</h4><p>It's emphatically not about building community, as blogging, Facebook and Twitter are, it's about building compromise. I didn't say agreement. No one changes anyone's mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Two steps: 1. Understand. 2. Compromise.</p><p>We think we can't <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=compromise\">compromise</a>, but we do it all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, people who are pro-life have had to accept the compromise that abortion is legal.</p><p>Another, people who were against the war in Iraq had to accept that we went to war in Iraq.</p><p>These are compromises so abhorrent that they hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, many of us are experiencing huge buyer's remorse after the election. What could we have done differently that would have saved us from having to give so much on things we hold so incredibly dear.&nbsp;</p><p>But, on the other side, I think at least some people who voted for Trump either feel the same remorse now, or will soon. For example if you chose Trump because you wanted to \"drain the swamp,\" less than a week after the election, you can see clearly that he's doing the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/us/politics/trump-campaigned-against-lobbyists-now-theyre-on-his-transition-team.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=nytpolitics&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0\">exact opposite</a>.</p><p>Now we have to learn how to listen to each other with respect, without trying to change anyone's minds, and then come to a compromise we can live with that's better than what we're going to get in the whipsawing policies between Democratic and Republican government, every eight years. We could use a little more continuity and predictability. We need to say no to the radical extremes, and try to arrive at less painful compromises, give a little to get a little. That's the way our government is designed.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm looking for very very special people, not your average Internet user. If you listen to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/11/10/preparingForPostwarAmerica.m4a\">podcast</a>, starting at minute 9 if you're short on time, and make it to the end, you'll get the idea. I think it's worth your time, of course, but it's totally your call.</p>",

It was a real eye-opener. I expected the author, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Osnos\">Evan Osnos</a><span>, would be on all the shows and there would be lots of follow-ups. Nope. Nothing. Back to the horserace.</span></p><p>When I asked why, the consensus was that the press expects Clinton to be the next president and are treating her thus. So now we have a full dossier (of mostly lies and trivia btw, the press calls these \"narratives\") on a person who will be a private citizen next year, and know almost nothing about the person who will be president.</p><p><i>That</i> was the story. It was a real juicy one. You just had to take a deep breath and move through your fear. Once he had the Republican nomination, it could no longer be seen as a fluke, the possibility of his presidency had to be taken seriously.

And it's possible that this piece too will be similarly interesting.</span></p><p>First, go listen to this <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/spurs/article/Gregg-Popovich-uncensored-Discusses-the-10609311.php?cmpid=twitter-desktop\">audio interview</a> with NBA coach Gregg Popovich. It's very fog-clearing and uplifting. He's an amazingly clear thinker and speaker. To be as successful in the NBA as he has been, you have to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, read this <a href=\"http://www2.nybooks.com/daily/s3/nov/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival.html\">piece</a> about living in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy\">autocracy</a>, by someone who has lived in one most of his life. That's what's coming in the USA if we don't do something.</p><p>But what can we do? Well the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)\">Electoral College</a> votes on December 19. And while there is a tradition that they vote according to the way the people in their state voted, there's no Constitutional requirement that they do.&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that if an alternative was put forward, that meets the objectives of most Trump voters, without the autocracy and hate, maybe we could make some nice lemonade out of this situation. (I would also want to get the approval of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, so that Democratic voters have a say.)</p><p>Coach P got me thinking in this direction when he asked the simple question -- why are we rushing into a transition. We could instead have another campaign after some serious compromising and win-win construction. Put forward John Kasich, perhaps. He sounds like a guy who would leave office after his term was up or if he lost a reelection bid. Almost anything is better than Trump (who just wants money and attention, why can't we give him that w/o the nuclear launch codes).&nbsp;</p><p>At this point who cares! Let's save our fucking country and sanity. Give Trump a Congressional Medal of Honor, Purple Heart and his own cable channel, no cost, for life. A Broadway parade and a hearty thanks from everyone in America for being a champ, and a good guy and a billionaire and a true patriot. This is what he wants. Give it to him. Give him <i>more</i> than he wants.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13588048/electoral-college-petition-clinton-trump\">Vox</a> doesn't think it's workable, but let's concede the new president is a Republican, not Hillary Clinton. To make this work, she would have to request that her electors vote for the compromise candidate. I think Kasich is a good choice. We know he has guts and it's pretty clear he loves America.&nbsp;</p><p>There's not much time to put it together, and a real campaign would have to be waged to make sure that the Trump voters know that we will implement the changes they wanted, and a lot of <i>good things</i> will happen. That's the lemonade part. ;-)</p><p>Thanks for listening.&nbsp;</p>",

You might want to listen to that podcast if you find the idea described here interesting.</p><p>1. It's not a community. We already have community systems, for example, Twitter and Facebook. We already know what they can do.</p><p>2. It pairs people, one from a red state, one from a blue. Think of them as electronic penpals.</p><p>3. They have similar backgrounds. For example, both are teachers, with two kids, living in a suburban neighborhood. So they recognize facets of each others' lives. Or a divorced truck driver paying child support in Georgia is paired with one in California. A programmer in Salt Lake City with one in Boston.</p><p>4. No minds are changed. Very important point. This is not about talking someone into agreeing with your conclusion. It is, however, about understanding their point of view, the things they are passionate about and why. How each of you reached different answers to the same question.</p><p>5. The system chooses the pairings. Two or more people may arrive together, for example members of the same family. &nbsp;If you already know the person you're communicating with, you may have formed opinions about the person. We want you to start fresh with a clean slate. No baggage.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Communication is via email that is passed through a proxy. So the system operators keep and can read a copy of all communication, and can ask both of you questions, or suggest topics to discuss. We may be reading what you write, so we can better understand what the differences are and where there might be points of agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>7. Nothing will be made public, unless both parties agree. </p><p>6. We ask you to try to compromise where there are strong differences. We all compromise all the time. But we go back and forth between extremes. Maybe we can find a middle ground that we can agree to long-term.&nbsp;</p><p>9. A personal comment. I suspect we will find there is agreement in important areas, like taxes, health care, education. One thing we learned about in the election of 2016 is that citizens on both sides pretty much want the same thing. We've been forced onto different sides by the political parties. Unnecessarily, and with very negative consequences. At this point the qualities of the candidates are irrelevant. The election is decided. Now we can try to reach compromises and possibly find agreement that was below the surface.&nbsp;</p><p>The only goal I have in proposing this is learning. I think it's possible we can change politics at the citizen-to-citizen level so we are not so manipulated by the (my opinion) ridiculous and exhausting process we currently use in the US to decide our leadership.&nbsp;</p>",

I remember looking at the headlines of the Times and Daily News and feeling like I was living in a movie, this didn't feel real.</p><p>I was driving on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Solano+Ave,+California/@37.8907665,-122.2923499,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857935066f30a5:0x74c6bf59ecf6d302!8m2!3d37.8907665!4d-122.2901612\">Solano Ave</a>&nbsp;in Berkeley with my friend Tori, and noted how normal everything looked. All the shops and restaurants were open. People were out on the street. I wondered if it would all be there a year later.&nbsp;<span>I asked Tori if she thought it would. She said yes. I made a note to remember that. And it seems I have. (She was right, btw, it all was there a year later, as if nothing happened.)</span></p><p>I told that story to a young friend at dinner last night. We're all worried about what's coming next. We're pretty sure that our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_Barack_Obama\">current president</a>, the one who took over for Bush, could get us out of most crises, as he did then. But the Republicans now taking over are going down the exact same path that led us to the financial collapse of 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>They aren't even in office yet, but you can see the tax cuts coming, and dramatically increased spending. All of a sudden <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/deficit-donald-trump-republicans-231372\">deficits</a> aren't a <a href=\"http://www.memeorandum.com/161115/p8#a161115p8\">problem</a>.&nbsp;<span>We suffer for years of <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=deprivation\">deprivation</a> and an unmanaged economy because the Repubs obstruct in Congress, until they take over, and now the checkbook is out, the credit card is about to be maxed, and you can be sure their friends and probably POTUS himself will be on the receiving end of our largesse. All of a sudden future generations be damned. Run up the deficit. Send more of future generations' money to the 1% of the 1%.&nbsp;</span></p><p>One of these days we won't survive a Republican-induced crisis. Right now, if Tori were here, I wonder what she would say (I'll send her a pointer to this story). Will the lights still be on one year from now? Me, I'm not so sure. ;-)</p>",

Learned what a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city\">sanctuary city</a> is, a good smart thing. Immigrants can call the cops without fear of being deported. So crimes don't go unreported. So police can help keep the peace. Such a humane and smart thing. A matter of public safety as the mayor of Minneapolis told us.</p><p>And they had a Somali woman who had been <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/ilhan-omar-will-be-nation-s-first-somali-american-legislator/400478961/\">elected</a> to the Minnesota state Senate, the first in US history. There was another segment on how cops in Arizona had used traffic stops to turn people over to immigration, and the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN13B05C\">guy</a> who designed their law, and Alabama's, is now in charge of immigration for Trump. Both were declared unconstitutional.</p><p>But the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Hodges\">mayor</a> of Minneapolis says her police department isn't going to help the Trumps round up immigrants in Minneapolis, and it doesn't matter if you cut off federal aid. That's a problem we can deal with, said the mayor. I cheered. It's the usual Republican assholery. And lazy entitled white people who vote for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Made me embarrassed to be white. As usual the immigrants are kicking ass, sending their kids to college, starting businesses, keeping their neighborhoods clean and safe, and the fat-ass white people just sit around complaining on their fat entitled white asses.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry, that's how it looks to me. You all are always saying how we look to you. Deal with it. ;-)</p><p>I'm tired of coddling lazy fat-ass good for nothing white people.&nbsp;</p><p>They also showed Trump's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUMMpq2U_-M\">rally</a> in Minneapolis in the last days of the campaign, telling more lazy entitled fat-ass white people that their lives suck because of the Somalis. They cheered enthusiastically. I guess being white is so depressing for some people they can only feel good if you put down people with darker skin. As if that mattered. Don't they see how pathetic they are?</p><p>BTW, I did a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/798679554969731072\">Twitter poll</a> asking how many Republican senators would switch to the Democratic Party in Season 3 of the new Trump reality show. I wanted to put the idea out there. I actually think there will be a realignment of parties. You know it happens, Repubs do turn into Dems. I think a lot more of that is going to happen than people realize.&nbsp;</p><p>And the fear of the New Repubs being the second coming of Hitler, I'm thinking they're more like the Fascists Who Can't Shoot Straight. Laurel and Hardy Meet Autocracy. The Keystone Kops of Totalitarianism.&nbsp;</p>",

Occasionally I have what I think is a good idea for them, or a word of encouragement. Unlike other fans of theirs, who they talk about on the show, I never have a harsh word. I love the show and the two protagonists. I'm not only a fan but I'm a supporter. (I have a lot of experience with podcasts going back to the early 2000s, and I know how kvetchy fans can be.)</p><p>So I'm going to try writing a short blog post and send them a link because they really need to hear this!</p><p>At the beginning of the <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/11036.html\">show</a> that came out today they explain that they recorded it before the election and it's clear that, like many of us, their world is rocking because of the result.&nbsp;</p><p>What I want to say is that The West Wing is the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/05/30/1295.html\">antidote</a>. It's the escape. Let me explain.</p><p>When the show ran originally we were in the midst of the Bush II presidency. It was a real nightmare. He bumbled through wars and tax cuts, the economy first shuddered and then collapsed. Hard times in America! Watching The West Wing gave us a chance to escape for an hour a week in a White House with a cranky but eloquent Nobel laureate as the president, and a staff of the best and brightest of their generation, all speaking words written for them by the ironic and warm-hearted Aaron Sorkin.&nbsp;</p><p>I've proposed elsewhere that the Trump presidency offers a great chance to <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/west-wing-cast-talks-reboot-bartlet-endorsements-article-1.2683730\">reboot</a> the West Wing franchise. This time it should star a young attractive POTUS who is constantly fighting battles with an obstructionist Republican congress, but still manages to be a wonderful president. He is always being pursued by a crackpot who questions his birthplace and legitimacy as president. The White House is staffed by various bright young smart people who are always doing zany unpredictable things, but you know their hearts are in the right place. If we manage to survive the Trump years, at least we can do it with a certain amount of comfort and hope for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>And even if they don't reboot the West Wing TV show, at least we still have the podcast! Keep up the good work Josh and Hrishi. You are not alone. ;-)</p><p>PS: I also <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/09/16/theNewWestWingStarringDonaldJTrump.html\">proposed</a> during the campaign that someone offer Trump a starring role in a reboot of the West Wing. Somehow I think that's more like what he wanted. Too late now. (Maybe not?)</p><p>PPS: I've <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site%3Ascripting.com%20west%20wing\">written</a> about the WW quite a few times previously.&nbsp;</p><p>PPPS: Geez I'm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=reboot%20west%20wing&amp;src=typd\">far from</a> the only person talking about this.&nbsp;</p>",

Sometimes Chris Hayes.</p><p>There's a lot of fussing about What Went Wrong, and the irony that Hillary got more than <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/hillary-clinton-s-popular-vote-lead-now-over-two-million-n687701\">2 million more votes</a> than Trump and that number keeps growing. Given those numbers, it's kind of obvious that a lot went right. That's first. Don't overlook that.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, I think you can figure out what the difference was between 2012 and 2016 without me saying it, but people can't seem to make the words come out of their mouths, so I will say it for them.&nbsp;</p><p>2012: A charismatic campaigner against a guy with a stick up his ass. The charismatic campaigner won. Pretty much the same thing in 2008, btw.</p><p>2016: A charismatic campaigner who said a lot of shit that made educated people look away in horror, vs a smart candidate who was careful not to say anything that would make people mad at her (for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/04/01/1158.html\">good</a> reason) and would have been a great president (imho) but (key point here) is a poor campaigner. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say Hillary was at best a 3. Very often a 2. The charismatic campaigner, as always, won.</p><p>People love stories. They love to cheer. Elections are tribal. We want to feel like we belong to God's Own Tribe. We have right on our side.&nbsp;<span>But those are just words. What's actually going on is body chemistry.&nbsp;</span><span>When you feel part of a winning tribe, you get <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/story/91744-this-is-your-brain-on-love/\">oxytocin</a> in your blood which is basically heroin. It feels great. It's like falling in love. A lot of people got that from Trump. And if he weren't so transparently ignorant and unsuited for the job, and racist, he probably would have inspired a lot more people to vote for him.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Hillary? I supported her all the way, but I always hoped people wouldn't notice how awkward she is on the trail. No confidence in herself. In the debates, she was fantastic. That's her element. But getting a crowd off their feet, yelling and cheering, she isn't a natural. In that sense Bernie was a better candidate. Not saying he would have won. I don't know, no one does.</p><p>Moral of the story. If you think your candidate can't campaign, have a straight talk with him or her, and tell them they have to step aside, because they're going to lose and that does no one any good.</p><p>Now that said, there's no upside in blaming anyone, making them feel bad, tarnishing them in history. Leave it alone. But you must tattoo the lessons on your forehead so you never forget. Campaigns matter. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitas\">Gravitas</a> matters. Confidence, storytelling, building a tribal presence, they all matter. Body chemistry matters.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the dazzling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Maddow\">Rachel Maddow</a>.<span>&nbsp;She can tell a story and make you cheer and stand up and say YEAH. The feeling is I want lots more of that. She has a natural ability to get the tribal oxytocin flowing. She's a fantastic, passionate, super-smart, high-feeling, earnest, learned, inspirational story-teller. High integrity, honorable, she cares, and you can tell. She would do well, imho, if she decided to run.</span></p>",

This is a very important piece. He says something that very much needs to be said, and heard. If you can access the piece through their paywall please do. But this piece is so important, I'm reproducing it here in full, so everyone can read it.</i></p><p>By Lawrence Lessig.</p><p>Conventional wisdom tells us that the electoral college requires that the person who lost the popular vote this year must nonetheless become our president. That view is an insult to our framers. It is compelled by nothing in our Constitution. It should be rejected by anyone with any understanding of our democratic traditions  — most important, the electors themselves.</p><p>The framers believed, as <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp\">Alexander Hamilton put it</a>, that “the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the [president].” But no nation had ever tried that idea before. So the framers created a safety valve on the people’s choice. Like a judge reviewing a jury verdict, where the people voted, the electoral college was intended to confirm — or not — the people’s choice. Electors were to apply, in Hamilton’s words, “a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice” — and then decide. The Constitution says nothing about “winner take all.” It says nothing to suggest that electors’ freedom should be constrained in any way. Instead, their wisdom — about whether to overrule “the people” or not — was to be free of political control yet guided by democratic values. They were to be citizens exercising judgment,  not cogs turning a wheel.</p><p>Many think we should abolish the electoral college. I’m not convinced that we should. Properly understood, the electors can serve an important function. What if the people elect a Manchurian candidate? Or a child rapist? What if evidence of massive fraud pervades a close election? It is a useful thing to have a body confirm the results of a democratic election — so long as that body exercises its power reflectively and conservatively. Rarely — if ever — should it veto the people’s choice. And if it does, it needs a very good reason.</p><p>So, do the electors in 2016 have such a reason?</p><p>Only twice in our past has the electoral college selected a president against the will of the people — once in the 19th century and once on the cusp of the 21st. (In 1824, it was Congress that decided the election for John Quincy Adams; likewise in 1876, it was Congress that gave disputed electoral college votes to Rutherford B. Hayes.)</p><p>In 1888, Benjamin Harrison lost the popular vote to Grover Cleveland but won in the electoral college, only because Boss Tweed’s Tammany Hall turned New York away from the reformer Cleveland (by fewer than 15,000 votes). In 2000, George W. Bush lost the popular vote by a tiny fraction — half a percent — and beat Al Gore in the electoral college by an equally small margin — less than 1 percent.</p><p>In both cases, the result violated what has become one of the most important principles governing our democracy — one person, one vote. In both cases, the votes of some weighed much more heavily than the votes of others. Today, the vote of a citizen in Wyoming is four times as powerful as the <a href=\"http://votes.equalcitizens.us/\">vote of a citizen</a> in Michigan. The vote of a citizen in Vermont is three times as powerful as a vote in Missouri. This denies Americans the fundamental value of a representative democracy — equal citizenship. Yet nothing in our Constitution compels this result.</p><p>Instead, if the electoral college is to control who becomes our president, we should take it seriously by understanding its purpose precisely. It is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people. It is meant to be a circuit breaker — just in case the people go crazy.</p><p>In this election, the people did not go crazy. The winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation. Like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. Choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people.</p>",

They're now going to expend serious energy making him fit into the role of President of the United States, and this time with the help of the Constitution, they will probably have a bit more success, which will encourage them to keep on the path they're on.</p><p>And that's fine, but it isn't furthering the story-of-the-year.&nbsp;</p><p>This should be a long-term redirection for news orgs. Shifting the focus of news from all-coasts-all-the-time to centers throughout the country. The first step is to build a new hub mid-country. I suggest Flint, Michigan. The host would be Michael Moore of course. And he would invite on anyone he wants. He could invite people from NY, DC, LA, SF or Seattle, but they'd have to travel to Flint to be on the show. The idea is to shift the center.</p><p>What would happen? I don't know. But it would probably be more like <a href=\"http://trumplandmovie.com/\">TrumpLand</a> than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardball_with_Chris_Matthews\">Hardball</a>.

I once described this to my then-colleague, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen\">Jay Rosen</a>, as picking up a box from one place and putting it down in another, without considering that the box shape might not be the right one for now.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring new people into the conversation. That's the message of the new age. It should have been done smoothly, by hosting blogs at the big news orgs for people who were newsworthy on their own, to go direct to the readers. But they wouldn't do it. So it happened on Facebook and Twitter. But as we see, the social media services, with their limits, are not good containers for intelligent discourse. And we need to include people who previously we didn't. Again, if the news orgs don't do it we will have to do it ourselves.</p>",

We also would have accepted the destruction of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965\">Voting Rights Act</a> of 1965.&nbsp;</p><h4>It's the disenfranchisement dummy!</h4><p>Winning the White House and both houses of Congress give the Republicans a lot of new ways to disenfranchise voters. They don't even have to convince anyone that there was massive voter fraud, but if you have the chance, why not. It makes the voter suppression go down easier, for the people whose votes are not being suppressed (i.e. reliable Republican votes).&nbsp;</p><p>And no, they're not going to try to keep people in California from voting. This is strictly for pivotal purple and purpleish states like Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Ohio. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, that are sometimes red and sometimes blue. The goal is to make them permanently red, and give the Repubs control of the White House basically forever, the same way they gerrymandered their way into control of the House.</p><p>It's the opposite of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor\">Hanlon's razor</a> rule that says \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" With the Repubs, you should always look for the malice. It's there, and it's usually not very hard to find. In this case, they're setting us up for massive disenfranchisement and a Republican lock on the White House.</p><h4>Trump is not stupid</h4><p>People used to say George W. Bush is stupid, but I always thought he was smart. Same thing with Trump. No way someone gets to where he is and is stupid. He's plotting and scheming, and has lots of experience and has a sense of which bets are worth taking. So when he says something that appears random, it's safer to assume that it's not.&nbsp;</p><h4>Don't take my word for it...</h4><p>For background I recommend this <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/11311.html\">episode</a> of the Slate daily podcast. It's an interview with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Ackerman\">Bruce Ackerman</a>, a professor of constitutional law at Yale. It's depressing for sure, but you should hear what he thinks is happening.&nbsp;</p><p>Also enlightening is this <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/08/10/431238980/block-the-vote-a-journalist-discusses-voting-rights-and-restrictions\">Fresh Air podcast</a> from last summer laying out how the Repubs were suppressing the vote for the Nov 8 election. This clearly played a role in the Trump win.&nbsp;</p>",

But most are written by journalists, so they miss (imho) their own role in what went wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you're watching an NBA basketball game, and one team is being called for every infraction, but it turns out that most of the calls end up inconclusive, it just appears that they might have been thinking of doing something that could be seen as inappropriate, but probably not illegal, or even dishonest.</p><p>On the other hand, the other team is not only fouling a lot, several times on every play, they're also getting hauled into court for committing <i>crimes</i> on the court, not &nbsp;crimes of the sport, but actual legal crimes. And when they explain what they're doing, they commit technical fouls, back in the game.</p><p>And in the crucial final minute of the game, they call the first team for a huge blatant foul, but then the call is reversed, but after the game is lost. Oh well. Shit happens.</p><p>I think that's a pretty good telling of the role the press played in the 2016 election. They could have run Trump University ads showing the candidate selling snake oil. Caught red-handed. And then explain the devastation he brought to Atlantic City. Show how his employees and customers feel about him as a businessperson, since that's how he's presenting himself. Very germane to voters. They probably would have helped us understand what it would be like to be governed by him. Give us some idea how to view what he was saying in his stump speeches.</p><p>That's the story journalism missed. Show us what a Trump presidency would be like. Be the Consumer Reports of the executive branch of government.&nbsp;</p><p>Will I lose Medicare or ObamaCare? Will my kids have to fight in a war? Will banks be free to suck all the value out of our property, so they can buy themselves bigger estates and yachts? We have to figure this out, it's important, and that means if you're doing your jobs, you have to help us do that.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not saying the journalists are bad people, or if I would have done better in their shoes. The NBA has never seen a team like Trump/Pence in 2016. But it's good to really look at things dispassionately, to see how you all can do better in the future. And for that imho you have to listen to how your work was viewed by others, not just by asking other journalists.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: I have to call out the New Yorker for doing an <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/26/president-trumps-first-term\">outstanding piece</a> of journalism that tried to give us a sense of what a Trump presidency would be like. I think it is the single most valuable bit of writing in 2016 politics.&nbsp;</p><p>PPS: It's hard to analyze a story in which you are a central character. You're likely to miss your own role. See <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/05/DoyouhaveaHead.html\">Do you have a Head?</a> for a kids game that illustrates.&nbsp;</p>",

The nation hated itself for Nixon. Carter was the bitter pill we decided to swallow, for punishment.</p><p>So when he arrived, he brought with him a staff of outsiders from Georgia, smart people who knew nothing about Washington and they crashed into the legislature and lobbyists. No honeymoon. He got nothing done, and we switched when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa8Qupc4PnQ\">Sunny Mr Reagan</a> promised us <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c32G868tor0\">something</a> on a hill that had sunlight on it. Carter was gloom. A guy who wore sweaters and told us we'd have to do without. A national <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106508243\">malaise</a>. Okay we suffered enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump is using up goodwill on stupid mistakes and scaring the bejesus out of not just you and me, but also the 1%. At some point the stock market is going to reflect the fear.&nbsp;</p><p>He's staffing up with people who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_w_n-8w3IQ\">could</a> be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0euMFAWF8\">characters</a> on The Simpsons. Can anything coherent come out of this group? I try to keep an open (and worried) mind, but you have to wonder.&nbsp;</p><p>Where will the scale come from? Trump is criticizing <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-boeing-air-force-one-232243\">Boeing</a> today for a $4 billion project spread over eight years. Has he looked at the <a href=\"http://federal-budget.insidegov.com/l/119/2016-Estimate\">budget</a> yet? Does he understand how big the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States#GDP\">US economy</a> is?&nbsp;</p><p>The Carrier thing may impress voters, but he doesn't need the voters right now. They have voted. Now the establishment in DC has to bet on whether his charm will last. I don't know how they think. But in 1977 they took a look at who Jimmy Carter brought with him and decided not to work with him. And that was that.</p><p>BTW, not to dis Carter as a person. He is a good man who was not an effective president. And Trump and his family will do very well if he goes down the path Carter did. But he may not be the demagogue we fear he will be. He still has to get the government to work for him.</p>",

Maybe even after that.</span></p><p>There's a lot of pressure on the electors. Let's show them we are behind them. For that we have to be there, physically.&nbsp;<span>You can't \"stand\" for the country by signing a petition or sending email. You personally have to be there. In the cold and dark with a candle you bring, to provide the light.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here's what I want to do. I want to start a Facebook group that's just for organizing the silent candlelight vigils around the country.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So for example, there would be a place in San Francisco, probably Market Street by the Ferry Building. In New York, Columbus Circle and Union Square in Manhattan. Some place central in each of the boroughs. Every city and town would organize something.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The vigils start at sunset every night and go through say 10PM or so. These are not \"occupy\" events. They are coordinated with law enforcement. We are quiet and still. No marching, no chants. Just people standing in observation, just standing up for America.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Everything else is forgiven. We can fight about it later when our democracy is safe.</span></p>",

(She wears a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab\">hijab</a>, but from the podcast she says she's not dark-skinned.)</span></p><p>If you want the perspective from their point of view, watch this <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/360932/trumpland-documentary-voters/\">video</a> of interviews with Trump voters before the election. You see where they live, how they relate to each other. It's remarkable how much of what they say are straight recitals of Trump talking points. This is one of the best things I've seen, heard or read about the election. A real eye-opener.</p><p>It helped me understand how broken we are, as a country. Because it's not true that the country is for white people. That's just something people say. The NPR reporter was born in Indiana, speaks like all of us, she's American. But if Trump could so easily convince white people to fear Muslims, he could do it for any other race or ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Anyway, that's not exactly the point of this piece. First I wanted to establish that point of view is integral to what your truth is. If you're a Muslim reporter for NPR you see it from one point of view, and if you are a white person in Des Moines you see it a different way.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17.5px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 20px;\">A tip for journalism</span></p><p><span>Look at this </span><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/12/10/memorandumSocialSecurity.png\">screen shot</a><span> of current </span><a href=\"http://www.memeorandum.com/161209/p120#a161209p120\">stories</a><span> about the changes that Repubs want to make, right now, to Social Security. They're all from the point of view of who? Reporters, Washington insiders, and unfiltered Republican misdirection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><i>Not</i> represented is the point of view of a retired person in the Bronx or Sarasota or West Des Moines, who has paid into Social Security all their life and is now depending on the payments, and is going to lose them.&nbsp;</p><p>For them the headline would be \"Repubs want to take your Social Security.\"&nbsp;</p><p>I think there's a good argument for changing <i>take</i> to <i>steal. </i>Maybe that's too much for a reporter to say. But it's not too much to put the cost to the reader/viewer up front. Imho that's where I believe it should be, must be, if you're doing your job.</p><p>And the article should clearly explain how you can register your displeasure immediately and clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>It's funny because I heard Megyn Kelly, also in a <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/11517.html\">recent podcast</a>, say that she reps the interests of her viewers. She sounded like she meant it. I like Megyn Kelly. I think she's sharp and she has courage. But I'm pretty sure Fox News isn't presenting the news from the viewer's perspective. They're probably running with the Republican myth that they're \"saving\" Social Security. In a sane world, reporters should be exposing the lie fully to their constituents and helping them act. And if it means cutting off a Republican spinmaster, all the better.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a missing component of today's journalism, the point of view of the reader. If you all could focus more on that, the readers would take more interest in your product.&nbsp;</p>",

Virtually non-existent, imho.</p><p>A few weeks before the election, before the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=comey+letter\">Comey</a> catastrophe, I thought our biggest challenges were climate change and the ineffectiveness of antibiotics. But all that was on a slow track. Now the challenge is right here, right now.&nbsp;</p><p>I watched a <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-hayes-and-bernie-sanders-hold-town-hall-with-trump-voters-in-wisconsin/\">town hall meeting</a> on MSNBC last night, hosted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes_(journalist)\">Chris Hayes</a>, with Bernie Sanders as the guest, but the real stars were the voters of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenosha,_Wisconsin\">Kenosha</a>. It was an eye-opener. Maybe Hayes should do his show from Kenosha for the next month, with guests from the community. There were a lot of juicy threads that were not followed-through on.&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed as if many of them had not met each other before. That was interesting.</p><p>The Trump voters, and there were quite a few, said some things that I think they are going to learn are wrong, and that will happen soon, especially if somehow there can be cross-pollination of news from MSNBC-land to and from Wisconsin-land, they might hear about the disasters-in-the-making before they are actually complete.&nbsp;</p><p>A Trump voter said, with no dissension, that the racist stuff that Trump campaigned on wasn't real. But it <i>is</i> real. A Muslim woman there, born in Wisconsin, she spoke with a Wisconsin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-Central_American_English\">accent</a>, wore a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab\">hijab</a>, said she was scared for herself and her family. There's talk in TrumpLand (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower\">one</a> on Fifth Ave in NYC) of requiring Muslims to register, <i>even Muslims who are American citizens. </i>So there it is. The racism is real. Registering comes first. Then armbands, then...&nbsp;</p><p>Do the Trump voters know that Congress, of the same party as the incoming president, is organizing to turn Social Security, Medicare and the ACA into a huge tax cut for the super wealthy? That's your future. No retirement, even though you already paid for it, and you can buy health insurance with money you don't have from an insurance industry that won't sell it to you.&nbsp;</p><p>They seemed confident that there would be time to vote Trump out in four years. A big misunderstanding about how long it takes to undo social programs if you don't care about the people who depend on them.&nbsp;</p><p>I doubt if the Repubs care one bit about how Mr Trump Voter from Kenosha plans to vote in 2020. Their goal is to loot their future right now. Cleaning up the human mess? Well if there are real elections (see above) and they lose, the Democrats can clean it up, like they did last time. That didn't get your auto plant to come back did it? And it won't get your Medicare back next time. By then your Social Security money will be in the bank accounts of already-rich Repub backers.</p><p>I know I'm talking to no one. Nothing can prevent the fall into the abyss. We're not in there yet, but we're going down. Not much more to say.</p>",

The US is a car that's not in a ditch this time, it's flying off the edge of a cliff and about to fall into the abyss. And the Democrats seem too scared of being insulted by the Repubs to fight it.</p><blockquote>Impassioned citizens have been pleading with electors to vote against Mr. Trump; law professors have argued that winner-take-all laws for electoral votes are unconstitutional; a small group, the Hamilton Electors, is attempting to free electors to vote their consciences; and a new theory has arisen that there is legal precedent for courts to give the election to Mrs. Clinton based on Russian interference. All of these efforts, along with the grass-roots protests, boycotts and petitions, have been happening without the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Three people have been outstanding in their leadership. <a href=\"http://www.memeorandum.com/161214/p7#a161214p7\">Larry Lessig</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMFlint\">Michael Moore</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maddow\">Rachel Maddow</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a developer, I am ready to work with any leadership that shows up to build social networks that empower us to organize.</p><p>The tools we're using primarily to organize are well-understood and mature.

I stand ready to work with anyone who stands up to lead.</p><h4>Lakoff</h4><p>I've written about Lakoff a number of times, I even did a podcast interview with him in 2006.

No.</p><p>First, my guess is that Trump made a deal with Pence similar to the one he <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/magazine/how-donald-trump-picked-his-running-mate.html\">offered to Kasich</a>. Pence really runs the country and foreign policy while Trump \"makes America great again.\"</p><p>Pence is getting the daily briefings, and he will be in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Situation_Room\">Situation Room</a> when there's a crisis. And he is forming the government. All those meetings and dinners Trump has don't mean a thing. He's not making the decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>The deal they made is that Trump gets to be the frontman, he can talk to other world leaders so it looks to them like he's running things, but it's really the extreme Christian part of the Repub Party that's running things. (And the other world leaders get signals about what's really going on, so they know not to blow up the world because he said something idiotic.)</p><p>Trump is the outrageous&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/12/16/trump-raises-specter-treason/zdwgXRuJBMChEXmX5kchhP/story.html\">distraction</a>&nbsp;that draws your attention while the magician is doing his magic.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here's what you should be paying attention to: The way the US is going to be looted by the Repubs this time. They'll try to finish the job the Repubs did last time, and to the extent they can, we'll be left with as big a wreck to dig out of when they're finished.</span></p><h4><span>Tax cuts, war and a bubble&nbsp;</span></h4><p>Tax cuts -- they will cut taxes drastically, and pay for it by completing the absorption of \"entitlements\" like ObamaCare, Medicare and Social Security into the treasury. There's a lot of money sitting there waiting for them to grab. And they do the transfer by cutting taxes.</p><p>War -- They'll start another war. This transfers government wealth to defense contractors, all Repubs.&nbsp;</p><p>Bubble -- There will be another bubble, made possible by the repeal of banking regulations. All kinds of scams will be legal.&nbsp;</p><p>That's it. We've seen this before. They can do it all right now because they control Congress and the White House. They will try to do it all very quickly because in two years, they might lose Congress, even with all the gerrymandering and voter suppression they now depend on. This is what you should pay attention to, not whether or not the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmazz/status/810165584847454213\">person</a> who's standing in for Trump on Twitter can spell a particular word.&nbsp;</p>",

Stelter is one of the more outgoing and accessible of the political reporters, but that's not saying a lot. I don't think he or the people who appear on his show have anything to do with our freedom, and I'm not in the mood to hear this kind of pitch after they <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/les-moonves-trump-cbs-220001\">sold us out</a> in this election.&nbsp;</p><p>They're in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/11/09/accessJournalismTakenToItsLimit\">access</a> business. And they all know it, and even the little people, like me, know it. So it's a total smh moment when Stelter gets all preachy like this.</p><p>Most of what you hear on the news shows are total lies. They're reduced to reporting on narratives, perceptions, optics, these are the actual words they use, but not the truth and certainly not the interests of the people they report for. A lot of people end up believing the lies, they vote based on the lies, or they go elsewhere to get <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/18/a-new-poll-shows-an-astonishing-52-of-republicans-think-trump-won-the-popular-vote/?utm_term=.dac9d5273ddb\">other lies</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When they report on plans to kill Social Security, why isn't the headline about how it will affect the people? It's more about the horse race, and one party's chances to control the Senate in 2018. (Which is incredibly pathetic given that all the horse race coverage in 2016 was in the end totally worthless.) Millions of Americans, your readers, are going to lose their retirement savings.&nbsp;<span>Why is it so hard to adopt that point of view?</span></p><p>It's totally apparent that we have to re-form journalism around the needs of voters, and ignore the charade. It's just acting-for-advertising, that's all that's going on here.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2004, when I lived in Boston, I heard a commercial on the local <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBUR-FM\">NPR station</a>, a pledge drive in which the president of the station said \"you are the owner of the station.\" The <i>you</i> in that sentence referred to the listener who in this case was me, Dave Winer. I was an academic and curious if that could be chased down, so I called her, got routed to a PR person who sent me their annual report, a glossy brochure and a letter asking me to contribute money. At no point was there a discussion of how I wanted my station to cover the news, or a suggestion of an idea that I might contribute content or even technology to the station that after all I was the owner of. (I wanted to tell them about the then-nascent <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html\">podcasting</a>, btw.)</p><p>Part of not normalizing our political situation is to not accept the way American journalism has evolved up to 2016. It doesn't work because it is centered on the perspective of a small number of people in New York and Washington. There is a solid impenetrable wall around it. It can't get better until it emerges outside the wall. A reboot has yet to happen and until it does I think the exact opposite of what Stelter says.&nbsp;</p><p>Their idea of \"freedom\" is killing our country.</p><p>PS: The fundamental mistake of journalism in the 2016 election is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/796179720534626305\">summarized</a> thus: \"So many people let this be about Hillary vs insanity when it was really all of us vs insanity.\"</p><p>PPS:&nbsp;I had another experience like the one with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBUR-FM\">WBUR</a>, about 25 years earlier. I realized when I was a comp sci grad student that encyclopedias, which came as huge sets of books, would work better if they were digitized. I wanted to start to work on this. So I contacted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>, which was then the #1 encyclopedia, to open a discussion. Instead they sent a salesman to my apartment in Madison. He kept coming. I was a single grad student, no kids, with access to an incredible library at the university, and not much money. I was not in any way a customer for his product. But he kept coming. Every visit a reminder of how deaf his employer is. (Yes I do see the irony of pointing to the Wikipedia page for Britannica.)</p>",

This is the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html\">sources go direct</a> idea that is so central to blogging. I also thought money in politics was not as central as people thought it was. More important was an innate ability to communicate. The new tools would become that powerful, I believed.</p><p>Now Trump of course, in addition to being an instinctively gifted blogger, is also a super salesman, in person and in front of a crowd. I'd love to hear <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier\">Walt Frazier</a> do the play by play for a Trump interview. Dishing and swishing. Feline quickness. All of the words that would describe an agile NBA point guard apply to our president-elect. Now these are not great talents for a leader, commander in chief, or statesman. But it got him elected, that's for sure.</p><p>You can read the archive of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">my blog</a> to see what I think of our prospects under the upcoming Trump presidency. I am not a happy camper. But as far as his ability to communicate directly through the tools of blogging, we've never seen anything like Trump with a smartphone and his Twitter account.</p><h4>Why?</h4><p>Why did I choose Trump? Well,&nbsp;<span>I think </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose\">Pete Rose</a><span> should be in the baseball Hall of Fame. He has the most hits of any player of all time. I think acceptance should at least partially recognize the enormity of a person's accomplishment. Is Trump how I wanted blogging to triumph? Of course not. But there is no denying the enormity of the accomplishment.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Marshall</span></h4><p>There were many excellent political writers who I turned to for unique ideas in this election cycle. A few were outstanding, Nate Silver, Matt Yglesias and the person I'd like to honor, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall\">Josh Marshall</a> at <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/\">TPM</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Of all of them his <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog\">editor's column</a> is most like a blog. He often writes in the first person. He spends a lot of time thinking, but more than anything, he's a timely writer. When something happens, he quickly goes into motion. I find I can depend on him for instant valuable perspective in real time.&nbsp;</p><p>He has embraced the role of blogger as news transmitter. What he does there is not journalism, he is himself a source when he's writing on his blog. I read with great appreciation as he helped us through this incredibly turbulent and confusing year. BOTY-level work.&nbsp;</p>",

Later, when I realize that I need to change the software, after the initial release, there can be three big problems. </p><p></p><ol><li><span>It might mean renaming, redesigning or removing a feature. Users are usually very unhappy about any of that. If I wait, I get to tweak the feature set and there are no users around to give me grief. And knowing that they're going to be unhappy makes me conservative, and ultimately hurts the product. And it stops being fun for me.</span></li><li><span>I might have to change the product in a way that makes the new version incompatible with previous versions. That means migrating the users, and these days that means doing it so they don't even know it's happening. Those \"corner turns\" can be complex, and require a lot of thought and work, and it's precarious. If there's a bug in the transition code, it shows up in awful ways. If there are no users, no migrations!</span></li><li><span>Also, if I limit the initial user base to people I know will report problems if they see them, I get something back from having users. It's been really disappointing for me providing software for net users the last few years. You never hear from them except to tell you that you fucked up, even when they treated the software disrespectfully, sometimes <i>incredibly</i> disrespectfully. People these days are often selfish, uncaring, rude, and demanding when it comes to software. Sometimes it's hard to see why I should ever release it, actually.</span></li></ol><p></p><p>Just being honest with you. Software developers are people too.

Not the experience I signed up for. </p><p>Luckily my friend, the gift recipient, told me about the trouble (in a FB chat conversation that was instantaneous and cost $0). I got on the phone with Amazon, probably talking with someone in China (even more international) and we figured out the only thing to do was to cancel the gift card, and I'll now have to become a member of <a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\">amazon.co.uk</span></a> so I can give my friend a gift card she can actually use in the country she lives in. </p><p>So Amazon, a creature of the net, if there ever was one, can't get their two systems to talk to each other? I should send them a pointer to the XML-RPC <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html\">spec</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Services-XML-RPC-OReilly-Internet/dp/0596001193\">book</a>. ;-)</p><p>S<span>o I went ahead and logged on to </span><a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\"><span data-auto-link=\"true\" data-href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\">amazon.co.uk</span></a><span> with my American account and it worked. So the rep was wrong, I didn't need to create a new account.</span></p><p>I did have to re-enter my credit card, and choose between pounds and dollars. This isn't something I've done before, so I had questions that weren't addressed in the process, like what are the tradeoffs in choosing betw pounds and dollars (I imagine my credit card company charges me a conversion fee if I use pounds, but it's harder on my friend if it's in dollars, so I went with pounds). </p><p>Net-net the guy on the phone could have been more helpful, or (it seems) the whole process could have been transparent, if they let my friend use the gift card on amazon.co.uk. Perhaps there's a tax reason for this? Or some regulation? But it took some of the fun out of the present, which isn't a good thing. Hassles are tolerable on my end but on hers? Please this is a gift. Amazon could have been a bit more on my side here.</p><h4>No first names please</h4><p>As a by-product of waiting on hold listening to elevator music, I realized why I don't like big company reps using my first name. It's because they are repping a big company and don't have a first name.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I'm not talking with a person, I'm talking with a company. When they try to make it person-to-person that's got to be to my disadvantage, as a customer. So I don't like it. (Finally a purpose in being on hold listening to elevator music.)</span></p>",

He took up my space so I had to stand against the wall and look like an idiot. I eventually gave up and walked around the show, pretty dejected.</p><p>A few years later, after I had made a success of my product, I ran into \"Dick\" and he was the same guy, only this time he was kissing up to me, but he still talked over me, and the way he told stories he always had it better than I did. I never liked him, but at times I thought of him as a \"friend,\" I guess because I didn't believe in myself enough to think that I deserved real friends who liked me and treated me well. A guy like \"Dick' only has \"friends\" because there are a lot of people like I was, people with a poor self-image. </p><p>Anyway, a couple of weeks ago \"Dick\" showed up again in my life, this time on Facebook. I had forgotten what a jerk he was. This is something I tend to do. I thought it was nice to cross paths with him again. But after our first chat, I found myself feeling upset and didn't like the feeling. Later I figured it out, that's how Dick always made me feel. Because I'm so forgetful, he actually had a chance for a clean fresh start. But people don't change, unless something terrible happens in their life to shake them up. Clearly that had not happened to \"Dick.\"</p><p>So Dick was coming to NY and wanted to get together for lunch. We set the date for Monday. On Sunday he texts me and asks if we could do it Wednesday instead. I was able to switch, but I kind of saw where this was going. Then on Wednesday morning he asked if we could push the meeting back 1/2 hour, because he had something before that might run over. I said okay. </p><p>So I walked to the restaurant and got there exactly on time. He wasn't there of course. I registered with the host, there was a 45 minute wait. This is a very popular restaurant. I didn't know. I waited outside ten minutes in the cold, and under my heavy jacket I'm sweating, because I walked 40 minutes to get there. So, after ten minutes I get a text saying he'll be 15 minutes late (on top of the ten minutes he's already late). So I left. I took the subway home. 45 minutes after when we were supposed to meet, I got another text from him asking where I was. I ignored it. When I got home I unfriended him. </p><p>(I think I figured it out. He knew there would be a 45 minute wait, and decided to let me do the waiting. That's what an ass Dick is.)</p><p>So our first and last experiences were the same. I don't think I'll ever see or talk with this person again. But the moral of the story is we have people in this world who for whatever reason need to have power over other people. I am not one of them, and am thankful for that. It's taken a long time for me to understand how this works. I don't know how people get like that, and I don't really care to know. But I know that I'm worth being treated with respect.&nbsp;</p>",

It's a grande Pike Place coffee with three shots of espresso. I figured this would help me make it to midnight. I only had a few sips before my eyes were basically welded open. Enough caffeine. So in the morning I had an almost full cup of room temperature Starbuck's caffeine drink. What to do with it?</p><p>So I poured it into a big glass, filled it with ice, added a little half and half and let it sit for a minute for the cold to permeate all the caffeine molecules. </p><p>Oh man whoa is it good!

The amount of insight per sentence is low. Lots of repetition of themes. As if we haven't been listening since 9/11.

I found Colbert has no wisdom to offer other than <i>Whoops! </i>some big shit happened that we weren't expecting. We need much more. </p><p>They are all about normalizing everything, staying within the guidelines of their idea of how the political process works.

That's how I see what the news people are doing.</p><p>I think they mostly are historians, I think that's the path they are on, trying to fit our current situation into a historic context.

            "text": "<p>In July I wrote a piece called <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/07/28/dontFeedDjTrump.html\">Don't Feed the Trump</a>, which was mostly about what I had learned from dealing with trolls in the 40-plus years I've been on the Internet. Imho there's a lot of wisdom in that piece, and if it had been heeded by the press, we'd probably be preparing for the Clinton presidency, not Trump's.</p><p>What's done is done, water under the bridge, etc -- Trump is the president-elect, and in 17 days he will be the 45th president. Yadda yadda yadda.&nbsp;</p><p>But he's no longer a troll. I think that needs to be said clearly. A troll is someone who steals your energy and uses it to attract attention to himself. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States\">POTUS</a>, by definition <i>can't</i> be a troll. He already has all the attention. If you respond to him, or RT him, or write a post about him, you are not doing anything to call more attention to him. It's analogous to pointing a flashlight at the sun. No one will notice, except for the few people around you.</p><p>So at this point, we're in uncharted territory. A person who behaves as if he were a troll, campaigning for an office he has already won, making predictions that will come true or won't, being watched by everyone on the face o earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/816060244740673538\">RT'd</a> one of his tweets with a simple question, asking why he thought the North Koreans wouldn't be able to launch an ICBM in the early days of his presidency. Famous author and former Wired colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevin2kelly/status/816061657726275584\">Kevin Kelly</a> played back the advice I had given so many, and I acknowledged that he was right and I had indeed fed the troll. But on reflection, I realized the rules had changed.&nbsp;</p><p>So this morning I did it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/816299778640412672\">again</a>, stating that without ObamaCare I wouldn't have health insurance, and I didn't appreciate his campaigning and that it's time for him to get to work and start caring about the millions of Americans like me who depend on it for health care.&nbsp;</p><p>Our role at this point is to remind the soon-to-be commander in chief and remind ourselves that the job he is about to occupy works best if he at least pretends to care about all Americans, and instead of campaigning, he projects the impression that he is hard at work trying to make America (sigh) great again. The campaign is over Mr Trump. It's past time for you to get serious about the work you signed up to do. That should be our posture to his troll-like behavior, to remind him he is not the outsider he used to be.

(I've collapsed the text into one paragraph.)</p><blockquote><i>Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases&nbsp;like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web&nbsp;massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!</i></blockquote><p>Never mind the hype, or spin or lies, it's cool that we can see the Repub exec communicate so openly with his&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=slave\">slaves</a> in Congress. This kind of stuff used to be done through back channels,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/presidentialrecordings/johnson\">privately</a> -- now it's out in the open for all to see.&nbsp;</p><p>And we can see that the Repubs are going to try to not-so-quietly sabotage ObamaCare, even more than they already have, and drum up popular anger about it. Expect ObamaCare to go off the front-burner, if Trump has his way, for now.&nbsp;</p><h4>Schumer <i>is</i> a clown</h4><p>I watched Schumer on <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/schumer-trump-being-really-dumb-to-fight-with-intel-agencies-847022147815\">Maddow</a> last night, and I agree with Trump, he is a clown. Maybe a good insider politician in Washington, and in NY he's the kind of guy we elect and reelect, but boy did he miss the point. He wasn't talking to Washington insiders on Maddow, he was talking to taxpayers, people who use ObamaCare and/or Medicare or who are paying into Social Security or drawing out of it. In other words, citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't give a shit if he wins a battle with Repubs, I want to live my life and have my health insurance, and know that other Americans aren't being cheated out of what they paid for. This isn't a game to us Schumer, it's our fucking lives. But there's Schumer talking about holding their feet to the fire, whatever that <a href=\"http://www.yourdictionary.com/hold-someone-s-feet-to-the-fire\">means</a>, and the chaos he talks about so gleefully will be chaos in my fucking life you asshole.</p><p>Thanks for listening. I had to get it off my chest. :-)</p><h4>Bernie was hot</h4><p>BTW, Bernie Sanders also was <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/sanders-republicans-wrong-to-claim-mandate-847073347789\">on</a> Maddow last night, after Schumer, and where Schumer was lost in DC insider bullshit, Sanders was talking to us, loud and clear.&nbsp;</p><p>It's really all about perspective. News media would do well to pay attention. Stop reporting the inside game and tell the people watching what the news means to them. Sanders did that beautifully. It's <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/12/18/pressFreedomIsNotMyFreedom.html\">really</a> not that hard.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicco\">Nicco</a>, you all should teach this at Shorenstein.&nbsp;</p><h4>Note to Jack</h4><p>Schumer is right about <a href=\"http://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-local/article/In-floor-speech-Schumer-warns-of-Twitter-10833782.php\">one thing</a>. 140 chars is no way to run a country.</p><p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/04/trumptweets.png\">Look</a> at how Trump has to say his thing. What an embarrassment. Hasn't this gone far enough? Shouldn't Twitter have a payload type of simple styled text with links? Bold, italic, anchors. Please I beg you. Twitter is so central to political discourse now, but one thing Schumer is right about, 140 characters isn't enough.&nbsp;</p>",

There are another twenty whose paywalls I hit regularly. If I paid for all the subscriptions whose paywalls I hit, I would be spending a lot more for news than I do for the Internet connection that gets me to the news, in addition to most of what I read which is not-for-pay. That doesn't seem right to me, and it isn't containable. There will always be another source I would like to read but can't because of this unworkable economic system.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead I want what I get from Facebook without the algorithm. All the news sources appearing in a reverse-chronologic river, with the possibility of having a mailbox-style reader (as I have for Twitter with <a href=\"http://happyfriends.camp/\">Happy Friends</a>) and I pay a flat fee per month which is then allocated to the pubs based on how much I read their work.&nbsp;</p><p>I know it's not perfect, it rewards linkbait, but I also get to choose which pubs show up in my river, using a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/futureNews.html\">checkbox-news</a> style interface. So new ones show up, but they can easily be banished if they turn out to be spammy. And my friendships should also cause new pubs to be suggested.</p><p>The best part of it is this -- level playing field. No more gatekeeping by the big news orgs. The gatekeepers don't even serve them anymore. We get the same voices saying the same things, as the world changes, they're following a river that has gone dry, meanwhile the actual news has charted a different course.&nbsp;</p><p>We need a union of news orgs, implemented as a web site, with a business model that merges all the different for-pay methods. It should be easy to use like Facebook, but without the conflicts of Facebook and open to bloggers and new voices who aren't controlled by corporate media.</p><p>PS: It seems to me that Twitter could serve this need, quite nicely, btw.</p>",

            "text": "<p>This post came from a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/david.weinberger.9809/posts/1205541769482670\">thread</a> on Facebook started by David Weinberger where he asked if there would be any poets at the Trump inaugural. I decided to take it seriously. What would a poet say? This is what I imagined I would say if given a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>You know all that talk about political correctness?</p><p>Yes, I know it's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics\">dog whistle</a> for racism. I know. But there's also a problem that it points to, and it's worth looking at, not passing over.</p><p>Consider an example, how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin\">Steve Martin</a> eulogized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher\">Carrie Fisher</a> on Twitter:</p><blockquote>\"When I was a young man, Carrie Fisher was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. She turned out to be witty and bright as well.\"</blockquote><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police\">thought police</a> swooped in and took him apart for saying she was a beautiful creature. Men, apparently aren't supposed to think that about women, even when that's pretty much exactly as she was presenting herself&nbsp;to the world at the time. His fault was telling the truth. And it's something that when said by a woman about a man is considered liberating. Too often we impose really harsh judgement when we could choose not to. This is one of those times, with Martin's innocent expression, to have taken the high road. But people sense vulnerability, and they hit him hard.</p><p>Trump has taken advantage of this mistake, but there's an element of truth to what he says, there <i>is</i> too much political correctness in our world, it's stifling and often unnecessary, an expression of power that helps no one, and of course Trump pushes it way too far.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In my younger days, when I was skinny and fit and full of success and youthful optimism, I </span><i>loved</i><span> it when women treated me as if I was a beautiful creature, especially older women, in appreciation of my sexuality. It was nice to not have to say a word and still be desired.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I have enough women friends to know that in the right context they too like the feeling of being sexually appealing.</p><p>Some things like racial hate should be covered up, not shared publicly and criticized when it shows up. But this was love, not hate and it was in a eulogy for a person whose sexuality was something she offered openly and publicly. If you think Carrie Fisher wasn't selling her sexuality&nbsp;you and I live on different planets. Martin merely said that, as a young man, he appreciated it. B.F.D.</p><p>BTW, it's possible that Martin was really saying that he slept with her, and then they became friends. That's how I interpreted what he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we have a government taking office that is seriously dangerous where Steve Martin's comment wasn't dangerous at all. We need to learn the difference. Decide if he meant well, if what he was saying came from love, appreciation and grief, at the passing of a friend and if so, cut him some slack, learn <i>not</i> to object.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case the change that needs to happen is not with Martin but with the world he lives in.&nbsp;</p>",

He says:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>For elegant text-based publishing, there is a need for a simple, easy-to-use, well-designed platform such as Medium. WordPress was supposed to deliver just that, but it took a geeky turn, saturating its ecosystem with scores of third-party plugins — more than 48,000 at last count — whose quality can charitably be called uneven. Most WordPress sites end up using dozens of plugins, each one bound to create its own set of problems: slow page-loads, crashes, random behaviors or update cycles that don’t match WP's platform agenda. Unless you have sizable tech resources at your disposal, WordPress is a nightmare. Switching to Medium gives you the impression of going from MS-DOS to iOS.</blockquote><p>I think it is fair to say WordPress is to Medium as MS-DOS is to iOS, but for different reasons. T<span>o be fair you have to compare Medium to the </span><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">hosted version</a><span> of WordPress. There are no plugins there and none of the complications or management hassles he describes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However the user interface of&nbsp;</span>WordPress<span>&nbsp;is large and spread out, the commands you need are organized in a way that&nbsp;makes them hard to find. A lot of the problems I have with WP could be solved by reorganizing its command structure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The second reason Medium is preferred is the editor. It was a major advance in browser-based editing when it came out five years ago. If you were to graft the Medium editor onto WordPress and reorganize the commands, you'd really have something. They could address the question he raises by providing a standard \"reference release\" of WordPress that includes a set of commonly used plugins that are known to work well with each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Filloux then reviews the business problems that Medium has, most of which come from having raised a large amount of venture capital and because of that having to find a revolutionary product that changes the economics of publishing. A tall order. And every time they pivot, the confidence in them finding such a model dwindles. This is something that's not just felt by investors but by Medium users and it depresses the general blogging activity.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, all the content that continues to pour into Medium is at risk due to the missing business model. And this is where I part with&nbsp;Filloux. I wonder why he only discusses Medium's interest and the interest of its shareholders. What about <i>his</i> interest and that of other people who use Medium as their publishing platform? Is this the best way?&nbsp;</p><p>I argue that it's not. That what we need is a better designed WordPress, or an open source Medium. Or something new that is inspired by Medium's smooth UI, and WordPress's open source heritage.&nbsp;</p><p>We need lots of choices, not two.&nbsp;</p><p>One more thing to consider. While Medium has been searching for its business model, open source software has been making the editing ease-of-use accessible to any JavaScript developer. So it's getting more plausible every year that users can get what they like about Medium, without waiting for them to find the revolutionary business model.</p>",

Create an outline called menubar.opml.&nbsp;<span>The top level items are the names of menus. The sub-items are the commands, and the subs under each command is the text of the script that is run when the command is chosen. You edit everything in the outliner.</span></p><p><span>When you change the text in the menubar outline, the menus automatically rebuild. You don't have to have menubar.opml open to use the commands. They will always be there when you're using <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/\">Little Outliner</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The language is JavaScript. The scripts are run by the browser through the built-in <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp\">eval</a> function. Your scripts can call any function inside LO2.&nbsp;</p><p>As in Fargo, there is a <a href=\"http://littleoutliner.com/code/verbs.js\">set of functions</a> that are pretty much guaranteed to work across versions of LO2, and you should use those whenever possible to be sure that your scripts continue to work. For historic reasons we call these functions verbs. &nbsp;</p><p>I basically copied the verbs that were in Fargo, and commented out the ones that don't make sense in LO2, for example the <i>wordpress</i> and <i>cms</i> verbs.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>file</i> verbs don't work but they might at some time in the future, so I left them in place.&nbsp;</p><p>I left the <i>fargo</i> verbs because they do work here, they just get the version and name of the product. In this case they will reflect the version and name of the Little Outliner app. So for example this will work:</p><blockquote>dialog.alert (fargo.version ());</blockquote><p>Caveat: I did very little testing of the verbs. Some of them will not work because they were specific to the Fargo environment. Use common sense. If you have encountered a verb that does not work that you think should work, report it as a bug in a comment below. Include a bit of script code to illustrate.</p><p>Pro tip: I recently learned that you can access the JavaScript debugger from one of these scripts. You can drop into the debugger by calling debugger; in your code. You have to open up JavaScript tools yourself, the debugger call won't do that for you. But it's a very important feature if you're writing complex script code.&nbsp;</p><p>Historic note: These verbs came from Frontier, so Frontier programmers will feel right at home.&nbsp;</p><p>I've turned comments on for this post so if you have questions you can ask them here.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://lo.1999.io/2017/01/17/theScriptsMenu.html\">Update 1/17</a>: More verbs and the menus are now hierarchic.&nbsp;</p>",

Its market cap is $12.39B.</p><p>I've asked about this privately among friends who are investment bankers, and they all quote from TWTR's balance sheet. They don't see the upside of Twitter owned as a political tool, as a lever by which to influence, or to compete to run/own the US govt.</p><p>And <i>own</i> is the right word. If Trump gets in without divesting, then an election in the future will be more like a corporate merger. The guy who runs the US has no conflict of interest, and can keep his or her investments, they just have to steer clear of <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=emolument\">emoluments</a> and they're constitutional. I bet Zuck and Bezos have lawyers looking into this. Also Bill Gates, Steve Case, Meg Whitman and Eric Schmidt.</p><p>Anyway, all this means the the political landscape in the US has been re-factored and owning a social net will be a big advantage going forward.

There are lots of podcasts that people do because they love to share what they know. As one of the people who designed and developed podcasting, I want you to know that I did that work not so it could be something journalists do, but rather something that <i>people</i> do. And that can and should shape how journalists approach podcasting. But no inclusion. Nothing.</p><p>The world of online information and perspective sharing is so much bigger than journalism.&nbsp;<span>It's like the world the journalists imagine if the the White House were to kick them out. Not talk to them. Not listen to them. Then their work would be less meaningful. This is how I feel about the connection between bloggers and journalists.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We, collectively, as a society have made mistakes in dealing with the rise of Trump, using our tools, btw, that we would not have made if our perspectives were integrated into the work of journalism.&nbsp;</span></p><p>It's as if when the journalists discovered blogging, they said \"Oh this is what we do, we'll take it from here.\" But it's not what you do.

Let's do it right, so that I don't have to do this over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>So I designed a system that would depend on the existence of a Scripts menu. Unfortunately the outliner didn't have that feature. So I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/12/scriptsMenuInLittleOutliner.html\">added</a> it. And a couple of users asked for file verbs. And I made the menu hierarchic.</p><p>Now I had what I needed. I wrote a menu script that takes an outline and turns it into a listicle. It's just connecting stuff together. There's a small template file, I read it, do some string substitutions, and write it out into the user's space on littleoutliner.com.&nbsp;</p><p>The result is <a href=\"http://storage.littleoutliner.com/users/littleoutliner/listicles/test1.html\">this</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Of course I used a Grateful Dead song to create the demo, as I often do, when getting something interesting started.

If you exclude people, then you are not inclusive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Longer version.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Inclusivity today means creating opportunity for people of color, of certain religions and ethnicities, LGBTQs and women.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I voted for Clinton, and I'm scared of President Trump. But I also am a white man. And I want to say something.</p><p>Inclusivity is not a zero-sum thing. If you include someone that does not imply that you exclude others. Progressives, of whom I am one, have been just as guilty of zero-sum thinking as the Trumpists.&nbsp;</p><p>And imho, Trump got a bunch of votes because inclusivity has become a zero-sum thing among progressives.&nbsp;</p><p>An example. I was struck by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/upshot/republican-men-say-its-a-better-time-to-be-a-woman-than-a-man.html?_r=0\">tone</a> of an article in today's NYT. It's a story about Republican men, and it's whole point is (again, sigh) how men are wrong. As a man, I can't tell you how tired I am of hearing that. Exhausted. It gives me something in common with the Trump voters.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a woman, I don't think you can hear how often this theme is repeated. But as a man, I hear it all the time. Shut up because you're a man.</p><p>A better way to view the world is to find people you can work with, and stop worrying how they got there. You may resent me, but put that aside, and fucking work with me. And go out of your way to include the people you've been excluding, and who you've been condescending to. Listen to your own words and imagine someone saying them to you. If you would find them offensive then don't say them. Learn to be really fully inclusive.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And when you do that, that might give us the margins we need to take back control of the government. A pragmatic result from basically doing what's right. How could that be bad.</span></p><p><span>I'm going to march with the women on the 21st in NYC but I'm going to wonder if you would march with me if we had a march for men (and know the answer in advance, you wouldn't). Until I feel supported, and loved and accepted, we're still going to be divided. And that division comes from progressives not conservatives. We need to acknowledge that and fix it.&nbsp;</span></p><p>If your reaction is hostile, then imho you're like the people who, when they hear <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/17/0880.html\">Black Lives Matter</a> say All Lives Matter. You are no better.&nbsp;</p>",

This has been his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi\">M.O</a>. in private life and people who know him say it's certain that will go with him to the White House.</p><p>I remember a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/12/13/chrisHayesInTrumpland.html\">town hall</a> with Trump voters, just after the election, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenosha,_Wisconsin\">Kenosha</a>, a factory town that lost its factory, north of Milwaukee. A Trump voter was sure that checks and balances would stop Trump from doing anything too terrible. It turns out that's not true, and that was knowable before the election, and should have been factored into his thinking. It's especially not true if there's a Republican majority in Congress.</p><p>In this alternate reality people know the arcane rules of football and basketball better than they know the rules of government. This, in a country that has, if we do our jobs, <i>self</i>-government. We let people tell us it's too complicated, we listened to their confusing lies, and let them confuse us, thus giving them the power to decide for us. </p><p>All that stands between us and chaos now are the Republican members of Congress, the military and federal police (FBI, NSA, CIA et al). Maybe the courts. Because it's clear the president will do exactly what he wants until someone forces him to stop.</p><h4>Next chapter</h4><p>I'm doing some of the best writing of my life in pngWriter. </p><p>It's the combination of the Twitter writing ethos, which says typos are okay, and if you're wrong, well there's always another tweet coming up right after this one. Nothing is too important, so that allows you to be breezy here, where writing on the blog is more formal.</p><p>This works for me. I just copy and paste the finished copy from pngWriter into my blog, edit, link, add a picture and an abstract and publish. It's made my blog writing better. </p><p>I know people want me to release it. That's great. Hold on to that. My experience with product releases is that people say they're excited, but when it comes time to use the product, they either don't use it, or they abuse it. This does not create an incentive for me to release stuff. I finally decided I had enough of this system. It's amazing in a way that it took me this long. </p><p>If you want people to develop software in the space between social networks and blogging, we need to get the system operators, the Twitters, Googles, Facebooks, Amazons, etc to participate. They really don't give a shit. Both in appearance and fact. And users have to give a shit too, btw. </p><p>These networks are our world these days. And they aren't being well maintained. We don't have parks, or places to create and compete. They are stagnant, non-evolving places. They all suck. So how can developers make it better, when you all wallow in the suckage, Really, there's a problem here. </p><p>Users need to get a sense that they have something at stake, and stop herding to the cheapest most mass systems. Diversify and you will get diversity. And real innovation. </p><p>Take responsibility for your future, and stop waiting for people to hand it to you. When you do, you get shit.</p><p>More to come..</p><h4>The word is pride</h4><p>I saw Obama speak twice at the DNC in 2004. I was lucky to be there. Once at the blogger's breakfast. He was presented as the next hot thing in the Democratic Party. I didn't see what the big deal was about. He seemed like a state senator from Illinois. Then he gave the keynote and still, I didn't see anything there. </p><p>The pride thing finally hit me when he gave the race speech, about his pastor, who said a lot of very true things about America, things that Republicans don't want to hear. But I didn't mind. The thing I felt was pride when Obama explained race from his point of view. </p><p>Then there were prideful moments again and again, until it became normal, and DC devolved into the crazy that passes for government. I forgot that I was proud of him and us, for him being where he was. </p><p>Now, on the last day of his term in office, it hits me bigtime. </p><p>I am proud of him and us, for him having been where he was, for so long. And where he will be forever. As a symbol that we have greatness in us. </p><p>I am proud of Obama and proud of America.&nbsp;</p>",

He said all new administrations seem to do it.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“I think it’s always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it’s going to be forever. Nothing is forever in this country. We have an election every two years right on schedule, and we have had since 1788,” the Kentucky Republican said. “We’ve been given a temporary lease on power, if you will.”&nbsp;</blockquote><p>McConnell isn't someone I usually quote, but on this he is an expert.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the Trumps, as distinct from the Repubs, have overreached.&nbsp;</p><p>The frog can tell the water is boiling while there is still time to jump out of the pot.&nbsp;</p><p>Are they being smart, do they see something we don't over there in the Trump White House? Maybe so. On the other hand maybe they're doing the same thing so many newly-elected majorities do, overreaching.&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhere deep inside every Republican politician is a basic will to survive. They're constantly trading off options. The billionaires who pull their strings do the same. They may think they're super men and women but they're just people like us. When their fear rises too quickly, they might be inspired to act.&nbsp;</p><p>We need the Repubs to grow a pair and put a stop to all this.</p>",

            "text": "<p>I listened to a <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/12818.html\">podcast</a> discussion between Buzzfeed editor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)\">Ben Smith</a> and New Yorker editor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Remnick\">David Remnick</a> about Smith's decision to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonycormier/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-secret-trump-dossier?utm_term=.ju53kA81w#.wcZMbVDyQ\">release</a> the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html\">dossier</a> of opposition research on Trump. This is the second time I've heard Smith interviewed on this subject, the other time was on the Chris Hayes show on MSNBC.&nbsp;</p><p>They reached a conclusion, sort of, that there's a difference in ethos between reporters that came up through blogs and ones who write for New Yorker, a 90-year-old publication known for excellence and breaking big stories (no sarcasm).</p><p>But it wasn't a satisfying conclusion, and I have some standing as part of the early evolution of the blogosphere whose traditions led Smith to the correct answer, to release the dossier. I just wish they had done it in time to make a difference in the election.&nbsp;</p><p>So, to me there are two reasons, the first more important than the second.</p><p></p><ol><li><span>Smith identifies with his readers. It would be outrageous for him to have valuable source material like the dossier and keep it hidden from his readers.</span></li><li><span>There had already been extensive dumps of Clinton campaign emails, but none on Trump's. Now we know why. The Democrats were being nice, </span><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/harry-reid-letter-fbi-james-comey-clinton-emails-trump-russia-ties-hatch-act/\">pleading</a><span> with the FBI to release the dossier without telling the public there </span><i>was</i><span> a dossier, and the press were being even nicer, sitting on the dossier until after the election, though happily publishing Clinton's emails, and Comey's scolding and his 11th hour letter and 12th hour retraction. Somehow that was okay but it was not okay to release the Trump dossier? I don't get it.</span></li></ol><p></p><p><span>Put a disclaimer on it, as Buzzfeed did, and trust the readers to be smart enough to figure it out for themselves. Trust is a two-way thing. If you don't trust your readers it would be unreasonable for you to expect that they would trust you.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I have yet to hear a convincing reason why any news org would hold on to the dossier.</p><p>BTW, it's offensive to think this difference in values is connected to age. Although Smith was careful not to say it, Remnick mentioned it several times. I'm older than <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=how+old+david+remnick&amp;oq=how+old+david+remnick&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.3199j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">both</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Smith_(journalist)\">them</a>, and I feel strongly that the blogger ethos is the correct one, because it's grounded in the connection between news and reader. That's really what matters in news, imho.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The \"we know better\" idea that the press are inside, and will decide what the outsiders are entitled to know, is very old and isn't real anymore. The people own the means of publication now alongside the press. Eventually the dossier would have gotten out even if all the journalists agreed to embargo it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There's a big trust problem because you guys make simple questions complicated, like this one.&nbsp;</span><span>Think on your feet, and stay focused on what your readers need and want, and stop being so fair to people who cut all the corners, including ones we don't know anything about, like Trump. He withholds vital information, don't you do it too. And the people, the readers, are the ones who have to decide, and then live with the consequences. It's better if they know what they're getting into.</span></p>",

Ingram makes it sound like a conundrum. If they don't give her airtime that will just fuel their argument that the press is at war with them. So -- confusion.</p><p><span>But if you actually look at it like a war, or a sport, which are all modeled after war -- like tennis or chess or canasta, play it out. Either way they're going to say the same thing. It doesn't matter what you do. Anything you do will provoke the same response.</span></p><p>Why do I see this so clearly? Because I once tried to appease a platform vendor who was committed to crushing my small startup. They kept giving us hoops to jump through, and we would jump through them. There was always another hoop. Eventually they won. But the truth was they had won the moment they started. </p><p>POTUS has power and tools you can only dream of, as with the platform vendor we had the hubris to challenge. If Trump goes to war with you, he wins. So you might as well accept that from the beginning, and change how you see yourself, and change your goals accordingly. </p><p>I suggest you think of yourself as one of your readers or listeners, one with an extra big megaphone. You have no more rights or privilege than we do. Now you can relax and be glad you get paid to do this. Eliminate any sense of power or right or privilege and you now are fighting a different battle, not one where you can bring down a corrupt leader, but one where you can help the people figure out what's going on, even a little. That's a different kind of <i>achievable</i> victory.</p><p>And for crying out loud don't go to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents%27_Association#White_House_Correspondents.27_Dinner\">Nerd Prom</a> this year. It will be totally humiliating, in ways you can't possibly imagine.&nbsp;</p>",

And I don't think there's any question that he wants it. Of course he does.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Starting early in the campaign he <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=trump+asks+why+hillary+was+allowed+to+run\">asked</a> why Hillary Clinton was allowed to run. I always wanted to ask a followup: Who does he thinks decides? The answer is of course, in the US, no one. We are all equal. There are rules about who can and can't run, you have to be a citizen, over 35, and born in the US. I think that's about it.</p><p>In the US we're all about <a href=\"http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-self-government-definition-lesson-quiz.html\">self-government</a>. This is a basic core value. That's the opposite of how Trump sees it. He thinks that <i>he's</i> the government. We're the subjects. This is the clash of values between the people and the president. I doubt if many of his voters see him as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_for_Life\">President For Life</a>, but there's no doubt that Trump does. (We should raise this question, with both Trump and the voters.)</p><p>Anyway, obviously, now that he's president, he will decide who can run against him in 2020.</p><p><span>Later in the campaign, he said at least once, that we should not bother with the election, let him be president. He might say he was joking, I don't think it was a joke, it was a pitch.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There were other clues. The \"Lock her up\" slogan. An insult to the Constitution. It isn't up to a crowd whether or not someone is locked up. That's the point of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights\">Bill of Rights</a>. There's no majority rule when it comes to the rights and freedom of an individual. The individual is sacred in our country.</p><p>Also, I'm done being a good guy and giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. When someone tells you who they are, believe them. He has told us his intentions, in plain language, over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/827726260247859200\">must not</a> give an inch on the rule of law. While I don't like him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827867311054974976\">questioning</a> <a href=\"http://www.memeorandum.com/170204/p11#a170204p11\">the</a> <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-so-called-judge-travel-ban\">legitimacy</a> of the court, the executive branch is following the court order. I would love to know how that discussion went inside the government. Perhaps it was DHS acting independently?

It's great that the states and the courts are standing up to the president. This is the fight for the soul of America. It's not over yet.&nbsp;</p>",

Objectively.</p><p>But the press plays along with the (imho) farce that Trump is on top, ready to respond to crises, or even driving what his admin is doing.</p><p>Perhaps instead of 1984 or Brave New World, we all ought to be reviewing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNo0BicRM8k\">Wag the Dog</a>?</p><p>People joke about #presidentbannon b/c we think we understand what's going on.

And everyone knows this.</p><p>But we are collectively pretending we don't.</p><p>The flow of EOs has stopped, which is good, by govt managers, the military and courts. system worked. we passed a big test.</p><p>The next step, to get back on solid ground, get someone in charge of the White House who is up to the job.

A few very simple additions to Facebook would help bring the web into Facebook, but they are deaf to this. As is the press. Why? Presumably because it isn't 100 percent about them.&nbsp;</p><p>Also when we hear how Facebook is stifling news, we never hear the other side, how news ceded its distribution to Facebook, and how we still don't know it wouldn't work, if the news industry just replicated what Facebook does, without the mistakes that Facebook makes. I think it <i>would</i> work. And as a user of news, I wish they would just do it. In America, we have a word for this -- competition, and like the First Amendment, it's one of our core values. You can't prove someone has a monopoly if you haven't even tried to compete with them. As the great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Nisker\">Scoop Nisker</a> says, \"if you don't like the news, go out and make some of your own.\" That includes the news itself, imho.</p><p>Then just now I heard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis\">Jeff Jarvis</a>, famous news-about-news pundit say, on the BBC News Hour, that journalism must be better at self-examination. Right there that's the bug. They need to not so much depend on self-examination, but rather learn how to listen to their users, not as amorphous mindless <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry\">slurry</a>, but as sentient beings.</p><p>For an industry whose existence depends on its ability to listen, news has become a ghoulish imitation of itself, sort of the Walking Dead of listening. They just can't do it. Most of what they do is recycle fumes. Yes there is some actual news in the fumes, esp in 2017 when the news is so rapid and real, but it would do better if instead of gradually reforming, news underwent a revolution of relevance. Let the people take over for a while. Find ways to radically listen. Extreme listening. It'll be painful at first, but no pain no gain. On the other side, we'll all be better for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is the Truth of Trump in every way. He himself is a disaster. But he forces us to get off our butts and actually work with each other. And that means the press has to learn to work with people who criticize it, because in the criticism, is truth that the news industry has been scrupulously avoiding.&nbsp;</p>",

While not a new phenomenon, the problem is compounded by both the speed that information travels in our networked world, and the technological and cultural “filter bubbles” that we live our lives in. This is a problem that impacts all of us.</blockquote><p>I was trying to figure out if I should go.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the focus should be the other way, on <i>collecting news flows that are reliable,</i> from people and orgs who are trying to get accurate stories. I think that problem is easily solved, and then the next problem is revealed -- how to get people to come there for news.</p><p>I can create the flow, I have -- but I can't get people to come there.</p><p>I think this requires a change in thinking at the news orgs, that their futures are tied together, that without flowing their ideas through one central place (actually a number of them) they will eventually sink under the weight of all the flows captured on Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>We should have done this years ago, but now it's urgent.</p><p>So I don't think Misinfocon is for me. I would prefer to have a small meetup with a few systems people from news orgs, and create a UX for news-hungry people that only includes trustworthy pubs.

It's really good and they're doing good. Unlike other shows that are still stuck in horserace mode, if you can believe that, Maddow has the guts to report on the world we're in now, the one that needs us to save it.</span></p><p>Anyway, reporting on a <a href=\"http://thememoryhole2.org/blog/aphis-annual-reports\">blogger</a> who did a <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/this-blog-is-republishing-all-the-animal-welfare-records-the-usda-deleted?utm_source=mbtwitter\">backup</a> of the USDA website that they took offline, she said something like this --</p><blockquote>We should all do what we're good at.</blockquote><p>I had more or less come to that conclusion. It's why I so desperately want to help news get on solid distributed ground where it can be not-so-easily controlled by a crooked and corrupt government.</p><p><span>All that's missing are users and developers.</span></p><p>Users who will use the product of the open systems created by the developers. The technology to create an open news ecosystem is trivial. And it doesn't need to be implemented. It already exists. </p><p>This is the amazing thing -- it already exists. Say that 100 times. </p><p>It already exists and <b>WE AREN'T USING IT</b>.</p><p>That's a crime.&nbsp;</p><h4>To developers</h4><p>This originally appeared as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/829720469515411457\">tweet</a>. Since many of the people who read this blog are developers, I should say where, if you want to get involved, you could start.</p><p>To be a good developer you first have to become a user. So I would recommend downloading and installing <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a>. You don't need a server to run it. Set it up to follow some feeds you like, let it run for a few days. Visit the river page several times a day. Add more feeds if you want.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an open news system. That's all there is to it. You don't have to be much of a developer to set one of these up.</p><p>Now what can you do with it? Put it on a public instance at AWS or Digital Ocean or where ever you like to host. It should be part of your political group. Or if you work at a news pub, it should be something you provide as a service to your editorial people. Let them tell you what to subscribe to.</p><p>That should give you more ideas. Build! Serve your users. Help open news thrive. We need it to survive.&nbsp;</p><h4>To users</h4><p>But wait there's stuff users can do too!</p><p>First thing, can you find a developer to set up a river for you, as described above? If so, send them to this page. Make sure they know how much you love and appreciate them, and how important their work is to the cause. Take your developer friend to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2001/03/31.html#takeAProgrammerToLunch\">lunch</a>. It's a little secret, programmers like to be appreciated, pretty much like other people. :balloon:</p><p>Until then, you can start using my rivers. I did what I describe above. I have one for <a href=\"http://politics.newsriver.org/\">politics</a>, one&nbsp;for the <a href=\"http://nbariver.com/\">NBA</a>, a river of <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/\">podcasts</a>. These are of course just examples, but they are useful on their own. These are total labors of love, I'm not trying to sell you anything other than our freedom to share what we learn without using centralized systems. It's going to be really important if things go badly.</p>",

It's a complicated story, touches on a bunch of different viewpoints, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timberners_lee\">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://stallman.org/twitter.html\">Richard Stallman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow\">Cory Doctorow</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Joi\">Joi Ito</a>.</p><p>My point of view: I have been, at one time, a dues-paying corporate member of the W3C, around the time XML-RPC was becoming SOAP, but I mostly stayed away from the process. I saw it as a <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Time%20sink\">time sink</a>, it took me away from developing features for users, which is what I like to do. It looked to me as if the goal of the W3C was to negotiate between the big companies of the day, at times Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Sun, IBM, then Google, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, the entertainment industry, these days.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea -- take a public resource and let the biggest companies divide up its future. The result is as lifeless as you might imagine. A big part of the reason imho why the web is in so much trouble these days.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Anyway, I wanted to offer my two cents in the DRM debate.</span></p><h4><span>Should the web have DRM?</span></h4><p>I don't see why the web needs DRM.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there a simple one or two page summary of the reasons for DRM?&nbsp;<span>I understand why big media companies want to keep people from copying their movies, music, TV shows, etc. No judgement on that. In that I'm not as radical as Stallman, but I'm closer to his view than I am to that of big companies with expensive content that they want to lock up under DRM.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I was surprised to hear that MIT is unhappy that the W3C isn't paying rent. They are entitled of course, but I don't think the web itself should have to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I see how the web can help big companies, but I wonder when you all are going give back to the web? Seriously, the web has given us so much, and it's languishing because the big companies and the organizations they back suck the life out of it, and we stand by and say nothing? What does the web get in return for making these companies and their founders so rich?&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe we should have a negotiation. Someone should stand for just the web. You can have DRM, but in return you have to help the web. If you can't do that, then the argument might go, the web can't help you.</p>",

We agree that it's America's strength that we can listen to each other, disagree, and co-exist in the same political system. We love that about our country, even if we disagree about almost everything else.&nbsp;</p><p>Frum says the two main threats from Trump are:</p><ol><li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy\">kleptocracy</a>.</li><li>His <a href=\"http://trumpstatus.org/#1485466299000\">connection</a> with Russia.</li></ol><p>But even those aren't the big problem. It's the things he will do to cover them up that are going to destroy the republic if left unchecked.</p><p>Therefore he says and I agree the two things we should focus on are:</p><ol><li>Demand the release of his tax returns.</li><li>Call for a bipartisan investigation into the connection with Russia.</li></ol><p>He suggests that the commission be led by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff\">Michael Chertoff</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Albright\">Madeleine Albright</a>. A Republican and a Democrat who are widely respected in the US and around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Also it's important to track progress. When a decision is made on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WaysMeansCmte/status/831539930434240512\">tax returns</a> or the commission, pass the link around to your social media followers. It's not as salacious as the latest TrumpTweet, but keeping the pressure up on these two issues keep the process focused on what really matters.</p><h4>Be inclusive if you want to win</h4><p>One more thing Frum says, and I totally agree, if you can't rally with people you disagree with on other issues, then Trump is not your biggest issue.&nbsp;</p><p>His example. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/womens-march.html?_r=0\">Women's March</a> on January 21 wouldn't admit pro-life speakers. Pro-life speakers who can't support Trump? Those are <i>our</i> people. (Note: I am pro-choice.)</p><p>That's probably why we should have had a more general protest, one that didn't have the conflicts that the Women's March brought to it. Getting past the Trump crisis is the most important thing right now as far as I'm concerned. We must work with everyone who agrees.&nbsp;</p><h4>The Daily podcast</h4><p>The NYT has a real winner with the <a href=\"https://api.nytimes.com/podcasts-rss/zKq6WZZLTlbM?apikey=18736e07a8184bf2a3f1a9ed57ed5152\">Daily podcast</a>. It's only 20 minutes, so it fits in with my other daily podcast listening. And it's great stuff, and quick. No points belabored, the news of the day covered. I'm hooked.&nbsp;</p>",

So a common verb set was a goal. I shouldn't have to do anything to be able to call these routines.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part, was, although I didn't know it when I started, putting aside the \"async religion\" of JavaScript, and flattening the scripting interface.&nbsp;</p><p>What this means is functions return results instead of taking callback parameters.&nbsp;</p><p>So this is how you'd copy a file:</p><blockquote>file.writeWholeFile (dest, file.readWholeFile (source))</blockquote><p>Turns out there are synchronous versions of a lot of the things that we do in JavaScript. You just have to look for them. They all have huge disclaimers, but those, if you think about it, only apply to code running in the browser or on the server.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a third place. The place where you've had to turn to Python, where JavaScript just won't do, because it's too complex. In the one-off connective glue scripts you have to write to keep an evolving web presence working. That's a key idea. That's the third place.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to mark this moment, I think I figured out how it'll work. And rather than lose the thought process that got me here, I recorded a 25-minute <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/02/17/electronRunner.m4a\">podcast</a>, telling the story of how 40 years of dev work led to this place and hopefully far beyond. :balloon:</p>",

It was a humiliation not just for the president, but for a country with a long history of racial oppression, trying to overcome its past.&nbsp;</p><p>But I had a bad feeling. I had learned from years of conflict in business and tech, that you don't want that last bit of victory, it always comes back to bite you. When you win, you want to be gracious, extend an olive branch, be big, even if inside you feel like taking the revenge that is yours.&nbsp;</p><p>I learned this lesson from a defeated adversary. When I first arrived in Silicon Valley, I did a deal with a company called Personal Software, that had just bought a product called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc\">VisiCalc</a>, which was the first spreadsheet program. They became a juggernaut, and my product, which eventually became <a href=\"http://outliners.scripting.com/thinkTank2Pc.html\">ThinkTank</a>, wasn't making it. When I finally delivered, the company decided not to market it, and they told me about their decision in a nasty, humiliating way. I was forced to take a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perp_walk\">perp walk</a> through the company offices, administered by a guy I'll call Rick, though that's not his real name.</p><p>A few years later, Personal Software was gone, a victim of its own success, and my company, formed around the project they rejected, was thriving. I forget what I was doing, but I was playing with Rick, making his life miserable, because our fortunes were reversed. I was on top, and he was the loser. He reached out to me, and said something memorable (paraphrased).&nbsp;</p><p>\"You won, Dave, I see that. It would be great if you'd let me get on with my life.\"</p><p>I felt shame. I stopped. And every time I won a personal victory, I remembered Rick and his humility.&nbsp;</p><p>But Rick, when he dragged me down, actually did me a huge favor, as Obama did for Trump that night. Rick motivated me. He gave me the push I needed to win. I had a <i>reason</i> to win, to kick his ass. It worked. And in the end I found I didn't need to kick his ass, the victory itself was enough of a reward.</p><p>Obama should now have learned that lesson. He was the guy up on stage, speaking in front of a podium that said President of the United States. Trump was in the audience, with no mike, no voice. Trump had to take it. But he was brewing his revenge as Obama humiliated him, a revenge that he would ultimately take out on all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>Why tell this story now?&nbsp;</p><p>Because Trump just did it to <i>his</i> adversaries.&nbsp;</p><p>His&nbsp;<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/02/18/trumpTweet.png\">tweet</a>, where he called American journalism the \"enemy of the people\" was too much. It was so wrong, so dangerous, so \"burn down the house\" that it motivates me, an American citizen and voter, to want to see him brought down. It tells me that there is certainly something very awful that he doesn't want anyone to know. So now we have to know it. And journalism will be part of how we get to know it.</p><p>It could motivate the Republican Congress to take a chance, really a small one, and authorize an independent commission with subpoena power, to investigate, so the news doesn't have to break through leaks. It should come out legally, under government supervision. Whatever the truth is, whatever it is that connects the Trump Family to Russia, we have to know it, we will know it. Either through the government or through journalism. And Trump, if he wishes to learn from his mistakes, will know he shouldn't have motivated his enemies.&nbsp;</p>",

We talked about the work I did with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon\">Chris Lydon</a> when we were both research fellows at <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/\">Berkman Center</a>, in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>I always worry about interviews, they can be like <a href=\"http://contactsheet.org/cgi-bin/ransom.pl?thedata=This+is+an+example+of+a+ransom+note.&amp;Button=Generate+Ransom+Note\">ransom notes</a>, you never know how they're going to reassemble your words and if the result will make sense or accurately represent what you believe or know.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm happy to report they did a good job of putting the story together. It's an <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/thursday-feb-16-2017-paying-tribute-to-stuart-mclean-1.3982583/how-podcasting-became-the-medium-for-the-people-1.3983769\">8-minute podcast</a>, and if you've been following this <a href=\"http://scripting.com/\">blog</a>, it's imho totally worth a listen.&nbsp;</p><p>I should add that podcasting started before I met Chris, and continued after I left Berkman. CBC chose this thread, but there are others they could have just as easily picked up.&nbsp;</p><p>And it's nice to see Chris get the credit he deserves. A lot of people thought it was too weird an idea. When I pitched him, he showed up, and while they don't mention this on the CBC show, his series of podcasts are the only audio documentation of the early political blogosphere. His interviews were first class, and he picked a very interesting group of people to cover, some of whom went on to have amazing careers as bloggers and political leaders.&nbsp;</p>",

Same argument as the Berkeley panel:</p><blockquote>What independent journalism needs more than ever from Silicon Valley is a significant transfer of wealth.</blockquote><p>I forwarded the post on Twitter with a single word comment: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/834174579497107456\">Pathetic</a>. I was going to leave it at that, but then I found myself ranting in DMs to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/mathew-ingram/\">Mathew Ingram</a>, a journalist friend. What came out was somewhat coherent, here's what I wrote.</p><ul><li>The reason I think it's pathetic is that it's a way of avoiding the changes that journalism has been avoiding.</li><li>Instead of competing with Facebook, which would lead journalism to its new relevance, they want a handout.</li><li>Well I want a handout too. Who wouldn't want a handout?</li><li>But this is a request to avoid growth, and no one is entitled to that.</li><li>It's immoral, it's lazy, it's unsupportable. And btw, practically speaking it's powerless. It just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/834393027863072768\">isn't</a> going to happen.&nbsp;</li><li>So journalism ought to have a good Plan B. It's right here, ready for you all to use, it's called the web. It's made for journalism.</li></ul><h4>Postscript</h4><p>I couldn't help myself, I had to write more. ;-)</p><p>Facebook sucks for news. We can create something so much better. I have tried to work with them, to get them to change in small ways that would help the web, and make Facebook a more adequate surface for writing, and keep hitting the same wall. <i>They like their business the way it is. </i>That imho makes them ripe for competition.&nbsp;</p><p>They might give journalism some money, but that isn't the answer. Journalism has to become what Facebook refuses to become. It's tough. But that's the way human evolution works.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes we need journalism, but the journalism we need is not what Bell describes, we need something re-born out of the web. I've been right about a lot of stuff over the years, and the journalism thinkers have never understood until it actually happens.&nbsp;</p><p>It won't go the way Bell wants it to go. But journalism will thrive on the net, I'm sure of it. Further it can't thrive in the environment Facebook has created. And as long as they're on top and generating all that money they have no incentive to change. And once they feel the heat, it'll be too late for them.</p><p>That about sums it up. :balloon:</p>",

I just downloaded it in a few seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>It includes interviews with (in alphabetic order):</p><blockquote><i>Harold Bloom, Ed Cone, Daily Kos, Robert Fisk, James Gleick, Glenn Reynolds, Julie Powell, Stephen Kinzer, The Real Preacher, Elaine Scarry, Doc Searls, David Sifry, Slugger O’Toole, Polly Toynbee, Eugene Volokh, David Weinberger, and myself. He also has a full Howard Dean speech, given in Concord, NH, and interviews with people who were present at the speech.</i></blockquote><p>I totally forgotten that we had done this. It came back to me via an email from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spWR2Czbrg\">librarian</a> who wanted permission to use these podcasts in an archive of early podcasting. Of course we said yes.&nbsp;</p><p>People wonder why we should preserve the history of the web. This is why. Now fourteen years later we can hear those podcasts and compare them to what is being produced today. I believe this work will stand up well.</p><p>PS: As a backup I uploaded a copy to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/misc/lydonInterviews.zip\">scripting.com</a>.</p>",

Get you thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>Along these lines...</p><p>In the US we always try to make everything fit into a market.&nbsp;</p><p>But some things resist that treatment.</p><p>For example, if it were to snow two feet tonight in NYC, how would you treat that with market economics? When I go out my front door, would I have to contract with a shoveler to clear a path for me to the subway? But if I did that, the people following me would get the same service for free. So the natural thing is to pool our money and pay a shoveler to clear a path for all of us. That way each of us pays a fraction of what it costs. You can see where this is going. Pooling our money is another word for tax. It's been given a bad name by persistent marketing, but it's still a good idea, and for natural events like snowstorms, any other approach is basically unworkable.</p><p>It takes a little imagination to see disease as a natural disaster like a snowstorm, but that's the best model for how it actually impacts a community. We don't know who will get sick, or when. So rather than take a risk that you'll be the one who gets the expensive disease, we pool our resources to pay a share of what the treatment would cost each year. And either way we're lucky. If we don't get sick but paid a small tax, we're happy. Not so happy if we're the one who gets sick, but at least we get the treatment we need, don't die, and also are not be bankrupted by our misfortune.</p><p>I'm not going to go into all the detail here, but every way you look at it, disease follows the pattern of a natural catastrophe. So the only reasonable way to fund treatment is to pay taxes, and that's it. In the U.S. we've privatized the insurance, but maybe it's time to fully bite the bullet and just make it a tax. That's the debate we're having, over many decades, under all the noise.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: When I teased this piece on Twitter I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/839526004930535425\">suggested</a> an alternate title. &nbsp;:-)</p>",

Totally off the scale in terms of probability. I had health insurance, a COBRA plan that was set to expire. Luckily it was still in force when I needed the surgery.</p><p>Of course, when it lapsed, I had a pre-existing condition. I didn't even try to get insurance as an individual. Instead I got a job, thinking it provided health insurance, but it didn't. It was at a university. I had a health <i>plan. </i>Big difference. It meant I could use the university's health care system. I got my meds at a huge discount. But if I needed surgery, always a real possibility, I'd be out of pocket.</p><p>Luckily this was in Massachusetts, where they had ObamaCare before the rest of us. I still couldn't buy health insurance as an individual. So I started a company, with one employee, and we voted in a health plan. I was covered. Whew.&nbsp;</p><p>In two years, after the university appointment lapsed, I was back on the road. I lived in Seattle, Florida, Calif and now New York. The insurance company had figured out that my mailing address was no longer in Massachusetts, and were making noises like maybe they didn't think I was covered. They kept paying for doctor's visits and meds, and I kept paying the huge premium, my fingers crossed that if I needed surgery, I would be covered. </p><p>When ObamaCare came about, I switched immediately. I now was in a network, so I was limited in the doctors I could use. At times this was inconvenient. But I knew that in an emergency my health care would be covered. That's what really mattered. Confidence. I've since used it for a complete test of my heart two years ago. It was not cheap. But needed. I paid nothing, it was covered.</p><p>I still pay a lot. My premiums are not subsidized. But they are <i>half</i> what my old Massachusetts premiums were. And have not gone up at all since I started with ObamaCare.</p><p>For me, an independent developer, ObamaCare was the answer. Without it I would not have insurance. I'm absolutely sure of it. </p><p>One more thing, I am really offended by what the Repubs say about users of ObamaCare. I know how important health care is. Ryan and Chaffetz clearly have no clue. But they will find out, because we all get older, and life teaches you a lot, and one thing it teaches is how important health care is.</p><p>Clearly they have not even talked with real people who use health care. Don't they have parents? Aunts and uncles? Have any of their children gotten sick? Of course they all have great health insurance, but maybe their cousins don't. Paul Ryan's neighbors in Janesville? Or Chaffetz's congregation in Utah? Do they talk with their preacher or rabbi about this? Do they understand the purpose of health insurance? I guess not, judging by the so-called health plan they are proposing.&nbsp;</p><p>They have no business making my health care decisions for me. And the way they're lying to confuse people. Ugh. They deserve no mercy. What they're doing will kill people for sure. Many many people.&nbsp;</p>",

Too late, the press is reporting otherwise. Then on a walk this afternoon I listened to the excellent Daily <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/13795.html\">podcast</a>, also from the NYT, that as Tufekci predicted they would, accepted Assange's premise.</p><p>Look at how the press waits until the <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/\">CBO</a> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/10/14858028/ahca-cbo-score\">scores</a> the Republican health bill before passing judgement. Clearly we need something like the CBO to evaluate Wikileaks type claims. People who have reps to lose, have deep technical backgrounds and know how to ask the questions, if they don't have expertise on a specific subject. So reporters aren't out there on their own, trusting someone so wholly untrustworthy as Assange. Something like <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2017/03/10/sean-spicer-upside-down-flag-pin/\">Snopes</a> or ProPublica, to take the time to evaluate the claim, and while they're deliberating the press will know to withhold judgement.&nbsp;</p>",

I have some ideas how to do that, and why the way they've been going about it is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>I migrated to Silicon Valley in 1979, from Wisconsin, where I was previously a graduate student in <a href=\"https://www.cs.wisc.edu/\">Computer Science</a>. I had an idea for a product, and a working prototype, and couldn't find people to partner with in Madison at the time. There were no computer stores, just a few consultants, and very few people with personal computers. I had one of course. I couldn't wait until they were commercialized. Too good an idea.&nbsp;</p><p>I also got <a href=\"l\">BYTE Magazine</a>, and all the ads were for places in California, places like Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Cupertino, Los Gatos. I looked at a map and saw they were all in about the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California\">place</a>. So I figured that was where I should go. So I loaded up my hippie van and drove there, and found lots of people who, like myself, were excited about the future of personal computers.&nbsp;</p><p>If I were a country musician I'd go to Nashville. But I made software so I headed to Palo Alto. That's how I explained it to my friends at the time.</p><p>I was drawn to the original Silicon Valley, very early for PCs, so I have some idea what the appeal is and how I decided to go there. The most important thing was seeing that other people like me were already there. That was what drew me there.</p><p>Today there is no BYTE Magazine, but there are other ways developers find out where they should go. If I were going to do it today, I'd try to build an association between my locale and a popular open source project, or a new project started by someone who has credibility as the leader of a project. It's the technology and personal leadership that matters. Company names matter too, but only if you're hosting the company headquarters.</p><p>Usually localities go for large capital investments, tax breaks for big corporations, or infrastructure like high-speed networks. Your small state or city might find the money to do that, but that's not your advantage, there almost always are other places with more money to throw at BigCo's and infrastructure. and the money is better spent on education and open source, where it will have a more lasting effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Those two things, education and projects, will do more to fuel the development of your tech culture than the presence of an outpost for a company headquartered in the valley. They will always see it as an satellite, the important jobs will still be in Menlo Park, Cupertino or Sunnyvale.&nbsp;</p><p>Expanding on this idea -- a <i>university-sponsored</i> open source project would be even better. It can easily and inexpensively host conferences. People will come to your school to get educated on the project, and graduate having already made contributions. Mid-career project participants could return to university to teach, or to gain new skills. And the students in turn would put down roots in your community so they'd be more inclined to stay there after graduating.&nbsp;</p><p>In my own case, had Madison had enough other people to work with, I might have stayed in 1979, because it has a lot of things going for it as a tech center. At least it did at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>So what would step one be? Recruit the people who start open projects, and give them incentives to relocate. Treat them the way you'd treat talent for your local sports teams. Money is a good thing, but you should also have liberal laws, great things to do. Even if nerds never go out they like to think they could, and their families like it.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider Boulder as an example, they have the Rockies and a fine university. Good places to eat and hang out. Bike paths. Denver, a major city, is nearby. A big airport. All the basic ingredients for booting up a tech culture, and that's exactly what's happening in Boulder.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast Internet would be good too. And a liberal governor and attorney general who's ready to push back against oppressive policies from Washington.</p>",

After the election it came out that a lot of the contrarians on Facebook were bots. From then on, when someone I didn't know dropped an idea in the middle of a thread that didn't seem to fit in, I just deleted it. I've developed a nose for these things after all these years of online life. And err on the side of deleting bot-like messages, even if you think there's a chance a real human posted it. Because a human behaving like a bot isn't all that different from a bot.</p><p>I stopped using Windows when I realized I could easily switch to a Mac and leave all the malware behind. Kind of the same idea.</p><p>Facebook may be in a death spiral, like they talk about for the insurance industry. Facebook needs people to be interesting. We are the product. If we stop using it, well that might be why it feels so empty now. And the ecosystem spins down.</p><p>Another idea. How hard would it be for Facebook to simulate a person? Post the things they would post about current events. Make new friends. Even long after they're dead. It could be that Facebook is the context in which The Singularity happens.&nbsp;</p><p>That might be how they overcome the empty feeling that's there now. They can invent new people.&nbsp;</p>",

Or what if we had teach-ins, or did community construction while trying to lift the prospects for our candidates. Or cleanup after a storm. All the supporters convene at a soup kitchen on a given Sunday to feed homeless people. Or just go for a hike all around the city to spread the good energy for our candidate and get some exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you didn't get elected, something good will still come from the campaign.

Basically our country has been invaded, there's a pretender in the Oval Office, and we have to get him out before he can do more damage to the country. That's the problem.</p><p>Now the Repubs have done something, and we should be showing appreciation, not condemning them, though they probably don't mind the condemnation because it's the air cover they need with their constituents.</p><p>Here are some (imho) irrefutable facts.</p><ol><li>The <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/what-did-we-learn-today\">hearing</a> that was held yesterday couldn't have happened if the Repubs hadn't scheduled it. They are the majority party in Congress. If they don't want hearings, then there are no hearings.&nbsp;</li><li>They knew the Democrats would do what they did. It made the Democrats look good with their constituents. In normal times that alone would be a non-starter for the Repubs (and for the Dems if they were the majority party). But these are not normal times. They have acknowledged that by scheduling the hearings and providing a stage for the Dems and the directors of the FBI and NSA.</li><li>Before you give them too much credit, however, if Trump's approval rating weren't low and going lower, none of this would be happening.</li><li>They come from districts that, for the most, voted for Trump. Their constituents need to see them defending him. Even though it's a charade, because as I said in #2, they knew the Democrats would ask the questions they couldn't.&nbsp;</li><li>The only thing they could do that's better is start a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_or_special_committee\">select committee</a>, or call on the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor. With yesterday's testimony, that seems more likely than it did before. I suspect this is the goal of Nunes and the other Repubs in the House (and of course the Democrats as well).</li><li>Reading tea leaves, but it's not much of a leap, the Repubs in Congress have decided, correctly, that Trump must go. They are doing what they have to do to both make that happen and to not commit career suicide if at all possible. The Repubs are taking a risk that they will be discovered, or that Trump's approval rating could suddenly go up, which could happen, if for example if there were a 9/11 level terrorist attack on American soil. So there is some courage involved. Trump knows he's being crossed, and in order for it to work he must stay weak. Whether he will is an unknown.&nbsp;</li></ol>",

They want just the sound coming from the instruments and the amps, nothing reflective. If they want that effect, they can add it. They don't want the room to add any sound of its own.&nbsp;</p><p>So why not design a restaurant so that the walls absorb sound? It would be the place people go to have a quiet evening of conversation. Or just to not go insane trying to be heard! :balloon:</p>",

Now here are my two cents...</p><p>What would I do if I were the owner of Medium and were free to be creative with new business models?</p><p>I'd merge with or acquire an ongoing news organization, or maybe two. Both well-known for excellent editorial, with fantastic writers and the ability to draw more. Medium would inherit their business model. And it would become the editorial system for the publication and it would also be the Letters to the Editor software.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd raise more money from the VC community to hire new editors, whose sole job it is to read what's posted on the service looking for people who are either talented writers, or people with extraordinary intelligence, insight or experience, who are writing about what they love, know and see. When such a writer is spotted their stories are promoted to the readers alongside the stories written by the pros. They are compensated either with stock or money (they would be encouraged to take stock).&nbsp;</p><p>In other words Medium becomes the farm system that drives, over time, a rapid expansion of news coverage, with much more first-person writing of news. News by the newsmakers. Sources go direct.&nbsp;</p><p>Now instead of facing the same hurdles that existing pubs face, without any of the advantages (Medium has no editorial voice, as far as I can tell none of the execs or devs are <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html\">NBBs</a>) they can tap into the natural way news is growing in the post-print news world. If you think about it, this is why Facebook and Twitter became the phenomenons that they are, without the advantages that Medium has (a real CMS with the ability to link and style).&nbsp;</p><p>Evan Williams <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/our-approach-to-member-only-content-cfce188261d1#.vyxrbgs2y\">says</a> they have new reading technology coming. That's great but I'd insist that these tools work with open formats, so they can benefit the web at large. It would help spread the idea that Medium is not just standing behind writers, it's also an enthusiastic proponent of the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/27/0724.html\">open web</a>. Right now it's a silo, everyone can see that, and it has to be limiting growth.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: I didn't realize that the new Medium has a paywall. So you can't read the story that Williams wrote. I was able to read it earlier. Not sure why I can't read it now.&nbsp;</p>",

That is so totally wrong. For more than one reason.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You still have to pay for it even if you don't have insurance. The hospital will bill you. And if you have a job, or assets, they will get paid. And it's a lot of money. So guess what, sick people don't go to the emergency room if they don't have insurance if it's at all avoidable.&nbsp;</li><li>Going to the emergency room is not health care, it's treatment. Health care is where the doctor does tests, and if there's a problem does more tests, and sends you to see a specialist. An emergency room handles emergencies.&nbsp;</li><li>There's also preventative care. Getting a colonoscopy (ugh) every so often. Or learning how to do self-examination. Or working with a doctor on losing weight, or stopping smoking, or getting off drugs, or getting birth control.&nbsp;</li><li>We should aspire to being a nation of healthy people. It's in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness\">Declaration of Independence</a>. We're here for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it doesn't say anything about \"not dying in the streets.\"</li></ol>Bottom line, going to the emergency room isn't even treatment, and treatment isn't health care. That's the amazing thing about the ACA, it used the experience of the medical system to make the economics of health care work better. If the Dems hadn't tried to get some Repub votes it would have matched reality even more closely. It's a lot like climate change. The Repubs confuse weather for climate. And confuse treatment for health care.&nbsp;",

This is from a <a href=\"http://www.frumforum.com/waterloo/\">blog post</a> he wrote in 2010.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>When Rush Limbaugh said that he wanted President Obama to fail, he was intelligently explaining his own interests. What he omitted to say—but what is equally true—is that he also wants Republicans to fail. If Republicans succeed—if they govern successfully in office and negotiate attractive compromises out of office—Rush’s listeners get less angry. And if they are less angry, they listen to the radio less, and hear fewer ads for Sleepnumber beds.</blockquote><p>That's not just true of Limbaugh, but of all the press. It's the distortion of getting our news from <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464\">businesses</a> who rep their own interests first. Their interests are not ours. For all the evidence you need, consider who sleeps in the White House.&nbsp;</p><p>The chickens have come home to roost. Loops have closed. Sowing happened ten years ago, reaping <a href=\"http://www.memeorandum.com/170324/p128#a170324p128\">now</a>. It's time to step back from the failed theory that Repubs would know what to do if they won it all.</p><p>Yesterday I wrote this in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/845463645668696064\">tweet</a>:</p><blockquote>Repubs, our form of govt requires compromise. Lots of Dems don't get this too. Make a diff, dismiss Gorsuch, nominate Garland. Govern.</blockquote><p>This is consistent in Frum's theme, as expressed in a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-republican-waterloo/520833/\">post</a> he wrote yesterday. Anyone trying to govern from the extremes of either party is doing it wrong. It can't work, and it's not good for the country, or for them. Our journalism will never tell that story, so we must find ways to tell it to each other. It's the only way we can win.</p><p>I listened to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, and I am sure they would welcome a chance to work with the Republicans in Congress, in the role of the minority party, to make our government work in a more routine and functional way. That means we have to have a real Supreme Court, not one that does what the billionaire class wants, but what the country needs. And real elections without Russian interference or voter suppression. It starts with a real Congress that works in a bipartisan way to do the work of the people. And the people have to get and remain involved, to make sure we are not being herded by journalism with its own ax to grind.&nbsp;</p><p>Mitch McConnell quietly <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/mcconnell-pledges-obamacare-rollback-cautions-overreach\">said</a> something very true after the surprising election results. But as is often the case with wisdom it applies even more to the person with the idea. McConnell overreached in not playing an advise-and-consent role with the Garland nomination. That was a step too far, one of many in the last eight years. But this was an attempt to cement a victory in the Supreme Court. So instead of taking a decade to undo the damage of the Tea Party, we'd have to wait generations.&nbsp;</p><p>Pelosi, Schumer, Ryan, McConnell should get together in an offsite, quietly and privately retreat and talk, as adults, how to get our country back on course. You four people have the power to do it. You should. And you should now be ready to do it.</p>",

So I couldn't solve the problem that way.</p><p>Instead, I added a hook in the code that displays a tweet in a river, which is deeply buried in the code, it's part of the nodeStorage API. Of course I didn't want to put the hack at that level, there are too many other places that could break. So I added a callback.

It was a combination blogging tool and RSS reader. It was basically an open precursor to Twitter. No 140-char limit. And anyone could produce an RSS feed, and anyone could consume them.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this openness, a market grew up around it. And being open had its disadvantages. Change came slowly, if at all. At some point we couldn't add features, because the community was so unwieldy and from our point of view, uncooperative, even hostile.&nbsp;</p><p>So along came Twitter, and it ruled. It deserved to because it could evolve, it was faster than RSS, people would see your updates instantaneously, and subscription was a single click. That was probably the biggest accelerator for Twitter.</p><p>Anyway, here we are 15 years later, and Twitter is mature. Facebook and Snapchat are out there too. But guess what, the engine underneath it all is still there. The heart is still beating. The feeds are still feeding.&nbsp;</p><p>All along I've been using RSS to <a href=\"http://politics.newsriver.org/\">get</a> <a href=\"http://nytimesriver.com/\">my</a> <a href=\"http://nbariver.com/\">news</a>. And I think I have it a lot better than pretty much anyone else. I control what I see. The only algorithm is transparent, last-in-first-out, and I'm running the code, not Facebook. I get a <i>much</i> richer news flow on my own system than I do on Facebook. It's not even close.&nbsp;</p><p>I made the software, <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a>, free. But it's really designed for programmers. It runs on the Unix command line. It's fine for what it does, but I wouldn't recommend it to a non-technical friend.</p><p>I wanted to make something that was as easy as Radio UserLand was 15 years ago. And just as much yours. Not controlled by a big company and its advertisers, and possibly political allies (we don't really know who Zuck is influenced by, after all).&nbsp;</p><p>Distilled, in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/844691778724859904\">tweet</a>, this is what it's about to me. \"One of the most patriotic things you can do is to upgrade the quality and breadth of the news you read. Invest in your personal news flow.\"</p><p>Even just a few months ago, that statement would have seemed arrogant, even unhinged. But today we know that control of information flow is essential to basically everything. It will be even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VhVk61jAEA\">more so</a> in the future.</p><p>That's the anthem of my new product, <a href=\"http://rss2.io/electric/\">Electric River</a>.&nbsp;It's now available for the Mac, hopefully soon on other desktop platforms. It boots up reading the feeds I set it up to read. But you can and should make it your own. I want to work on making feed discovery better next, but for right now, you can build your own news network and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to make it work. And in doing so you will help make building the next layer, and the one after that, possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's have fun! :balloon:</p>",

            "text": "<p>Once upon a time, I was 30 or so years younger, and had just sold my angel-backed tech company to a VC-backed company, stayed six months, and then left to start something new. I was young, successful, a minor tech god in Silicon Valley, the whole world at my fingertips. And I wanted a job at Apple.&nbsp;</p><p>My success had come from being one of the first to ship a product for the Mac in 1984, and then having the ability and courage to stick with it through a couple of bad years. This had endeared me to people at Apple. I knew a lot of the top execs there. They all used my software. It seemed natural to me that I'd continue my career at Apple, instead of as an outside developer.</p><p>I knew the reality that the world didn't, that being independent was a precarious existence. It was either feast or famine, but mostly famine. I wanted the security of a regular paycheck, health plan, an office, a boss even. And I wanted the benefit of shipping my software to all those people who used Macs. Instead of reaching a small fraction of the users, my software would reach them all, I reasoned. I envied the people who worked at Apple. (I would find out much later that they envied me too.)</p><p>One of my Apple friends, a top exec named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e\">Jean-Louis Gassée</a>, said I should not work at Apple. A witty Frenchman, he explained I would not like to see how the sausage was made. He said it in a funnier way. It would be better for everyone he said if I continued to be independent. But I persisted. And nothing good came from that persistence. As convinced as I was that I should be \"inside,\" the big company culture at Apple, contrary to the hype, prevented individuals from being powerful. Even if people were brilliant and driven, there was only so much a person could do.</p><p>A few years later, after developing a product that should have been system software, and being copied by Apple, my small team of three people met with the team at Apple that was doing what we did. We sat in a corner of a supersized conference room. The Apple people filled the room. There must have been 30 people there who did <i>less</i> than what we did. No matter, we eventually had to give up. There was no way to co-exist. They didn't want us there, even though they said they did. And when the platform vendor doesn't want you there, you won't be.&nbsp;</p><p>I tell this story now, as I'm getting ready to go to a journalism conference in Italy, six timezones away. I see journalism making the same mistake I made in the early 90s. They look at the advantages what they call the \"platforms\" have over trying to make a go of it independently. They want those advantages. But also like me in the 80s, they want to keep their independence. They want to be mavericks, Woodwards and Bernsteins, and, at the same time, be paid by the people and companies they will have to challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>I know tech culture now in a way I didn't then. Gassée probably thought I'd have to learn the lesson myself back in 1988, but he shared the learning anyway. There was no way to bring independence into a large company. It just doesn't work that way. If you want to be independent, you have to make your own way. Independence means the same thing no matter what direction you approach it from.&nbsp;</p><p>I know I can't convince journalism to give up on getting the tech industry to make it easy for them, so I'm pitching a different idea. Have a <a href=\"http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2017/plan-b-making-a-home-for-news-on-the-open-web\">backup plan</a>, in case it doesn't work out with Facebook. The open web is here for you to use as an alternate distribution system. It's nice to have Disneyland <i>and</i> Yellowstone. Time-Warner Center <i>and</i> Central Park. Corporate-owned spaces&nbsp;<i>and</i> open spaces. They need each other. And journalism, done right, belongs more to the open spaces than the corporate spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook <i>and</i> the open web.&nbsp;</p><p>The web can't give journalism the money Facebook can, if that's what Facebook did. But we can find a way to make journalism work in the open context, one that supports independence, and imho is much closer to the way journalism, when it's done right, works.&nbsp;</p><p>Dave</p><p>PS: In hindsight, I couldn't have developed blogging, RSS and podcasting inside Apple. Unthinkable. Apple came at the web from the opposite direction, viewing the world as elite creators providing vision and products to a mass of consumers. My philosophy, more in line with the original Apple view, and the original vision of the web, was to view everyone as both a creator and a consumer. I think this is the struggle inside journalism as well, long-term. And the reason Facebook has all the money, imho, is that they embraced the non-elite view, that the technology enables.&nbsp;</p><p>PPS: In 1995, one of my first blog posts attempted to define the word <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/08/22/whatisaplatform.html\">platform</a>. Mostly people had been using the word intuitively. Powerful idea. Worth understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>PPPS: A couple of years after that I came to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/07/14/xmlRpcForNewbies.html\">see</a> the Internet as the platform without a platform vendor. It's the only place the platform vendor can't screw with developers, because there is no platform vendor. I went ahead and did all the things I wanted to do at Apple, for the web. In the end it worked out.&nbsp;</p><p>PPPPS: But there's still more work to do.</p>",

I listen to what they think needs to be fixed and am reminded why it's better to improve the existing format through a namespace rather than starting over. Here's a story to illustrate.&nbsp;</p><p>Every trip I forget to bring something and this trip is no exception. I didn't bring a power adapter that converts the format accepted by Italian wall sockets and converts it to the format accepted by an American wall socket. Of course all my devices, my iPhone, Android phone, Mac laptop, even my watch, are designed to work in America.&nbsp;</p><p>So last night I was running off energy stored in my batteries in America.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Some tech guy in Italy or America decided their way was \"better.\" And they never imagined that I would be trying to plug my American iPhone into an Italian wall socket. Or they didn't care.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time I was able to email back to the US, in an instant, because wifi is a standard that's supported everywhere. And I was able to post to my linkblog because RSS is well-supported everywhere. And I was able to read the item I posted to my linkblog because my iPad has an HTML browser that communicates over HTTP even though the designers at Apple didn't particularly like the web. They supported it anyway. And now ten years after the introduction of iOS I am able to use the web from Italy, or anywhere that has a wifi connection.</p><p>So when I hear &nbsp;some programmer doesn't like XML, my answer will always be to offer to help them find a library that hides that detail from their software, and in doing so, help some traveler in some unknown space 100 years in the future. I think that's the duty of every engineer, everywhere, always.</p>",

I'll share more info when I have URLs to share. </p><p>At one session, I wondered if Twitter had ever considered buying a major news org. I know the party line on that was no, but I think with Twitter sort of stuck in the mud, if that might not be an interesting way to get unstuck. Consider that the valuation of Twitter is over three times that of the NYT, Twitter is still a much more efficient attractor of value than the news industry, even with it being in the <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=doldrums\">doldrums</a>, as it is (disclaimer I am a Twitter shareholder).</p><p>I met a lot of interesting people, and spent major time with some people I already knew.

I thought I had come back with all these ideas to write about, but even though I feel well enough to write, unusually for me, I find I have nothing to say.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that's nice about going away from the US for a week is I feel removed from the Trump madness. I was unable to keep up my steady diet of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Maddow\">Maddow</a>. I got home on Monday night just as she was coming on. I couldn't get into it. Same thing has happened each night since.</p><p>So much of what people report seems to be showing that Trump is inconsistent and ill-informed, and irresponsible. But this is already factored in. The guy is a shameless kleptocrat. He's almost certainly maneuvering the country to make himself richer. He probably already is much richer than he was when he took office. Before long he will pass Putin as the richest person in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy\">kleptocrats</a> who ran the Bush II government, Cheney and the defense contractors, this is a very inefficient way to transfer wealth. Too much waste. Someone should try to make a deal with Trump and the Repubs. Resign, you get to keep all you stole plus a premium. Surrender your Twitter account and finish your days playing golf all around the world with other rich folk. They can even teach you how things work, how exciting for you, now that you <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2017/4/12/15279654/trump-north-korea-xi-10-minutes\">seem</a> to care!&nbsp;</p><p>I guess I had something to say after all. :balloon:</p><p>PS: Another idea. Since Putin <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/13/british-spies-first-to-spot-trump-team-links-russia\">gave</a> us Trump maybe he should <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery_Barn_rule\">have</a> to take possession of him after he leaves? Or maybe he and his hackers can figure out how to get him to leave sooner? We can make it worth his while. I bet by now Putin has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_remorse\">buyer's remorse</a>. If POTUS blows up the world, Putin and Russia are blown up too. There's no magic shield that protects him from Trumpocalypse.</p><p>PPS: I was going to point to an article on a news website about Putin being the richest guy in the world, and while the major sites are much faster than they used to be, they are all still too offensive to point to. Time, for example, starts playing music almost as soon as the page loads, and then starts playing video. What if you're working in an office or reading in a library? Can't point to that. And US News pops up a Subscribe dialog before it lets you read anything. Now that's just insulting. So I left out the pointers. Trust me. A lot of news orgs think he's the richest guy. You can do the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS732US732&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=putin+richest+person+in+the+world\">search</a> yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>PPPS: The <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/news/2017-nba-playoffs-full-schedule-8-first-round-matchups-053026525.html\">NBA playoffs</a> start on Saturday. I'll make a guess for the first time on this blog. Boston vs Golden State, with GS winning in five.&nbsp;</p><p>PPPPS: If only the old Mission Impossible <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible#IMF_agents\">team</a> were still around, in a dark corner of the CIA or KGB. They could give Trump a drug to convince him that he won. Martin Landau and Barbara Bain would play the role of Kushner and Ivanka. It doesn't matter <i>what</i> he won, just <i>that</i> he won. Yes yes, you won, you really won, you were tremendous, you are the greatest, now goodbye!&nbsp;</p><p>PPPPPS: One more thing then I really have to go. This was my first trip to Europe, ever, where I had good connectivity all the time, thanks to <a href=\"https://fi.google.com/about/\">Google Fi</a>.

We talked about the usual thing tech people and journalists talk about when we get together. What's the future of journalism on the Internet? I have some strong ideas about that, all based on the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/10/12/itsStillSourcesGoDirect.html\">Sources Go Direct</a> philosophy, but I was surprised to find that Chris and Mary were totally on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the idea.</p><p>Chris and Mary do a weekly <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/11/20/radio-talk-host-christopher-lydon-returns-wbur-after-year-absence/jLC042johF7aRALtnvWlNK/story.html\">NPR show</a> that's also a <a href=\"http://radioopensource.org/category/podcast/\">podcast</a>. (Chris is the host, Mary the producer.) Since the election they've been talking with scholars and political insiders about the state of government in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn't listening to it, sad to say, until a friend told me I should, that it's the best thing out there on politics in the US. I started listening, and enthusiastically concur. It's the adult stuff, reality-based, not the mush you get on the cable networks, or the investigative details you get from the Washington Post and the NY Times (these are valuable but they don't provide a big picture that Chris's collaborators do).&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, so if you were trying to figure out where the value is in Chris's program, you'd have to put the Chris/Mary combo at the top of the pyramid. It's their rolodex that makes it work. It's the extensive reading and listening they've done, over twenty &nbsp;years, that means they know who to call and can ask the right questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Next level down the pyramid are the people in their rolodex. They know their shit because they've spent a lifetime studying the history of kleptocracies, the Soviet Union, Russia, fascist movements around the world and in the US. Or they've been inside politics for a long time and have memory of Nixon and perhaps even McCarthy. Watergate and Iran-Contra. The buildup to the war in Iraq. People who knew the people with the levers of power.&nbsp;</p><p>One more level down the pyramid, where the greatest value is, by sheer volume, are the people who are smart enough to be listening to Chris's show. Probably a very large number of them are in Boston, because his show is broadcast on <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/programs\">WBUR</a>. But because it's 2017 and his show is distributed as a podcast, his <i>braintrust, </i>as I call it, is distributed around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>To summarize, Chris/Mary orchestrate, the people in the rolodex opine, and the braintrust listens.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's imagine a number that represents the quality of the Chris Lydon braintrust. That number would be very high. And another number that represents the size of the braintrust. That number would be low because most of the smart people in the world don't know about it. (And of course it's their goal to change that.)</p><p>Now let's take the Washington Post and NY Times. They probably have relatively high quality numbers, and large size numbers, compared to Radio Open Source. The product of these values is large. Another publication that I think of in these terms is The Economist. Their readership is really powerful, intelligent, educated. Their quotient would be high.&nbsp;</p><p>So here's the question this thinking raises, given the new distribution medium. How can a podcast like Chris's or a pub like the NYT, WP or Economist, take advantage of the breadth and depth of their braintrust to improve the product, make it more relevant and more profitable? I have some ideas about that. We'll discuss it at the <a href=\"http://heymancenter.org/events/the-unplugged-soul-a-conference-on-the-podcast/\">Unplugged Soul</a> conference, where Chris and I are doing the keynote interview tonight. :balloon:</p><p>PS: Last night on Maddow for the first time I heard her use the term \"open source\" to refer to reporting about the Trump/Russia scandal. Fascinating. She used it many times, so it was deliberate. I wonder if I missed something in the week I was traveling and if she's explained how she's using the term. Clearly it's not the way we use it in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\">tech</a> world. I must ask Chris how they arrived at that as the name for his podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>PPS: I've noticed that the NY Times is accepting the <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=bombastic\">bombasticity</a> of the Trump personna, even encouraging it. It came out in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://podcatch.com/pages/14444.html\">interview</a> with Trump, when they pressed for details about whether or not Susan Rice had committed a crime. There's no question the reporters knew this was bogus, yet they accepted what the president said as legit. When they do that, I as a seeker of truth, and believer in the values of the US, am betrayed.&nbsp;</p>",

            "text": "<p>Some takeaways from this weekend's podcasting <a href=\"http://heymancenter.org/events/the-unplugged-soul-a-conference-on-the-podcast/\">conference</a> at Columbia.</p><ul><li>Primarily this conference was by and for producers of podcasts. I was the only developer who spoke, and not in any detail about how podcasting works, other than to say it's open and not dominated by silos and that's where the freedom comes from.&nbsp;</li><li>As far as I can tell there is not much awareness of the technology of podcasting among producers.&nbsp;</li><li>I had a podcast-listening glitch earlier today, walking around town. I thought I had Chapter VI of <a href=\"https://stownpodcast.org/\">Shit-town</a> on my iPhone, but I didn't. It took me five minutes of navigating through confusing sites, the app store, iTunes, who knows what, to get to a place where I could just click a link to listen. The state of the UX for podcasting is awful. Unacceptable for a technology that's 14 years old.</li><li>The lack of improvement imho is due to a <a href=\"http://www.sonyclassics.com/fogofwar/\">fog</a> of companies and developers who think they dominate or expect/plan to, and won't talk with others.&nbsp;</li><li>Podcasting should be a pleasure. Finding new great stuff to listen to should be easy and instant. And you should be able to get that without giving up the freedom.&nbsp;</li><li>I have to figure out how to cut through the fog and plot a course and ignore the people who refuse to talk, and just fucking go.</li><li>There are always silos trying to start up. I really doubt any of them will gain traction.&nbsp;</li><li>I'm going to keep building with Electric-River as the base. Next up I want to teach it to download podcasts to a user-accessible folder on a desktop. If you have MP3s on your disk, you can control where the shows are and don't have to have so many connectivity surprises when you're out and about.&nbsp;</li><li>Shit-town is great. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/04/15/mrPutinShowSomeMercy.mp3\">star</a> of the show on where we're at in America and what Putin can do to help us out of our misery. I'm writing this post in the style of John B, if you're wondering why I sound so pissy and uppity.</li><li>Tim Berners-Lee is on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tim-berners-lee-inventor-web-plots-radical-overhaul-creation/\">right track</a>, preaching that users should control their own data. I'm concerned that this is going to come with another prescription that we all use RDF. We get a lot of interop from OPML and RSS, both of which are variants of XML, a format developed by his W3C.&nbsp;</li><li>I wrote an <a href=\"https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/we-could-make-history-349109119cee\">open letter</a> to Evan Williams in 2012 suggesting that we make history by helping to undo the siloisity that was creeping into the blogosphere. No response.&nbsp;</li><li>It's very likely there would be no podcasting today if we had not gotten early and steady support from NPR. That's because in 2003, Tony Kahn at WGBH listened, and thought podcasting was a good idea, and spread the gospel throughout NPR land. We got lucky, we found the guy at NPR that everyone there listened to, and he believed. Tech should have more people like Tony.&nbsp;</li><li>BTW, Martin Nisenholtz at the NYT played the same role for <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a>. Without the support of the NYT, it's likely that the RSS community would have melted down into many competing incompatible standards, neither reaching critical mass.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Moral of the story: Don't ever doubt that technology users can have enormous power. And as a technologist, don't be shy about searching for these people and listening to them and trying to help them win. Be careful about the first impulse to dismiss. Great things can result from these collaborations. The myth of the lone inventor dreaming up the future ensconced in a lab isn't how it works.&nbsp;</p>",

I made it through the first fifteen minutes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Maddow\">Maddow</a> and then switched over to the NBA playoff game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Houston Rockets. At least there the <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/nba/index.ssf/2017/04/nba_playoffs_houston_rockets_v.html\">outcome</a> was somewhat in doubt. Watching Maddow I came to a conclusion. And by conclusion I mean, an end.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that the Trump campaign worked closely with the Russian government to influence the election. It isn't in doubt at this point. So many of their campaign officials met with Russians during the campaign, with people who laundered Russian oligarch money, even. The list <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/10/514514117/trumps-national-security-adviser-reportedly-discussed-sanctions-with-russia\">includes</a> the National Security Adviser and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/politics/senate-jared-kushner-russia.html\">son-in-law</a> of the president. His campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/12/paul-manafort-foreign-agent-trump-russia\">manager</a> was a Russian agent for crying out loud. And he lied about it, openly.</p><p>At this point we can rest until the Republicans in Congress decide it's time to do their jobs and get him out of the White House. He does not belong there. I don't think Pence would be much better, he's a smarmy former Limbaugh-alike <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/mike-pence-talk-radio-225855\">radio</a> \"conservative.\" Whatever he is, however bad or corrupt, we can't survive much more of Trump's mad incompetence. We're on the brink of nuclear war, we knew that would come, and now it's here. We still have the power to turn this around. But the hour is getting late.&nbsp;</p><p>What more can watching Maddow accomplish? We know what we know. More evidence will come, that's for sure. It's like taking the temperature in August in NYC. Yes, it's hot and humid. I didn't need to watch the news to know that.&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom line: We know he's in debt to Russia. They have the goods on him, the only question is how bad it is and I'd bet it's very bad. Impeachable? Of course. The guy is guilty and is driving the US and the rest of the world over a cliff.&nbsp;</p>",

The goal, I guess, was to find out what the boy thought about the news. It was a noble idea, but imho it didn't work. Kids in the midst of adults will act more or less as they think the adults want them to act. I remember what it was like being a kid myself. Perhaps a panel of kids, with the adults in the audience, might have worked better. But I suspect they wouldn't have stuck to the topic.</p><p>It occurred to me much later that this is typical of developer conferences. They might have a panel where developers are on stage and the platform vendor employees are in the audience, but only heavily supervised developers, and ones not likely to rock the boat too much. Thus depriving everyone of what could potentially be a lively and useful discussion.</p><p>What if instead they had a panel with <i>adult</i> users of news, telling the professional journalists, in the audience, what frustrated them about the way the news was covered. There's a lot of potential in that. But news people, like the people who run big platform companies, seem reluctant to take the risk of letting their users speak freely in their presence.&nbsp;</p><p>When I did my session at the Perugia conference I spoke as a technology developer who wanted to work with journalists. I saved my criticism in that session for other developers, so the journalists seem to enjoy it. I could just as easily have led a discussion about how journalism led us off a cliff in the 2016 elections, and how if we want to save what's left of democracy, it's going to a require radical transformation in how news works. I suspect if I had done that, the journalists would have walked out of the room.</p><p>I am experiencing this frustration watching some of the same people who were at Perugia, who I spoke with over meals and in the hallways about the dire state of news, tweeting about a journalism conference they're at in the US this weekend. As in Perugia, they talk about users of news the same way platform vendors talk about users of their platforms. In aggregate. Theoretical terms. And missing the point, imho.&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom-line: Have the guts, if you're going to have a professional conference, of giving &nbsp;substantial time to the users of your profession's products. It's a perspective that's often missing, a very important one. If you want quick productive change, it could be the most direct path.&nbsp;</p>",

And many others contributed. It wasn't an act of invention or a single person's accomplishment. Lots of people contributed.</p><p>Lately Chris Lydon has been getting much-deserved credit for his role in the bootstrap. For a good year he was the leading edge of podcasting. A lot of today's most popular podcasts owe Chris for his inspiring early work.</p><p>Steve Gillmor and Doug Kaye also did their part.</p><p>And don't discount Adam Curry's contribution (the MTV star). Once he got his podcast going a whole community of podcasters followed. Many of today's podcasters follow the form he pioneered too, which is vastly different from Lydon's.</p><p>Me? I was the geek and the showrunner for the first few years. I held the conferences and twisted the arms and wrote the code. If you don't think there's a lot of that in bootstrapping a new medium, well you don't know how it works.</p><h4>Part II</h4><p>One of the reasons the story of podcasting is so scrambled is that no one has done a thorough and patient reporting of it. </p><p>Reporters sell a story, and have a fixed amount of time to report it, so they interview one or two people, read the Wikipedia article about podcasting, and repeat the same mistakes the previous reporters made. I've seen this happen in other areas, mistakes in Wikipedia become an alternate truth, long before Kellyanne Conway and DJ Trump</p><p>Until recently the standard podcasting story left a whole year out, and Chris Lydon's contribution. It's as if there were a blank unfilled spot in time when nothing happened in podcasting, yet the opposite is true. </p><p>i've just been casually looking for stuff in various archives, including the BloggerCon websites, and came across a gorgeous <a href=\"http://bloggercon.scripting.com/2004/09/27.html\">description</a> of podcasting by Adam Curry written in Sept 2004, in advance of BloggerCon III in November. I asked all discussion leaders to do this. He told the story in a very clear way from his point of view, as a Dutch guy (you can totally hear that), a radio pirate, and somewhat bitter visionary (as all visionaries become, given enough time).</p><p>BTW, it's signed Ron Bloom, but I'm pretty sure it's Adam who wrote it.

Note I didn't say find anyone a good podcast to listen to now, I said find <i>me</i> one. It should be a podcast that I, an individual person, will find good to listen to.&nbsp;</li><li>It's immediate. I don't want to subscribe to a podcast that will someday yield something good to listen to, I want it now.</li></ol><p>For the last 17 years podcasting has been answering the wrong question: <i>I want to subscribe to this.</i>&nbsp;That question doesn't come up often, if ever. And podcasting doesn't even answer it very well.</p><p>Think about it. Where are you when you decide you want to subscribe to a podcast. That's a trick question. How about nowhere. How about it never happens. I'm never looking at something on the web or elsewhere and think oh that's something I want to subscribe to.&nbsp;</p><p>There are shows that I like so much that it's almost certain that I want to listen to whatever they have available right now. Planet Money, Fresh Air, West Wing Weekly, Radio Open Source are examples. But it's never guaranteed that their latest thing is something I want to listen to now. It might be a rerun. Or maybe I find the subject distasteful or disturbing or the person they're talking with or about is of no interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Okay so if the question is <i>Find me something good to listen to now, </i>then how do you do that? What information do you need to be able to get that done?&nbsp;</p><p>It's collaborative. You need to know what I've listened to that I liked. And you need to know what my friends have listened to that they liked. So we can serve as recommenders for each other.</p><p>Facebook's social graph is good enough to get this started. I know because I tried it manually a couple of years ago. I posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/337761226431289?pnref=story\">message</a> asking my friends to recommend podcasts. I then made that into a subscription list and fed it into <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/river5\">River5</a> and the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2015/04/17/introducingPodcatchcom.html\">result</a> is <a href=\"http://podcatch.com/\">Podcatch.com</a>. It's highly personalized. It works well enough that I get an answer to FMSGTOLTN pretty much 100 percent of the time.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this for other people we just need to systematize it. Make it so that it works for anyone's friends, and it's dynamic, it's kept up to date. When my friends' interests change, then the recommendations change.&nbsp;</p><p>Also to really work, Facebook isn't the right place to accumulate the data because amazingly you can't listen to a podcast in Facebook. They're too busy reinventing human senses I guess.</p><p>&nbsp;A podcast listening client would be able to accumulate the data. But here's the catch, I don't want to be locked into any one client. So if they aren't giving the user access to their own listening data, and they aren't making it easy to share with others, then I'm not going to use it. It's possible that such clients exist, and if they do I want to know about them.&nbsp;</p><p>How important is this? Very. A similar problem was there for <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS</a> in the early days and it was never solved because the reader vendors were unwilling to accept leadership. They all assumed they were going to dominate, or their investors wouldn't let them share the data. Then along came a silo that didn't use RSS, Twitter, and it solved the problem. RSS languished with no love from the dominant vendor, who eventually left (Google Reader). Today RSS still works, amazingly, but it's not a happy ecosystem. It serves as a cautionary tale for podcasting, in how it can go very wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd say this is the big challenge for podcasting in 2017. It's why I'm worried about it getting siloized. The practical problem is that then there will be a gatekeeper, who behaves like Facebook and controls an opaque algorithm and the medium is closed off to non-Facebook developers, and we lose the freedom that has made podcasting such a wonderful thing.&nbsp;</p>",

Mostly just rote security theater. Change your Google password, enable 2-factor? These have nothing to do with a phishing attack. Our passwords were never exposed.

            "text": "<p>I've used all kinds of formats and protocols in a long career as a software developer. </p><p>I also have created a few, and have had to fight to keep them independent and unowned, with varying degrees of success. This set of rules represents what I've learned.</p><p>If we work together on a project based on open tech, these are the principles I will try to stick to. I wanted to put all this in one place, so I can pass it along to future software developers.&nbsp;</p><h4>Rule #1: Interop is all that matters</h4><p>\tThe only reason we have open formats and protocols is so our software can interoperate. </p><h4>Why interop?</h4><p>\tWe want interop so that our users are free to move.</p><p>\tSo our products compete on the basis of performance, features and price, and not lock-in. </p><p>\tThis is as basic as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath\">Hippocratic Oath</a>&nbsp;that doctors take.</p><p>\tIt honors and respects the users of our products.</p><h4>There are tradeoffs in standards</h4><p>\tThere are few absolutes in standards work, some rules even contradict others, so you have to think, and strike a balance. </p><h4>Software matters more than formats (much)</h4><p>\tToo often people try to design a format first, and then make software that conforms to the format. You might get some good demos. But not much chance of developing a standard that way.</p><h4>Users matter even more than software</h4><p>\tPeople choose to interop because it helps them find new users. If you have no users to offer, there won't be much interest in interop.</p><h4>One way is better than two</h4><p>\tNo matter how much better the new way is, you'll still have to support the old way. </p><h4>Fewer formats is better</h4><p>\tIf you can replace two formats with one, without breakage or loss of interop, then I say go for it.</p><p>\tRemoving complexity from the world is always good. </p><p>\tThink of this like code factoring, but on a larger scale.</p><p>\tThis is 1/2 of Postel's robustness <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle\">principle</a> -- be conservative in what you send.</p><h4>Fewer format features is better</h4><p>\tIf you want to add a feature to a format, first carefully study the existing format and namespaces to be sure what you're doing hasn't already been done. If it has, use the original version. This is how you maximize interop. </p><h4>Perfection is a waste of time</h4><p>\tI've witnessed long debates over which name is better than another. </p><p>\tI once led a standards discussion beginning with this rule: We always had to come up with the <i>worst possible </i>name for every element. That way when someone said \"I think foo is better\" (and they did) we could all laugh and say that's exactly why we won't use it. </p><p>\tIt totally doesn't matter what we call it. We can learn to use anything. There are more important things to spend time on. </p><p>Think of people whose first language isn't English. To them the names we choose are symbols, they don't connote anything. </p><h4>Write specs in plain English</h4><p>\tI write for people who have brains, like to think, are educated, care about interop. I understand that people reading specs are not computers. </p><h4>Explain the curiosities</h4><p>\tI also try to explain why things are as they are because people seem to be interested. But only after explaining how it works and providing an example. </p><h4>If practice deviates from the spec, change the spec</h4><p>\tIn writing the spec for RSS 0.91, I found that a lot of the limits imposed by the earlier spec were being ignored by developers. So I left the limits out of 0.91 spec. No one complained. </p><p>\tAfter RSS 2.0, the format was frozen, so no more adjustments based on practice.</p><h4>No breakage</h4><p>\tVersion 2 of your format should be backward compatible. This means that a version 1 file is a valid version 2 file. </p><p>\tDon't break the installed base. (Not that you can. There are still lots of people running XP even though Microsoft said it was over. And that's a commercial product, not a standard.)</p><h4>Freeze the spec</h4><p>\tAt some point, when the new ideas have slowed to a trickle, and as a base of compatible software develops, freeze the spec, but provide an extension mechanism so new ideas have an outlet. </p><p>\tDevelopers need a foundation to build on, one that is fixed and isn't moving.</p><h4>Keep it simple</h4><p>\tBeware of open formats that are impossible to fully support.</p><p>\tXML-RPC could be fully supported in a few days. You could never fully support SOAP. I believe this is no accident. Large companies crafted SOAP so they could say they were open without interoperating with competitors. The goal of XML-RPC was to make it easy to interop. </p><h4>Developers are busy</h4><p>\tNow you've got a popular product and your data formats are open and documented, you are encouraging your competitors to be compatible. </p><p>\tNext thing to do is to create a toolkit in at least one popular language that shows how to support the format. Real working code can help fill in the blanks for the spec. Some developers will use the sample code without ever looking at the spec. I know I do. </p><h4>Mail lists don't rule</h4><p>\tThere's a weird bit of psychology that seems to happen on mail lists set up to discuss interop. The people there feel like they can make decisions that the world will then obey. You can hear it how people talk. They seem to believe they have arrived at the top of the pyramid and now they are masters of the universe. Actually, they're just people on a mail list. No one, not even the other people on the list, care what you think.</p><p>\tSame is true for real world conferences. </p><h4>Praise developers who make it easy to interop</h4><p>\tI'm thinking of Slack. They didn't have to make it so easy, but they did anyway. It's the web way, it's the strong way. They're saying they want their users to be free to leave at any time. That they should stay with Slack because their product is the best, not because they have to stay.</p><h4>Thanks for listening!</h4><p>\tIf you have comments or questions, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/manifesto/rulesForStandardsMakers.md\">GitHub group</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Just post an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues\">issue</a> related to this document.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/manifesto/rulesforstandardsmakers.html\">slide-show</a> version of this, suitable for presentations.</p><p>\tAnd thanks for making it this far. </p><p>\tDave</p>",

Posts with titles or no titles. Any HTML I wanted. Then came Twitter and Google Reader and they squeezed my blog to almost nothing. Facebook then took out what was left. Try to write for all of them, that's the empty set. So fuck it, let's go back to the beginning before all that michegas, and have a notepad where my ideas flow and maybe some of them make it into the silos, or not.&nbsp;</p><p>That's the concept.</p><p>And the implementation is coming along.&nbsp;</p><p>The project is called <i>Old School.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Here's a link to the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/reboot/test/v3/dave/\">prototype page</a>.

This one is based on the way the site worked at the very beginning. Very free form, written in an outliner, I get to use all the features of HTML, the posts can be long or short, have titles or not, include as many links as I want.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been blogging <a href=\"http://scripting.com/reboot/test/v3/dave/\">over there</a> for the last few days and it feels good. It also feels good to write longer pieces <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/16/experimentingWithAPersonalTwitter.html\">here</a>, using <a href=\"http://1999.io/\">1999.io</a>. So I will use both ways to blog, and they will be integrated. If the design is right, you won't know where a story came from.&nbsp;</p><h4>Combining flows on Slack</h4><p>Along the way an item made it onto my todo list to try flowing all the links to a Slack group. So yesterday I cobbled something together quickly that flows all the links from four of my feeds into one flow on Slack. The four feeds are:</p><ol><li>The main Scripting News <a href=\"http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">feed</a>.</li><li>My Radio3-based linkblog <a href=\"http://radio3.io/users/davewiner/rss.xml\">feed</a>.</li><li>The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/reboot/test/v3/dave/rss.xml\">feed</a> from my new Old School blog.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=22221172@N00&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200\">feed</a> from my Flickr account.</li></ol><p>I thought this might be an interesting prototype for a <i>Personal Twitter, </i>one where an individual, someone who's very active at collecting links (me) and writing quick posts (again, me) and taking pictures (you get the idea), posts things as they come to his or her attention. I set it up and invited a few friends. I really like it.&nbsp;</p><h4>You can request an invite</h4><p>So I want to invite other people to join the group. It's not for commenting, it's just for reading, but there's no way to configure Slack for that, so it has to be on the honor system. I set up a channel called Chatroom for people to talk about stuff, if they want to. The <a href=\"http://guidelines.scripting.com/\">comment guidelines</a> for Scripting News will apply there.&nbsp;</p><p>If you've made it this far, great!&nbsp;</p><p>And if you'd like to request an invite, post your email address to <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/2tgdcKqS61FzAjqU2\">this form</a>, with a comment about how long you've been reading Scripting News, and an idea of how much you're interested in this Personal Twitter idea.</p>",

So I'm going to run a couple of them <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/21/reEvanWilliamsAndJsonFeed.html\">here</a> in the this post.&nbsp;</p><h4>Re the NYT profile of Evan Williams</h4><p>Re today's <a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/evan-williams-medium-twitter-internet.html\">profile</a> of Evan Williams and Medium in the NYT.</p><p>A few off-the-top-of-my head thoughts...</p><p>The best art ignores money. It's driven by the desire of a human to express what's inside. \"I am human and I have something to say.\" </p><p>I wish Medium had strived to make crazy-great editing software, and had created a server that they operated for free, and free of advertising, and open source with a liberal license that let others build new kinds of collaborative systems with great editing at its core. </p><p>How do you make money from this? We don't have an opinion about that.</p><p>Think of it as a way for a man who made billions from the open web to give back. It was never about any individual's greatness or worth, it was and is about our need as a species to apply our collective minds to our evolution. We still have fundamental changes to make for our species to survive. </p><p>I'd add that the whole idea of a Great Thinker solving our problems is itself part of the problem. It worked for us until we conquered and controlled nature. Now we have to find a new purpose for ourselves, a new mission.&nbsp;</p><h4>Re JSON feed</h4><p>People have asked what I think of JSON feed... </p><p>My longtime friend and collaborator, <a href=\"http://inessential.com/2017/05/17/json_feed\">Brent Simmons</a>, is one of the two guys who designed the format. In fact I am in Seattle right now visiting Brent, talking about another project, though of course we have discussed <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/version/1\">JSON feed</a>. I knew it was coming. Brent and I emailed about it about a month ago.</p><p>My opinion is pretty neutral. Kind of a shoulder shrug. It reminds me of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bOy3RNyWME\">slogan</a> from Battlestar Galactica. \"All of this has happened before and will happen again.\"</p><p>The hype around this effort reminds me of the hype at the start of Atom. Thankfully the personal stuff does not seem to be coming along with it this time.</p><p>Is this something we should be focusing on?</p><p>I think we have to work on climate change and the fascism that's trying to boot up in the US. Our systems for news suck, and there are obvious ways to improve them if we put our minds to it. And I think a new incompatible feed format not only doesn't move us toward solving those problems, in a very small way (not worth worrying about) it moves us <i>away</i> from solving them. By using bandwidth that could be used to foster working-together, perhaps. By making things that would otherwise interop, not interop. </p><p>If developers have a hard time using XML in their apps, if that's the problem, why not attack it right there? Work to make it easier. I work in Node and the browser, and in both places XML and JSON are equally easy to use. The same could be done for any environment. In fact in the browser, XML is integrated deeply into the programming model, because the web is made out of XML. </p><p>As a developer of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/04/19/electricRiverV041b.html\">feed reading</a> software, if any new format gains traction, my software will support the format. I don't believe in locking users in or out. So a new incompatible format makes my life slightly more difficult. But once the work is done, it moves out of the way, hopefully never to be thought of again.</p><p>As a writer, and developer of feed-creating software I am going to stick with good old <a href=\"http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html\">RSS 2.0</a> with the <a href=\"http://source.smallpict.com/2014/07/12/theSourceNamespace.html\">source namespace</a>. It has served me well, and doesn't want for any features. If it did, I would just add them to the namespace. </p><p>One more thought, a few years ago we played around with the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140218231452/http://rssjs.org:80/\">idea</a> of JSONified RSS, a simple translation of the XML elements and attributes to JSON. Two observations. 1.  It didn't invent new names for things that already exist. 2. It didn't catch on.</p><p>See my <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html\">Manifesto</a> for standards-makers for other general thoughts.&nbsp;</p>",

I was aware at the time that there was a choice. I went with the one-to-one correspondence. There were two reasons, a design question and to keep it simpler for developers and podcast listeners.</p><ol><li>Suppose you allowed an arbitrary number of enclosures. Wouldn't you want to be able to describe each? If so, an enclosure would morph from being a simple three-attribute element, to a structure. What would be the new sub-elements? One obvious one would be &lt;description&gt;. How about a title? A date? Category? Author? I'm sure you see where this is going. We just created a new &lt;item&gt; inside an enclosure. And could an enclosure have an enclosure? Why not? Isn't that more powerful? (The reason usually given for having more enclosures.)</li><li>The second reason is that you made life more complicated for the aggregator developer. When they look for an enclosure they somehow have to decide which of the multiple enclosures the user wants, or offer a choice to the user. Does the user really care what format the podcast is in? When I'm listening what I want is to hear the podcast. You want me to choose? My life is already too complicated. Too much software interrupts the flow of my thought with questions I have no interest in.&nbsp;</li></ol>",
