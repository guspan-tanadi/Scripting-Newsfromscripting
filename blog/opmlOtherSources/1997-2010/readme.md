# A huge chunk of the archive

I wrote about this find on <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/22.html#a160334">Scripting News</a> on 12/22/2021. 

12+ years of OPML source for the blog. 

### Conversion script

I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/1997-2010/converter.opml">Frontier script</a> to convert the archive to the form I've been using since 2017, with one OPML file for each month. 

Here's the same script <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/2531341ed9e2426b1d11848b76905f7c">as a gist</a> so you can see how it works even if you don't have an outliner handy. ;-)

### Big file of includes

I also uploaded an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opmlOtherSources/1997-2010/includes.opml">outline</a> that includes all the OPML files from this part of the archive as include nodes, so you can browse them in an outliner.
