# A huge chunk of the archive

I wrote about this find on <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/22.html#a160334">Scripting News</a> on 12/22/2021. 

12+ years of OPML source for the blog. 

### Conversion script

I wrote a Frontier script to convert the archive to the form I've been using since 2017, with one OPML file for each month.
