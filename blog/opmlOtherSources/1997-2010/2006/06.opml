					<outline text="First, we could all benefit from a common identity system for the Internet. Think about all the times and places you enter your social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, credit card number, the secret number on the back of the credit card. If you had all that information about someone else, and their bank account numbers, you could probably have all their money. And every day we hear stories of companies we trust with this information, losing it. Note the big word in there is trust. Trust a company? Hah. Now which companies do you trust? Are companies trust-worthy?" created="Thu, 29 Jun 2006 15:15:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Yesterday I got my credit card bill. There was a charge of $1017 for a hotel stay that was supposed to be picked up by a company. I actually only stayed one night, the rate was $400 a night, so not only were they were mistaken in charging me instead of the company, they overcharged us. How much you want to bet that I end up paying the $1017? In this case there were &lt;i&gt;two companies&lt;/i&gt; not worthy of trust. (When told of the problem the first company should have let me know immediately that they would cover the expense, but they didn't. Ooops, there goes the trust.)" created="Thu, 29 Jun 2006 15:17:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Microsoft asked for our trust with Hailstorm. But they were behaving very badly. They claimed their bad behavior was legal (it wasn't, it turns out) but that wasn't even the point. If we sense that a company is bad, the first thing they lose is our trust. It turns out the concern was totally justified, many times over. As they were screwing Netscape, they were screwing us, their users, even harder, sitting on the browser, not making any improvements, as malware of all types rendered our computers more and more useless. Now Microsoft is paying for their sins. (They never even apologized for all our wasted time.)" created="Thu, 29 Jun 2006 15:19:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now we turn to Google. I remember when my idea of Google soured, it was an instant flip, one day I thought these are good people who love the web, when they grow it's good for me. Really, we used to think of Google that way. But then they started acting like Microsoft, stupidly doing things that undermine the rare priviledge they had won. It was hard to argue that losing the trust hurt them or their shareholders, until today, when their intention to be the identity czar of the Internet became apparent. It won't work for the same reason it didn't work for Microsoft, they screwed with our trust too many times." created="Thu, 29 Jun 2006 15:21:26 GMT"/>

Of course, using a photo taken by someone else at BloggerCon is totally appropriate, and symbolic, since it's entirely a collaborative thing. 2. What a fantastic picture of two people, Ponzi Indharasophang and Jory Des Jardin,  who are totally engaged, in the loop, in the room, minds turned on, and getting something done. This is what I'd like people to think of when they think of BloggerCon and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggercon.org/iv/format&quot;&gt;unconference format&lt;/a&gt;. 3.

I'm struggling to figure out what script is causing the flatlining behavior on the server. This has been the problem in Frontier for years. I've got very limited tools to figure this out, but with a little cooperation from the kernel, it could almost certainly dump the information I need, pointing me to the table that's getting too large, or the script that's looping infinitely. That we've been stuck here for so long is an indication of poor communication in the community, and a lack of incentives. The technology is very simple." created="Tue, 27 Jun 2006 15:46:51 GMT"/>

I bet you did too. Marc is a paradox to me. He makes such a big effort to support open standards, and I'm told they do support XML-RPC, and the MetaWeblog API, unlike Reinacker and Amazon. But when I offered to build a bridge between the OPML Editor and his aggregator he lectured me on how he was doing an outliner and how much better his vision of outliners was than mine. All the time I'm thinking to myself, if that were really true, if the tables were turned, I'd encourage support for those interfaces, so he could build a market for my superior product. Marc is a smart guy, but he could learn a trick or two.

It turned out it was my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatvavavoom.com/&quot;&gt;uncle&lt;/a&gt;. He was young, just 58, and had died suddeny in Jamaica. I decided not to go to Jamaica to participate in the settling of his affairs, I stayed in Cambridge to make sure BloggerCon came off.

It stirred up everything, and that's why this morning, there are unresolved feelings to feel, and it's totally appropriate to process them in the hours before the fourth BloggerCon.

I'll tell you more about it as we get closer. We're going to do some live webcasts on Wednesday and Thursday to check it out. So if you haven't been getting your fill of Morning Coffee Notes, we should make up for that, amply, this week. " created="Mon, 19 Jun 2006 13:36:32 GMT"/>

I had a funny dream myself. Sitting in a crowded movie theater, probably in NY, someone's cell phone rings, and the fcuker not only answers it, but he starts a conversation, in full voice. An usher, who for some reason was seated in the audience, gets up, grabs the phone, and walks out of the theater, with the guy following. Somehow I know who the usher is, it's Saddam Hussein! I wonder if the guy knows who he's about to get into an argument with. The crazy thing is that in this dream, Saddam is a smiling, friendly old guy, with a nicely trimmed beard, wearing a clean well-pressed usher's uniform.

					<outline text="There's actually a neater solution, especially if you've put a piece of software on the user's desktop to facilitate uploading and editing of the data -- keep a copy of all the data on the user's desktop, and just mirror it in your web app. There goes the problem (or is it an excuse) that your competitor would be using your CPU cycles to grab a copy of the user's data (with the user's permission, I should add, you need a username and password to get access, so the argument that they're protecting against scrapers and abusers doesn't hold water).

					<outline text="With a local copy, the user can point any service at the data, and it can suck up a copy, and the competitor's app would run on the user's desktop too, using their (abundant) CPU cycles.

					<outline text="Yet another reason to use rich clients. I use Flickr Uploadr, always. It's just a bit easier to work with than the browser-based method of uploading, and that bit of easiness has proven to be worth it. Then of course the competitor has to offer a desktop tool as well. We do it with the OPML Editor. The server components, the directory browser, blog renderer, work with a copy of the data, the originals reside on the user's machine. It also protects against a system failure, or a company failure. " created="Sun, 18 Jun 2006 09:05:47 GMT"/>

					<outline text="When users wisen up, and that day is inevitable, you will have lost the battle, it'll be too late then to give them their entitlement. If Zooomr isn't reciprocating that's their problem (or more accurately their users' problem) and they'll pay for it. My job, as the guy who started BloggerCon, is to help you get recognition for giving all the power of choice to your users. The only criteria for winning that should be tolerated, by anyone, are features, performance and price. Lock-in is not an honorable or sustainable way to win. " created="Sat, 17 Jun 2006 15:23:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another observation. Every time there's a competitive market like this, the vendors learn something that seems counter-intuitive. Users who are attracted to Zoooomr will not stop using Flickr. The core users will use &lt;i&gt;all the tools,&lt;/i&gt; even competitive tools that seem to be clones of each other, because some are strong in one area and others are strong in others. In the Mac graphic tools market, for example, people who used PageMaker got Quark, but they never stopped using PageMaker. And they also used Canvas and Illustrator and even MacDraw and MacPaint, because they all did things the others didn't. What made this possible was file format compatibility. So Stewart, let your users try Zooomr, make it easy for them! We won't stop using Flickr, unless you stop moving it forward, and you know because you have integrity, that if you stop moving it, you have no right to hold on to the users.

					<outline text="BloggerCon is an unusual conference. We don't have speakers, panels or an audience. We &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have discussions and sessions, and each session has a discussion leader. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="The discussion leader">
					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/06/15/accordianGuy.gif&quot; width=&quot;81&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named accordianGuy.gif&quot;&gt;Think of the discussion leader as a reporter who is creating a story with quotes from the people in the room. So, instead of having a panel with an audience we just have people. We feel this more accurately reflects what's going on. It's not uncommon for the audience at a conference to have more expertise than the people who are speaking. "/>
					<outline text="The discussion leader is also the editor, so if he or she feels that a point has been made they must move on to the next point quickly. No droning, no filibusters, no repeating an idea over and over.  "/>
					<outline text="The discussion leader can also call on people, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzznet.com/buzzwords/lesblogs/photos/?id=1798119&quot;&gt;stay awake&lt;/a&gt;, you might be the next person to speak! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Think of it as a weblog">
					<outline text="Think of the conference as if it were a weblog. At the beginning of each session, the leader talks  between five and fifteen minutes to introduce the idea and some of the people in the room. Then she'll point to someone else. She may ask a couple of questions to get them going, then she'll point to someone else, then someone else, then make a comment, ask a question, etc. Each person talks for two to three minutes. Long enough to make a point. About the time someone would take if they called into a radio talk show."/>
					<outline text="We have a limited amount of time, and a group of participants whose time is valuable. The leader's job is to make sure the show stays interesting, even captivating. If it gets boring people will go out in the hall and schmooze, or focus their attention on the IRC channel, or read their email, or whatever. So the leader's job is to keep it moving. Sometimes this means cutting people off. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="How to prepare">
					<outline text="Since every person in a session is considered an equal participant, everyone should prepare at least a little. Think about the subject, read the comments on the BloggerCon site. Follow weblogs from other people who are paticipating. Think about what you want to get out of the session, and what questions you wish to raise, and what information or points of view you'd like to get from the session."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Everyone is a journalist">
					<outline text="BloggerCon is an unusual conference in that almost everyone participating writes publicly. So we assume that everyone present is a journalist. Every badge is a press badge."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="On the record">
					<outline text="All conversations, whether to the entire room or one-to-one, unless otherwise stated, clearly and up front, are &lt;i&gt;on the record and for attribution.&lt;/i&gt; You do not need to ask permission to quote something you hear at BloggerCon. Of course you may ask for permission to quote, and you may choose not to quote things you hear."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="It's a user's conference">
					<outline text="Where I come from, the technology world, most conferences are centered around the vendors."/>
					<outline text="This is not like those conferences. Here, vendors are welcome, and we hope they will help by sponsoring a party, dinner or brunch, but they participate mainly &lt;i&gt;by listening. &lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/06/15/slugga.gif&quot; width=&quot;85&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named slugga.gif&quot;&gt;Most of the people who are talking are users. In my opinion, these are the revolutionaries. Vendors make a living by creating tools that these people use to change the world. So much attention is focused on technology, too much imho. At this conference we turn it around and focus on what people are doing with the technology. So if you hear someone say it's about the technology, expect me to challenge if I'm present. If not, stand up and say &quot;That's not correct.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Further, if they say the technology is too complicated for a user to understand, ask them why, and if they could simplify it so we can understand. And if not, why should we use it? Perhaps a new user-centered philosophy will emerge. "/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="Things we assume">
					<outline text="Sometimes conferences bog down in meta-discussions, discussions about what it's okay to discuss. I want to try to head some of that off in advance by stating some assumptions, and asking people who want to discuss these things to either discuss them here on the Web beforehand, or to find another venue to discuss them."/>
					<outline text="1. Weblogs &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; journalism. Not all weblogs, and not all the time. People have said weblogs aren't journalism, and that seems foolish, as strange as saying telephones aren't journalism. It's kind of a moot question. Weblogs can be used for journalism, or not. When people say they're not journalism, I think they haven't thought it through well enough. "/>
					<outline text="2. What is a weblog &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an interesting question. At the Jupiter conference when the question of what a weblog is came up some people would say it's not a good question. At BloggerCon if you have an idea that requires you to say or ask what a weblog is, please go ahead. It's totally on-topic. I would consider the conference a success if that's the only thing we figured out. (Chances are we won't, btw.)"/>

If a discussion naturally turns to products, it's okay to talk about them, but it's probably &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; okay to talk about your product, unless the discussion leader asks you to. No matter what you must ask for permission, and don't be surprised if the answer is no. "/>
					<outline text="There are good reasons for this, if one person talks about his or her product, then their competitors will feel they are entitled to, and pretty soon the user's needs are drowned out by the needs of the vendors. The point of this conference is to focus on users. "/>

					<outline text="First a little history. The print publishing industry, and the print-inspired electronic publishing industry, made it possible for information to be transmitted back when the transmission equipment was expensive, but it was always a very lossy transmission, subject to manipulation by the person doing the reporting, and the person doing the editing, the owner of the publication, etc. In the process, a little truth leaked out, but not much; and nothing that that the publishers didn't want out there (and there was no visibility at all into the motivations of the publishers).

How much do you think Apple spent to figure out that the scroll wheel should navigate through individual songs and podcasts? For that matter, how much did Apple spend on podcasting itself? (Hint, they got it for free, no patents.) " created="Tue, 13 Jun 2006 17:11:26 GMT"/>

					<outline text="At lunch yesterday, in Berkeley, my companion asked what's the big deal about Scoble. I had to think for a minute, back to when I first met him, about six years ago. I had been retained to keynote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftponline.com/&quot;&gt;Fawcette&lt;/a&gt; conference, and Scoble was the editor of the conference. I was struck by a couple of things. First, he actually called me to talk about my role at the conference, a practice I had never seen before (and one which I have adopted for BloggerCon). And then, over the months leading up to the show, he'd send emails to all the speakers, sometimes just with a link to an article he thought we'd find interesting. I thought to myself, this guy is already blogging and he doesn't even know what blogging is. " created="Mon, 12 Jun 2006 20:10:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another different thing about Scoble is that he's unimpressed with celebrity. He seeks out interesting people, and then spends time with them, if they'll let him. When he worked for me at UserLand, he would open doors for me, find me interesting people to talk with, and then he'd often just kick back, and listen. This is smart, it's how you absorb information, how you get people to teach you stuff. (The one exception to Scoble's celebrity coolness was Bill Gates. When he interviewed Gates for Channel 9 he was nervous, no question about that.)" created="Mon, 12 Jun 2006 20:12:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="He also is generous with credit. I can't tell you how many times he's reminded me of the things I've given him. That's very unusual. As time goes by people tend to forget, myself included, who created the opportunities that made their achievements possible. " created="Mon, 12 Jun 2006 20:14:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I also think that Scoble is the prototypical evangelist, in league with the other great evangelist, Guy Kawasaki, but in a very different way. He understands the role of developers, but more important, he learned how to be a sales person early in his career, and he never forgot the basics. You sell yourself first, that's how you get in the door. Once the prospect is sold on you, you can close the deal anytime you want. And like all great sales people, Scoble wears his heart on his sleeve. Whether or not you buy is a personal thing to Scoble, but he always smiles, no matter what, because I don't think he &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; gives up on closing the deal." created="Mon, 12 Jun 2006 20:15:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, in retrospect, Mount Scoble was a lot higher than I thought. He's sold a lot of people. Did Furrier get a good deal? Well, let's see if he can contain Scoble. The man was big, even in relation to a huge multi-national company. Will his persona swamp a small startup that virtually no one has heard of? Should they change the name now, after all, who's heard of Podtech, versus who's heard of Scoble? Kind of a no brainer, don't you think?" created="Mon, 12 Jun 2006 20:17:43 GMT"/>

There are people who will travel across the country, or from Europe or New Zealand, to be part of the community. Three people from Nashville are coming, Rex Hammock, Nick Bradbury and Terry Heaton. I've got an offer out for a DL to lead an Emotional Life discussion, following in the footsteps of John Perry Barlow and Julie Leung. Let's hope that one comes off. Blogs are about more than brands and business models, we hope. I had another talk with Jay Rosen about his session, he's planning something really special. And then Mike Arrington is going to lead a discussion on a topic that might surprise some. I want to find our idealism again. The video bloggers never lost it, their conference is this weekend, also in SF, I'll be there. Think of BloggerCon perhaps as the &quot;original&quot; or old school blogging culture. Yeah, we've been kicked to the curb and dragged around. Starved and hooked up to scams and schemes. But we still stand for something.

Which of them have &quot;funny&quot; names. Is there any confusion about what they are?

The plan where each DL gets 10 invites and chooses them as if they were panelists at a non-unconference, was interesting, but imho, it didn't work as I hoped it would. So one of the hallmarks of BloggerCon planning is, when something isn't working, don't be afraid to change it. The new plan is very simple. Tomorrow morning we'll open a Wiki-based signup page. There will be space for 125 sign-ups, and the first 125 people to sign up will be part of the show at BloggerCon IV on June 23-24 in SF. There's lots of room outside the meeting room, and wifi everywhere. The weather is likely to be great. There's also BarCamp going on in SF on Saturday, so there's lots of blogging schmooze available South of Market during the conference." created="Wed, 07 Jun 2006 15:07:55 GMT"/>

What they say in general is true for me. I love Netflix for the breadth of their catalog. I can explore Woody Allen movies over a period of a month, loading up my queue with every Woody Allen movie they have, and then playing with the queue as the month goes by. Simultaneously I'm exploring movies directed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netflix.com/RoleDisplay?s=1&amp;personid=20769&quot;&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt;. As far as I know this is the first time a regular person like myself has been able to do this. But there still are a lot of old movies you can't get on Netflix. I'd like to see a partnership between Netflix and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcm.com/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Turner Classic Movies&lt;/a&gt;, a process whereby I could get any movie on TCM delivered via Netflix. I also think the key to longterm survival of Netflix is giving people incentives to connect up to their friends' movie history so I can easily recommend movies to people I care about and they can tell me what they thought.

How can we be friends if he's friends with people who are selfishly trying to monetize our work, without giving anything back. I say &quot;our&quot; work, because Toni represents many thousands of WordPress users. There's an arrogance around Battelle's conference, they're the insiders and we're the poor schnooks whose work they monetize. I'm one of those people.

					<outline text="BTW, a similar approach would work with cameras, but the flow is in the other direction. A server subscribes to the output of my camera, and whenever it gets in wifi range, it pulls the new pictures into the cloud.
