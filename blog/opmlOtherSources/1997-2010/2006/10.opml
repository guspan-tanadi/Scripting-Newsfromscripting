I had never spoken with him before or since, and I had no idea the call was coming. I have spoken with Bill Gates a number of times, I've talked with ex-Presidents of the United States, with candidates for President, I even spoke once with Bill Clinton when he was the sitting President, but I was never so nervous as when I was talking with Jobs. I mostly listened. I'm convinced now that he was trying to be my friend, he was telling me what bozos the people running Apple were, something that both horrified me, and that I agreed with. He was so open in his derision, with me, basically a stranger. It really put me off. But in retrospect, perhaps I should have been more agreeable. I don't know. But he was clearly in some way reaching out to me as a blogger probably, not so much as a developer. Also, I had at the time quit the Mac, quite openly, and had no plans to go back. Today, I use nothing but Macs, which is a testimony to the quality of his work, and the choices he made back then, but at the time, I was sure he would fail, and I said so openly. Net-net, at least at the beginning, it seems as if Jobs &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; some kind of dialog with the blogosphere. " created="Sun, 29 Oct 2006 22:40:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The second part of the story involves Kate Adams who I first met at the Digital Storytelling Festival in Crested Butte, in 1997 (long before she was blogging). Kate was then quite outspoken, she worked in the Quicktime group at Apple, one of the successes of the company through the dark years, and one of a small number of technologies to survive at Apple 3.0." created="Sun, 29 Oct 2006 22:47:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Kate was at a company-wide meeting in Cupertino, shortly after Jobs took over, and sent me an email for publication without attribution, enthusiastically explaning what Steve had said. I published the email &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/beerFoodAndSteve.html&quot;&gt;on Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, without identifying the source. The next day she was called into Steve Jobs's office at Apple, they knew who sent the email because they had written a script watching for mail going to me from inside Apple. Not surprisingly, I stopped getting mail from people at Apple. My sources (Kate wasn't the only one) dried up. " created="Sun, 29 Oct 2006 22:50:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To Chuq's point, Kate wasn't in any way acting as a spokesperson for the company. It was clear from the writing, this was an employee not a spokesperson. I didn't identify her as a spokesperson. So if the policy wasn't to be a spokesperson, it's pretty clear Kate didn't violate it. " created="Sun, 29 Oct 2006 23:10:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Also, when Scoble was blogging for Microsoft, most of the time he wasn't blogging as a company spokesman (it's possible there were times when he was coordinating with Microsoft PR). In general people understood that he was blogging as a person. It was pretty clear, because at times he would say he thought management was wrong. Not too many spokespeople do that. Same with all the other bloggers. If Ray Ozzie, on the other hand, were to resume his blog, that would be different, we would assume, since he's an officer of the company, that his writing was official. So if Apple really believes what Chuq says, they can relax a bunch, the blogosphere is smart enough to discern between a spokesperson and a plain old person. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 29 Oct 2006 23:10:30 GMT"/>

The next layer comes on not by building on the old layer (a trick, the guy you're building on will eat your lunch), or re-doing what they did (what the naysayers correctly say you can't do), but by starting from a different place and building something new, and so different that the old guys don't understand it and don't feel threatened by it.

					<outline text="Listening very carefully to podcast and broadcast discussions about the war in Iraq between Washington policy-makers, there is a lot of subtlety that's missed in the crude discussion of &quot;stay the course&quot; vs &quot;cut and run.&quot; I'm sure we're just getting an inkling of what's going on there, and to even get that inkling you have to listen a lot and carefully. Here are some things to consider. We're encouraging the supposed unity government of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki&quot;&gt;Maliki&lt;/a&gt; to work with other factions, but he isn't doing it.

					<outline text="Anyway, there's a point to all this. Clearly behind the scenes, when the Americans put pressure on Iraqis, they're telling them to work with each other. Even the Republicans say that, that in order for Iraq to have a chance of working, each of the factions must compromise. But here's the disconnect. Here at home, the Republicans completely disenfranchise the Democrats and people who vote for Democrats. Every bit of disagreement is cast as cowardice or disloyalty. Most of us aren't going to become Republicans. So how can we expect the Iraqis to do what we ourselves don't? The answer -- it's unreasonable to expect them to.

I've been struggling to find a way to explain this, and haven't come up with one yet, but I recommend if you want to find out more, find a friend with an HD setup and watch one of your favorite shows at his or her house. It's not enough to go to a store to get a demo, or to see a quick demo at a friends' house. For me, it was watching Phantom of the Opera at Scoble's house in Half Moon Bay that made the difference.

					<outline text="A brief report on my MacBook. Two days after it returned from repair, it hasn't shut down randomly, not even once. It is still running hot. And it could be my imagination, but it seems to be using the battery less efficiently. I will be able to measure this by trying to watch a 1.5 hour movie straight through. It used to be able to do this. " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:06:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I have some thoughts on the apparently escalating problem with randomly shutting down MacBooks. It appears the problem worsens over time. I bought my MacBook in the first week it was out, and I was one of the first to experience the problem. So it doesn't seem that Apple is out of the woods yet, only they know how many Macs suffer from the problem, and apaprently it isn't just the first ones sold that do, based on McCracken's &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.pcworld.com/techlog/archives/002978.html&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. And it raises bigger questions about the relationship between Apple and its customers. " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:08:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, does the company have pride in its product? And second, does it think its customers are smart for choosing it? If both are true, it's up to the company to make the second statement true. A computer that doesn't work, no matter how much better the software is, or the basic design, is not a smart choice."/>
					<outline text="So by not taking care of it quickly, as if the customers matter, Apple makes the customers stupid for having chosen the product. Sooner or later the smart people have to go elsewhere, even if they would prefer to use a Mac."/>
					<outline text="In the almost two months that my MacBook didn't work, I was forced to use a Windows XP laptop. Now I'm trying to integrate the MacBook back in my life, but it's just as difficult now as it was when I first made the transition from Windows to the Mac. One of these days (I hope) one of the PC manufacturers will figure out how to make a machine that's as nice to use as a Mac and as reliable as PCs are. Then Apple will &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to take these issues seriously."/>
					<outline text="Of course I would think better of the company if it took the issues seriously before they had to."/>

Paul Andrews, formerly of the Seattle Times, said something similar when I floated the idea by him. My answer is you have to start somewhere. And I'm not that bad an organization guy, when I was at Harvard, I surely stirred things up a bit, but that worked because Harvard is the kind of organization where things are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to be stirred up a bit.

I worked as a pro myself for a short period, then went amateur. I've spent the last xxx years urging the pros to adopt our ways.

It may not be what you want to hear, but isn't it my job, as it is yours, to say what I see, and tell you what I think? I hope it's obvious that I think news reporting can be done better. A few simple guidelines follow, which I hope are helpful." created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 16:15:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Encourage your sources to have blogs. One simple way to do that is to de-emphasize the phone interview, and take quotes straight off the blogs of experts in the area you're reporting on. They'll get the message pretty quickly, if you want to be quoted (and most people still do) it's more likely if you have a blog." created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 16:17:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. If a person you're quoting has a blog, point to it from your piece (if not from the print edition, from the web version). " created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 17:01:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Speaking of pointers, shorten your URLs through redirection (this also lets you gather stats on which links your readers found interesting). So for example, if you're going to point to another reporter's article, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kget.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=F362325A-A594-4205-A088-82580093EF1C&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, you can, instead, use a shortened URL, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yll8rz&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Now you can include more web pointers in your print articles. (Note: I'd recommend you establish your own service, not use Tinyurl.)" created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 17:02:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Start your own blog, point to it from every one of your print stories. Even if you have no idea what you're going to write there, start it, so you're over that hump. " created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 16:20:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. Float ideas for stories on your blog, much as you would with a person on your staff. See what kind of response you get. Most reporters don't have a good feel for how their readers think, or even if people are reading their articles. If I were a professional reporter, this is what I'd want to know first. People throw around a lot of theories about what sells papers, but what do they base their beliefs on? When they say people prefer news about pedophiles to news about bribes and payoffs, they don't really have a strong foundation for that belief. One common objection is that you tip off your competitors, but I think, really, reporters worry too much about this. Readers don't care if someone stole your idea. And sure, there are some ideas you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; float, for legal or ethical reasons, so don't." created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 16:25:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="6. Back to sources having blogs, I'd consider hosting those blogs. This is an idea I've pitched to Martin Nisenholtz at the NY Times, first in 2002, and a couple of times since. How it would work -- when a person is quoted in a Times piece, a few days after the article runs, a person from the publishing side contacts them, congratulates them on being quoted in the Times, and asks if they want a blog. No strings attached, you can say anything you want on your blog, no editorial review, and no cost to you. We get to run ads on your blog, they won't be intrusive, much as we run ads on columns by regular NY Times columnists. The reason this works is that it includes the reporters in the vetting, ultimately it's their decision who gets to blog under the corporate masthead, which is important in an organization where the talent is so important to its success. But they also have to deal with competiton from a new source, their sources. I think it's really clever, and the first news organization that does this will have a leg up on all the others. " created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 16:27:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="7. Finally, as you learn, share what you learn with your readers. Sure some will snark at you, but that's been going on since the beginning of time (read the Letters to the Editor if you don't believe me). And you'll be teaching your competitors too, but that's good -- it's called leadership, and everyone wants that. Basically, it's been my experience that the more you share of what you learn, the more you will learn." created="Wed, 18 Oct 2006 17:13:21 GMT"/>

Put enough normal people in a room covering an event, and you've got coverage. And in my recent experience with MacBooks, a few reporters offered to do phone interviews, which I declined. I said I had written it all up on the blog, all of it is on the record, for attribution, and having a pretty good idea how the interview process works, and the results it produces, the only rational thing for me to do these days is to decline the interview.

But they understood something that most reporters and their supporters don't understand -- the readers didn't have a choice just a few years ago, but now we do, we can go direct to their sources, to their blogs, to find out what they think, we don't need the reporter to assemble the sources for us. To not recalibrate accordingly is professional suicide. No doubt some &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; commit suicide. There's a Tower Records down the street from Magnolia, and on Friday they had guys out on the street with sandwich signs urging us to go to their closeout sale. Someone there must have thought there will always be record stores, Internet or no Internet. " created="Tue, 17 Oct 2006 17:00:58 GMT"/>

I had to wait a couple of weeks while they shipped a part to the Apple store (after claiming they didn't know about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt;, already widely reported on the net), and then brought it in when they called (same day, I didn't make them wait) for a 4-5 day repair. That was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/10.html#macVsToyota&quot;&gt;nine days ago&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to go down to the store last week to find out when it would be ready (I was shopping in the area). They wouldn't talk to me if I didn't have an appointment. There's no record of the repair when I enter the number on the website. So I thought I'd call the store today to find out what's up with the repair. There was no way to find a human being through their voice navigation system. Now I'm on hold hearing &quot;all our representatives are still busy, please hold for the next available representative.&quot; That message comes on every 20 seconds, interrupting music playing behind it. While I'm going through this wait, I figure I've already put in a few hundred dollars of my life into fixing the defective machine, and everything in their system is designed to keep me from finding anything out, or getting my machine back (with thousands of dollars of my data on it, btw). While going through this psychic reaming, I'm thinking that while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uriahcarpenter.info/1984.html&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; might not have been like 1984, 2006 surely is." created="Mon, 16 Oct 2006 17:33:03 GMT"/>

I'm also trying to do what I can to make &quot;Republican&quot; a dirty word, but that's not an ad hominem, because it's about a party not a person. You may disagree with it, and that's fine, that's what makes our country great.

Yet the press has focused on the less interesting one, presumably based on the assumption that the reader or viewer would not understand the Delay scandal. But be clear, it was &lt;i&gt;their choice&lt;/i&gt; to go this route, no reader or viewer made the decision, they did. I think it was because they knew how to proceed.

Naturally, as a new home owner, I wanted to rent a safe deposit box, so I went to the local branch of my bank and asked to rent one, and was told they don't have any. I could get on the waiting list, but it's got hundreds of names on it. Hmmm. So I went down the street to another bank, asked the same question, got the same answer. Why are all your boxes rented? They looked at me as if I were from a strange planet, where you could actually rent the damn things. I scratched my head, it seems as if I was able to rent them fairly easily in the past. Finally I found a bank that had one, I opened a checking account, deposited the minimum required, paid the first month's rent and then asked why they had boxes when their competitors didn't. Answer, after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Hills_firestorm&quot;&gt;Oakland Hills fire of 1991&lt;/a&gt;, the hill-dwellers in the East Bay rushed out to get safe deposit boxes. This bank was built a few years after that, so they missed the rush. It's often a good idea to ask why, sometimes you get an interesting story that reveals something useful about human nature. People get safe deposit boxes when they see their neighbors lives turned upside down when whole neighborhoods go up in smoke. " created="Wed, 04 Oct 2006 17:08:19 GMT"/>

But after visiting New Orleans in December and hearing the the tales of woe from people who bought flood insurance, only to find the industry didn't honor their commitments, I wondered if it was actually worth the money.

I did at one point get a TV picture showing up on my laptop and that was pretty exciting, but then they wanted me to install the new version of the software, and from that point on, nothing worked. In the process the software got hosed and no longer works. The instructions for installing the hardware are strictly for hobbyists, I can't imagine someone non-technical making any sense of it. I also felt they should have provided specific guidance for the settop box I have. Maybe they try to do too much? Also, as luck would have it, I bought my unit a day before they announced their new products. My bad luck, and I guess theirs too, I'm reviewing something that's obsolete.

The Zen Master teaches us to believe that if it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; it must be good, to not to struggle with existence, so in that spirit PayPerPost is good. In fact, as with many other things, it's better than the old way of doing things, because it's out in the open, it's existence is disclosed. In the print world, there's a pretense that such a practice doesn't exist, but of course it does." created="Mon, 02 Oct 2006 16:02:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I saw it happen in the 80s when I ran a software business that spent as much as $100K per month on advertising. I noticed that when I used a certain phrase in my ads, that phrase would show up in the editorial coverage. It wasn't contractual, as it is with PayPerPost, there was no clear obligation for PC Week, MacWorld or InfoWorld to provide this service, it's possible that the authors didn't even know they were doing it, but the net effect is the same as PayPerPost." created="Mon, 02 Oct 2006 16:04:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And then there was the time a publisher and editor came on a joint visit. When the editor went to the men's room, the publisher said that if I bought an ad the editor would cover my product. That time it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; explicit, but not out in the open. The readers of his magazine may have suspected that there was a connection between advertising and editorial, but they didn't have the proof that PayPerPost would have provided." created="Mon, 02 Oct 2006 16:06:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then there is the tendency of the publications to favor products of the big companies, the ones that run millions of dollars of ads a month instead of tens of thousands of dollars. They may believe the big companies had the staying power, and therefore tilted the table in favor of their products, but they were also the ones paying their salaries." created="Mon, 02 Oct 2006 16:08:19 GMT"/>

					<outline text="In other words, this is hardly a new practice, but at least now it's out in the open. Readers know to ask the bloggers if they are members of PayPerPost. They also might be aware that there are less visible ways of buying influence. " created="Mon, 02 Oct 2006 16:09:20 GMT"/>

They're really stupid, because if they just did a little checking they'd find that I was a harsh critic of Clinton and rallied for his impeachment and removal from office. I see politicians as vendors and voters as customers. Once you get caught lying that's it, I'm not buying anymore. If Bush were honorable, if he weren't a force that put a lid on discourse by labeling people (e.g. cut and run), if he weren't lying &lt;i&gt;all the time,&lt;/i&gt; I'd say fine, stay in office, even if you fucked up big time (which he did). But Bush is the problem, so it's time for him to go. As they say when Clinton lied no one died. Bush set in motion a process that's killing thousands of people and costing us billions of dollars and throwing away what's good about our country. The man is the biggest failure we've elected in my lifetime, and that includes a few other first-class losers. " created="Sun, 01 Oct 2006 13:13:10 GMT"/>
