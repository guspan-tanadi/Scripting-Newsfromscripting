					<outline text="Any software whose purpose is to copy-protect data, will fail. This is a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/corollary&amp;r=67&quot;&gt;corollary&lt;/a&gt; of Murphy's Law, which isn't just a joke, it's a law of nature. Engineers have to learn this in designing systems. It's one reason users get so pissed off when copy protection schemes interfere with their ability to use products in the way they were intended to be used." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:33:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For example, I bought a copy of Windows XP to install over some bits that had gone bad on an IBM ThinkPad. As I was installing the software, it told me I would have to first uninstall it on another system it believed I had already installed it on. Now, I couldn't do this, of course, because the &lt;i&gt;software was wrong,&lt;/i&gt; I hadn't installed it anywhere else. So here I am, almost $200 poorer, hoping to have a good user experience, and getting ready to call for help, a misadventure all of its own. Never did get the software working on the laptop. Microsoft has my money, I have nothing. If I want satisfaction I'm going to have to put more than $200 of my own time into getting it. Never mind. Lesson learned. No more copy protected operating systems for this user. I don't care how much of my rights they've taken into consideration. I don't trust schemes whose purpose is to lock me out of things I have a right to get into." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:35:15 GMT"/>

					<outline text="When I was checking in on the web before going to NY, they offered the option of upgrading to first class for $250. Now that was too good to pass up. Only $250 to be treated better, to get a bigger seat, to be smiled at and cared for? It's a  deal! On the way back, I expected to get the same offer, and take it, but they made it really difficult. Here's how." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:44:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, I had to change the flight. Of course there's no way to do it via the web, I wish there were. I call the 800 number, and navigate through their automated system, knowing all the time that it wouldn't be able to handle it either. I pressed 0 for Operator a number of times, but that trick, which often works, was disabled. Remember that I was prepared to pay more to be treated better. Finally, I navigated to the place where it routes you to a person. They put me on hold, listening to recorded messages, but the connection had gotten really bad and I could only hear every third word. I wasn't sure if they were saying things I needed to hear, or if it was the usual idiotic advertisments. I stayed on the line. Finally, after waiting ten minutes, an Indian voice came on. Her name is &quot;Annie.&quot; I could only hear every third word. I tried speaking loudly slowly and clearly. After repeating myself a few times I got off the phone, and checked my email. She had made the change, charged me $100, and I went ahead to the web site and spent the $250 to upgrade to first class." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:46:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But I realized, sheez, I wanted to pay more to be treated better, and in the end I paid more and wasn't. My time was treated as valueless. Second, not only did they save money by hiring a cheaper person in India, but they also cheaped out on the phone line! Even Skype would have been better than the system they were using. India may be far away, but don't they have good phones? They must be losing business this way. It sure didn't feel good." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:50:34 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The Millennium U.N. Plaza Hotel" created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:56:49 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="I promised the desk clerk at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/339844503/&quot;&gt;Millennium U.N. Plaza Hotel&lt;/a&gt; that I would blog this and I am a man of my word." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:56:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I checked in there, they asked for a photo ID. He said he was going to make a photocopy. I said I didn't want him to do that. He said it was a requirement, since the hotel was part of the UN. Not sure why or if this is true, but I've been asked for a photo ID going into office buildings in NY, and generally let them have it, but I was concerned in this case because they had also taken an imprint of my credit card. With these two piece of information, there are some delicate places they can get into. " created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:57:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you're not worried about this, I think you should be. When you hear about schools and businesses losing hundreds of thousands of credit card numbers, it could be yours. I once had all my mail stolen. They eventually caught the people, and it was identity theft. I don't think they ever got access to any of my accounts, but they got banking records and credit card numbers. Since most places don't ask for driver's licenses, it's still thought of as a fairly good way to identify people. But not if you routinely give it to hotels and they enter it into their systems. Next time they lose a few hundred thousand identities, it may include drivers license numbers. If it's the Millennium U.N. Plaza Hotel that loses them, it will be include mine, because I let them photocopy my license. " created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:59:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If I hadn't, I would have lost the money I pre-paid for my room. The desk clerk promised that I would get the copy back when I checked out. However when I asked for it when I checked out they said I couldn't have it. I said that's the last time I stay at your hotel, he said fine. I said I'm going to blog it (I felt stupid at this point) and he said okay." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 18:02:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In my humble opinion, the Millennium U.N. Plaza Hotel in New York plays pretty loose with customer's identity information. I won't be staying there again -- a shame, because otherwise it's a nice hotel, reasonably priced, at a good location." created="Sun, 31 Dec 2006 18:03:28 GMT"/>

To be clear, I wouldn't have objected if they had set the default to work with their tool, as long as users could change a preference to use it with other tools. Long-term it would have made their tool more useful to more people, following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2005/12/12.html#howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternetVersion3&quot;&gt;principle&lt;/a&gt; of sending people away to get them to come back.

We will also be honored by the presence of newlywed Raines Cohen all the way from Berkeley. I'll begin with five minutes or so of random podcast-style ramble, then ask what people want to talk about. I'll pick out people at random and ask them to explain something. Likely callouts to Andrew Baron, who just announced a new venture in video podcasting, and proto-blogger Cameron Barrett, who is working on Confabb (of which I am invested). Martin Schwimmer, legal blogger, can help us understand what's what with Internet patentry. Bobby Orbach will call me Biiiiiig Daaaave (probably).

It surely &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be influenced, if you have a good product. And I may well buy a Vista machine at some point. I have paid for all the hardware I use today. I did once get a freebie from Microsoft, they sent a guy to my house to install both a new computer and a high-speed Internet line, in 1996, when Bill G was still running the company. Back then I said lots of things he didn't like, but instead of sulking and trying to pretend I don't exist, he engaged me in debate, and we all learned something. It's possible that some of the people at Microsoft today owe their jobs to his approach. " created="Thu, 28 Dec 2006 16:09:33 GMT" type="outline"/>

Of course what they did wasn't right or fair, but also, neither of them claimed to be helping the community as Microsoft did, and neither has been convicted of antitrust as Microsoft has. Even so, I have been critical of both Apple and Google here, for their efforts to corral RSS behind a wall of corporate ownership. In contrast, I don't think any of the big publishing companies, notably the New York Times Company, who have made a &lt;i&gt;greater&lt;/i&gt; and much earlier contribution to the success of RSS than the tech industry has, have tried to own it or fork it as Google, Apple and Microsoft have. There's a lesson here, and Sean is a good teacher. Yes Sean, the tech industry is bad. But even in the tech industry, Microsoft stands head and shoulders above the rest.

Next week Sean could be working at another company, and his successor could say, when we show him or her how much Sean liked us, &quot;Okay, now what?&quot; And he or she would be right.

Back then I was very happy to be working on the web, I thought of it as the platform with no platform vendor, and I saw XML as a way of inviting all the would-be and former platform vendors back in to rule our lives, and prevent us from having any fun or making any money. Eventually I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/07/10/whyILikeXml&quot;&gt;won over&lt;/a&gt;, for one main reason -- interop is important. If I make software that has an open and easy to understand protocol for communicating with other instances of itself, then other people can write plug-compatible software, and users can choose between products based on features, performance and price, not compatibility.

I didn't mean to. However I did mean to shred the idea that everything can be redone at any time. Sure there are always lots of arguments in favor of starting over, but the one argument against it, imho, is the strongest, interop is sacred, and anything that throws out interop is highly suspect. One way to do things, no matter how flawed, is better than two, no matter how much better the new way is. The Perl community has a different motto, god bless em, but in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2002/04/04/fourYearsOfXmlrpc&quot;&gt;space where all languages interop&lt;/a&gt;, the less-is-more and worse-is-better approach is &lt;i&gt;what makes things work. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Thu, 21 Dec 2006 15:39:18 GMT"/>

I've had situations like this, where people are irrationally obsessed with me, when it isn't clear what they want, other than to keep me right where I am. I consider both Amanda and Andrew friends. I've spent much more time with Andrew than Amanda, countless times I've told him to just let it go. I say the same thing to Amanda, because I think she's holding on too.

I think this is a good thing, even though I fully understand why big companies like Microsoft (Shaw's client) have attempted to orchestrate product rollouts in the past. It made more sense before there were blogs, when the number of news outlets was finite, and when most people were dependent on intermediaries to find out about new products. That hasn't been true for quite some time, and it will be less true in the future. " created="Sat, 16 Dec 2006 20:18:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The embargo system led to an inbred information flow, and created opportunities for competitors that didn't have the ear of the big pubs, like the NY Times, Fortune, Business Week or the Wall Street Journal. How many of the ideas that made a difference in the last few years were rolled out in the orchestrate and embargo system? When you see a rollout that's been orchestrated does that make you more or less interested? For me, if 18 big publications got the story before me, I'm not interested at all. If Om and Mike got it before me, ditto. And in a world where everyone is a publication, you just can't play favorites, you have to find a way to spread the news on your own, without help from middlemen. " created="Sat, 16 Dec 2006 20:20:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Luckily it's easy to do. No reason you can't cover your own rollout. It requires that you undestand your product, have an idea how people will see it. It means maybe you haven't been that secretive about it while you were creating it.

But I'm sure of this -- in the future, the users are the designers, so you can't hide your ideas from them, they already know them, if you're barking up the right tree, if your ideas are any good.

" created="Fri, 15 Dec 2006 22:17:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For example, it wasn't until after the election that they were willing to call the fighting in Iraq a civil war. Now the discussion has moved beyond that, and they're almost willing to say we're losing the war in Iraq, and that the President somehow wants a strategy to win the war. (They quote the incoming SecDef, heroically, for admitting that we're &quot;not winning,&quot; which isn't exactly the same as losing.)" created="Fri, 15 Dec 2006 22:28:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Going all the way back to the beginning of the war, the MSM didn't ask the obvious question -- given that there's no evidence that Iraq had anything to do with 9/11, why are we invading them now? Wouldn't it be more prudent to focus all our energy at rooting out and destroying the people who organized the attack? It seems we should have been talking about that, not just in hindsight, it seemed that way at the time, too." created="Fri, 15 Dec 2006 22:34:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But now, in late 2006, we seem to still be at least one step behind where we should be. When talking about winning and losing, how could we know, when we haven't got a way to measure success or failure? Simple, obvious point -- but, again, we're not looking at what's necessary and obvious, at our peril, really. It could get a lot worse. I don't think people are factoring that in. Or so it seems." created="Fri, 15 Dec 2006 22:28:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In World War II, victory in Europe was clear when Hitler was dead and the Allies occupied Berlin. The Pacific war was over and won when the Japanese surrendered and we occupied Tokyo. Even the Cold War had a clear outcome, amazingly. I suspect most people wouldn't have thought it would ever end, but it did. We won that war too. " created="Fri, 15 Dec 2006 22:29:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I suppose we could spell out some formula for victory in Iraq, but until the President tells us what &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; definition is, there's no point. Whatever the goal, I certainly wouldn't support sacrificing any more American lives even to turn Iraq into a peaceful country. And from everything I've read, it seems this would take 10 or 20 years, if it could happen at all. But I think there's reason to believe that Iraq can't get on with finding peace until we leave, as long as the country is occupied, that will be the issue everyone talks about and fights over.

I remember saying that I don't care how mean you are, I'm still your friend, nothing is going to change that.

And while I do appreciate the apology (btw, I found it more than &quot;bothersome&quot;), this affair has lowered my opinion of your organization, the program, and of NPR.

He might have emulated Ben Rosen, the author of the Rosen Electronic Letter in the late 70s and early 80s, which was something like TechCrunch, though it ran less frequently and was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bricklin.com/history/02d58210.gif&quot;&gt;printed&lt;/a&gt; on paper. Rosen got to know all the players in the nascent PC industry, and when he was reasonably sure how the industry would develop, he quit the newsletter (turning it over to Esther Dyson) and started two companies: Compaq and Lotus, and became even more influential in very short order (and hugely rich, btw).

I've never met the founder of the show, Jay Allison, but we have many friends in common. I believe in This I Believe, but that's not what this essay is about. I also believe in voting, The Golden Rule and Murphy's Law, and commonsense principles like What Goes Around Comes Around. I could write essays about these subjects and easily fill 500 words. I also share Chris Lydon's belief in the Emersonian Ideal of self-reliance, the power of thought, the power of the individual.

I like to take NPR podcasts with me on my walks. It's my time every day to fill my mind with new ideas from the brilliant programmers at NPR. The This I Believe essays are frequent companions. Yesterday it was an interview with the man himself. As I settled into my stride, I saw a woman ahead with a dog, the dog was doing his thing and the woman was bending over to pick up the prize. I thought to myself &quot;I'll just cross the street,&quot; and luckily there was a cross-walk. Berkeley, where I live, is like Cambridge, when it comes to the rules of the road. The law is the same everywhere, the pedestrian has the right of way. As long as the pedestrian is in a crosswalk, the traffic must stop. But in places like New York, New Orleans, St Louis or Denver, the law is ignored, and pedestrians must wait until the traffic clears, whether or not there's a crosswalk. But Berkeley is one of a handful of places where the pedestrians regularly risk their lives and step out into traffic. " created="Tue, 05 Dec 2006 16:07:36 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I've stared down many a driver, and I'm still here. I've actually broken one windshield and one headlight. When the drivers stop, always outraged to have their space invaded, I try to keep my cool, and ask them to think about it.

					<outline text="When I end up staring at the grill of a car that didn't want to stop, but was forced to, being an engineer and inventor, I think for the rest of my walk, how can we solve this problem? Maybe walkers could carry an indelible paint, and mark the car as an offender. Let the person explain to the husband or wife why there's this mark on the grill of the car. It could lead to some interesting talks at home. Honey, that could have been blood or bone." created="Tue, 05 Dec 2006 16:17:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Me, when I'm driving, I always stop, and the pedestrians almost always grin with gratitude. Everyone likes to be respected, and this is a very nice way to show respect. A mother crossing the street with a couple of small children deserve your protection no more than an aging man listening to a podcast. We all need to be heard, and the law is there for a good reason, to make walking seem safe. And walking is such a good thing, it saves the atmosphere, protects against disease, and it fosters the kind of thought we need more of. " created="Tue, 05 Dec 2006 16:15:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So this is what I believe, when you see a human body crossing the street, as you approach in your car, don't treat it as an obstacle or a slalom pole. Remember, this is a person, someone's son or daughter, husband or wife, aunt or uncle. Obey the law, stop, get a smile. Feel good about yourself." created="Tue, 05 Dec 2006 16:25:58 GMT"/>

As you know, I'm in the process of buying a house (the closing is a week from tomorrow), so I do a lot of email with my mortgage broker, accountant, realtor, insurance agents. They're all using email these days, so there's less phone tag, and it's easier to compare offers, juggling details is possible, even while I'm traveling.

I was able to estimate the cab fare, and since I don't live in NY and they keep changing the bus fare, I was able to find out how many quarters I needed to get on the bus (eight).

Think about it. There's a big trend here, imho it's the difference between the 20th and 21st centuries. In the past the flow of ideas for products was heavily centralized, and based on advertising to build demand. In the future, the flow of ideas for products will happen everywhere, all the time, and products with small markets will be worth making because we'll be able to find the users, or more accurately, they'll be able to find us. &quot;Targeting&quot; customers is the wrong metaphor for the future. Instead make it easy for the people who lust for what you have to find you. How? 1. Find out what they want, and 2. Make it for them and 3. Go back to where you found out about it, and tell them it's available. " created="Thu, 03 Aug 2006 13:11:40 GMT"/>

The incentive to defraud is too great. And who's frauding who, I think it's the companies that take your money to hitch your message on &quot;content&quot; where it isn't welcome.
