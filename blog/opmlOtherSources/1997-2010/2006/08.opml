Hire a consultant if you don't believe me. It's worth checking out. A dam is about to break. There are a lot of people pissed at O'Reilly, every time you do another exclusive event, more people are getting angry. But so far they're not saying anything publicly because your company has said, clearly, that if you say anything negative about them, you won't be invited.

					<outline text="I had an experience like this with Apple in 1997. The company was in disarray, the market was sinking fast. Craig Cline, who was running the Seybold Conference at the time asked me to chair a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seyboldreports.com/SRIP/subs/0109/IP010902.HTM&quot;&gt;panel&lt;/a&gt; entitled &quot;Can Apple Survive?&quot; I accepted the assignment with gusto. This is exactly what we needed to get out in the open. But Apple controlled the conversation and they tried to sabotage us. Well we had the discussion anyway, ask anyone who was there, it was a real good thing we had it. A lot of people were very concerned, and rightly so. By getting the angst out of the way, we were able to focus on what was working in the Mac market, and that played some role in the revival of Apple. Not a very famous role, but I think an important one." created="Thu, 31 Aug 2006 03:52:18 GMT"/>

Clearly the number of hits they're getting for Mike's feed must be going up, and perhaps the number of unique IP addresses is going up too. Do they count all the readers at Microsoft as 1 subscriber?

My aggregator reads it 24 times a day, am I counted as 24 &quot;readers?&quot; Bloglines just reads it once for N people who subscribe, how do they factor that in?

					<outline text="David [Weinberger] -- I'm curious about the ambivalence you express &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/foocamp06_welcome_to_foo_you_l.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds to me like you're trying to curry favor with the well-known critics of FOO (and obviously, you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/26.html#whyCarryTheWaterDavid&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;) rather than giving us real insight."/>
					<outline text="Yes, FOO Camp is exclusive in the sense that it's invite-only, but if you're honest, you'll have to admit that it's one of the most diverse technical conferences you're ever likely to attend. We make a real effort to invite people from different technical communities, people who ought to know each other, but don't. One of our goals is to create new synapses in the global brain, so to speak. This is way more diverse than an open-to-all comers event that draws from the same community. And it's precisely because we limit attendance that we're able to manage that creative mix. Do you bake a cake by using whatever amount of flour, eggs, sugar, and chocolate you happen to have in your kitchen? There's a range of experiment, but in the end, you control the mix because you know that some combinations are essential for the cake to work at all."/>
					<outline text="This is not to say that an open-to-all comers event can't also work (assuming you have either a narrow topic that doesn't draw a huge crowd, or else a venue that can hold all comers, and a set of goals that will work for a very large event.) But it would be a very different kind of event, and for our purposes, much less successful."/>
					<outline text="Stop worrying about what Winer thinks. He's perfectly &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/01/29/twoDaysAtDavos&quot;&gt;happy&lt;/a&gt; to attend exclusive events, as long as he's invited. He has a grudge against me, for reasons only he understands, and despite his many other virtues, on this subject, he just needs to be ignored."/>
					<outline text="There are lots of ways to do great events. FOO is one. Bar Camp is another (and we're honored to be imitated, and in fact have invited some of the Bar Camp people this year to be sure that they learn as much as they can about how we do it.)"/>

				<outline text="Why post from a Blackberry?" created="Mon, 28 Aug 2006 16:28:47 GMT">
					<outline text="I've seen a few blog posts asking why would you want to post from a Blackberry? After all, you could carry a laptop with you, and of course typing on a laptop keyboard is much easier than typing on a PDA keyboard (it is, no argument there). And maybe it's a good idea to take a break from blog posting sometimes, maybe it's a good thing that you can't post from every conceivable place." created="Mon, 28 Aug 2006 16:28:55 GMT"/>

					<outline text="1. I think it's important to flip the question around, because when you do it helps reveal the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; of it. Is email the only form of communication that makes sense when using a Blackberry? Well, maybe for some people, but for others, who may have to communicate with a workgroup, or their family, or create an RSS feed for their observations away from work or home, using weblog software makes a lot of sense, not to exclusion of email, but in addition to it. " created="Mon, 28 Aug 2006 16:31:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Okay, great, but you can use email to post to a weblog, why not just do that? Well, I tried it. In 2001, I programmed Radio 8, which shipped in early 2002, to receive blog posts via email. The problem with that is that unlike email, I like to edit my blog posts, make spelling corrections, add items to a list, reorganize, prioritize, etc. When you're using email to post to a blog, it's a lot like email (surprise!) -- your first version is your last. Again, email is useful, I send emails all the time, but blogging is useful too." created="Mon, 28 Aug 2006 16:33:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. To the point that a laptop can go with you everywhere a Blackberry can, that's obviously not true. I have my Blackberry with me when I'm in line at the supermarket, I almost never have a laptop with me then. But that doesn't mean I don't get ideas while standing in line. A few other places Blackberries go that laptops don't: ski lifts, restaurants, cabs, buses and yes, bathrooms. (Someone had to say that, glad it's out of the way.) Jackie Danicki writes that she &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jackiedanicki.com/?p=198&quot;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; &quot;from the Vatican during New Year's Eve Mass, with the Pope a few feet in front of me.&quot; You could also blog during a disaster like a hurricane or after an earthquake. " created="Mon, 28 Aug 2006 16:34:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Bonus point. People have even said they tried reading news on a Blackberry and it was too cumbersome. That's why we have to bang the drum so loudly and even then a few days later people didn't get the message: With a simple change in the way news is presented, it works. It's not a technical breakthrough, it's a usability improvement, but it makes a big difference. Try it out before you dismiss it, and don't try it on a desktop or laptop, try it on a PDA.

I consider Nicco a friend, and I know him pretty well, and I've been listening to McCain, and I think it's a total mismatch. Almost every reasonable person can agree that there's &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; admirable about McCain. But he can't be the next President and solve the problems created by the current President. He is a loyal Republican. Even if he were secretly against the war, he couldn't take the steps needed to end it. And he's always said we need &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; troops in Iraq. Nicco worked for Howard Dean, and while there's a lot that I don't like about Dean, he got the war issue right, back in 2003. It's even clearer in 2006.

We're not the idiots the Republicans make us out to be. And never mind Iraq for a minute, what about the US? Isn't the President's first responsibility to America?

But when you finally break through, savor the moment, and don't pay any attention to the ballast. (Also, I find that the people with the biggest problems often turn out to be competitiors.

I like to use redirects as part of the user interface for my web apps. Rather than display an error message saying you have to configure the app, I just redirect to the configuration page. My framework only allows one kind of redirect, so I always do a permanent one, HTTP result code 301. Everything worked fine, but something apparently changed in Firefox and now it notes 301s, and implements them on the client side. It probably seems like an economy of some sort, but it broke a few of my apps, and it took the longest time to figure out why. Not saying they did anything wrong, but making a note so that next time maybe I'll remember it, and save some time. Or maybe this will save you some time.

That they're different is something I've come to appreciate, having spent considerable (for me) time in Canada over the last couple of years. They don't seem to mind that we think they're just like us, but they don't feel that we're just like them. " created="Mon, 14 Aug 2006 16:27:53 GMT"/>

I had heard it before, but never in its entirety and for some reason this time it really grabbed me. Patriotism is moving, even when it's not your patriotism. Maybe even more so, because it doesn't get all mixed up with personal stuff, you get to experience love of country through someone else's eyes, and it's really beautiful. But then I saw a friend of mine from Berkeley, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaliyasblogs.net%2FIwoman%2F&amp;ei=1qfgRIHHI7LOigHM7aD5AQ&amp;sig2=4oN3ZTIN6grsar-ltUwyww&quot;&gt;Kaliya Hamlin&lt;/a&gt;, standing, and singing. I had to look twice and think, and then I remembered, she's Canadian! That's right. I'll never forget that image, Kaliya is tall and strong, opinionated, a bit nutty (in a nice way), a leader, and underneath it all, she's even more different from me than Jackie Robinson was, because she's patriotic to a different country, and Robinson and I are both from the United States.

Please we should expect more of ourselves and each other, not less. Of course men have soft insides, just like women, but the world treats us so harshly. Be a man, you can take it. I notice this, because as you get older you're not as strong as you once were, but there's so little mercy. Even crossing the street, drivers challenge men, where they stop for women. I refuse to run to get out of the way of a speeding car, for fear that I'll trip and get run over. And I don't run so well anymore. Being hit by a car hurts a man almost as much as it would hurt a woman. And on the Internet our bodies are &lt;i&gt;exactly the same size.&lt;/i&gt; But men are still supposed to put up with bashing. No wonder our emotions turn off. We're punished for showing any of it, sadness, fear, joy -- these are considered unmasculine. The only emotion men are permitted to have is anger, which is why you see so much fear and sadness, even joy, expressed as anger. The day when you are ready for men to express their emotions is the day you will see that we have them. " created="Sun, 13 Aug 2006 04:47:33 GMT"/>

And as the day went on, bloggers posted their accounts of the human view of the events, the eye witnesses, while the pros were (importantly) reporting on the governments. See how the two complement each other? We need both views, and it would do us all good if the pros would stop predicting the demise of blogging, and get busy learning to use blogging in their reporting.

I had told her that when I write about gender I get attacked. I've told other feminist friends the same, and said it at BloggerCon in June. They denied it, telling me basically to be a man, suckitup, stop being so sensitive. This time Sylvia got to see both the cause and the effect, and I won the argument, finally. She now sees the barriers, ones she herself doesn't have, but others of her gender do have, to letting men say their piece about gender. " created="Thu, 10 Aug 2006 21:13:09 GMT"/>

She was one of the doubters, post-BloggerCon she ridiculed me for asking for permission to speak on gender. Perhaps unwittingly she gave the best demo of why I, and other men, are fearful to speak about gender. In a condescending and humiliating fashion, we get lectured by women who don't stop to think before they name-call and attack. No, Liz I don't think it's cute when you call me a sexist. And I don't think it's fun if it doesn't go both ways. I don't want to call you or anyone else a name, but if I did what you did, imagine the verbal stack of bricks that would come down on me.

But there's a long to-do-list for women, and because men have been forced into silence on this subject, that list hasn't had a chance to develop. Liz, it's time to bend over backwards to create safety for men to speak on this subject. Many of your colleagues are already doing this. There are still a few standouts, and you are one of them. No more gender-bashing, lecturing and name-calling, and no more tolerance for that. I will consider what you have said. Now it would be great if you would do the same.

There also appears to be a disconnect between the promoters and the people who do the work. When Jimmy Wales says that the focus in the future will be quality not quantity, this doesn't seem to translate to anything new in the work on Wikipedia. It's a very slippery subject, but an important one, because Wikipedia pages rank so high on the web. If they didn't, there would hardly be a reason to discuss. In the web before Wikipedia, every point of view had a chance, but Wikipedia tends toward centralization, toward one or two views prevailing, those that are represented by people who are willing to maintain a presence on Wikipedia.

In the future, the flow of ideas for products will happen everywhere, all the time, and products with small markets will be worth making because we'll be able to find the users, or more accurately, they'll be able to find us. &quot;Targeting&quot; customers is the wrong metaphor for the future.

I was talking about that on Sunday with Ponzi, when she and the Scobles and Paulls came over to look at my new house in Berkeley. Why are women so good at dressing up, and men care how their dates look; and women (think they) overlook the looks, and focus on other qualities. We got started talking about this because Ponzi suggested a date for me with someone I don't find attractive, even though she's smart and clever, and laughs at my jokes.

I wouldn't have said these things at the conference, because I don't yet trust the women not to bash when they get scared.

Does she understand that, while she was expressing a compliment, she was also putting down my gender? Would she have understood if I had said something negative about her gender, for example, if a woman was being analytic or solving a problem, that it was her maleness that was speaking?

Had the tables been turned, had it been 50 Israelis, I can't imagine Israeli logic concluding that they themselves were to blame for the deaths. Israel is not just defending itself, &lt;/i&gt;we &lt;i&gt;are defending Israel. Without our army, our arsenal, our economy, Israel would not exist. They have an impossible problem, true enough, but they're not the only ones anymore, and they're just 3 million people. I don't understand where they get their support. I'm an American Jew, first-generation, child of refugees. If anyone would support Israel, it would be me, but I don't. This war has to stop now. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Tue, 01 Aug 2006 16:02:44 GMT"/>
