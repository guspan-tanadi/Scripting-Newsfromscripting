And that is part of the larger pattern of the appeal of a new online collectivism that is nothing less than a resurgence of the idea that the collective is all-wise, that it is desirable to have influence concentrated in a bottleneck that can channel the collective with the most verity and force. This is different from representative democracy, or meritocracy. This idea has had dreadful consequences when thrust upon us from the extreme Right or the extreme Left in various historical periods. The fact that it's now being re-introduced today by prominent technologists and futurists, people who in many cases I know and like, doesn't make it any less dangerous.&quot;" created="Wed, 31 May 2006 12:43:56 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I've not commented on the Web 2.0 trademark issues because I didn't want to be part of the flood of discourse. I've been on the receiving end of that kind of &quot;feedback&quot; and it's not very productive or pleasant, and runs a predictable course, and I'd like to see us be a little less predictable, and a little wiser, here in the blogosphere. So I waited, and now that things have settled down, I would like to weigh in. " created="Tue, 30 May 2006 16:36:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. The blogs seem to have a knee-jerk opinion that everything involving lawyers is wrong. I don't agree. There are times when people can't settle their differences without legal representation. There are also times when all discussion must be handled by lawyers. Just because we have an Internet and blogs doesn't change this simple fact. We have lawyers because we exist in the context of a legal system. It's got flaws, but in my limited experience, it usually seems to come to the right conclusion. Lawyers provide important services, which we need to keep our economy and society working. " created="Tue, 30 May 2006 16:39:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Everything O'Reilly, CMP and Battelle said about protecting trademarks is true. If you want to keep your trademark, the law requires that you challenge all infringing uses of it." created="Tue, 30 May 2006 16:41:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. However, if they wanted to protect the trademark, it seems to me that they should have been sending demand letters from the beginning. It appears they started when it became clear that the USPTO was going to grant their application to register the mark. That said, I am not a lawyer, so I don't know whether the lack of consistency weakens their ownership of the trademark." created="Tue, 30 May 2006 16:42:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Key point: O'Reilly is a business and it behaves like a business. It is not a political cause. Its purpose is to achieve ROI for its shareholders, and it does this very well. They've made millions of dollars commercializing ideas that others gave away for free, while the blogosphere, naively, has bought into the idea that O'Reilly is something other than a business. This is illustrated perfectly by Cory Doctorow's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/26/can_anyone_own_web_2.html&quot;&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;. They created the Web 2.0 name, perhaps (some dispute this), but that's all. The ideas behind Web 2.0 are other people's work, and those people, for the most part, haven't made &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; money from it. If O'Reilly were to lose control of the trademark they still would be way, way ahead. There's no reason for their arguments to gain sympathy at an emotional level, even if they gain sympathy at a business level. There's an important distinction here. " created="Tue, 30 May 2006 16:44:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. The shock came from naivete being awoken by the reality. I don't think the O'Reilly people fully understand how much the blogosphere has bought into the idea that O'Reilly is sort of a non-profit for great ideas. To see them act so boldly in a commercial fashion is something they needed to be prepared for, and there was no preparation. " created="Tue, 30 May 2006 16:56:18 GMT"/>

I wonder why Microsoft doesn't respond to Apple's ads. Apple is just regurgitating the (mistaken) conventional wisdom. They're kind of doing Microsoft a favor, because they're marketing against where Windows was ten years ago. (And actually Windows NT had already solved many of the problems they're talking about.)

It's less about the venue and more on the net, and even more, a record that can be listened to in any order, at any time in the future.

					<outline text="First, I'd either do a deal with a registrar, become a registrar, or merge or partner with one. It's absolutely essential that the user own the domain that their feed is hosted at, so that, in case of emergency, they can switch to a different hosting service. If they don't own the domain, it doesn't matter how many promises the vendor makes, or how well-intentioned they are, an act of god could result in a blackout of a huge portion of the RSS network. It's irresponsible to host a large percentage of the net's RSS feeds at one domain. I would set it up so it's the other way around. My hosting service won't host your feed unless you own the domain. " created="Sun, 21 May 2006 17:05:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, it would have to be very easy to set up, that's why we'd bake in the registrar functionality. We'd even suggest a domain name if you can't think of one, something like oe913qvijj.com or zeu5ba5wv.org. " created="Sun, 21 May 2006 17:16:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reason this works is that the domain name system has already been set up so that one registrar can take over the registration of a domain. No need to invent a new system. Your feed goes where ever you want, whenever you want. " created="Sun, 21 May 2006 17:08:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then, once you have a domain registered, you can check a box (which would be on, by default) that allows us to host your feed for you. Sorry, you will have to pay something like $7 a year for the hosting service, but you get to act like a customer, and we will treat you like one." created="Sun, 21 May 2006 17:10:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, I'd allow readers to become customers too. When they subscribe to one of the feeds we host, if they're willing to pay a flat fee, we'll eliminate the ads in the feeds we serve them, and share the revenue with the people who author the feeds. I don't really like ads myself, so I'd pay the fee, happily. Some people want to put ads in their feeds, and for them, we'd offer a competitive price, with the added advantage that we allow readers to not have to see the ads if they're willing to pay to not have to." created="Sun, 21 May 2006 17:11:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's a little bit more complicated, but it's a sustainable business. When FeedBurner's users are up in arms when some media conglomerate has bought them out and is starting to redirect their feeds to Viacom and Fox properties, or inserting their own content alongside yours, like adding a idiotic liberal bedwetter post alongside your rant about immigration policy, or generally messing around with your ideas, we'll be above it, because you'll be able to opt out of our system any time you want. We won't be able to screw with you, because you'll be able to switch, easily, without our help. (If you've ever tried to get off AOL, you know why that's so important.)" created="Sun, 21 May 2006 17:12:56 GMT"/>

So I was feeling positive (see above), tried to install it, and now the computer won't boot. I tried re-installing, still wouldn't boot. I tried going back to the old memory configuration, and it wouldn't boot. Conclusion: the computer is fried. I got lucky when I called, the person I spoke with was only slightly arrogant. That's the problem with Apple's culture. They teach their people they're so much smarter than we are, but at the same time they design computers that require you to do these upgrades for yourself, and I'm fairly technical, and I managed to break the computer doing it. Bad design. In any case, I'm paying for it with my time today, I'm heading back to the store in Emeryville to see if we can't get this resolved. I feel really stupid for having bought this computer.

At previous events at best the webcasting worked intermittently. This time we have a couple of factors working in our favor. 1. CNET has excellent networking, so there shouldn't be a problem getting a high-quality stream coming out of the site. 2. We've had a couple offers of financial sponsorship for the webcast, so we can spend at least a little money. Now, I only want to do audio, video is too high a hurdle. If we can get quality audio this time, we can try video next time. I don't see any problem miking the room well enough so that at least the audio will be understandable for people tuning in over the net. Now, what software should we use? &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/05/11/scripting-news-for-5112006/#comments&quot;&gt;Looking for creative advice&lt;/a&gt;.

My Macs, even the super-high-end desktop machine, do exactly what they say the PCs do. Okay, I'm still using PowerPC Macs, but that's all they sold when I bought these machines, less than a year ago. And that's another thing not to like about Apple. They're always making you feel stupid for having bought their latest and greatest. I'd like to see Microsoft fire back with ads of their own about Apple's planned obsolescence and how much it costs, really, to keep up with them. You have to be rich to love Apple. PCs, even if the OS and apps are butt-ugly, and the viruses are just awful, are computers lots of people can afford, people who couldn't afford Macs.

Apple and Google are clawing at them, and winning. I figure they have a year, maybe two, to start having some products that make sense on the net and the desktop; and offer the media stuff Apple does, and solve the malware problem (and also bake-in BitTorrent). They're falling behind, seriously. It's not about marketing budgets, Apple and Google have great piles of cash too. That used to be Microsoft's security blanket. Not no mo. At the same time, one of these three companies might want to &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt; to make some friends among the bloggers. It's not in Microsoft's DNA, Apple sues the bloggers to keep them from talking about them, and Google is the most arrogant self-absorbed company to hit Silicon Valley since Netscape.
