				<outline text="The sparks &lt;a href=&quot;http://listics.com/20060731431&quot;&gt;start to fly&lt;/a&gt; over at Frank Paynter's. Hard to find a quote to pull, but he's saying publicly what a lot of people were saying privately, or in a veiled way (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/07/31.html#tooManyPitches&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). Mena Trott is a former competitor of mine, so I avoided saying things specifically about her pitches, but I imagine Matt Mullenweg, who was in the audience at the time, might have felt it was unfair for her to sell TypePad, when his product is equally commendable. This is very common in tech conferences, and one of the best reasons to keep product pitches off the stage." created="Tue, 01 Aug 2006 02:50:56 GMT"/>

					<outline text="BlogHer this weekend created a lifetime of memories. Women are different from men, here I am at age 51, and I've still got more to learn. They come in all ages, shapes and sizes and they came from all over the world. " created="Mon, 31 Jul 2006 14:30:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Women are generally more supportive of each other than men are, and they're surprised to hear this, although I've known that for a long time (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1998/01/01/menStaySilent&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about it). They still think there's a secret club of men, some sort of handshake that we use help each other rise to the top and run the world. Oh man. If only. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 31 Jul 2006 14:49:56 GMT"/>

I want men like myself to have a place to do what they do at BlogHer. BloggerCon is not quite that, esp for the last two which have been on the west coast. Both are user conferences, but they don't have to fight so hard for that at BlogHer. A lot of people who come to BloggerCon still think it's an industry event. That creates disharmony. There's a difference between an insider's conference, and an inclusive one. There's no way to have a blogger's conference that isn't a user's conference too, imho. " created="Mon, 31 Jul 2006 14:23:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The commercialism that bothered some wasn't in my way. That's not to say that they shouldn't tone it down next time, they should. &lt;a name=&quot;tooManyPitches&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sponsors should not be on stage giving pitches. It sets the wrong tone, and excuses speakers for doing the same. I was embarassed for some of the speakers who did the usual thing, told stories to set up product pitches. That leaves you with a slimy feeling, mostly about them at a conference like this, where the idealism was the current driving the people. At tech events it's different, where cynicism is the undercurrent. " created="Mon, 31 Jul 2006 14:48:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think it was Scoble who said he wished college had been like this. Amen. The ratio was great, probably 20-to-1 women to men. And these weren't ordinary women. They were (as Ze likes to say) hard chargers. I was really impressed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/&quot;&gt;Dina&lt;/a&gt;, the tsunami blogger from India, what character, what a force of nature, what an intellect.

So you got a great ratio, and they're smart and driven, but that's not all -- they're also bloggers! Which means I don't have to explain what blogging is. One of the speakers said that since she started blogging her friends don't ask how she is, they already know. Of course I've had that experience many times myself, but in this context, many of the people I talked to were readers, who understood what I have been writing in ways that my male readers generally don't. So they not only know how I am, but they have an idea of &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; I am too." created="Mon, 31 Jul 2006 14:28:08 GMT"/>

At a convention of hard-charging alpha females, she stands out, in so many ways, and we have much in common, as much as we are opposites. First, we're both 51, and basically happy with it. We talked about that. We're both from the Bay Area, but from opposite ends, she from Santa Cruz and me from Berkeley. But then the politics of both places are more or less the same, wacked out left coast political hippie. She worked to save New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina, and I went down to have a look post-Katrina. Neither of our work is done, but I have a strong feeling that the connection betw Grace and myself is going to create a path that lots of men and lots of women go down, working together, to make the world a happier, more fair and better-running place.

Or it could go the other way, it could be an activity for a group that already exists. An OPML directory of Berkman Center podcasts would be interesting. But a directory of podcasts from Holland or Canada, two hugely large and diverse places, seems an exercise without much purpose.

I'm not kidding. An example. Ask an adult how hard it is to not smoke. Most likely they will say that it's very hard. But ask a kid, and they'll tell you it's easy, you just don't do it. See how much sense that makes, but to the adult mind it's a mystery. Which is more work, smoking or not smoking? Obviously smoking is more work. You have to take a cigarette out of a pack, pick up a lighter, ignite the lighter, ignite the cigarette, take a puff, take another, tap off the ash (after you find an ashtray), take more puffs, then put it out. Compare that to the act of not smoking. You just sit there, and you don't have to do any of that. You can just sit there and do &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; and you're not smoking. It's so simple a kid understands it, and so simple an adult doesn't. " created="Wed, 26 Jul 2006 04:59:28 GMT"/>

Because we're going slow, and I'm sort of feeling my way through this, there is no way. I've started lots of directories, some that work, some that became disorganized messes. I've learned that the only way to end up with something good is to go slow. That said, I'm not going to be able to do what everyone wants me to do, so that will create the need for more directories. That's fine and good and right. There shouldn't be one directory any more than there should be one weblog. But if we do things right, the atomic units will be small enough so that they can fit into lots of different structures. So topics like New York or Minnesota podcasts are small enough to fit in.

It's still useful. BTW, when I wrote for HotWired, a publication that would surely pass any reasonable set of tests, I had a deal with them that they wouldn't change my writing without my permission. I had the same deal when I wrote for Fawcette, briefly. I'd imagine any other quality publication would work the same, so Google's rules are kind of naive.

Aside from being an efficient use of technology, it is also a non-infringing use of BitTorrent. From a legal standpoint, the more non-infringing applications there are, the weaker the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=mpaa+bittorrent&quot;&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; as it goes after BitTorrent, as they have attacked other P2P technologies. Having a major national candidate using the technology for non-infringing purposes helps strengthen the case, and while I have not endorsed anyone for President in 2008, I do thank Edwards for stepping up for technology. This has a lot more impact than the kind of things bloggers usually ask candidates to do, like blogging their personal thoughts, or have video bloggers follow them into the bathroom (sorry, that's a small exaggeration). Use of BitTorrent, esp by a Democrat, is the kind of thing that politicians can actually do to &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; the Internet. " created="Wed, 19 Jul 2006 19:36:53 GMT"/>

" created="Wed, 19 Jul 2006 15:07:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Right away, I figured that I should be able to find some new podcasts. It seems Scoble should be scouting for me and you and all the other people who read his blog.

					<outline text="Anyway, it just so happens that in the summer of 2003, three years ago, I was doing what I wanted Scoble to do. I was hanging with Chris Lydon, among others at Berkman Center, who was doing periodic interviews with the bloggers of the day. It was great stuff. Every time a Lydon interview came out, I'd copy it onto my portable MP3 device and take it on my daily walk through West Newton, and of course point to it from Scripting News, so you all could try it out too. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2003/07/19.html&quot;&gt;on this day in 2003&lt;/a&gt; Chris released his &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/07/18#a187&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with North Carolina blogger Ed Cone. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.skybuilders.com/lydon/cone.mp3&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; is still up there, you can listen to it today. The Lydon series is, in many ways, the first podcast.

I ask them to check the other customers in my building. It seems about four times out of five this really pisses them off, because I get a lecture about how I have to make an appointment, and give up a day of my time so they can have a repairman visit, why I don't know. So I usually say goodbye at that point, and try again. More often than not the second person is sympathetic, and we test the other modems in the building and (surprise!) find out that either they all failed at exactly the same moment, or there's some other problem that has nothing to do with the modems. Even so, before they're willing to investigate, I have to make an appointment." created="Mon, 17 Jul 2006 14:59:00 GMT"/>

I said that one of my neighbors would likely call in an hour or so, and &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; could make the appointment. I feel I've already made my contribution to Comcast today, as if they were a charity, by giving them an hour of my Saturday morning. That was all I could afford right now. So I went down the street to Starbucks to check my mail (I bet they don't use Comcast) and when I came home, the Internet was back on. I'm left guessing whether or not it was a random event, or if they decided, while they were waiting for someone else in my building to call, to see if they could find the outage themselves, and reboot some router or whatever.

The first thing is to use it long enough so that a clear pattern develops. This is important, because a persistent user will often figure out a workaround that makes something utterly efficient, and then it's just amatter of moving that (short) sequence of steps up the UI tree, so it's more visible to less experienced users.

I never said XML-RPC is better than SOAP or REST, or more perfect or pure, or better documented. I don't care if the others have better websites, or more advocates posting on mail lists. The reason I advise would-be platform developers to support XML-RPC is because at least for some developers (including me) it's so much faster to implement, so we spend less time creating glue and get to building applications sooner. I've learned that the sooner developers get to the fun part, the more likely they are to deploy. And if that's the goal, why not support it? BTW, I never said they shouldn't support SOAP or REST, in fact I often provide multiple interfaces to my would-be platforms, because I've learned that if you want uptake for new ideas, you shouldn't argue over small things like this, you should say yes whenever you can.

					<outline text="There's no question that Blake Ross is too young to remember this. So are many of the people working at Google, Yahoo and Microsoft, and all the startups that populate the land we used to call Web 2.0 (Mike Arrington, a bellweather, now calls it the New Web, which is fine with me).

					<outline text="In my talk earlier in the day, when asked about IE7's support for RSS, I confessed that I was now a Firefox user, and as before, with IE7, it was impossible for me to imagine switching. Too painful. Once you make the adjustment to way one browser works, adopting another seems difficult. I guess now that I have one switch under my belt, it would be easier to do it again. But to me, IE7 is the land of malware. Firefox still is relatively pain free (although the popups are starting to appear)." created="Sun, 02 Jul 2006 15:27:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What I hoped to hear from Ross yesterday is something like this. &quot;We understand why you and many others switched to Firefox, and now that you're users of our product, we hope to keep you as users. We know that malware probably played a role in your decision to switch, so we have put the following systems in place to deal with the problems, as they appear, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all over the world. Further, we know a lot of our users are on the Mac, and there are lots of ways to improve the Firefox experience for Mac users, and here are some of the ideas we have (insert demos of features in the pipeline).&quot;" created="Sun, 02 Jul 2006 15:29:38 GMT"/>

He's thinking beyond Microsoft. Scott McNealy, the master of Microsoft bashing is retired, replaced with an exec who (surprise) is focused on rebuilding their business by understanding what Sun can do for users. Bill Gates, the great software warrior of the 20th century, is retiring too, replaced by a thoughtful man who's crafting strategies to (guess what) create value for users and give them what he knows they want (by looking at how they're adopting competitors' products). In other words, if Firefox insists on a fight, they might find themselves fighting with no one, and impressing only the people who have hate in their hearts for people they don't know. Thankfully that's not a very large group of people, but unfortunatley, for those of us who use their product, that method does not, in any way, address our needs. Which is why I concluded that Firefox would leave us as cold, on our own and unfed, as Microsoft did. " created="Sun, 02 Jul 2006 15:32:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In business you just can't afford to be picky about who your friends are. If someone uses your product and supports it, even evangelizes it, you really don't want to blow them off, and certainly not in a public way like Ross did to me. But it's okay, I have thick skin, been around this block, dissed by the best. But in all the years I've been doing this, I've never seen someone who is scared of a simple user question succeed in this business. At least if Bill Gates didn't want to answer your question, he smiled, and lied. You came out feeling slimed, that's for sure, but you couldn't quite figure out &lt;i&gt;why.&lt;/i&gt; &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 02 Jul 2006 15:35:39 GMT"/>

Had he blogged an objection or correction, or sent it via email, I would have happily presented his point of view. There's nothing wrong with speculation as long as it's clear that's what it is. I make no apology for what I said. As a user of Firefox today (I wasn't then), to the exclusion of any other browser, I would like to know what features they're going to add, what bugs they're going to fix. That's what I asked him for here at Gnomedex, and I didn't get an answer. I don't care about their aspirations re Microsoft, that's where the software industry went wrong.

So at first I thought I wanted them to offer a 60 or 90 day free trial for my users, but that led to an even better idea. How about paying me to generate business. Seems I should get a big portion of the revenue, so I'm incentivized to build business for Amazon. Seems like a no-brainer. Voila! Business model. Aha." created="Sat, 01 Jul 2006 18:12:16 GMT"/>
