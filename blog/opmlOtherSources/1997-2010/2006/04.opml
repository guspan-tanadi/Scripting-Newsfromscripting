					<outline text="When bloggers get together, the topic of every session drifts into &quot;How do we make money doing this&quot; no matter what the original topic was. It's the same way with artists. It's so funny, because bloggers don't do it for money, and no matter how you try, the discussion never actually uncovers any ways to make money, it's just about how we need to discuss how to make money. It's a meta-discussion of a hopeless subject. Sort of like debating the need for world peace at the UN. Come to think of it, I bet that's exactly what they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; debate at the UN. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 30 Apr 2006 09:08:30 GMT"/>

What geeks do, in idle years, is discuss this, until the users find something new to adopt, on their own, then we catch up with them, and then do it all over again." created="Sun, 30 Apr 2006 08:58:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I promised I'd explain once and for all why it's hopeless to &quot;try to get the users&quot; to use social bookmarking software unless they're already using it. Here's why: I don't know. But I do know it never works. It's so bad that when I try to solve the problem (I'm a geek, so I fall into this trap myself, can't help it), I hack at making it easy and painless, figuring it's a user interface problem (if you're a geek you're nodding your head right now, right?) but when I make it so easy anyone would &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to do it, not only doesn't anyone else do it, I don't even do it myself!

					<outline text="I do know that Dan Bricklin posed &lt;a href=&quot;http://danbricklin.com/log/2005_01_28.htm#guiltlessness&quot;&gt;something like a law&lt;/a&gt; to explain the phenomenon, as best as a geek possibly can. Software that rewards you for doing something one percent of the time will get used (email, word processing, SimCity) and software that punishes you for doing it only 99 percent of the time will not get used (calendars, PIMs, categorizing stuff, social bookmarks). The genius of del.icio.us is that it falls into the former category, even though it appears at first to fall into the latter. " created="Sun, 30 Apr 2006 09:04:22 GMT"/>

A race between Gore and McCain would have been very good for the country, I felt then, and feel even more strongly now.

I have no idea how freeing EVDO will be, but I suspect it will be very.

Later in May I'm participating in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futureinreview.com/&quot;&gt;Future In Review&lt;/a&gt; conference in San Diego. In June, we're definitely having a Super Unconference of some sort, the week of June 19 (toward the end of the week for sure). We've gotten a huge number of offers of space in downtown San Francisco, I'm working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://marc.blogs.it/&quot;&gt;Marc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoisylvia.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Sylvia&lt;/a&gt; to sort it all out, and then we're going to make invitations to discussion leaders. There's a lot of energy around it, and it is preceded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://vloggercon.com/&quot;&gt;Vloggercon&lt;/a&gt; (I'm going to find some way to participate in that) and postceded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcamp.org/BarCampSanFrancisco&quot;&gt;BarCamp SF&lt;/a&gt; (ditto) and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnomedex.com/&quot;&gt;Gnomedex&lt;/a&gt; (I am a DL there). We're going to look for a big umbrella to put over all the events on the west coast in June, maybe the Summer Olympics of Unconferences? And then, after all that, I'm going to try to sneak away for a trip somewhere relaxing, and believe it or not I've signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogher.org/&quot;&gt;BlogHer&lt;/a&gt;, at the very end of July. At that conference I'll do a lot of listening and notetaking, and look for ways I can help the Hers. " created="Sun, 23 Apr 2006 00:11:26 GMT"/>

An all-inclusive, no invitation required, $0, everyone welcome, free-for-all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggercon.org/iii/newbies&quot;&gt;unconference&lt;/a&gt; of idea sharing and whoopee-making!" created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 13:15:51 GMT"/>

He recounted how, at a conference, Nelson spoke up, saying that we were all doing hypertext wrong. I've heard Nelson say this, and I know what he's &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1581891.stm&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;. His concept of hypertext, which was the original (he coined the term) was that links were two-way. The reporter said that Nelson was really weird and kind of rude. I took exception to this. Nelson is a visionary, and a teacher, in many ways it's his passion that's the fabric of the web. If he hadn't written his seminal book in the 70s, I wonder if the web would exist today. Later, I thought, how strange, we want visionaries, we need them, but we want them to fit some impossible concept of humanity. Someone should have passion without being too passionate. I wonder if people have really thought this through. I'm willing to cut a guy like Nelson almost infinite slack, because I so &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; appreciate what he has done for us, and for me." created="Tue, 11 Apr 2006 14:34:30 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I've heard Bloom talk about &quot;Advertising 2.0&quot; before, but it isn't until now that I heard something like a definition. Bloom fights his way through sentences the same way Bush tortures his words, so if you took a literal transcript of what he said it would be nonsense, but he managed to communicate the idea anyway. It's something I've said many times, probably to him, certainly to Adam Curry, and also here on Scripting News. Advertising is changing, advertisers have to learn to communicate to people who aren't captive couch potatoes. They have to say things people &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to hear, in the way they want to hear them, otherwise they won't listen. All the new electronic modes give the user the power to skip ads they aren't interested in. Advertisers must take this into account." created="Sat, 08 Apr 2006 23:16:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Luckily people want commercial information, they seek it out. So there is a role for marketing in the future, but advertisers are slow to adapt. Bloom is saying, rightly, that they must adapt. He says it in a more fear-inspiring way, but fear or no fear, they should listen to what he says." created="Sat, 08 Apr 2006 23:20:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I spent a bit of time with Bloom early in 2005 talking about businesses that might be possible around podcasting. He's found one of them. But he doesn't need and can't use the amateur podcasters in the new business he seems to be building. Why he continues to promote his company to user-content-creators is a mystery. His business is that of an Internet advertising agency, which is exactly what the last &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thinkinc.com&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; he and Curry started was, in the dot-com boom.

We all have different perspectives, but if you think about what it looks like from the point of view of someone who was reading this weblog in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, there was unbelievably huge growth in podcasting in 2005 and the first part of 2006. Think about all the experiments we did here in the early years, and how they didn't start getting uptake until mid-2004 or so. If one percent of the people in the US are using podcasts today, that's 3 million people. That's a lot more people than read this blog.

Not a good use of the screen, it ignores the fact that they can produce a new document for each user every time they visit. The print publication was limited by having one layout that had to work all day for every reader, and it had to fit in a fixed piece of real estate. The screen can be (vertically) infinite. I'd be happy to make another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longbets.org/2&quot;&gt;bet&lt;/a&gt; with Martin that eventually the home page of the Times is going to be a configurable &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews&quot;&gt;River of News&lt;/a&gt;.
