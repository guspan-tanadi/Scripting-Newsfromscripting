Once David Weinberger and Howard Rheingold told me that people wouldn't listen to my ideas on anything other than technical issues. I tried to explain that those kinds of barriers are exactly why I started blogging, because good ideas can come from users, and from people who &lt;i&gt;receive&lt;/i&gt; investments, not just from people who make them. It's that kind of thinking that the Internet is so good at routing around. Of course the intermediaries don't think I have the qualifications to talk about VC or friendship, but the fact is I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a technology investor, and I've done fairly well at it. I'd love to know how much money Matthew Ingram has bet and what his track record is on tech investments. I've won some, lost some, but so far I'm solidly in the black. Over the years I've gotten a return that any VC would be delighted with. So, even if you only want to hear from people with experience (which imho is a big mistake) you'd still have to pay attention to my thinking (or find another excuse, I suppose).

I think the next one in Berkeley will be at the Shattuck Hotel, which has an excellent Afghani restaurant that seems to always be empty. It's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotelshattuckplaza.com/HistText.html&quot;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; kind of drafty hotel, I wouldn't stay there (I have, one night, it wasn't an experience I'd want to repeat) but it's got the right configuration for one of these dinners, and it's very close to BART for people coming in from SF. People coming from the South Bay just can't get here for a 7PM dinner, maybe by connecting with BART they can. Crossing the bay by car at rush hour is just too slow. The people who came from the other side didn't get there until 8PM. " created="Fri, 27 Jan 2006 11:52:14 GMT" type="outline"/>

A reading list is more than a compendium, I think it's got to be curated the way an art director chooses paintings for an art exhibit (as if I knew how they do that). As a reader, I want the effect to be subtle. All of a sudden I'm getting much better info about gadgets, even pointing to stuff from those sources. But I'd never have thought to subscribe to the feeds. Luckily I know an &lt;a href=&quot;http://sndirectory.worldoutline.com/OPML%20Editor%20Docs/Reading%20Lists/Examples/Phil%20Torrone/&quot;&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; in gadgets and he did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sndirectory.worldoutline.com/OPML%20Editor%20Docs/Reading%20Lists/Examples/Phil%20Torrone/Gadgets/&quot;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; for people like me, people who dabble, who enjoy gadgetry, but haven't committed much time to the subject. So while it's great that you have an OPML of &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/01/26/theWomen.jpg&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; in technology (it would make a fantastic directory) it probably &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; a great reading list. But what do I know. This is all so new. Keep on writing and I'll keep reading (and commenting)." created="Fri, 27 Jan 2006 00:39:49 GMT" type="outline"/>

First, I develop in this environment because I designed this environment as the place where I wanted to all my development. That's way I thought of it in the 80s and 90s, when the kernel was in active development -- do it right so you don't have to do it again. It's got most of what I want. I wish there were a Linux version. I wish the back-end was continually being analyzed for performance improvements and bug fixes. I wish there were work going on to remove display glitches in the outliner. I wish there were a version in development that ran on the new Intel Macs in native mode. So it's not perfect, but there's nothing else like it, and at this point, it's the only current development environment I know how to develop in, and at my age, I'm not wanting to learn another. I put at least 20 years into this one, it works the way I want it to. That said, everything we're doing is with open protocols, and the code is all open source (GPL) so what I'm really doing is bootstrapping another defacto standard, like RSS or XML-RPC, and the apps that build on them (podcasting, MetaWeblog API). It could be that most people will eventually use software different from what I use. Programmers like to re-invent. But at least our work will be compatible, if we can avoid some of the mistakes we've made in the past. Hope this helps, Dan. I appreciate the spirit of your questions." created="Thu, 26 Jan 2006 21:23:27 GMT" type="outline"/>

There really isn't anything for a two-person-only public discussion. If we did it in a blog post with comments there would be all kinds of extra noise from people in the (put on your Mick Jagger accent now) critics section. First updating FeedDemon is Nick Bradbury's job not mine. I needed a platform for improvements to aggregators, the only way I can get people to go where I want to go is by doing it first and making it popular. Reading lists are the big shift. And, yes we do need some major improvements in the blogging platform most people use. It's been totally stagnant for almost four years. It's all so stuck. Now if Matt Mullenweg would do everything I asked (as if he didn't already have a full plate) there would be no need for me to do any work here. But that's not the way it works. And about improvements below the system.compiler table, that's exactly where I don't want to go. I worked under there for many many years, but the C development environment I worked in is dead now (THINK C) and the replacements (imho) suck. So what remains to be done there must be done by younger people. I'm fully capable of fixing stuff above that level, and I've been doing so quietly for months. Every time I tell you to update opml.root you're getting one or more of those fixes. Keep digging Dan, I like your style, and let's continue this discussion when we get some better tools for two-person public discourse." created="Fri, 27 Jan 2006 00:14:42 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="An important point not to miss: weblogs are publications. Bloggers are therefore publishers. Any innovation that comes from blogs comes from publishing. The reason the distinction is important is that publishers have a fundamentally different view of the world than tech companies. I'm still working on trying to characterize it. One thing is for sure, the tech industry takes a dim view of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/20/rss-came-from-the-publishing-industry-2/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; kind of thinking. Why? They look at publishing as &quot;user generated content&quot; and authors as &quot;the long tail&quot; (with them as the head of course). They see themselves as the makers of the money, and us as the laborers of love. That for sure is a flawed way of viewing the world, defintely a loop the tech industry is in, one that the publishing industry should not continue to support.

No flashy graphics, and I don't miss them. I know, some people think podcasting is about the eye candy, but I'd much rather have an executive summary I can skim, and then go right to the audio.

Instead, the consensus developed around the RSS that the New York Times used, and last time I checked they were in publishing, not technology. But there's an interesting question buried one level deeper, is the publishing industry the new technology industry? Are they doing better technology than the old technology industry? In the case of RSS, there's absolutely no doubt -- they are. Yahoo and Microsoft are following them, and that's the smartest thing any tech company can do. Google thinks they're the tail wagging the dog, but they may figure out that fighting the consensus isn't in their interest. &lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/01/21/monkey.gif&quot; width=&quot;120&quot; height=&quot;98&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named monkey.gif&quot;&gt;Kevin himself once was a consensus-fighter, but wisely now has seen that his interest is in making users happy, not in undermining their will.

MSM has a place, but they can't ignore the pressure blogs create for them to be more disciplined and to work harder to report what's happening instead of reporting conventional wisdom. The profession of journalism has gotten lazy, preferring to report controversy on issues where there is only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/sciencespecial2/index.html?excamp=GGGNintelligentdesign&quot;&gt;idiocy&lt;/a&gt; and not a meaningful debate over facts. This has led to a political meltdown in the US, with a major city in ruins and more and more of our spending happening in a faraway country of little significance to our interests. The press even admits culpability, and yet we still debate whether bloggers are right or wrong in predicting their demise. Well, I don't know who predicted it, but as I've said many times here they don't seem to need anyone's help in their aspiration for oblivion, they seem to be doing just fine on their own.

He's totally correct about the difference between Radio and the (newer) OPML Editor, where your data is stored in XML files in the filesystem and then is upstreamed to the centralized server. Upstreaming in Radio is still more powerful than the OPML Editor's, but there are tons of advantages to keeping all your data in OPML files. You're protected against database crashes (but filesystems can crash too). And you can use other XML-generating tools to create content and flow it through the same backend that the OPML Editor uses. Users don't have to be aware that all this is going on, the defaults are set up so that it &quot;just works,&quot; but having things be so open means we have more options as we go forward.

I'd also like to see a Flash user interface (maybe Kosso can do this).

Interesting that, according to Boutin's notes, Schmidt issued a non-denial denial on whether they're making a PC. Me, I don't think it's necessary that they do that, but I do think it's necessary that they protect their rear by keeping users happy with search. Microsoft doesn't overwhelm smaller competitors by bundling, that's just a tactic, a distraction. Microsoft wins by doing the 2.0 upgrade to their competitor's meat and potatoes.

The mail-reader type RSS reader has a few advantages over a web browser for reading blog and news paper feeds. 1. You can read offline. 2. If it's in an emailer you can easily forward posts to friends via email. 2. You see the last 100 items (configurable) where the blog might only show you 5 when viewed in a web browser. And it has an advantage over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews&quot;&gt;River of News&lt;/a&gt;, for blogs where you want to be sure not to miss a single post even if you're online intermittently. Some people need both forms of readers. It's like the difference between a spreadsheet and database. Both are good for numbers, but they're good for different things.

Out of the thousands of posts here in the last year, there may have been a dozen about that issue. But every comment is repeated and amplified, and believe me, I know it. Anyway, I'm having fun -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.opml.org/2006/01/01#a500&quot;&gt;today's project&lt;/a&gt; was the coolest little gadget I've done in a long time. Picture-casting! The bang per line of code was just amazing. And don't miss that that's largely because the Flickr people are following their heart so well. Some business guys might have said that their brilliant support of RSS serves no purpose. But it made my little hack possible in about 1 hour beginning to end. That's a sign of some really good work, on their part. This is what I like the most, people working together, and you know, developers and users partying together. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 01 Jan 2006 21:19:15 GMT" type="outline"/>
