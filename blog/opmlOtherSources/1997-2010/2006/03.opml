The guy from Amazon apparently asked Scoble to cut the bullshit and tell him why he should be interested in blogs. If I had been there I would have said that blogging is now an expected channel of communication with at least some customers, with developers and the press. Amazon has customers, and presumably wants more. And they have a developer pitch too, and they have stories they want to communicate to the press. So if some of the people you want to reach like to receive information via RSS and blogs, why would you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to provide it? To me, asking why you should use blogs is like asking why you should answer the phone. It might be a customer, a developer who wants to use your services, or a reporter who wants to write about the company. Your competitors answer the phone, so you should too.

I don't plan to, although Murphy's Law says anything that can go wrong will go wrong. My plan is to stop as soon as the end of this year, maybe earlier. I want to get some things done first. And in the meantime, I've been getting some intriguing offers now that people know there's an end to this weblog. I like that very much. Marc Canter &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/03/keeping-it-fresh&quot;&gt;wishes&lt;/a&gt; the software industry would clone the ideas that were in Radio 8, which shipped over four years ago, and speaks as if I had already retired. Not true. And the codebase of Radio 8 is largely GPL now (we could probably GPL the rest of it, need-be). I want to build a developer community around it. Marc, how about we work together, instead of giving up, let's show em how it's done! There's still time, Murphy-willing." created="Fri, 31 Mar 2006 02:25:02 GMT"/>

Anyone who believes that it's &lt;i&gt;conceivable&lt;/i&gt; is someone who hasn't got the most basic clue about how software development works. It's akin to believing that all the US troops in Iraq could come home for the weekend and then on Monday all be back in Iraq fighting the insurgents. That much code movement just isn't possible. It's almost for certain that that much code wasn't rewritten in the transition from XP to Vista and that's already &lt;i&gt;taken five years.&lt;/i&gt; You gotta understand it's not just how much time it takes to write the code, it's got to get stabilized too. So if you were to write an operating system from scratch (or 60 percent from scratch) today, you could expect to get some use from it in 2011, maybe. But not with an installed base like Windows and its out-the-door rate for new machines. It would be completely diseconomic, the support costs would be astronomical, even if any users would be willing to use the damned thing, because it wouldn't run any of their software. Microsoft is learning, as we all are along with them, that you just can't do major overhauls of Windows anymore. The only way a new OS is going to bootstrap is with a whole new environment, perhaps on the XBox or maybe Second Life will be the new operating system for this century. It takes a lifetime to build the momentum behind an OS. " created="Sun, 26 Mar 2006 00:49:29 GMT"/>

Like being able to see the seating chart before making the flight choice. This way I can find out if a flight has some empty seats, and guess if they're empty now they might still be empty on travel day. I know, it's a crap shoot, but look at it this way, if there are no seats available now, I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; the flight will be full. The second must-have feature is the ability to say &quot;give me results on one day on either side of this day.&quot; Which means if I have some flexibility on when I travel, if there are some better choices, a cheaper flight or a more humane time (I hate red-eyes, won't do one unless I'm traveling overseas, when they're unavoidable) I would choose to travel a day earlier or later.

Then, if you have the chutzpah, walk up to people and ask if they could give you a ride. This gives you a chance to size them up and it's hard to say no to a person, where it's easy to drive by a guy on the side of the road. Also people feel better after a little rest, and are more likely to give you a chance. " created="Sat, 25 Mar 2006 15:46:21 GMT"/>

Their web conference in Las Vegas didn't make much of an impression in the blogosphere. My guess is that they just went with safe bloggers, and if you go for safety you might as well not do it at all. Now, if they had come to us and said, what could you do with the resources we're going to put behind this conference, could we have created some lasting value? Without a doubt. How many millions of dollars did they spend on Mix 06? I'd have gone looking for a college classroom building we could use during spring break, and put participants up in Motel 6, Best Western and Hampton Inn (and pay their airfare and incidentals). One space for podcasting. One for blogging. One for APIs. And so on. Add 1/3 Microsoft people so they can absorb the culture. And do a hack-a-thon, something that's definitely part of MS culture (they were doing them as far back as the 80s). But today they have strict rules about who controls what is said.

At the Stanford one we talked about coverage of City Hall, which he pointed out was a problem, as professional journalism was retracting, it was leaving civic politics uncovered. I may have pointed out, probably did, that the people can fill in and increase coverage of civic politics. I vaguely recall that Markoff was unconvinced. But as time has passed I've become more sure this is the answer, and that the respective role of professional and amateur is that of editor and reporter, teacher and student, coach and player.

The pros have often erred by being dismissive of the bloggers, but maybe we're getting past that. They now tend to see the problem as economic -- that Craig's List is eating into their revenue. But there's a balancing opportunity. Some, perhaps not many, of the people reading Craig's List, share the passion for informaiton and democracy that a good idealistic reporter does, and will do it for love, not money. I believe the vast amount of editorial writing will be done for no money.

I thought the bridge was almost finished, but not nearly so. It won't open until 2014, according to the plan, which doesn't really exist, yet (even though construction is quite far along). The original plan called for the bridge to be completed by 2004, but politics interfered. But it wasn't rational politics, about where the most resources go, it was about esthetics.

Some people like Python, some like Ruby, and some like environments that other people don't think of as environments. Roml's hypothesis only works in a monoculture; sometimes it looks like there is only one development environment that matters, but there's always someone, who's doing something important, who isn't using the consensus platform. Some people thought CP/M was the only environment that mattered, but others insisted on developing for the Apple II. When the IBM PC ruled, there were still Apple III developers, and then Mac 128 developers. When the Mac ruled, some insisted on doing character-based DOS apps. And all through the 80s, there were people who developed on Unix, waiting for the day when &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; would become the consensus platform. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Behlendorf&quot;&gt;Brian Behlendorf&lt;/a&gt; used to argue that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/HC/Products/Dishwashing/Ajax.cvsp&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/03/14/ajax.jpg&quot; width=&quot;65&quot; height=&quot;118&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named ajax.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apache was the only HTTP platform that mattered, but if that were true, no one would be using any other HTTP server, today, more than ten years after the advent of Apache. The problem with Roml's thesis is the world is messy. The proof is in Amazon's toolkit, they try to do it all by providing examples for languages and even so don't cover all the bases. How much better if we had a standard language for expressing web services that was supported in all environments, so one set of docs would work for all. We do have such a format, but if they don't use it (they don't) it's value dissipates, and eventually will go away. " created="Tue, 14 Mar 2006 18:30:55 GMT"/>

I've sworn however that I won't ask any questions, I find the format so unconducive to discourse. I'm going to try to sit with my hands folded and only answer when called on (which I don't expect to happen). Okay now it's on to the buffet and opening reception.

I'd love to avoid having to protect my creative work this time. I think at this point, no one would argue that, for better or worse, I am the designer of OPML, and the author of its spec, and the developer of the app that defines the format (the last part probably some people would contest, but I believe most reasonable people would concede that). Yet, based on recent experience, there are people who think it can be &quot;taken over.&quot; I don't know if it can or it can't. But why not wait until after the OPML Editor 1.0 release ships to try to hijack the format. After that I won't fight with you. I probably won't even fight very much now. The fight has pretty much gone out of me. I'm feeling the stress of all the fighting, and age, and I'm satisfied that I have enough money to retire on now. Why not let me go, quietly and peacefully, I'll stop writing my blog, I'll stop developing new stuff, you can be me if you want, I won't be in your way. How about it? If ever there was a peace offering, it seems like this one must be too good to be true." created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 16:03:06 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Somehow I had been transported back to 1983. I was at an Apple event, and there was Young Steve Jobs, with a full head of hair, talking with reporters, but not in a huge auditorium, in a room that looked like a high school gymnasium, kind of a user's group meeting. He was defensive, talking about the Apple ][, and the reporters were on his tail, hassling him, looking for defensive quotes to fit into what were sure to be stories about the death of his company.

He was young, in his early 20s, with an arrogant smile. They weren't winning any battles with the reporters, but I was just some old schmuck, he didn't have to be nice to me, so he wasn't. Didn't matter to me, I was on a mission. I wanted to tell him that it would all be okay, I wanted him to get the message to Steve. As proof that I came from the future, I told him I knew they had a new computer in the works, it would be called the Macintosh (I couldn't remember if they had decided on the name at this time) and it would ship in January of the next year. He corrected me and said they would have some news in February, not January. &lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/03/12/emerald_city_guard.jpg&quot; width=&quot;69&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named emerald_city_guard.jpg&quot;&gt;I smiled. I told him some more things that would happen in 1984, knowing this would not help convince him that what I was saying was real, but if he'd remember them, he'd know then that what I said about 1997, and the iPod in 2002 would likely be true and I was really a visitor from the future. He walked away, and a minute later a snotty security guy with facial hair like the guard in the Wizard of Oz came to escort me out of the hall. Apparently the young marketing dude thought I was a lunatic." created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 11:39:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The dream didn't end there, it dragged on and on, my subconscious apparently was interested in how life would work if all I had in my wallet were about $100 in cash and credit cards with expiration dates like 2007 and 2008. It was pretty difficult to make a go of it, as a homeless person with almost no money. The place I live in, in Berkeley hadn't been built yet, nor had my car, my cellphone didn't work, and if I could find the younger version of myself in 1983, even if I could convince him that I was a relative of his, he was fairly broke then and wouldn't have been able to help me out much. And then all the different people and places got to be too much, and I drifted off into some other place, or woke up, or whatever." created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 11:43:20 GMT"/>

Now that's something. Now I see things a bit more clearly, it looks like Esther wants us to think these are her ideas, and how inconvenient it would be to have the person whose ideas they really are, there, in the flesh, explaining how the stuff really works as she and her friends scratch the surface. I'm paying the $5000 to go to this conference, so I'm a customer, and I feel cheated. The real guy was willing to come educate us, for free, and the conference promoter said no. Yow.

					<outline text="And now Microsoft is doing it too. What's in it for them, I can't figure out. What about Bill Gates, who's giving the keynote, being interviewed by the Man himself, Tim O'Reilly. I've never known Gates to be unkind at an intellectual level to the people whose ideas he steals. He doesn't pay them very much, if anything at all (they never offered to pay me for the work of mine they've used over the years). I don't mind that so much, because that's the way it's always worked. It's this new notion that you don't need to tell people where your ideas come from. That's not only bad business, it's dishonest. Why the richest guy in the world needs to be so dishonest, well he doesn't, so I don't believe he is. He might try asking Tim O'Reilly some questions about where he gets his ideas from, when he's on stage with him at Mix 06. I won't be there to ask the questions, nor will any of my friends." created="Sat, 11 Mar 2006 16:25:13 GMT"/>

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unto.net/unto/&quot;&gt;guy&lt;/a&gt; who designed &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensearch.a9.com/&quot;&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/a&gt; at A9 was there, a product that at first I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/03/15#a379&quot;&gt;didn't get&lt;/a&gt; (and said so) and then got and liked (and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2005/03/17.html#When:10:52:49AM&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; so). Everyone likes to talk about the calls they got right, but unless you make mistakes, you never took a risk, so I prefer to make them, and then correct them, and I think this is a good practice. The second thing is the name of a company that a guy told me about after the talk. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediamelon.com/&quot;&gt;MediaMelon&lt;/a&gt;. Now that's a good name, and I don't know why. I guess I felt like eating some melon when I heard the name. Melon is juicy and sweet, but not too sweet. It's healthy and fresh, not something you eat every day. I suggested that as his company grew there would be people who would urge him to change the name, but I said he shouldn't. It's a fun name. Melons are cool. You don't hear about companies named after melons every day. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 09 Mar 2006 14:28:23 GMT"/>

I was introduced to the term by Andrew Layman, in 2001, who was then one of Microsoft's chief XML architects. At the time we were trying to get a complicated protocol to interop, and I suggested that perhaps it would be easier if we looked at a small subset, instead of trying to get interop across what had become a far-reaching protocol. So we came out with what we called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soapware.org/bdg&quot;&gt;Busy Developer's Guide&lt;/a&gt;, or BDG, and it proved to be quite popular.

There was a time, not too long ago, when a conference about technology would be all about Bill Gates. He'd be the elephant in every room, in the middle of every presentation and every conversation. &quot;What about Microsoft?&quot; has been replaced by &quot;What is your business model?&quot; Either they were going to kill you or buy you. They were the menace that was everywhere. This conference was different, even though it was held in a Microsoft office, they weren't mentioned (except by me, with irony that they weren't being mentioned) once. 2. I'm so tired of people talking about how their mother wouldn't understand something. I've been hearing this for 20 years, and it's sexist and ageist, and wrong and unfair, and how about let's get rid of this offensive idea. I'd never say that about &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; mother, who has a PhD, and is pretty smart. I certainly wouldn't want to encourage her helplessness! At one point I leaned over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/107416662/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Tara Hunt&lt;/a&gt; and expressed this sentiment. Then I realized that she's a mom, and said so. I wonder how many mothers were in the room and how they feel about always being held up as the paragon of cluelessness.
