Peter responded positively to my query, so we're going to meet on the 21st, here in Berkeley, to talk about the device. I agree with many of the things Michael says, but there are some I strenuously object to. And there are others I'd add to the list. I'll explain." created="Thu, 30 Nov 2006 14:57:48 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Since we agree that it should have built-in wifi capability, why should it have USB? USB may be a little faster, but if I can save money and space by only having one communication interface, then I'm going that way. I don't see myself pushing content from a desktop or laptop to the device, I see it downloading on its own over wifi. I do think I'm going to have to tell it what to subscribe to over the interface, the podcast discovery mechanism really has to be on a system with a rich user interface.

					<outline text="I agree that it's a good idea to stay lean and mean, but I don't accept a premise that says we have to make this work with less resources than Apple and Microsoft. Peter, Jason and myself are designers, not bankers nor are we manufacturers. That's why there are banks and plenty of Asian companies that can make devices to spec. We just need a good business person with chutzpah to rep us. I don't think there's any shortage of chutzpah between the three of us. Why can't we raise $100 million to make this baby? I know John Doerr's phone number. We used to be neighbors. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 30 Nov 2006 15:02:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One thing's for sure, if I have any say about this, we're going to zig where Apple and Microsoft are zagging. At the first sign of DRM, I'm out. It's amazing that they left this door open. The guys from Hollywood can threaten us, but my podcasts are free for copying, as are all their podcasts, as are all podcasts. This is a podcast device, so it has no DRM. Period. Non-negotiable." created="Thu, 30 Nov 2006 15:05:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another zig to their zag, which I think is a good idea, is a reasonably open design process. I don't want to do it completely open, because there are parasites out there (wish there weren't) so any really non-obvious ideas will stay off the blogs.

Go figure. Maybe I can do things with my Internet-connected Mac that I can't do with a settop box? Wes, open your mind, stop thinking about connecting PCs to TVs and think of computers that are part of a home entertainment system, and it'll all of a sudden start making sense. Even better, spring for a few hundred bucks and get a Mac Mini, and stare at the the back of it and the back of your TV for a few minutes and you'll see what's missing.

But putting the breasts down, they cook more slowly and the juices sink down into the breasts, keeping them moist. Works every time, producing a deliciously juicy turkey.

					<outline text="First, read this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/21/blogger-wars-how-jason-calacanis-gets-even/&quot;&gt;bit by Mike&lt;/a&gt;, who takes Nick Denton apart for daring to challenge some assumptions that Jason Calacanis has left out there, just aching to be challenged. " created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:06:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now Mike is wrong in so many ways, I don't think I'll be able to list them all, but I'll try." created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:09:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, there's nothing wrong with what Nick did. Jason is a public figure and made a lot of public statements about netscape.com, most of which weren't examined more than superficially, and as long as Nick discloses that they are competitors, in case anyone is confused about where he's coming from, he can say whatever he wants. I thought the question he raised deserved a straight answer from Jason, without the obfuscation that came from both Mike and Jason. " created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:09:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Did the experiment at netscape.com work? My guess is that it didn't. Why? First, for the obvious reason, people don't quit so quickly when their latest venture was a success. If it worked (and note that Jason doesn't say that it did) why quit so soon? Because there's new management at AOL? With all due respect to Jason, that doesn't make much sense to me. " created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:17:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Denton asked the only question worth asking, and backed up the answer with numbers. If Jason has other numbers, let's see them. I want to learn what worked and what didn't because I'm always thinking up new things to do with the Internet, and it helps to know what other people's experiences were. The new Valleywag (which Mike disses, and I don't think he's right about that either) is providing that new service, where the old one just focused on who's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucking,_Austria&quot;&gt;zooming&lt;/a&gt; who, as if Silicon Valley was some kind of Hollywood. I lived in Silicon Valley for 20+ years, and trust me, there's not much to report on there. " created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:12:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And Mike, isn't it good that Nick is focusing on business instead of the salacious stuff? Wouldn't it be nice to go to the bathroom at a conference and not worry about whether your sanitary habits might appear in Valleywag (true or not). Maybe Mike is protesting because the new Valleywag is getting a little close to TechCrunch? Nahh, couldn't be. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:15:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Note that Nick has more or less said he's aiming Valleywag at TechCrunch. So when Mike gives Nick grief for challenging a competitor well, Mike ought to be careful about that, because he appears to be doing the same thing. " created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:23:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And finally, I'm glad someone is digging in on these things. The more this happens, the more likely that bullshit is exposed, quickly -- the more careful people will be with slinging bullshit.

They're both great guys. Alan Kay once said the Macintosh was the first computer worth criticizing. Jean-Louis Gassee said that as the monkey climbs the tree, the more people can see his derriere. Mike is at the top of the tree these days, what he says matters. And I say competition is good, it keeps you on your toes, and no one loves you as much as your competitor. And I also say it's good to take a break once in a while, to get your thoughts in order. I love talking with both of these guys, they're smart, they're curious, and they learn. Both of them would be more than welcome at the Bronx Science for Adults. And I don't know Nick as well, but I suspect he would be too. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:26:42 GMT"/>

Yahoo has the same feature. Amazon makes purchase recommendations, but I find they're recommending things I've already bought from them, hardly very creative, and almost never results in a sale.

The next product I'll try is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=184316&quot;&gt;Belkin Pre-N wireless router&lt;/a&gt;, not for its advanced MIMO protocol (which would be hard if not impossible for me to use on my G4 desktop Mac) but for increased range. I'm not sure how an Airport Express performs relative to the other routers on the market, until now I've never really tried to get great performance out of wifi. Also looking for utilities to measure performance of local nets. So far I've mostly been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://reviews.cnet.com/7004-7254_7-0.html&quot;&gt;CNET's web app&lt;/a&gt;, however that's measuring wide-area performance.

					<outline text="Okay, I had bought a second Airport Express, because I wanted to experiment with piping music around the house from my desktop, so okay, let's try using it to extend the range of the Mini, which I was using as my wifi base. Well that didn't work, because apparently it can only be used to extend an Airport. The problem then was that the new Airport Express didn't work. After I set it up initially nothing I could do would make it show up on any of my computers. Every attempt to reinitialize it failed.

					<outline text="I prototype in Frontier, but we will deploy apps in LAMP-based environments (although I'm also interested in commissioning a port of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kernel.scripting.com/faq&quot;&gt;Frontier&lt;/a&gt; to Linux). What matters to me in choosing platforms is that the code be maintainable and the environment popular enough so that if we need to grow a devteam it'll be easy to find the people.

					<outline text="My track record is well-known, I hope, I've created many of the apps, formats and protocols that are the basis for what people call &quot;Web 2.0,&quot; in addition to pioneering outlining and presentation software. " created="Wed, 01 Nov 2006 17:30:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have some more ideas, some quite powerful, imho, and I'm aiming high, I only want to work with great people. I also invest in the people I work with, you'll learn new skills, and I'm a demanding boss, but if you stick with it, the rewards are great. If you meet most or all of these qualifications, send me an email with a pointer to your resume. Thanks. " created="Wed, 01 Nov 2006 17:30:51 GMT"/>
