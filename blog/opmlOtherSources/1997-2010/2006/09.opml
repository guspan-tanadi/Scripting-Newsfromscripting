I, of course, like. A prototype for this is a movie review system where I own and control my data. Today, I rate movies on Netflix and Yahoo, but I can't get them to share the data with each other, so they make recommendations without info the other one has. If I had a place where I kept my movie ratings and gave each of them a pointer to it, they could read it and I would control the data. It would be very easy to set up, the technology is no trick at all. The hard part is getting enough users to do it this way to gain critical mass. This is also the idea behind Edgeio and Marc Canter's People Aggregator.

The next step will be they'll find some American citizens who are terrorists, and Congress will vote that in time of war the President doesn't need to charge them with anything to imprison them until the war is over.

So they spent more money, but they did get $200 off for having to do this. I guess the Apple tech person said they probably didn't want to bother risking it continuing.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management&quot;&gt;DRM&lt;/a&gt; strategy of the iPod is getting in my way. Each iPod binds to one and only one desktop or laptop computer. Connecting to another is a no-no. That's why it comes up as a read-only device when you plug it into a different computer. There are ways to hack around that, by copying an XML file from one machine to another, but that's not too much help when the other machine is a few miles away, and aside from that, I don't like to hack around that way because -- dumb me -- I actually paid for this stuff.

					<outline text="So I decided to move the machine. It was time to do it anyway.

Nice stuff for a walk on a Sunday afternoon. Only one problem. When I plug the iPod into the desktop, the original one, the one it used to like, it now acts like &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; is a foreign computer! Want to reformat the iPod, the Mac asks?

					<outline text="Today is, in a sense, the three-year anniversary of podcasting. It wasn't called podcasting then, but all the essential elements of what would become podcasting were in place. A regular show with a theme (&lt;a href=&quot;http://kino-eye.com/2006/09/10/podcampboston2006-lydon/&quot;&gt;Chris Lydon&lt;/a&gt; inteviewing people he finds interesting), a feed that has those shows as enclosures. The enclosures are in MP3 format. And a small number of aggregators that could do something interesitng with all that.

					<outline text="When this became a juggernaut, almost exactly a year after the first Lydon feed, it desperately needed a name. &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/message/41&quot;&gt;Danny G&lt;/a&gt; came up with &quot;podcast&quot; and we liked it, so that was it, the decision was made, a &quot;rough consensus&quot; formed, and from then on we called what we were doing podcasting. " created="Sat, 23 Sep 2006 18:49:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now there's no doubt that part of the reason that podcasting took off then and not in 2003 or 2002 or 2001 is that there was an iPod and &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; was a juggernaut. People were interested in portable media, and the iPod had everything to do with that. So it made sense to relate this new art to the iPod, even though what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twit.tv/2006/09/22/a_cast_by_any_other_name&quot;&gt;Leo says&lt;/a&gt; is totally true, our podcasts work on things other than iPods. In fact, I wonder why Apple or someone else hasn't invested in making a device that is GREAT for listening to podcasts on the go, but that's another &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/09/22/scripting-news-for-9222006/#comment-10732&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; altogether." created="Sat, 23 Sep 2006 18:50:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Apple has a legitimate concern if you look at it from their point of view. Although I am not a lawyer, it seems to me that iPod is an excellent trademark, it's not descriptive, it's a made-up word, until Apple came up with it, it meant absolutely nothing. So, from the start, it was a defensible trademark. Then it went through the lifecycle that most runaway successes do, commercial interests try to take advantage of the popularity of the mark and name their products relative to Apple's, some leading to confusion, others not. " created="Sat, 23 Sep 2006 18:53:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think podcasting may create some confusion for the podcasters but not for Apple. No one confuses a podcast with an iPod, any more than car wax is confused with a car. And it's totally explainable that a podcast works on other hardware, by saying that the computer industry makes stuff that works together. To think that today's iPod isn't the leader in the market is to be in denial. So all competitors are able to play content that works on Apple's market leader. Emphatically, this is a &lt;i&gt;good thing,&lt;/i&gt; and I feel no pity for Apple at being forced to be open, which is what podcasting forces them to be, like it or not." created="Sat, 23 Sep 2006 18:56:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I guess my take on it is this. I like the term podcasting because it causes people to find out where innovation really comes from. Apple has been coasting on other people's work, as well as contributing their own, but they're not very generous when it comes to sharing the credit. I'd be inclined to work with them on this, and other things, if they would be kind to us and our creations. Instead Apple sneers at the people who gave them this innovation, and sends demand letters to members of the community." created="Sat, 23 Sep 2006 18:58:50 GMT"/>

But here's the rub, when I drag an MP3 file onto the &quot;Dave's iPod&quot; icon, in iTunes or the Finder, nothing happens. No file gets copied. I tried everything I could think of, honestly, so go ahead and flame me for being dumb, because I can't make this easy to use software do what it was designed to do." created="Fri, 22 Sep 2006 22:43:40 GMT"/>

I answered all the questions it asked, entered the long registration string from the back of the package, but then the OS refused to boot, saying that I had installed it too many times. I could re-enter the number (which I tried, same result) or call a phone number. So I called. On the other end of the line was a robot, of course I was talking to the same piece of software that already said no, so it wasn't a surprise when I got the same result. You've installed the software too many times. So I hit the O button on my phone. Nothing happened. I hit it again, and again. Finally a voice with an Indian accent comes on the phone mumbling so I can't make out what he's saying. I guess that he wants me to read him the number, so I did, and this seemed to make him happy until I got about half way through it, then the line went dead, and a minute or so later another Indian voice comes on saying &quot;How can I help you sir?&quot; So I explain, again, he responds, not mumbling, and we get through it, and no surprise, it doesn't work. He says that I've installed it on too many computers. I explain for the third time that I paid for the software, got it just that day, installed it on exactly one computer (which I might add, already had a valid Windows license, so they got paid &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt; for this machine). I guess there was something in my voice that sounded sincere, and they give the guys in India some discretion because he gave me a number, that I entered, it worked, and the software is running. Needless to say if the computer needs a fresh install of the OS I'm surely hosed. " created="Fri, 22 Sep 2006 16:32:16 GMT"/>

They weren't paying attention, if I didn't want to have a collision, I had to adjust my path. I couldn't figure out what was going on, did this just start happening, or did I just start noticing it, or what? I thought maybe it was the age difference, I'd always heard that when you get older you become more &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/11/06/ibecomeinvisible&quot;&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;, and in Berkeley, the average age is pretty young. But younger than Cambridge? Then, a couple of weeks ago, walking in San Francisco, I hit on what may be the answer. Cell phones and iPods. Perhaps people aren't as conscious walking on the street as they used to be? Listening to a really interesting podcast, engaged in an engaging conversation with a friend on a Bluetooth headset. If it's true, are people also walking into buildings more? Getting hit by cars? What's happening with the mortality rate of pedestrians?" created="Wed, 20 Sep 2006 17:51:17 GMT"/>

We take care of the other country's soldiers, our enemy, because we want them to take care of our soldiers. That's why two Republican soldiers, McCain and Powell say Bush is wrong, and the US must continue to support the Geneva Convention. To do otherwise would be grossly unkind to our own soldiers. So many Republicans are coming out against this, you gotta wonder if this isn't some kind of trap for Democrats, who are saying nothing.

When I link to an article, I start with the URL to the &quot;rich&quot; HTML rendering, and apply an algorithm to turn the rich URL into a URL that points to a &quot;plain jane&quot; page, one which renders well on a mobile device. For example, here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5345184.stm&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the BBC website, and here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5345184.stm&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly version&lt;/a&gt;.

Somehow each feed is going to have to tell us where the mobile-friendly version is. And that means, inevitably, using a namespace (creating a new one or using an existing one) to link from an item to its mobile-friendly rendering. Or so it seems to me. I could be wrong.

Okay, so I had a bug in some software and it was redirecting where it shouldn't, and because I was doing permanent redirects, once I fixed the bug there was nothing I could do to Firefox to tell it to forget about my mistake (or was there? is there some programmer's switch I can flip that tells it to forget about all the redirects it's remembering? that would solve the problem). Anyway, so I map a different domain to the app, as I did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/08.html#When:1:40:31PM&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; when I hit this wall, and I used that one instead. However, I forgot to change the domain for the cookie the app was returning. So I spent hours chasing down a bug in some ancient mainResponder code that I haven't looked at in this milennium, and therefore didn't trust, when the problem was somewhere very far away, in my work around for this new weird and programmer-unfriendly behavior of Firefox's.

In defense of Britannica, there is indeed an important difference, Britannica tells you who the editors are, and Wikipedia can't. When directly asked about that, Wales dodges. I feel sympathy for the Britannicans, and I'm embarassed that the people from the web, which is where I hail from, are so hostile toward the print folk. When Wales cites an &lt;a href=&quot;http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1399038,00.html&quot;&gt;accuracy issue&lt;/a&gt; for Britannica (calling it &quot;bad publicity&quot;), it's clear they did the right thing, when the 12-year old boy found the errors, they thanked him, and made the corrections. What else would you have them do? Have no mistakes? Oh come now. At the end of the supposed bad publicity, &quot;Lucian said that despite the mistakes, he still thought the encyclopaedia was the best reference book he knew.&quot; Bravo. The Britannica guy isn't as aggressive a debater as Wales, but when you look past that, there is a balance, you just have to find it yourself. At the outset Wales seemed to accept that both approaches are valuable, and you know what, he could have stopped right there. Yes, both approaches are valuable. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.&quot;&gt;QED&lt;/a&gt;." created="Wed, 13 Sep 2006 00:24:59 GMT"/>

The first link on the River of News is the most recent, but it could be a bit of sports news, while news of the stock market crash is two screens down.

I'm a big fan of his column, and the segment he does on NPR every Sunday. The podcast is an hour-plus of rambling, he's not a good speech giver, but no matter, his point was very powerful. We've long assumed that ethical behavior is an indicator of character, but wait, that might not be what's going on. Social scientists do experiments that show that under different circumstances, a person might not call the fire department when the room they're in is on fire (if three other people go on doing what they're doing); or might call it in (if they're alone). Same person, same character, different circumstances. He shows a lot of other compelling examples. So I giggled and snickered because other people did? Maybe so. Maybe I waited to find out how other people reacted before deciding how I would react. Once I read the column in Wired and realized that other people were parsing it differently (ethically, empathetically) I felt free to let my ethics, my empathy, come to the front. So, I think there's a lot to Cohen's thesis, having just conducted the experiment, informally, with my own behavior." created="Sun, 10 Sep 2006 11:29:29 GMT"/>

An example might help explain how the users feel. Suppose you lived in a small city of 5000 people, on a small street that 20 people walked by every day. Because of the way the streets are aranged, most of the 20 people are neighbors, people you know well, the kind of people you trust to watch your kids if you have to run some errands. You leave the gate to your yard open because there's a nice shade tree there, and you leave a bowl of fruit out because you want your neighbors to feel welcome as they walk by. Come sit a spell and visit, life is good. Maybe two or three of your neighbors come for a visit a day.

					<outline text="The initial discussion of the element was on 5/19/02, as part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/ideasForEvolutionOfRss&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; proposing three new elements: pubDate, guid and ttl.

					<outline text="In April and May of 2002, we were working with Streamcast Networks, the makers of the Morpheus P2P client on integrating RSS with Gnutella. The ttl element was the key that would allow the network, which consisted of many millions of nodes, to share RSS feeds that were hosted on servers that likely couldn't take the pounding such a network could deliver. At the time, Morpheus was trying to re-launch after being shut down by a court order. I learned a lot from their CTO, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2002/05/25.html#lec5d98153ae3d334c02c17010ad4ce05&quot;&gt;Darrell Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who I spoke with several times, at length, in the spring of 2002." created="Thu, 07 Sep 2006 14:29:48 GMT"/>

Suppose you have a copy of Gnutella running on your machine, and I have one running on my machine. My machine wants a copy of a certain feed, so it asks your machine if it has it. Your copy of Gnutella looks in its cache, finds a copy of the feed, takes the lastBuildDate, adds its ttl value. If the resulting time is greater than the current time, it says yes, I can give you that, otherwise it says no. If your Gnutella strikes out, if everyone it asks says no, it reads the feed from the feed's server. " created="Thu, 07 Sep 2006 14:36:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'm not sure what happened at Morpheus, but this was just before I got knocked out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2002/06.html&quot;&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, and I didn't return to UserLand after that, so the project with Streamcast was never completed. The ttl element, however, made it into the RSS 2.0 spec, later that year, and it's still there, presumably ready to be used should this problem ever appear. Of course, in practice, in 2006, there aren't many feeds that receive so many hits as to require this peer-to-peer treatment. The market went a different way, at least for now." created="Thu, 07 Sep 2006 14:39:59 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I have definitely noticed the traffic on the rivers slowly going up. One interesting phenomenon is that the search engine crawlers pickup up story headlines every day or so when they scan, and for some reason  they're highly relevant, so they often make it into the first page of links. Of course when people looking for information click the link, the story has long-since scrolled off the river. But these are probably the kind fo people who follow news, so they're gradually getting introduced to the idea, and word of mouth of course feeds it too.

Starting with chest pain on the east coast, a plane trip home, a drive up the hill to his Woodside home, and then being evacuated by helicopter to Stanford Hospital, where he was lucky to be when the actual attack came.

					<outline text="To keep my cool while listening to the story I had to massage my own chest and remind myself that I wasn't having a heart attack, although at the time I did actually have heart disease, and knew it, but I hadn't told anyone, not even Craig. Then two years later, I asked Craig over to my house, a few nights before I was going to a cardiologist. When I told him about my symptoms he urged me to go to Stanford Hospital, right down the street. He offered to drive me. I said no, I wanted to wait and do it the right way. Now I know how foolish that was. I guess part of you wants to be, if not free of the disease, free of the certain knowledge, as long as possible. When I finally went in for my checkup I didn't come back until my chest had been ripped open and four arteries from my leg had been grafted onto my heart, giving me at least four more years of life.

Craig was on my mind because I was thinking about a visit. I knew he was gravely ill, and that he couldn't speak. I imagined that I would do most of the talking, and what would I talk about? I would tell him a tale of his own heroism, a story I tell every young person I come to know, and will as long as I live, the one about Craig and the guy from Apple, how he looked him in the eye and told him in his Craig-like way, that whatever Dave wants to do is okay with him. I will tell the young woman or man how great it feels to be so trusted by one so wise, and that as long as they are true to their heart, they will have my support as I had Craig's on that day in 1997.

The new black MacBook shuts down on its own in the middle of my work. The original G4 laptop is still blue-screening, and my dual CPU desktop G4 is blue-screening more frequently (on average once a day). I'm seriously thinking about shopping for a new computer, a Windows machine, fed up with the awful Mac hardware. In the meantime I'm using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00017H7QW?v=glance&quot;&gt;old Sony Vaio&lt;/a&gt; as my mobile computer. The software isn't as nice as the Mac, and the screen is much harder on my old eyes, but, knock wood, it works and the Macs don't. " created="Sun, 03 Sep 2006 17:07:38 GMT"/>

Gandhi also said you must become the change you seek. Indeed. That's the pied piper thing. Doing what you ask others to do might be harder than you think, you can't find out until you do it yourself. Then your experience can guide others. Want more women speakers at tech conferences? Okay, have a tech conference, and make that one of your goals, perhaps your primary goal. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; have to do it. There are no shortcuts. " created="Sat, 02 Sep 2006 15:31:32 GMT"/>

However, the experience is different when you look at them on a PDA, they look readable and useful. It's a hard thing to sell, I've learned.

				<outline text="One sure sign of a bubble is the meta-ness of the excitement. How far removed from actual user experience is the euphoria? Is there &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; technology involved?
