It doesn't much matter what the topic is, as long as you get heard (sorry for the pun). To which I say, bleh, that ain't what blogs are about senors and senoritas.

I went to one yesterday, and sat down at three sessions, listened for a bit, then got up because I had no idea what they were talking about. Funny thing is I don't think most of the people at these events are technical, but they've invented a jargon that they use in fast-spoken sentences and I have no idea what the language means.

We're about the same age, and I thought of similar minds, until the subject got around to Bush and the war in Iraq. Phil lives in Utah, and is very Republican and very different from me. Now what I'd like to do with our differences is have a conference about that, and balance it, one Berkeleyite to every Utahan. Let's spend a few days, in Utah first, skiing at Park City. Pair up, a congenial older lefty like me, and a congenial older righty like Phil. Ride up on the lifts together. Ski down groomed slopes at Deer Valley.

					<outline text="My new Denon receiver is really tied into Windows, but because it also has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/370421023/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;HTTP interface&lt;/a&gt;, I can program it from my Mac laptop. That made me think how Apple benefits from the openness of others. Suppose Denon were like Apple, and made a closed box, then I would be pissed because I'd have to use my Sony laptop to control it, but I &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; use the Sony, even though I prefer to use the Mac. The idea of user choice isn't about good or bad, heaven or hell, it's really pragmatic. Being open creates opportunities for companies like Apple, it allows them to coexist with monopolies like Windows, to develop a superior product, even though another company has dominant market share. Maybe someday Apple will dominate, but that day will likely be a bad day for open interfaces because while Apple benefits from the openness of others, they themselves aren't willing to leave the door open for others.

The Congress is organizing across (as opposed to along) party lines. Yesterday on NewsHour, senior Republican Senator John Warner from Virginia sounded more like the opposition than a member of the same party as the President. It's a miracle to see discourse come back to national politics. We are still in a very dark period, but it's getting brighter. And once again the brilliance and luck that's designed into our system is saving our ass. John Adams and Thomas Jefforson hated each other after &lt;a href=&quot;http://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=0410800-00&quot;&gt;George Washington&lt;/a&gt; left office peacefully and Jefferson's cousin John Marshall had &lt;a href=&quot;http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/9.htm&quot;&gt;guts&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="Throughout the President's speech last night he expressed an idea that surely the founders, all of them, would have objected to -- the idea that the people in the room were doing The People's Work. No, that's not the idea. The idea is much heavier than that. The people in the room &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the people. That's why the House is re-elected every two years, and that's why the President has to come to Congress to get approval to go to war, and that's why, when Warner reminds the interviewer that Congress is the equal of the Executive branch, she can be forgiven for needing a reminder, because for the last six years, Congress has not been doing its job. It thought it was here to serve the President. That is even further from the intent of the founders. " created="Wed, 24 Jan 2007 17:02:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="No matter, the founders win this one. Right now the Congress is not only serving the interests of the people, they are acting as the people, and that of course is good. That there are so many candidates for President is a sign that the system is working. Everyone should have the guts to think their ideas as worthy of discourse. This is where the philosophy of blogging and the philosophy of the US are totally in synch." created="Wed, 24 Jan 2007 17:05:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Jim Webb, the other Senator from Virginia, a Democrat, gave an absolutely stunning rebuttal to the President. I stood up and cheered, tears running down my cheeks. This is the kind of person that the founders imagined would be our leader. By the end of the speech I found myself hoping that Webb runs for President, although I think it unlikely that he will. But he would make a good President. I haven't felt that about anyone in a very long time." created="Wed, 24 Jan 2007 17:11:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And also yesterday, lost in the State of the Union shuffle, were the initial revelations in the Scooter Libby trial. Fascinating, unexpected. The White House itself is becoming a circular firing squad. First the Vice-President is implicated by the prosecution, then Karl Rove is implicated by the defense. Who knew what when? Well it turns out there was a coverup. No major surprise, but it looks like it's going to come out before Bush leaves office. What then? Will there be an impeachment? In the atmosphere in Washington today, it's hard to imagine that the President wouldn't be taken to court for his crimes. And for the President, the court is the House of Representatives.

To be clear, what Microsoft did is absolutely wrong. If that practice were to escalate (and who knows that it hasn't) then Wikipedia would just reflect the views of rich corporations and individuals.

					<outline text="Please read all of what Jeff says, and consider it carefully. It is flattering to me, and like everyone else I like to be appreciated. But his point is right on. Columbus popularized America and deserves credit for its discovery even though Vikings had arrived here, by accident, centuries earlier, and did nothing with the discovery. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 19:08:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To me, I'd like credit for discovery of some cool stuff, invention of software that makes it work and content that makes it compelling, all of which are neccessary but not sufficient, because the new stuff also has to be demystified, and it has to stay easy to understand, so that rather than intimidate, it should invite discovery by everyone else. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 19:10:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't make credit an issue, other people do. When I said I want to celebrate not just ten years of Scripting News, but ten years of blogging, I got a pile of &quot;who does he think he is,&quot; as I knew I would. Well, something started with Scripting News in 1997, whatever you want to call it, I call it blogging. If you think I'm wrong, blog it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 19:14:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="That's how blogging started by the way. I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg000001.html&quot;&gt;discussion group&lt;/a&gt; here, and people would write there how wrong I was about this and that, to which I said -- you need to start a blog. I must have said that to hundreds of people. By giving them something to respond to, Scripting News played the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/02/0201_artificialreef.html&quot;&gt;role that a shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; plays to a coral reef. You can quote me on that." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 19:15:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I learned from the Frontier community that people will always do what I do, even when I did what I always wished other platform vendors would do -- telegraph the roadmap, clearly. When I would do that, other people would start to do what I was going to do, and then scream loudly when I did it. That taught me that if I wanted people to do something, I had to do it first. The Pied Piper effect drives adoption and builds communities. It's not surprising that the generation of bloggers that came after the the first generation said they hated me and were trying to steal my thunder. That's human nature. But they were doing exactly what I hoped they would. They blogged their discontent, and as a result built something much larger than one person can build, and then they spawned communities that eventually hated them, and on and on, ad infinitum." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 19:18:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I also know that discovery comes in layers, as did the blogging world. There are many levels of early adopters.

Davos, this year will have more blogging than it had in 2000, when &lt;a href=&quot;http://davosnewbies.com/&quot;&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; and I were (probably) the only two people blogging there. I can't claim credit for bringing blogging to Davos though, because my efforts didn't gain traction and grow. If blogging was meant to happen there, it didn't happen in 2000.

There are some aggregators (such as the ones I wrote) that deal perfectly well with either kind of item, so I know it can be done. Two of the earliest blogs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.scripting.com&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.robotwisdom.com&quot;&gt;Robot Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, both had title-less items. I admit they're not common, but it's good way to blog, and right now I'm not going to change, especially when the developers who are reading these feeds could easily adapt (and since they all came after RSS had this feature, it seems to me that they must)." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 16:48:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, that's the historic preamble. Now here are two ways to deal with titleless items. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 16:51:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Choice #1: The simplest way is to ignore items with no titles. Pretend they don't exist. This is so much better than displaying a blank line, which is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.wordpress.com/2007/01/22/scripting-news-for-1222007/#comment-39266&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; do." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 16:51:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Choice #2: Synthesize a title. Here's a way to do that. Take the description text, strip the markup, take the first fifty characters (or whatever works for you) and add an ellipsis (two or three dots). If you really want to be cool, back up to the last space, delete everything after that, and then add the ellipsis. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2007 16:52:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, there are likely to be some condescending and fairly nasty comments about this, and that sometimes has the effect of reflecting negatively on me. That's how those people stop me from helping, or at least how they have in the past, and it's one of the reason blogging doesn't work so well these days. If you take the way they express their opinons as reflecting only on them, then we can go somewhere. You have a lot more power than you realize. Me, I'm just trying to make things work better.

I just bought a receiver that has a built-in HTTP server, so I can program the stereo over the Internet. It wasn't the reason I bought the receiver, but you can imagine I was delighted to find that it was there.

Here's how it goes. We all contribute to a fund, that hopefully would contain a lot of money, say $150 million. If Bush resigns on the first day, he gets the whole $150 million. Every day he waits, the fund goes down by 10 percent, so there's a real incentive for him to act quickly. On Day 2 it's worth only $135 million. On Day 3, $121.5 million. And so on.

					<outline text="Here's an idea for &lt;a href=&quot;http://buzzmachine.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, who says, with the best intentions, that we need to measure the number of people reading news sources or listening to podcasts so advertisers can know how many people are getting their messages, so they know how much to pay news organizations to carry those messages.

					<outline text="As a &quot;consumer&quot; of news (or user of news, or just citizen) I am interested in knowing which organizations do the best job providing news.

					<outline text="Consider: When Anderson Cooper devotes his whole 2-hour show on CNN to the return of two children to their families in Missouri, that would add very little to the score of CNN. On the other hand, the Headline News channel, which repeats the top stories every half-hour, would score relatively high, because of the variety of the stories they carry, and the relevance of those stories." created="Wed, 17 Jan 2007 16:13:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There is a way to separate the human interest stuff that's clogging the air waves from hard news. When four climbers are lost on Mount Hood, for example, if we look at it dispassionately, we'd see that the only people who are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/affect.html&quot;&gt;affected&lt;/a&gt; are the climbers (who died) and their families. If you want to stretch it, other people who climb mountains in inclement weather might also have an interest in that information. But the rest of us are only getting an emotional hit from the story. We project ourselves into the situation, and think how horrible it would be to die that way, or to have a family member or friend die that way. It's not news, it's not conveying information that affects us, it's story-telling." created="Wed, 17 Jan 2007 16:15:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="On the other hand, there is information that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; news, that affects all of us, that has almost no story-telling to it. When the Fed raises interest rates, there's no story, but wide impact. The fact that many Americans don't understand how it impacts them, is perhaps itself a story.

So someone who tuned into CNN might get 45 minutes of the hostages in St Louis, and 15 minutes on the PBS interview with Bush, or Scooter Libby, or global warming. Or if you like human interest mixed in, how about a story about the Christian Coalition working with Moveon.org. It's a bit of a tear-jerker for sure, but it's also news. Or, why not interview some of the families of Iraq casualties? There's a real emotional rush, for sure, but it's real. Or if you really want to go for the gusto, show Iraqis as human beings, and help people understand that when an Iraqi dies in violence that we caused (or at our hand) they leave behind people who miss them, who grieve them, just like us.

We're making a big mistake if we accept the news about iPhone, for example, only from Apple. There are other companies already in this market. How about taking a close look at their products when Apple asks us to look at the category?

I took my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rexblog.com/&quot;&gt;Rex Hammock&lt;/a&gt;, who was in town for the Expo from Nashville, to Fry's in Concord, for a cultural exchange. When I visited Nashville a couple of years ago, Rex took me to a great BBQ place. &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/?q=1695+Willow+Pass+Rd,+Concord,+CA+94520&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=13&amp;ll=37.973162,-122.041798&amp;spn=0.089853,0.190029&amp;iwloc=addr&quot;&gt;Fry's&lt;/a&gt; is the closest we come to culture here in the Bay Area (I also took him on a drive up Grizzly Peak Blvd, the roundabout &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=fish+ranch&amp;sll=37.89236,-122.275257&amp;sspn=0.022488,0.035148&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=14&amp;ll=37.87404,-122.212944&amp;spn=0.044987,0.070295&amp;om=1&quot;&gt;way&lt;/a&gt; to Walnut Creek, with great views of the Bay and the city). Rex, who had attended the Jobs keynote the day before, suggested I might get one of their new fast routers. I took him to the part of Fry's where they had a whole &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnet.search.com/search?chkpt=astg.cnet.fd.search.cnet&amp;q=pre-n%20routers&amp;tag=srch&quot;&gt;shelf&lt;/a&gt; full of &quot;Pre-N&quot; routers, all of which were exactly as fast as Apple's (and cheaper too). This fact had not come out yesterday, in the rush of all the press coverage. To be fair, the router was almost an afterthought in the panoply of marketing that masqueraded as news, but it should have been mentioned, right up front -- there probably isn't anything special about Apple's product." created="Sat, 13 Jan 2007 16:46:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We have a lot of catching up to do here. Apple has received an unfair advantage from the press, and also from bloggers. I'm not saying that we should give Microsoft a free pass, because they still control who gets their news, and that's wrong, it compromises the integrity of every reporter that takes their offer.

					<outline text="Many companies have lost their businesses, and customers have lost a lot of choice because of this system.

The only way it makes sense is for them to think of developers as competitors. That's where respect comes from. When we get there, vendors will make products that we use, they will not be thought leaders, or gurus. This is what they demand in order for us to have access. But we're not doing them any favors by giving them what they ask for, and we're sure not doing any favors to the users, and to ourselves." created="Sat, 13 Jan 2007 16:51:45 GMT"/>

Growth is driven by choice. The Internet grew because, for the 80th time, it was the platform with no platform vendor. The Apple II won, the Mac won, the PC won, even Windows won, because you could install any software you wanted on them.

Apple didn't need any patents to get me to buy their system. I don't even like the company, I think they're brats, small thinkers. Even though I don't have to, every year I spend thousands of dollars on their products. That says all I need to know about what kinds of locks you need on users.

Moving video content around a house is something I've been playing with for the last few months, and I gotta say I don't believe Netgear has a product that works for most people. You need a file server for sure, but every TV set must, imho, have its own hard disk and CPU. I prefer the Mac OS and I'd love to get a few Seagate TB disks. Such a setup does make the TV a lot more expensive (today) but I think it's the only solution that actually has a chance of working. Pretty likely Gates is going to talk about something like this tonight, and his solution almost certainly will put a hard disk and CPU at every TV (he sells OSes after all)." created="Sun, 07 Jan 2007 22:23:18 GMT" type="outline"/>

But RSS doesn't have an inventor. It wasn't invented. Something else happened, something harder than invention, imho -- an activity that we don't have a word for in the English language. " created="Tue, 02 Jan 2007 16:58:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, let's try to figure out what happened, never mind, for the moment, &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; it happened." created="Tue, 02 Jan 2007 17:01:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Today it's very common for a news oriented site, whether it's a blog or a newspaper, or a company or government organization, television or radio network, library, candidate, political party, university, sports team, anyone with news and people who are interested in that news, to have a feed. There are quite a few formats, but RSS 2.0 is the most prevalent. " created="Tue, 02 Jan 2007 17:01:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, if you were to draw a graph of this phenomenon, plot time on the X-axis and level of adoption on the Y-axis, you'd see a rising function, maybe a few setbacks here and there, but for the most part, every year there was more adoption than the year before. " created="Tue, 02 Jan 2007 17:03:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But during the years that everyone argues about, at the beginning, there wasn't much upward motion at all. The &quot;invention&quot; of RSS, muddied as it was, by prior art, wasn't responsible for its uptake. Rather there were several significant moments along the way: support by individual publications, individual bloggers, then blogging tools, then a small number of aggregators and readers, then a few very large publishers, then a flood of publishing and reading tools, followed by a flood of content. And podcasting, which also builds on RSS, helped fuel the fire." created="Tue, 02 Jan 2007 17:04:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Some of this growth was organic, it was created by previous growth. And other leaps were caused by innovation, new ideas, and some by arm-twisting, or evangelism. It's in this area that my commitment to RSS was instrumental. If it had been left at the &quot;invention&quot; stage, it would be where many other XML-related technologies are today, invented, but not much-used. Something new was done with the cloud of content, tools, aggregators, and that allowed a lot more people to use it, or hear about it, or decide it was finally time to support it.

If you want to understand what made RSS happen, it's the innovation, evangelism and commitment that was behind it, not the invention, because I said before, and as everyone seems to agree, it wasn't invented. But we lack a good word for the other stuff, so sheez, what's the big deal if they substitute &quot;invention&quot; for all that? I've looked the other way. But to say I was the &quot;self-proclaimed&quot; inventor is just wrong, I just nod my head when others say it, because I'm tired of arguing. " created="Tue, 02 Jan 2007 17:29:10 GMT"/>

					<outline text="In 2003, when I was beginning my stint as a fellow at Berkman Center, since I was going to be doing stuff with blogs, I felt it necessary to start by explaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/whatMakesAWeblogAWeblog&quot;&gt;what makes a blog a blog&lt;/a&gt;, and I concluded it wasn't so much the form, although most blogs seem to follow a similar form, nor was it the content, rather it was the voice. " created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 21:56:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If it was one voice, unedited, not determined by group-think -- then it was a blog, no matter what form it took. If it was the result of group-think, with lots of ass-covering and offense avoiding, then it's not. Things like spelling and grammatic errors were okay, in fact they helped convince one that it was unedited. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sexyjazz.de/world/d2k/&quot;&gt;Dogma 2000&lt;/a&gt; expressed this very concisely.)" created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 21:58:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Do comments make it a blog? Do the lack of comments make it not a blog? Well actually, my opinion is different from many, but it still is my opinion that it does not follow that a blog must have comments, in fact, to the extent that comments interfere with the natural expression of the unedited voice of an individual, comments may act to make something &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a blog. " created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 22:00:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We already had mail lists before we had blogs. The whole notion that blogs should evolve to become mail lists seems to waste the blogs. Comments are very much mail-list-like things. A few voices can drown out all others. The cool thing about blogs is that while they may be quiet, and it may be hard to find what you're looking for, at least you can say what you think without being shouted down. This makes it possible for unpopular ideas to be expressed. And if you know history, the most important ideas often are the unpopular ones." created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 22:02:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Me, I like diversity of opinion. I learn from the extremes. You think evolution is a liberal plot? Okay, I disagree, but I think you should have the right to say it, and further you should have a place to say it. You think global warming is a lie? Speak your mind brother. You thought the war in Iraq was a bad idea? Thank god you had a place you could say that. That's what's important about blogs, not that people can comment on your ideas. As long as they can start their own blog, there will be no shortage of places to comment. What there is always a shortage of, however, is courage to say the exceptional thing, to be an individual, to stand up for your beliefs, even if they aren't popular." created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 22:04:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I sat next to Steven Levy the other night at dinner in NY. He volunteered that in his whole career he had never written a word that wasn't approved of by someone else, until &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenlevy.com/index.php&quot;&gt;he started a blog&lt;/a&gt;. I applaud him for crossing the line. I give him a lot of credit for writing without a safety net. It really is different. Comments wouldn't make the difference, what makes the difference is standing alone, with your ideas out there, with no one else to fault for those ideas. They are your responsibility, and yours alone." created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 22:06:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For me, the big rush came when I started publishing &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;DaveNet&lt;/a&gt; essays in late &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1994&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;. I would revise and edit, for an hour maybe more, before hitting the Send button. Once I did that, there was no turning back. The idea was out there, with my name on it. All the disclaimers (I called the essays &quot;Amusing rants from Dave Winer's desktop&quot;) wouldn't help, if the ideas were bad, they were mine. But if they were good, they were mine too. &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; what makes something blog-like, imho." created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 22:08:37 GMT"/>

					<outline text="First, of course, I've watched your show, and I admire your chutzpah, but I gotta say, I'm (obviously) a man and I don't think you treat men very well on your show. Myself, I do pretty well with finances. The only debt I have is a mortgage, for its tax benefits, I could afford to pay it off. I have always been a saver, haven't been in debt since my late 20s (I'm in my early 50s now) and I have health insurance, and home owner's insurance. I've never mooched off women. I'm pretty responsible, I even quit smoking and stayed quit. And I don't like the way you treat men on your show." created="Mon, 01 Jan 2007 20:58:09 GMT"/>
