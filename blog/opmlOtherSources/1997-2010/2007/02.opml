And unlike the entertainment industry conferences I'd been to, these people are not so commercial and not bullies. Later, I was told that the people who come to this conference are the people most like bloggers in public media, but I also met a few execs, including the COO and a couple of board members of NPR, and they were excited too.

					<outline text="To say we, the bloggers, were well-received, would be an understatement. We were treated like stars and gurus, our words listened to attentively, our ideas received enthusiastically. What a joy and what a contrast to the tech industry, where bloggers are mostly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/03.html#makingMoneyWithAdsNotMuchLonger&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; as a business model, not a source of ideas." created="Wed, 28 Feb 2007 18:16:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, the post-conference emails are just beginning to be responded to, and I expect lots of good stuff to come from this first visit. There's talk of doing a BloggerCon for public radio. I'm helping the NewsHour people make their podcast feeds a little more useful. Most important I want to work on a vital exchange of ideas and perspectives across the pro-amateur boundary. I want them to teach us how to produce content up to their standards, so bloggers, podcasters and vloggers who want their work to air on NPR and PBS will know what they're looking for. And I want our methods to gain adoption in their space. An example is the way the Scripting News community researched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stories.scripting.com/2007/02/27/macbookSoundWoes.html&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt; with audio on MacBooks yesterday. This open research method can be applied equally well for public media. You just have to let us know what you're interested in. I promised to help them boot up a research blog, following this model." created="Wed, 28 Feb 2007 18:10:19 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I wonder if, with the benefit of hindsight, the music industry wishes it had done something different with Napster.

					<outline text="An example of a new deal -- tolerate the sharing low-rez scans of the music. Set a bit-rate that's semi-legal, and enforce, with Napster, the rule that anything scanned at a higher rate will immediately be removed, unless it can be shown that the artists permit redistribution of high scan-rate versions. I think even the indies would have gone for this, especially at the time. " created="Wed, 28 Feb 2007 17:32:41 GMT"/>

Anything would be better than the fractured world that's being re-created now. Wouldn't it be better for everyone if users knew they just had to go to YouTube to find what they're looking for, knowing that it would lead them to a purchasing experience if they want one." created="Wed, 28 Feb 2007 17:42:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It seems the entertainment industry doesn't recognize the power of its users.

He blames bloggers and podcasters for the demise of professional media, as if somehow we're responsible for the endless coverage of Anna Nicole Smith on cable news, for Judith Miller's complicity with the Bush White House, for the shameless way the press, without notable exception, hounded Howard Dean out of the 2004 presidential race. &lt;i&gt;Of course&lt;/i&gt; we're not responsible for any of those horrors, and Keen should, somewhere in this book, consider that blogging might be an attempt to solve some of the problems caused by a vacuum of responsible high-integrity journalism. I think, for the most part, bloggers would be happy to have real journalists at work at the professional pubs. I want more Woodward and Bernstein, more of the kind of investigative journalism done by the SF Chronicle following steroids in baseball, more reporters who are willing to go to jail for their principles, but I'm usually disappointed. There are countless examples in Keen's book where he credits the pros for doing thorough work, when their work is anything but thorough. (And he owes a huge apology to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wolf_(journalist)&quot;&gt;Josh Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, a blogger who is in jail right now, for exactly the causes Keen extols.)" created="Tue, 27 Feb 2007 21:30:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, he says over and over that Craigslist is responsible for undermining the business model of newspapers. But he doesn't ask why the newspapers failed to embrace the Internet, making Craigslist necessary. What's the lesson here? That the news industry is allowed to hold back progress? To what end? Sure Wikipedia has problems, but it also responds much faster than the older encyclopedias, and while I agree it's wrong to dismiss experience and scholarship, it's equally wrong to dismiss knowledge when it occurs in a person without the trappings of academia. The solution isn't to call the amateurs names, the new world requires thought, and Keen does not provide any." created="Tue, 27 Feb 2007 21:34:21 GMT"/>

I was ready for a work that would inspire a thoughtful response, because I like Andrew, at a personal level, but this book is beneath criticism. Back to the drawing board.

Because of the first change, we have to change the order of the feed to reverse-chronologic. The result of this changes is that the size of the feed decreases, and the time spent processing it on updating decreases, and the cost of running the server decreases.

Their challenge has always been to find a way to harness our power, to make them smarter. When Microsoft has achieved its mission it's been because they did this better than anyone else. Of all the tech companies this is their area of strength, more than Apple, more than Google, Microsoft is of the people, not such an ivory tower, although in recent years, it's looking and acting more like all the other tech companies." created="Fri, 16 Feb 2007 15:19:30 GMT"/>

Over time, people like Gartenberg and Jon Udell (another recent hire from outside) succumb to the logic of their law, and communication starts becoming one-way and therefore ineffective. But for now we have someone inside Microsoft who speaks our language, who doesn't rush to explain everything to us about how things work inside their firewall (as if we care, or should) and instead focuses on solving problems and leveraging opportunities." created="Fri, 16 Feb 2007 15:22:42 GMT"/>

They ran a series of stories, authored by Miller, that supported the Bush pretense for the war in Iraq. The stories were fabrications, the paper was used, its readers misled. They acknowledged that they did it, and even today they ran an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/opinion/07wed1.html?ex=1328504400&amp;en=c195bf93336a0269&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; saying that more discussion was needed at the time we went to war.

The idea of an HTTP server in a stereo sounds like a gimick, people say they get it but you can tell they don't because they can't put it all together to see that you could use a laptop (or a cell phone for that matter) to control the stereo. I think you have to live this stuff for years to see how exciting it is.

And maybe I'm wrong, in which case listening won't hurt, might waste a little time, but then we waste so much time worrying about who he thinks he is and why should you listen, that a little more wasted time doesn't seem so bad." created="Mon, 05 Feb 2007 15:07:35 GMT"/>

The idea that I could program my own music was incredibly enabling. People were talking about music in the supermarket and on the subway.

I went to one of their conferences and gave a talk, and told them how I, as a user, was rediscovering their product. To say they didn't want to hear it is an understatement. They called me names, shouted at me, held me responsible for their businesses. I tried to tell them money wasn't the issue, empowerment was. But they didn't want to hear.

I want to speak there, and there's a chance I might, but in case not, there are a few ideas I wanted to insert in the flow, after blogging, podcasting, and extrapolate towards what I think will happen in the 2008 election, and the role public radio can play." created="Sat, 03 Feb 2007 16:36:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, I'd like to offer hearty congratulations to public radio for doing such an excellent job of embracing podcasting. Their programming makes the most sense, imho, for podcasting, they have few of the licensing problems that commercial media have. As the Internet is used more to distribute content, whether streamed or via MP3, the role of the local broadcaster is diminished. There is nothing to be done about this, no point struggling against it. There's no way we're going back to the terrestrial broadcast model, the producers of the shows need distribution less and less, that's just a fact. In other words, there's some mopping up to do, and I think it will be done, and there is no shortage of controversy here, but that's not what I came to talk about. " created="Sat, 03 Feb 2007 16:38:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The political system in the US has yet to make the big transition that the Internet will cause. The candidates are still raising huge amounts of money to buy time on the commercial TV and radio networks. All this activity basically routes around non-commercial public media, which may play a small role in introducing the candidates to sources of money, but of course it doesn't get a dime of the political advertising bonanza. However, this is &lt;i&gt;good,&lt;/i&gt; because public radio, unlike commercial media, doesn't have the conflict of interest that comes with it. As with podcasting, public radio can be the first to embrace the new model. There's nothing in the way. " created="Sat, 03 Feb 2007 16:41:41 GMT"/>

Instead of candidates putting up a superficial image that has nothing to do with who they are or what their policies will be (famously, Bush's promise of no nation building, an example) the voters decide what their issues are, and then go shopping for a candidate. I believe the entire political system is going to re-form around this simple idea. It's like the New Hampshire or Iowa process, gone national. The voter is the decider, the politician a vendor, the voter is the policy-maker, the politician an implementor. The voter is a customer, and the voter is a thinker and organizer. In this mix, money plays a smaller role than it does today. Maybe even an &lt;i&gt;unimportant&lt;/i&gt; role. This is my hope, but we'll see how it plays out." created="Sat, 03 Feb 2007 16:57:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What this means for public radio is that it should be seeking more programming from today's listeners, because that's where the new ideas will be coming from. The staff should do more facilitation, editing, training, outreach. The voice of public radio should be, surprise, the public. I believe this will happen whether or not public radio embraces this concept, but as with podcasting, it works so much better when we work together. " created="Sat, 03 Feb 2007 16:46:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I am not advocating an instant change, nor is one possible or even desirable. My weekly listens include many public radio shows (there would be more if shows like Fresh Air and Morning Ediiton were available as podcasts). I love the flashback shows, and story of the week. But the most futuristic of the public radio podcast offerings is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4538138&quot;&gt;This I Believe&lt;/a&gt;, the show that gives a voice to the listener, and that's all it does.

					<outline text="Now, if I can give a speech at the conference, I'll elaborate on these thoughts. If not, this is my stake in the ground.

It was the answer to the now-defunct Comdex trade show, where you had to walk through miles of old boring stuff to find the new cool stuff. The goal of Demo was to turn it all around, and have the products move around and you get to sit in your seat drinking coffee, munching on M&amp;M's and snarking and snickering with the people to the left and right. Back in the old days no one paid to present, for better or worse it was Stewart Alsop's judgment that determined who presented. I have some ideas how the format can evolve, considering that it is almost 20 years later, and Comdex is long-gone. No matter what, it should be fun to help Mike and Jason put this together.
