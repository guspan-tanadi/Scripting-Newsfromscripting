Not saying it isn't true, but how many times, and different ways have you read this story. But if Google were to fund the reporters, as the author suggests, what happens when Google's fortunes decline? Tech is a cyclic industry. What goes up must come down. Count on it.

No sales people got in the way, I also picked up a copy of Al Gore's new book, went upstairs, made the purchase with my membership card, got my parking ticket validated, and got out quickly with what I came for and one optional purchase, got in the car, no jacket (which was the primary goal for the stop at Bay St)." created="Sun, 27 May 2007 23:39:39 GMT"/>

There's always been too much made of death in the tech world, in fact newspapers are still published, you can pick one up at any airport or train station. Many people have them delivered at home. We often go to newspaper websites for the news. Sure, there are problems, and the world is changing, but imho, we'll all do better if something called the San Francisco Chronicle continues to be published, even though the form of the newspaper will certainly change in the future. It would be a waste of a tradition, of a good coral reef, if newspapers really died. They need to change, and imho, when that change happens, we will safely be in the era of Web 3.0.

Part two is more fun -- I'd like people to talk about some crazy idea they have, ideas they don't think will get funded, but products they'd like to see nonetheless. Companies don't solve all the problems out there, some things get created with little thought of creating a company, but they end up creating opportunities for companies -- things like folksonomies, syndication, digital photography and video, blogging, podcasting. Personally, I'd like to see us make archving really work, so what we create on the web may outlive us. If there's a Hemingway or a Woody Allen out there today, they're probably creating for the Internet. How will we make sure their work survives? And of course that's just one idea. And some ideas never become commercial yet still have a potentially positive effect on our lives. " created="Mon, 14 May 2007 02:43:37 GMT"/>

I noticed that a fair number of the presenters were from his portfolio companies. He may have even joked about how he was using his power to tilt the table in favor of his investments.

					<outline text="Who loses when tech conferences lack integrity? I'd argue that the Valley loses. It's this kind of inbreeding that kept them from seeing what they call &quot;user generated content&quot; until 2004 or 2005, when it had been growing along with the web since its inception in the early 90s. An industry that prides itself on always being at the forefront had fallen far behind the leading edge. And even today, they don't understand it -- they call it &quot;new media&quot; -- and invite people who make them feel safe, they don't want to hear from people who challenge their assumptions. That's not a good way to design a conference, people come home feeling bored with the same-old same-old, when there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; new experiences to be had, new ideas to be shared." created="Wed, 02 May 2007 18:34:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Long-term this is their loss, although it slows down the flow of capital to new ideas when they most need support. They are happy to come in when it has been proven that there's money to be made, but the technologies come out much less powerfully than they would if the investors of the Valley really risked alongside the innovators. But they find us too brash, or outspoken, that's how we sound to them -- and to their friends in the established media and &quot;new media&quot; but until they embrace the randomness of the web, they'll continue to be surprised, continue to play catch-up, and continue to miss the really big opportunities." created="Wed, 02 May 2007 18:36:36 GMT"/>

I made my first investment at NEA right after that conference in December 1996. I did not participate in running Agenda 98, by which time I had three portfolio companies. But, even if I did AND if I had all three CEOs participate (which none of them actually did), it's hard to imagine that 3/26 of the program would be a 'fair number of the presenters.'&quot;" created="Thu, 03 May 2007 01:11:29 GMT"/>
