But it does. It's a classic faceoff, and in this case, the execs, the nemesis of the Internet, seem to be taking the side of the Internet. They can't promise the writers a share of the money they make on the Internet because they don't see how they're going to make money on the Internet. How can you share something that doesn't exist??" created="Sat, 01 Dec 2007 03:00:44 GMT"/>

Now the anger has subsided, as a software writer, and it will subside for the Hollywood writers too. This may be the moment when the system breaks.

This art has been around since 2001, it's been popular since 2004, so it's fair to assume perhaps that there isn't much demand. It's pretty easy to cobble together a podcast feed by hand.

I see podcasting, for bloggers, as just another way to communicate with a few people who are interested in what they know and think. I also see it as a way for professional news organizations, esp non-profits, to flow reports to people in a very convenient and powerful way. As a consumer of podcasts, I am in heaven. I am a regular listener of: Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week, Fresh Air, Nightline, NYT Tech Talk, and numerous NPR shows. I have far more content than I have time to listen. Thanks to podcasting I am a much better informed person, and it gives my mind something to do as I get my exercise." created="Thu, 29 Nov 2007 23:54:05 GMT"/>

I don't know how long it will last, or if it will ever end, I'm just going with the flow. I like to write, and hang out with friends in small groups, and I do a lot of reading and listening, and I also am working on software projects. If I were driving coast to coast or going to political conventions or teaching at a university, I imagine I would also be doing more podcasts." created="Thu, 29 Nov 2007 23:56:31 GMT"/>

But at the edges, where you're accomdating the minds of users, inevitably it gets a little messy. The key thing to look for is how hard is it to add a completely new feature.

I got about a dozen responses, they all look good. I think any of them could work for the project I have in mind. " created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:12:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This left me with a vexing problem -- which one should I work with, and what should I tell the others? I decided to work with &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of them, and anyone else who may be reading, by describing the project here, openly. " created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:14:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So here's the idea..." created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:30:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Imagine Digg in the old days, when there were just 25 people using it. Maybe that wasn't enough. Maybe it didn't really get interesting until there were 100 users or 250 or 1000. It was good, the articles were gems, things we weren't finding on our own, there were huge numbers of them, but they were prioritized, and the community had a heart of gold, people were doing it for love. The maturity level was high." created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:15:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But then something happened as Digg grew from 100 users to 100,000 and more. I'm not going to characterize it other than to say that it stopped being interesting to me as it grew. The stories weren't what I was looking for." created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:17:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I wonder if we could start a Digg-like community with the readers of Scripting News. The numbers are small, relative to Digg, it would be just like the old days, maybe 250 active participants. I was describing the idea to Fred Wilson this morning, and offered that his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.blogs.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; might host such a community. Or we could do a Digg-like community with 25 people by invitation, some you've heard of, some you haven't. All would be voracious news junkies. They would be empowered to add articles, comment on them, vote them up or down. I would invite Scoble, Fred Wilson, Steve Rubel, Amyloo, Jim Posner, Lawrence Lee and (I'm sure I'll think of many more). We'd count on the judgement of these people to find us interesting news items, and be fair in deciding their relevance. " created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:17:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Key point -- it would serve as an editorial system. Only members could participate in the social functions, but anyone could read the results. You could see what the community decided was important at any moment in time. You might choose to read the TechCrunch Digg clone, but not Scobleizer's or Instapundit's.

					<outline text="Two very smart people are thinking this way too." created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:21:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Steve Gillmor, the genius who brought us attention and gestures, has exactly this kind of system &lt;i&gt;running right now,&lt;/i&gt; in private beta. I first stumbled across it when I described the idea to a friend back in October, and was told &quot;You have to talk with Steve!&quot; So I called him, and sure enough he had it. He plans on unveiling it publicly very soon, perhaps even this week. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:22:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2060276197/&quot;&gt;Om Malik&lt;/a&gt; and I talked about this on Saturday when he came to visit in Berkeley. I am pretty sure this is part of the editorial system he'd like to use at GigaOm. One thing we both agreed on, strongly, is that it's time to shake up the market for open editorial tools. It's been stagnating. Enough of that!" created="Mon, 26 Nov 2007 18:23:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So that's the idea. I want starting a Digg-like community to be as easy as creating a weblog on blogger.com. Just fill in a form, click Submit and off we go. Let a thousand flowers bloom. Sure most will be ghost towns, there will be press articles talking about the abandoned communities, but I bet we look back in a couple of years and see the landscape in the blogosphere has changed yet again.

I love what URL-shorteners do, it's especially important in Twitter when you're limited to 140 characters to express an idea. If you have to include a link, that could use up a lot of the space you have. The problem is if everyone uses TinyUrl, as Twitter does, what happens when TinyUrl goes down or is sold to someone we don't like, or disappears forever? I admit I don't know the owners of TinyUrl and what their motives are. Their service is reasonably long-lived, reliable and quick. Even so I've written my own URL-shortener and am running it on one of my servers, and I try to use it whenever possible. However, like all my sites, this one will likely disappear within a few days of my passing. I have to maintain my servers to keep them running. A better solution is surely needed.

I've noticed the same thing. Steve Levy writes an article that appears in Newsweek about new hardware from Amazon, and it's an instant coral reef, within an hour or two it's the top item on TechMeme and there's a whole ecosystem of thought about it, published by people who have no information other than what they read in Levy's article.

It's not that way anymore. I'll probably write about the Amazon device, I'll probably have to buy one, and like a lot of the hardware I try out, it'll go into a box I keep in the den with other stuff that I learned a little from but never found a use for.

You'll get one brief piece in TechCrunch on their launch day, but if you find a blogger who uses it, you can really understand how it works, because they will know, and because the publishing tools are now distributed and free, you'll find out what they think. That's what's changed. The press still reflects what the press cares about, competing with other press. But the blogs, who aren't trying to climb the top 100 lists, are doing something else.

					<outline text="Good news -- you can do everything you could do with a network drive on Leopard that you could do on previous versions of the Mac OS, and probably more, and it's probably faster. I'll have to let you know after a bit of time using it. " created="Mon, 19 Nov 2007 01:40:52 GMT"/>

Locate the network drive you want to work with, starting in the &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;SHARED&lt;/font&gt; sidebar section, clicking as needed to make it visible. Or alternatively, you can use the Connect to Server command in the Finder's Go menu. You can even mount servers over the Internet this way. (This part can be very slow, but you only have to do it once.) Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2044912473/&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt; showing the available disks on a computer named Illium. Note that two of these disks are actually folders, Leopard doesn't care. That's coool. " created="Mon, 19 Nov 2007 01:47:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Now if you look in the upper-left corner of that screen shot, you'll see that I have chosen the second of four possible ways to view the contents of Illium. It turns out the dragging procedure people were trying to explain to me only works when you're in the three-pane view, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2044912477/&quot;&gt;another screen&lt;/a&gt;, not when you're in the other views. That's totally unintuitive, it's just a matter of luck which of the modes you happen to prefer. For people who use the second mode (like me), the Finder doesn't network very well. Click on the third of the three icons and things start working very nicely." created="Mon, 19 Nov 2007 01:48:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Suppose I want to work with the drive named &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;WYOMING&lt;/font&gt;. Now, all I have to is drag it into the Devices section of the sidebar, and it stays there. And it's fast, no long delays. People tell me, but I haven't yet verified, that this mounting will survive a restart. If so, that's a great improvement over Tiger. Not sure how well this might work on a laptop that disconnects and reconnects to the &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;LAN&lt;/font&gt; much more frequently than a hard-wired desktop computer. Earlier versions of the Mac OS tend to hang for long periods when you accidentally leave a network disk mounted on a laptop after disconnecting from the &lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;LAN&lt;/font&gt;." created="Mon, 19 Nov 2007 01:57:50 GMT"/>

When a new version of the OS comes out, we need good user-oriented change notes that explain what you need to do to get your newly updated systems to work like the systems they're replacing. I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of people have made this transition, but I can't imagine that I'm the only one who hadn't figured out how to get Leopard to mount network drives. That's pretty basic stuff, networking on Macs is something I just take for granted, I don't expect it to be mysterious. " created="Mon, 19 Nov 2007 01:41:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We don't even have good language to explain how to use a Mac. A number of people just said &quot;Command-K&quot; but that didn't solve the problem. I knew how to &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; network drives, but they weren't mounting. Are these well-understood terms? Apparently not. How many times did people tell me to drag a folder over to the sidebar without making sure I was already in the right view? Did they know that you had to be in that view? For people who prefer the three-pane view, it would likely never occur to them that this wouldn't work in the other views. Why would they think it wouldn't?

But it all comes home when you &quot;upgrade&quot; to a new version of the Mac OS and find that the engineers at Apple don't listen to designers, or understand users any more than the geeks at Microsoft do.

					<outline text="Google has it too. They will break us, I'm sure of it. If I told you how, they'd unleash a storm of hate at me very much like what you get when you criticize Apple. Even Microsoft used to have its anonymous assholes on the net who would make you feel pain for questioning their competence or integrity. Hey when they cut off Netscape's air supply, they cut off a lot of users and small developers too. Sun did it with the Java wars (Microsoft again), and Apple -- well read my piece on networking in Leopard, which may look like it was coordinated with Scoble's.

They are conveniently listed in the Shared section in every Finder window.

I double-click on Ohio and the list of disks is replaced by the files and folders in Ohio. Nothing has changed in the left pane of the window, no disk has been mounted, I can access the contents of this disk only in this window, and only as long as it stays open. If I navigate to another disk or folder, I no longer have access to this disk. This is the first major step back. (There were some minor reverses on the way here, each of the steps in this process take much longer for some reason than they did on the earlier version of the OS. I have two machines that haven't been Leopardized, so I can compare, and the delays can be really long, and yes, I've rebooted everything numerous times. The pre-Leopard machines are faster.

How do they get away with removing it, and no one calls them on it, and they don't explain it anywhere? (Or did they and I missed it.

Basically it now takes more time for the data to move around on the Flickr side. Is this breakage? Hard to say -- it is communication software, so you have to be prepared for latency and packets getting dropped. It did used to work. So it's &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; breakage and more robustness was required on our side. It just shows how sensitive these systems can be, and of course that they used a fancier method for security, that is safer, but also more fragile.

My code didn't try to sign the user in (there was no need to), so all of a sudden I was getting mysterious errors from my code saying that it couldn't locate an object called &quot;Original.&quot; It took some time to trace it down, and by searching on the net for other people who were having the same problem, and figure out how it related to my code." created="Tue, 13 Nov 2007 03:43:26 GMT"/>

I have to admit, that when I first implemented this code I didn't really understand what they these things are, but I fumbled around until the code worked and moved on.

Much of Davos is done unconference style, the lunches and dinners are basically roundtables with about 30 to 50 people at the table and the conversation is structured by a discussion leader, usually someone who's expert in an area, an economist or an astronaut, or an indigenous person who lives in a rainforest being destroyed by drug companies (and the drug company's CEO is probably there too). The conversations are generally very interesting, and often heated. Going to Davos with a white badge is not only an honor, but it's a great deal of fun, and educational. There's no doubt Mike will have a great time, and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$187&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; will likely be interesting reads.

One husband, many wives. One platform vendor, many developers." created="Sun, 11 Nov 2007 15:37:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you look at the successful platforms, most of them were completely open to anyone who wanted to make products for them. The best platforms were so open that people used the products to develop other products. You could do that on the Apple II, the IBM PC. Then came the Internet, where the duality was incredible. The Internet was an essential development tool, already, before any users came along. On the other hand, the most unsuccessful platforms have been the ones that were exclusive clubs, where only some people could develop. Sometimes they start exclusive and then become open, I'm thinking of the Macintosh, where I was lucky enough to be one of the insiders in 1983 who were seeded with development units. It was very good for recruiting, and it created a lot of buzz for us when it shipped, but the Mac didn't really blossom until 1986, after it had been openly available as a dev platform for two years. So I still don't know of a single example of an exclusive platform that worked. Yet companies still try to launch them, ignoring history, and hoping that they can control who gets to make their platform a winner." created="Sun, 11 Nov 2007 15:48:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Some examples of spectacular losers that were closed at birth: General Magic's MagicCap and Steve Jobs's NeXT. And today we have the iPhone, which is totally a closed box, with a very exclusive developer proposition. I had hoped that Google's phone platform, which was announced last week, would be the antidote for iPhone, but they are being exclusive about who they will let develop for it. I had hoped they would zig to Apple's zag, and would be completely open. Yet there are rumors that there are 50,000 gPhones out there with developers. I promise you, I don't have one. If I get one a year from now, I'm going to be less enthusiastic about trying to prove my ideas on their platform than I would be if I were among the first to get my hands on one.

Same with OpenSocial. Their campfires and marshmallows show that they understand that love is an important part of making a platform happen, but who was invited to their slumber party, and who wasn't? I think at this point in the evolution of their platform business, they would do better to if they were more open and inclusive -- save the parties for celebrating the birth of the babies, the products the developers create. Spread the seed far and wide, or don't spread it at all. I think that's the lesson of the Internet, of Apple and IBM, and General Magic and NeXT." created="Sun, 11 Nov 2007 15:56:21 GMT"/>

They must have gotten a leak from one of the companies that stood with Facebook, so they knew what was coming. They weren't scared of Facebook's technology, because they didn't respond with technology. They were scared because Facebook has a better advertising story than Google does. They are getting ready to offer some very premium web real estate that (pay attention now) Google can't compete with. And advertising is Google's bread and butter, advertising is to Google as operating systems are to Microsoft. They can't let somebody appear to be better than they are in advertising.

But Google is keeping people like me far away, which suggests that there may actually be no &quot;there&quot; there." created="Thu, 01 Nov 2007 21:53:12 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Want to see a great movie? You're in luck. One is playing at a theater near you. Went to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809423158/info&quot;&gt;Michael Clayton&lt;/a&gt; yesterday and was thrilled. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney&quot;&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a really great actor, getting parts that refine his skills and make me look forward to see what's coming next. Pay attention as the plot unfolds, at first it's confusing but it intrigues. Eventually it all comes together, maybe just a bit too neatly. " created="Thu, 01 Nov 2007 18:30:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Trying to figure out exactly who Clooney is like. The Times &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/movies/05clay.html&quot;&gt;reviewer&lt;/a&gt; said he's like Warren Beatty, another actor who really delivers, but I was thinking bigger -- perhaps Clark Gable or Cary Grant. He has that kind of presence. Michael Clayton might be his North by Northwest." created="Thu, 01 Nov 2007 18:33:27 GMT"/>
