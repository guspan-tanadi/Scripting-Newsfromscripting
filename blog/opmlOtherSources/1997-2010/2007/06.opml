					<outline text="When I click on a link in Safari on the iPhone, before I can read anything, I have to futz with the display resolution of the browser to make the text visible. This may not sound like a problem, but what a distraction, when following a link, before getting the idea, your mind has to take a detour into managing the device. In reading as in the movies, suspension of disbelief is broken when your mind has to exit the space of ideas and manage the projection device. It's wrong for the device to ask you this, even as a setup issue it should be usable out of the box, but it's unacceptable that it make the user configure the browser every time it displays a new page. " created="Sun, 01 Jul 2007 04:53:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Today's iPhone isn't a reading device. It wouldn't take much to configure the browser to be an excellent reading device, but Apple will have to give up the idea that the browser should work the same as the desktop browsers do. The iPhone is nowhere near as capable as a desktop display. Wishing it were so, and shifting the burden to the user to make it so, is not an acceptable solution." created="Sun, 01 Jul 2007 05:16:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I thought I could overcome this by creating a special version of a site just for the iPhone that crammed all the text into a narrow column, thinking that the browser wouldn't see any need to make the text small because it would have all the necessary horizontal screen real estate to display every character at a fully visible resolution.

We create sites that assume nothing about the device they're being rendered on, and browsers should take care to make our text readable for users of their device. The iPhone web browser doesn't keep that promise. " created="Sun, 01 Jul 2007 04:56:08 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I was able to register with AT&amp;T, choose a service plan, get a phone number, and make a phone call.

But there are optimizations I hope Apple makes soon. " created="Sat, 30 Jun 2007 07:10:58 GMT"/>

					<outline text="And there's a major usability problem with the Safari web browser, it's hard to believe that Apple didn't see and fix this problem before shipping, because it seems to make all websites unusable in the default configuration, with the default font choice, and there doesn't seem to be a way to change their choice of font. Is it possible they made this choice so that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/ad3/&quot;&gt;TV commercial&lt;/a&gt; would look good, and forgot to test the browser the way real people will use it?

At the core of all of it is an identity system. So what is an identity system? Is there a good definition somewhere? How many features can you add before it becomes more than an identity system? This is important because in this area, it's important to strip it down to its bare minimum, so that the first component of any network of people, events and resources can be maximally combined with features that depend on identity. The goal is to give the user the most options with the fewest identities. " created="Fri, 22 Jun 2007 15:11:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now this need to be minimal explains the interest I have in Twitter. Could it be that the ability to post 140-character status messages should be part of any identity system? Should every identity service minimally have a web browser interface, an IM interface and an SMS interface?

					<outline text="It seems that these are the questions we'll answer in the coming months. But my gut feel is that if Twitter has more functionality than is required to define an identity system, it's &lt;i&gt;not much&lt;/i&gt; more. Not too much more. To prove it, one would have to build an application that required identity using Twitter as the identity server, and see if the extra features turned out to be useful, redundant, or in the way.

					<outline text="Back in 2004, when the Creative Commons was very new, and I was working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/&quot;&gt;Berkman Center&lt;/a&gt; which was one of the proponents of the Commons, it seemed natural to release the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0 spec&lt;/a&gt; under one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#licenseAndAuthorship&quot;&gt;licenses&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, it became a common practice in spec-writing, for example when Microsoft released the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caltrain.org/timetable.html#weekday-northbound&quot;&gt;SSE spec&lt;/a&gt;, they also &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/576210162/&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; the Creative Commons." created="Wed, 20 Jun 2007 16:50:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It made sense to do so, because it follows in the precedent set by the IETF, the share-alike, for-attribution license, to this non-legal mind, is more or less the same license that the IETF has used for many years for its specs." created="Wed, 20 Jun 2007 16:52:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1139/576424382_0964ff92b3_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot;&gt;So the question is this -- if there are disputes about a work that's licensed under the Creative Commons, what are the mechanisms available to mediate or arbitrate such disputes? Perhaps such mediation is a service that one of the law schools, Stanford or Harvard, might provide? It seems that when a work is licensed under the CC, there should be some free help available to guide the use of the licensed material, since (I presume) one of the goals of the CC is to encourage creative people to be non-commercial with their works. If there's no way to profit from the work, it seems unfair that it should cost money to enforce the terms of the license (however these days &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; about the legal system seems fair to me)." created="Wed, 20 Jun 2007 16:53:12 GMT"/>

The platform is less important and the package is more important. What the consumer gets out of the box matters. The ability to make a phone call, or listen to music or get directions to a restaurant. But run some random app that someone other than Apple made?

The security argument is bogus. Skype runs &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; on computers that are wide open. The phone is just one app, as it is just one app on the iPhone.

I feel she is the central character of the show, more than Big Pussy, or Ralph Siparetto, or Janet's fiancee or Tony's cousin Tony, or Christopher. Adrianna is pivotal because her death proved for sure that Tony really is evil, without a redeeming quality, a pure gangster, period. Remember that Tony got a crush on Ade just before he told her to go with Silvio to see Christopher in the hospital. Remember how that ended for Ade. If any character had our sympathy, even our love, it was her.

There should be a sliver of justice to his death, the same way there was a sliver of justice to Ade's death (she was collaborating with the Feds, but not really, she hadn't ratted anyone out, she was just trying to live, her death was tragic and unnecessary, but Tony had no way of knowing that).

Ultimately it may be the only way we get the attention of our elected representatives. As strong as our system is, we have a weakness, the mechanisms for recall aren't often used. We must get over that. We should start considering impeachment the day a president takes office until they start taking us seriously. Maybe in 20 or 30 years we can relax. But we've let this go too far. The Democrats see the Constitution as an issue of election cycles. It is so much bigger than that. I don't care which party wins the White House when our basic freedoms are in such peril. Impeach Bush and Cheney now and let's get on with it. Let's send a message to the 20 or so Presidential hopefuls that they should pay close attention to what happened and continues to happen in California.

Scary thought. Reading in yesterday's WSJ or IHT (can't remember which) that printed tickets are going to be completely phased out soon, this is not a pleasant thought. Seems they'd better get some kind of identity system going for the online ticketing system before making the full switchover? Not sure about this, obviously.

					<outline text="Susan Goodwin, executive producer of NPR's Talk of the Nation joined us in an excited conversation about the future of public media.

I said &quot;I love you too.&quot; This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Instead of sending roses, I sent a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/cn21Feb07.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; I did about integrating public radio with what we do." created="Fri, 01 Jun 2007 15:45:13 GMT"/>
