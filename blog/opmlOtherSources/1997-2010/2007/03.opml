					<outline text="Meanwhile, the Manila server I set up at Harvard when I was there is back up, but only for a very short period of time. The fragility of this server is one of the things that's inspiring my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/03/29/fourIdeasForTheFuture.html#p2&quot;&gt;interest&lt;/a&gt; in future-safe systems. Back in 2003, with the help of Jack Russo, representing UserLand, we transferred the RSS 2.0 spec to Harvard, for safe-keeping through the years, hopefully decades, maybe longer. I think now, in 2007, it needs one more little bit of help to turn the corner to be relatively safe for the next century or so (knock wood, praise Murphy).

I'm moving all the images and sample XML files into sub-folders of the static HTML pages. We will also offer the whole site as a zip archive so people can download it in total. I will also provide the Harvard webmaster with an htaccess file that redirects the old urls to the new ones. I'm trying to anticipate the nit-picking that such a change is likely to cause, but I'm hopeful that with the recent Kathy Sierra mess, people will be reluctant to get so personal about it. All I'm doing is helping my friends at Harvard deliver on their commitment to provide an unchanging home for a spec that a lot of people build on. I am being careful not to change one word of the spec. Yet I'm sure, as I write this, that some people will spin as if they were on a Sunday morning politics show, hoping to confuse good people into thinking that changes &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; made.

I love public radio and television, but it's time for them to become two-way media. Next time we go to war, and we seem to be doing that all-too-regularly, we must be certain that the kinds of conversations that ordinary people have about the motives of our political leaders make it onto the airwaves. And I'd like to know what the pundits are saying when they go out to dinner, not just when they're on the air. Many people thought Bush was lying in the lead-up to the war, now let's reform the media so those thoughts get proper coverage in time to avoid future national catastrophes. "/>
					<outline text="2. I'd like to be able to pay a web company like Amazon or Google a one-time flat fee to host my content for perpetuity. I'd deposit my writing with them, on the web, and not worry about whether or not my heirs will keep paying the hosting bills to keep it alive. Today I'm hosting the weblog of my departed uncle (who I miss terribly!), I don't mind doing it, but what will happen when I pass? I'd gladly pay $10,000 to be sure my site and his survive my death. Long-lived institutions like Harvard University or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountauburn.org/&quot;&gt;Mount Auburn Cemetary&lt;/a&gt; (in Boston), even insurance companies, could get into this business. Think of it as a personal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hno.harvard.edu/guide/finance/index.html&quot;&gt;endowment&lt;/a&gt;, it would work like the money richer people leave behind as memorials to their own lives, or lives of loved ones.

Another idea along these lines, I'd like to pay a few bucks to beam my thoughts to a nearby solar system that might have intelligent life. Back in the seventies, I thought it was really cool when we sent a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record&quot;&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt; into the cosmos with a copy of the Magna Carta and Declaration of Independence and some Chuck Berry tunes (and Beethoven and Bach as well). I think this should be available to ordinary people like you and I, possibly for a fee. Maybe they could run a contest or have a reality show for people who don't want to spend the money."/>
					<outline text="4. I'm in favor of ideas that capture the imagination, because I think we don't have enough of them when it comes to solving problems we must deal with. If I were Bill Gates, I might send a copy of Windows Vista to Alpha Centauri (of course with a computer to run it on) and hold a contest for kids to write software that aliens might appreciate. One can be pretty sure that because of global warming or the war on terror or loose nukes that our terrestrial backups probably aren't much good, long-term, but the stuff we send out into the cosmos might actually survive us. Do we have any ideas worth preserving? Hmmm. We might generate some if we had a reason to. "/>

Giving Tim the benefit of the doubt, I think he doesn't fully unerstand what was going on in the blogging world, and I'm not claiming I do either, but he was running a conference this week, and it couldn't have gotten very much of his attention. And you know what, that's a good thing, and we should all strive to keep our perspective, before we create the kind of fantastic graphic imagery that was created around this event.

					<outline text="And out fo all that was said I think Doc nailed it -- we got used by a few trolls, and no one knows who they are. Everyone played a role in this, the people who stopped blogging, the people who threatened their friends, the people who called it a gang rape, and yes indeed, the mean kids. But they've paid enough. It's time to welcome them back into the blogging world, and in a few weeks, ask them to reflect on what they learned. These are all intelligent and creative people, who have acted badly. But they didn't deserve what they got. " created="Thu, 29 Mar 2007 15:11:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The time to act is way before it escalates into the kind of post that Kathy Sierra posted. There should be people who are willing to provide personal support to others who are ostracized this way -- and that support should be available regardless of gender, age, or other circumstances. I won't support anything that only offers support to women and not men, we must help unpopular people, even people who we think are mean.

All I got was silence. I think people need to come to terms with that, and speak up whenever people say or do things designed to hurt other people.

There should be 18 steps before something like Kathy Sierra's post appears in the midst of the blogosphere, and it shouldn't come from teh person who has been victimized, someone else should stand up for them and explain what happened. For so many reasons this is a much better way to go, and I'm sure the victim would like it better too (I speak from experience)." created="Thu, 29 Mar 2007 15:26:37 GMT"/>

					<outline text="It's lucky we had that offer, because that clearly puts a value on the service at the time of the transfer. From that point, there was a lot of work, a lot of rewrites, a lot of technical challenges (remember the June 2004 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/06/63856&quot;&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;), a lot of risk, and huge growth, which resulted in a sale, after much negotiation, to VeriSign."/>

I'll overlook the fact that Russo &amp; Hale forced me to waste over $50K on legal fees. And most important to most of the people reading this, we get to focus on getting UserLand working again. "/>

It's too late to be training new journalists in the classic mode. Instead, journalism should become a required course, one or two semesters for every graduate. Why? Because journalism like everything else that used to be centralized is in the process of being distributed. In the future, every educated person will be a journalist, as today we are all travel agents and stock brokers. The reporters have been acting as middlemen, connecting sources with readers, who in many cases are sources themselves. As with all middlemen, something is lost in translation, an inefficiency is added. So what we're doing now, in journalism, as with all other intermediated professions, is decentralizing. So it pays to make an investment now and teach the educated people of the future the basic principles of journalism. " created="Sat, 24 Mar 2007 13:18:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Second, embrace the best bloggers. How? Easy -- every time someone is quoted in your publication, offer them a blog hosted on your domain. This has a couple of advantages: 1. It gives the reporters the ultimate say on who gets to share some of your authority, who gets a chance to be the next amateur star. 2. It gives the reporters an incentive to only use sources that are qualified, it would improve the quality of your reporting. It also has a third benefit, as you expand the number of people writing under your banner, you also expand the reach of your publication, into school boards, local government, sports teams and businesses. It's also important because it's how &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; decentralize, aligning your interests with the &quot;grain&quot; of the web, as opposed to the current positioning, against it." created="Sat, 24 Mar 2007 13:19:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Of course you run ads on each of the pages, that's your reward for sharing your authority with the people who used to be your sources (and who still are, in every sense). Now your reporters just have to read the blogs to find the new trends, the quotes for their articles. They will learn a lot and perhaps even start having fun, instead of (as Markoff puts it in the O'Reilly piece) feeling like they're at a wake. That's depression, and you can feel it in the articles they write, and you can't possibly dig out of a hole when you're depressed. You need to find a way to tap into the excitement of the Internet, to bring it into your publication. In the tech business they call this &quot;embrace and extend.&quot;" created="Sat, 24 Mar 2007 13:22:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Eventually new businesses will form out of the messy brew of sources, editors and reporters you'll be supporting and in some cases, employing.

It's really rich, but we're too scared of Hollywood to work together on this. Or at least &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; too scared. But I admire what they're doing, esp since they just added excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eztvefnet.org/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS support&lt;/a&gt;. I may go ahead and design some software that automates BitTorrent for a friend (who will remain nameless) who is a Gilmore Girls fan who thinks its silly that she has to remember to download the program every week. I know &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jakeludington.com/project_studio/20051012_automating_bittorrent_downloads_with_rss.html&quot;&gt;Azureus has&lt;/a&gt; RSS support, but as it's implemented it's way too technical for even me to configure properly, and it's hopeless to try to explain to a person who knows how to use a TiVO, which is all the technical expertise that should be required. The UI should allow a user to express their desire the way my friend expressed it -- every time there's a new episode of the Gilmore Girls, get it for me. Not 204 copies of last week's show produced by different people. Just the one I always get. With EZTV doing quality control, the problem is close to solved for TV shows. And for movies there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/interview-axxo-the-most-popular-dvd-ripper-on-bittorrent/&quot;&gt;Axxo&lt;/a&gt;. Don't know who he is?

				<outline text="An untold story of UserLand">
					<outline text="What a long story, and today I can tell a piece of it that has had to remain under wraps for the last year or so. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:42:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, a summary of how UserLand came to be. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:43:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In 1988, I had an idea for scripting software on the Macintosh. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:44:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I loved the Mac for its graphic ease of use, but I missed the user-level programmability of Unix, and felt that combining the two would yield great results. I wanted to turn applications into toolkits, to let you combine a word processor and database with an outliner and a spreadsheet to make an integrated app that's customized to how you or your organization works." created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:44:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Technically, the idea worked, but as a product it failed. By 1993, I was ready to move on, so I did, I left UserLand and later in 1994, discovered the wonders of the web, and I wanted to figure out how to use it as a communication system for people. In 1995 or 1996 I got a prophetic email from Mason Hale, who had discovered Frontier and thought it would make a wonderful environment for CGI scripting. He was right, but I came to wish I had never gotten that email. Seriously." created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:45:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I revived UserLand, without cleaning it up at a corporate level. I poured money and time into it again, and the results were pretty fantastic. News sites became weblogs. Cross-platform inter-application communication became XML-RPC and then SOAP. XML syndication became My.UserLand and RSS. Edit This Page became Manila. Lots of innovation, but the company went through two boom cycles and never participated in the bonanza. Looking back, there are a lot of reasons for it, and one of them was that I should have taken the time to get a fresh start in the mid-90s, and I didn't do it it. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:47:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Finally in 2002, at age 47, after struggling through the release of Radio 8, I collapsed physically, was lucky to have survived, and as I recuperated from major heart surgery, I decided to quit UserLand, to leave behind all possible upside, just walk away from it, glad to have gotten away with my life. Once again, I made the same mistake. I should have hired a new attorney to document the transition, but I thought that everyone involved would be glad I survived, and would understand that I was finally moving on, for real. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:51:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then in 2003, after everyone but Jake Savin and Lawrence Lee had left UserLand, my brother and I decided to revive the company. Again, for a third time, I made the mistake of not carefully creating a legal basis for this. I thought everyone understood what they had agreed to do, and we would all do it. Again, I should have taken the time to get an independent attorney to look at the deal, but I didn't." created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:54:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="By 2005, weblogs.com, one of the many sites I was caring for personally, as a labor of love, had been growing exponentially. A year earlier it was doing 100,000 pings per day. By the spring of 2005, it was doing two million. I had reprogrammed the server a dozen times, each time stripping out functionality, buying more hardware. I hired a contractor. It co-existed with competing ping servers from well-funded companies, and I came to realize more and more over time that, as an individual, I was way out of my league. Weblogs.com was becoming something a person couldn't operate, it required the resources of a company." created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 18:56:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One day, when I was living in Florida, I happened to be talking with Keith Teare, an old friend, who was doing consulting work with VeriSign. I broached the question, would they be interested in taking over weblogs.com. He asked, and they said yes. It took a few months, and here's a key point, this time I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; get new lawyers to do the deal, including Mike Arrington (a friend who is now famous for the awesome TechCrunch weblog), and along with some great people at VeriSign, we put together a careful deal to transfer weblogs.com to VeriSign. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 19:00:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The day the deal was leaked was one of the best days and one of the worst days of my life. Through all the incarnations of UserLand, I had one lawyer, Jack Russo, and he was very angry with me after the deal. Before I could even talk with him, he was threatening to sue. All the turns in UserLand, that I had done informally, were now coming back to haunt me. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 19:02:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Eventually the threats turned into a real lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County Court, around the time I was buying the house in Berkeley. I've spent over $40,000 in legal fees defending myself, while Russo presumably spent much less because he's a lawyer. I think that was the central part of his strategy, he knew I would have to spend money to defend myself, where he wouldn't have to. " created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 19:05:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I wanted to write about this here, and I almost did several times. But on Friday, we got a decision from the court that agreed with our position, so now I feel that the future is pretty clear, and that if I want to clean up the mess that UserLand has become, now I have the ability to do so. It will still cost me personally many thousands of dollars, but it's a price I have to pay for having cut corners over the years. If I want my freedom, a bunch of lawyers and accountants and the government have to be paid. So be it." created="Mon, 12 Mar 2007 19:07:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I learned a very important lesson here, one that my friend Jason Calacanis said at the OPML Road Show in NYC in 2005. If a deal is worth doing, it's worth documenting with a good agreement. Anyone who is doing business with me these days knows that I have embraced this ethos wholeheartedly!

Indeed, they are. There are some huge ideas here. Why now? Well, after almost ten years of blogging, there might be something worth preserving. Being 51, and having survived a life-threatening illness at 47 makes me aware that there's no time like now. I'm already caring for the archive of my uncle who passed in 2003. What will become of his blog when I pass? To have it disappear then is simply not acceptable. And as a software developer, I want to be sure I have answers for less technical people, for the Dostoyevsky or Huxley among us, for the Picasso or Chagall, for the Ives, Copland and Berlioz. We believe digital is better, but how will people know how we lived two or three generations from now? That's a problem I want to work on." created="Thu, 01 Mar 2007 20:34:43 GMT"/>
