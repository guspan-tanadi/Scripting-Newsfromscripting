As Fred Wilson points out in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/07/bug---slowly-co.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, it's the polar opposite of the iPhone. He compares it to Ning, but it seems more like an early PC, and the app designer, if it delivers on its promise, as the BASIC that was bundled (in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory&quot;&gt;ROM&lt;/a&gt;) with those early machines. The assumption back then was that everyone would program for themselves. That of course led to the earliest users turning their personal labors of love into off-the-shelf products for other users. Hobbyists have always been at the core of the tech industry, it's rare and refreshing to see people deliberately make a product for them. " created="Tue, 31 Jul 2007 14:41:10 GMT"/>

It almost goes without saying, but should be said anyway -- if Bug is any good, it should be possible to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6748103.stm&quot;&gt;Podcast Player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/06/14/newIdeaSocialCameras.html&quot;&gt;Social Camera&lt;/a&gt; with it. So maybe Bug will be a prototyping environment for more polished mobile devices, like future iPhones. As a user and a developer my creativity has been locked out of the mobile market because I don't have the requisite hardware skills. Podcasting is one art that would be further along if we had access to the design tools that designers at consumer electronics companies have. There certainly are others.

					<outline text="1. It's an architecture for pluggable gadget components. There's a hardware interface, which I know little or nothing about (I'm a software guy). It was explained to me as &quot;60 pins&quot; -- they said they interface all the capabilities of the chip, whatever that means. But at a software level, each of the components interfaces with XML over HTTP. It's as if they read my mind. The pieces are all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;fractional horsepower HTTP servers&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="2. The designs for the components that Bug Labs is doing themselves are all open source. They're sharing everything.

					<outline text="2. &lt;b&gt;It's a micro-blogging system&lt;/b&gt;. Posts are limited to 140 characters. Enough for a bit of text and a link. This is a powerful idea, but not a new one. If you read Scripting News before February of this year, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/09/22.html&quot;&gt;partially&lt;/a&gt; a micro-blogging system. When it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/aprilfool2007.html&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; in April 1997, it was all micro-blogging. The earliest websites, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.cern.ch/&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp.netscape.com/home/whatsnew/whats_new_0693.html&quot;&gt;NCSA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/07/27/hehhehwhatsnew.gif&quot;&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt; were also micro-blogging systems.

One of the things we talked about was micro-blogging. I asked the people if they would like it if the only way you could create a WordPress site was on wordpress.com. They agreed that would not be good. Analogously, if micro-blogging is to become a real art, there will have to be many ways to create a micro-blog, and lots of RSS to tie them together.

A relatively &lt;b&gt;open identity system&lt;/b&gt;. I've said it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/06/22/whatIsAnIdentitySystem.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter or something like it, could be the holy grail of open identity. While the engineers of the tech industry have been, imho, looking at the problem the wrong way by trying to glue together the huge namespaces controlled by powerful companies who don't want to give up control. Twitter, with it's ultra-thin user interface, and light feature set, and simple API (more on that in a bit) and the nothing-to-lose attitude of its management, may be the breakthrough. Or it could be Facebook, with it's much larger user base and a management that also likes to roll the dice. The key is lots of users, a growing user base, and an API with no dead-ends.

					<outline text="4. &lt;b&gt;An ecosystem&lt;/b&gt;. Twitter's API is very simple. It covers the entire functionality, leaves nothing out. You could implement the Twitter user interface using the API. That's a key thing. Compare it to Apple, who reserves for itself and a few partners, under terms we don't know, the right to develop rich apps for the iPhone. Twitter takes the traditional PC industry approach, give everyone equal power, make it a level playing field and let the chips fall where they may. This means that if the people at Twitter miss an opportunity, the rest of us have a shot at providing it for ourselves and others. " created="Fri, 27 Jul 2007 16:11:01 GMT"/>

Users and relationships between users, their ideas, and an ecosystem. It's probably the basis for some pretty hot apps. Will it be possible to monetize them? Without a doubt. People who say that Twitter hasn't figured out how to make money don't understand the role technology companies play in the much larger media and communication ecosystem. Ideas gestate here, grow up, find users, and then find customers. In a way Twitter is a mega-enterprise product, and by using it, we're helping them prove it. Their customer is likely to be a telco or an entertainment network. But it's way too early to cash it out, they all took the right approach, seed it with some more capital to add more bandwidth, solidify the back-end, add a bit more functionality, and wait to see what the users and developers do with it." created="Fri, 27 Jul 2007 16:14:30 GMT"/>

I think what Apple has attempted is noble, but it's not going to work.

They argued that they were just a little company, struggling to make a go of it, and no one should fear them. Some of them even took the predictable political tactic of trashing the personality of the person raising the question. I held my ground. I've been around this business a long time, and I was sure their strategy was to sell to a bigger company, and I don't trust big companies. " created="Sat, 21 Jul 2007 19:15:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="People at big companies often are underpaid, with stock options going nowhere, and feel unappreciated by their colleagues, and when they look outside their company they see lots of people who look happy and successful, making more money than they are, without the political troubles and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/30/strategyTax.html#2&quot;&gt;strategy taxes&lt;/a&gt;, and they feel like they're doing all the work.

					<outline text="So now someone at Google &quot;owns&quot; Feedburner and all their feeds. And they could, if they wanted to, change the feeds to another format, overnight, without asking anyone. Reader software might have trouble working with it. They would say &quot;Oh but the new feeds work &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; with Google Reader, and that's the one most people use.&quot; And by the way, more and more that's true these days. But what about other feed suppliers? Do they have to change to work with Google Reader?

But it could happen when they have their own spreadsheet and want you to switch. Or if they want everyone to put ads in their feeds. Who would miss a few blogs here and there, don't we all use Blogger anyway (that's one area where they haven't taken over, btw, thankfully)." created="Sat, 21 Jul 2007 19:19:29 GMT"/>

Don't start new namespaces, build off the one you have. " created="Fri, 13 Jul 2007 16:12:26 GMT"/>

And Hypercard should have been a scripting language integrated with the Mac OS, why have two graphic environments when your &lt;i&gt;strength&lt;/i&gt; is the unity of your UI? What value were the rules of UI design if Apple immediately broke them? Unification leads to simplicty. Coalesce instead of fork. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/postelsLaw&quot;&gt;Postel's Law&lt;/a&gt;, still a very good one to follow. Fewer formats please.

I realized this when Scoble was starting to nudge people about how their sites looked on his cell phone. Then I got a Blackberry, and started playing, and all of a sudden I wanted to have serious conversations about where this stuff is going. Plenty of people showed up, with tons of knowledge and experience, but the conversation drifted to the background. Now it's back in the fore, and I don't think it can drift to the back, not after so many people waited in line, and they sold 500,000 in the first weekend, and they've got a software updating mechanism that as far as I know no cellphone manufacturer has ever had. There's going to be an update for the iPhone in July, and one in August, and in September, and on and on. Eventually you'll have to buy a new one, probably long before the battery wears out. That's how Apple works of course. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 02 Jul 2007 18:12:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So while I list my wishes, and complain about their chutzpah, that's just to make sure these things get on the record, maybe finally Apple will have some competition, someday I'd like to buy a Mercedes or a Lexus, nothing wrong with that, right?

					<outline text="Probably the biggest area the product is lacking is in browser prefs. i've been using the web for almost 14 years.

					<outline text="Okay, I made my peace with synchronizing to get music on the iPod, but it doesn't do me any good because the ear buds hurt my ears, after just ten minutes of use, and that's hardware I can't replace, so I'm afraid the iPhone loses on that one. However it is nice that the speaker is loud enough so that you can hear the player even without the ear buds, and it's nice that the buds have a mike too, but of course that's useless to me because of the physical pain." created="Mon, 02 Jul 2007 17:57:28 GMT"/>

					<outline text="An aside, I wasn't able to figure out how to get an episode of The Wire onto the device so I could watch it. I just wanted to see what watching a TV show would be like, and I'm opposed to using their store to buy shows I've already paid HBO for (twice, not only have I had a subscription for the last 30 years, but I also bought the DVDs from Amazon). Try as hard as I can, I couldn't get iTunes to upload the video to the iPhone." created="Mon, 02 Jul 2007 17:59:16 GMT"/>
