They tried to recover my data, but did not have another HD to put it on, so they copied it onto one of their store computers.

					<outline text="I don't have an office, and I'm not running a conference, so I hope to hook up with someone, hopefully in the Bay Area, with either of these, to try some experimentation with FlickrFan." created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 16:57:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First a little background..." created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 16:58:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My first glimpse of how wonderful news photography and screen savers are together was when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2005/02/15#When:3:37:36PM&quot;&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt; Andy Rhinehart at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goupstate.com/&quot;&gt;Spartanburg Herald-Journal&lt;/a&gt; on 2/15/05. He had to go to a meeting, and left me in his office to check email, update my blog using my laptop. HIs PC of course went into screen saver mode, and started showing pictures of various political leaders in meetings around the world and sporting events, people digging out of snow storms. It didn't take long before my eyes were fixed on his screen. " created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 16:58:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Later I found out that everyone at AP does this too. " created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:00:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you have a folder of new pictures on your LAN it makes a fantastic source of distraction. But it's different from video because it's silent. You can have a conversation about what's on the screen without interfering with it, or try to have a conversation about something else entirely. " created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:00:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is something we noticed about podcasting too, that sometimes less is more." created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:01:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Because there is no video you can: 1. Use your eyes for something else, like driving, walking, doing housework. 2. Use your imagination in ways you can't with video, imagine what the speakers look like, where they are, who else is there. Once your imagination is activated in one direction it goes off in others. " created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:01:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So photocasting or picturecatching, whatever it ends up being called, has a similar &quot;less is more&quot; dimension. " created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:03:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So then I tried an experiment, I put an early version of FlickrFan on a 46-inch screen in my den, and when people would come over to visit I'd leave it running and we'd talk about whatever we were going to talk about, and I wasn't surprised to see the attention drift over to the TV. It's captivating." created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:03:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I'd like to try it in two new venues to see what happens." created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:04:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. In a reception area in an office. Imagine one of the buildings at Microsoft. Or a doctors office, or the lobby of a VC firm. Install a big flatscreen TV on the wall, with a Mac Mini behind it, with a net connection, and let it run. See if people don't gravitate to it. See if people don't want to have meetings in the lobby. (I think some might.)" created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:04:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. At a conference, like Demo or Davos, scatter four screens around the main lobby (not the meeting room), with one Mac driving them all or each with its own Mac Mini. Again see how it affects the dynamic. You might want to show pictures taken at the conference for a unique recursive effect. Or just use the AP news photo feed. Either would be sufficient to learn how it works. I bet we would learn a lot." created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:05:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Let me know if you decide to give it a try, and by all means please blog about your experiences, share what you learn with the rest of us. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 30 Dec 2007 17:07:32 GMT"/>

I run two monitors here at my desk at Wired, so I can see two photos from the news agency side by side.

					<outline text="Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls..." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:41:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's with much anticipation that I say this." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:41:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have a new product that may be familiar to those of you who used Radio 8, and in other ways may be completely new. " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:42:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The idea is simple. " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:42:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's a convergence between big screen high-definition televisions, and photography as an Internet based activity." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:42:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The purpose of this product is to smooth that convergence, to make it easy to set up a connection between the Internet and your television. To allow photography to come into your &lt;i&gt;living room&lt;/i&gt; in new, powerful and easy ways." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:54:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Think of it as the networked living room and you'll understand the vision." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:54:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Some of the work I've done is technical, some is user interface, and some is working with media organizations to try to create a comfort level, or at least a spirit of Let's Give This A Try." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:43:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the latter case, it's much like working with the NY Times to get their news headlines and summaries to flow through Radio's RSS aggregator in 2002. Only this time we're working with photographs, and we think, the best news photographers in the world. And the pictures are beautifully high-def, they look really great when displayed on LCD and plasma screens. I use it with my 52-inch Samsung and 46-inch Sony. Of course what looks great on a wall, also looks great on a 15-inch Macbook or 24-inch iMac. &quot;;-&gt;&quot; " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:44:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And while we connect those pros with your TV, it's equally important that we connect your friends and families too. One of the early testers found the pictures that Doc Searls uploads to Flickr a great revelation. Me too. That's because Doc is not only a great photographer, he's also a great story-teller. I find that I can follow the lives of far more friends visually than I can through text messages (which I love to do too!)." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:56:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Viewing great photos on bigscreen TVs, desktops and laptops -- that's one focus, but not the only one. " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:46:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I wanted to provide a complete two-way tool for people who love Flickr, as I do. " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:47:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Why Flickr? Well, they've got this great thing called an API. It makes it possible for people like me to make software that runs on a desktop computer that does things like automatically backing up your new photos every night, and providing a drop-folder on your desktop for quick uploads. (It understands tags too, it's &lt;i&gt;incredibly&lt;/i&gt; simple.)" created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:47:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We also made it easy to post pictures you like to Twitter. Why Twitter? It's that API thing again. They made it easy for us to love them. I wish more network service developers understood how powerful this outstretched hand is. " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:49:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But that's not all!" created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:50:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Not by a long shot." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:50:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reason all this will be so familiar to Radio 8 users is that it builds on the same engine, the one that was released as open source in 2004. So I've been working on other tools to drop into this base platform and once we have a good-sized base of people using it for &quot;really simple photos&quot; on the desktop, there will be other tools. And because it's an open platform, other developers can do the same. Not saying they will, but they can. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:51:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I'm in the last stages, preparing the download site, and a FAQ, and tweaking the installer." created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:52:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One caveat, the first beta release is Mac only. That's because I'm doing all my work on the Mac, and this is a one-man show. Later we will work it out for Windows too, and with a bit more work and a bit more luck, for Linux. " created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:53:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It should be ready before the sun goes down today. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 16:53:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windley.com/archives/2007/12/reasons_to_buy_a_mac_mini.shtml&quot;&gt;Phil Windley&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The XBR4 already has a DVI input, so hooking up ought to be a breeze and getting good pictures on the thing would be wonderful.&quot;" created="Thu, 27 Dec 2007 22:53:18 GMT"/>

People were universally positive and helpful, and I can say I really learned some really important things as a result of the discussion." created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:10:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, the cost of the data on the hard disk swamps the value of the value of the disk and even the value of the computer. There was source code on the computer, and other information, which if it fell into the wrong hands, could cause some serious problems for me." created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:10:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have no agreement with Apple that covers the security or privacy of the data. As far as I know they think they own the contents of the disk as well as the disk itself. The experience I had with them actually makes me think they probably do feel its theirs. This from a company that takes the security of its own private information very seriously, they seem to have almost no regard for the security of its customers' information." created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:12:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="You have no control over when a hard disk will crash, or any foreknowledge of when it's even &lt;i&gt;likely&lt;/i&gt; to crash. So there's no way to protect against this kind of security issue. And that's what it is. What kind of sense does it make to invest in firewalls, and of what value is Apple's claim that Macs are inherently more secure, when &lt;i&gt;all the data&lt;/i&gt; on one of my computers is now completely out of my control forever?" created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:13:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'm not so concerned about the privacy issues, but I could imagine that other people might be. And if identity thieves are not aware of this backdoor way to get access to private information, how long before they are? Security experts always warn us that obscurity is not a good strategy for security." created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:14:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So what to do? " created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:16:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Basically I've given up on trying to get Apple to do the right thing and give me my disk back. Some people at the Emeryville store are well-itentioned, and are just naive about the problems that can come when you trust people with all your data. Others just don't care. Either way it seems unlikely that I'm going to get it back, and even if I do, it's been out of my control for too long. " created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:16:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'm going to go through the tedious job of changing the passwords on all my sensitive online accounts. That was overdue anyway. And next time a laptop blows its hard disk, I'm either going to replace it myself and shred the old disk, the same way I'd shred any sensitive documents before throwing them out, or just throw away the whole computer. I know this isn't green, but there seems to be no other course that's anything close to secure." created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:17:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And always be aware that you could lose a laptop, or it could be stolen. So far it seems that this is not yet an identity theft concern, but you can't be sure, and it won't be long before it is. " created="Sun, 23 Dec 2007 19:19:51 GMT"/>

					<outline text="2. The world that I hoped would come about did not.

					<outline text="4. If the bet had been held a year later, it seems there would be a pretty good chance that Martin would have won the bet because they recently took down the firewall at the Times, allowing search engines to index the full content. In the past, articles would remain visible for a couple of weeks then you'd have to pay money to access them. I believe they have a special deal with Google and other crawlers that allow them to get past the membership wall. For most of 2007 the Times articles were behind the firewall, and were less likely to be pointed to (which is how they rise in rank at Google)." created="Fri, 21 Dec 2007 17:36:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. It certainly is fun to speculate, but the decision about who won belongs exclusively to the Long Now Foundation.

					<outline text="The press and bloggers will run stories saying &quot;Spam Comes to Twitter&quot; and they'll be right, even though it won't be the main part of Twitter. Users will expect the company to do something about it, but I don't see what they can do other than eliminate the feature. Users will certainly want the ability to completely opt-out of replies."/>

Big diff. I would have to opt-in to see these messages in my stream. And if I got tired of it, I could opt-out. Spam is stuff that intrudes that you can't easily turn off.

I saw it as a solution to a problem we all have -- storage that scales up when needed, and scales down when not. Otherwise we all have to buy as much bandwidth as we need in peak periods. With S3, you pay for what you use. It makes storage for Internet services more rational. Later they did the same for processors and queuing. And a couple of days ago they announced a lightweight scalable database, using the same on-demand philosophy and simple architecture and API.

					<outline text="When I developed Frontier in the late 80s and early 90s my target platform was a modern desktop computer, a few megabytes of RAM, a half-gig of disk, a few megahertz CPU. A system capable of running Quark XPress, Hypercard or Filemaker. It would be used to develop apps that would drive desktop publishing. Later, it was used to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/clay/whatisclaybasket.html&quot;&gt;generate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/autowebdocs/whatisautoweb_119.html&quot;&gt;static websites&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/twentyFour/siteContents.html&quot;&gt;demonstration&lt;/a&gt; of democracy (a multi-author ultra-simple CMS), then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/frontier/admin/oldNewsPages/&quot;&gt;news sites&lt;/a&gt;, which became &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/aprilfool2007.html&quot;&gt;weblogs&lt;/a&gt;, then blogs, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://editthispage.com&quot;&gt;editthispage.com&lt;/a&gt;, Manila, weblogs.com, and that's when scaling became an issue.

					<outline text="A Manila server would work fine for a few thousand sites, but after that it would bog down because the architecture couldn't escape the confines of a single machine it was designed for in the 80s.

There's a serious economic and human wall here. You need to buy hardware and find the people who know how to make a database scale. The latter is the hard problem, the people are scarce and the big companies are bidding up the price for their time. Now Amazon is willing to sell you that, to turn this scarce thing into a commodity, at what likely is a very reasonable price. (Haven't had time to analyze this yet, but the other services are.) Key point, the wall is gone, replaced with a ramp. If you coded your database in Amazon to begin with you will never see the wall. As you need more capacity you have to do &lt;i&gt;nothing,&lt;/i&gt; other than pay your bill. " created="Sat, 15 Dec 2007 18:25:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, the design of Amazon's database is remarkably like the internal data structures of modern programming languages. Very much like a hash or a dictionary (what Perl and Python call these structures) or Frontier's tables, but unlike them, you can have multiple values with the same name. In this way it's like XML. I imagine all languages have had to accomodate this feature of XML (we did in Frontier), so they should all map pretty well on Amazon's structure. This was gutsy, and I think smart.

It's amazing that Microsoft and Google are sitting by and letting Amazon take &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; this ground in developer-land without even a hint of a response.

They're cloning Facebook so that their service will run Facebook apps. What this means, if they can pull it off, is that they won't have to fight to get support from developers. That's a big deal." created="Thu, 13 Dec 2007 03:25:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Google could have done this with OpenSocial. Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2007/12/13/canterpanel.gif&quot;&gt;panel&lt;/a&gt; assembled by Marc Canter at LeWeb3, I was reminded of every tech conference I've been to for almost 30 years. Some big company sitting in the center, and lots of smaller ones sucking up to them, not daring to say what's obvious, that the big company is only interested in limiting the growth of an upstart (not present on stage of course). That's where the Fear comes in Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. We don't say anything because we're too scared to. Even the outspoken Marc Canter, who's smart and has been around this block many times, doesn't dare say what's obvious. " created="Thu, 13 Dec 2007 03:26:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now Bebo decides to get in lockstep with Facebook, not Google. Of course! Facebook has the juice. But this is a dangerous place to be if Facebook doesn't want them there, and being a big company, they probably don't. The only value of having clones to FB is that it negates the threat from Google. Sometimes having clones is a good thing, but usually the clones take over the market. Witness MSIE and Netscape, and then Firefox. Compaq et al and IBM. dBASE and Fox. It's possible to depose an installed leader if it's possible to clone them. As a user and developer, I'd like to see FB be open to cloning. If I were a FB shareholder I'm not so sure." created="Thu, 13 Dec 2007 03:28:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One constituency that's &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; to like the existence of clones are Facebook developers. Without choice in platform vendors, they have nowhere to go when the sole vendor decides to take over their market. With a viable alternative, unless FB is incredibly aggressive and builds its competitive features so they can run on competitive platforms, at least developers will have a place to run their apps when FB encroaches." created="Thu, 13 Dec 2007 03:32:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Platforms are a game, like Risk, with rules and strategies. Google did not play the game wisely with OpenSocial. I chalk this up to inexperience on the part of the strategists. So far Facebook has been doing what's needed to keep its dominant position. Bebo deciding to clone the Facebook API ratifies that position, it's a gutsy move, but the best one available to them, and to other would-be Facebook competitors." created="Thu, 13 Dec 2007 03:34:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="PS: The news is slow to reach Europe. &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=60&quot;&gt;Facebook said&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that they support what Bebo is doing. Very enthusiastically. That should be the end of OpenSocial." created="Thu, 13 Dec 2007 03:49:31 GMT"/>

Mozart, Bach and Beethoven. You think there isn't any great literature out there on the web? I wouldn't be so sure about that. What if there is? And what if a baby born today becomes a great creative force? Or what if there's a social disaster like the Holocaust? Did you know that there are preserved diaries from pre-revolutionary America?

It's amazing how much work it takes to do this. In the end you strive to make it look so simple and install so easily that it seems obvious and trivial. But after all that, if it worked, people are creating in ways they weren't before. That's the gratification available to creativity. These days it's rarely rewarded with money. Okay, that's the way it goes, and in some sense is the way it's always been. The reward of art is insight. The reward of achievement is the possibility of more achievement.
