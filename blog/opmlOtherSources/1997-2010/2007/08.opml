When you put vendors on stage, they have to get their money's worth, it's their job. I know because I've spoken at many conferences as a vendor.

					<outline text="4. There are enormous economic incentives for companies that run social networks to not let users of other networks access their services. Shareholder value is a function of how many users they have, how they are &quot;monetized&quot; and how hard it is to switch. The harder it is to switch, the more money each user is worth. Any exec that did anything to decrease the number of users they control would probably be fired.

					<outline text="In the mess with Jason Calacanis, the subject of friendship kept coming up on his blog, and here as well. It seems that Jason and others expect something special because we're friends. But there are several kinds of friends, it seems,. At times I wanted there to be just &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/what-is-friendship/&quot;&gt;one kind&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually I threw in the towel and started, along with eveyrone else, using the term several ways." created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:12:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, there are real life friends. People who you commit to being intimate with, for a lifetime. Sure, they come and go, that's unavoidable -- people move away, people die -- but the intention is that we're going to share big chunks of our lives with each other, and trust each other to tell our whole truth. These are people who come visit you in the hospital when you look and feel like shit, they help you feel a little better. And vice versa. They're people you apologize to openly and fully when you fuck up. They're people you trust to see your darkness and lightness, knowing they won't abuse the trust. You can't have a lot of people who are friends in this way, if you dilute it too much, it stops being meaningful. " created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:14:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now it's possible to have simple affection without the trust, and that can be called friendship too.

					<outline text="And then there are the business relationships that are called friends. Just now on CNBC, I heard a banker say that another banker was a friend. I imagine that means they have dinner from time to time, speak well of each other, maybe exchange favors. These are also friends. It's in that sense that Calacanis and I were friends, along with many other people. " created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:17:59 GMT"/>

Usually it doesn't work, the thing that makes someone a friend doesn't turn out to be a good basis for business, and in the end you often lose a friend, and a business. But in the latter case that's all there is, business. In my mind it's not friendship, as much as an agreement to work together in some fashion. But let's not argue about it, if everyone else calls it friendship, I will to.

					<outline text="Now -- the big question -- which I have an answer to, btw, is do any of these kinds of friendships create a an obligation that you won't be openly critical of the person's work? I say no, because then you have to question your friend's motives, and who wants a friendship to be like that. Is this person choosing to be your friend so that you won't be able to criticize their product or employer? So that you'll only say positive things about their work? So, for example, I can be critical of Feedster, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Devine&quot;&gt;Betsy Devine&lt;/a&gt; will still be my friend (she worked for them at one time). " created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:20:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Yet, I feel compelled, when writing about a friend's efforts, to not only disclose the friendship (that's reasonable of course, it protects the reader) but also say that I really like the person I'm writing about, as if I would use this space to hurt them. I feel like a real chump when I do that, but given the atmosphere of the blogging world, I often feel compelled to do it anyway, so as not to start gossip that &quot;Dave doesn't like so and so anymore.&quot; A real friend, who knew me, would know that I would never intentionally use Scripting News that way, but there are readers who don't know and some who pretend they don't know." created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:22:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A sure way to become a former friend, is to say that I have an obligation to express my opinion privately. That was one of the most offensive things Calacanis said. Had his demo been private, and under non-disclosure, if it would have been inappropriate for me to write something &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; about the product, then I could understand his concern. But I have written about his product before, publicly. I didn't plan to write anything about more about it, but there I was at a conference, and he was explaining it, and I had a very strong reaction. When I'm exposed to something that's wrong, you can count on me to say so. Without that, this blog is nothing. And I don't sell &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; the right to tell me what I can and can't write about. And friendship is the worst excuse possible to say why I shouldn't write something. This supposed friend knows nothing about me if they think that will do anything other than provoke a very strong response of independence." created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:23:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I mention this not only in an effort to close the book on Calacanis (who btw could do this much more quickly by simply retracting the things he said that crossed the line), but also to lay the groundwork for me to write about Gnomedex. See, Ponzi and Chris are friends, and I have an idea that what I think of the conference could hurt their feelings. And as a friend, more of the personal kind than the business kind, I don't want to hurt their feelings. But, on the other hand, it is an industry event that I paid to go to. I don't go to very many conferences, and as it stands I will not go to Gnomedex next year. I'm sure some people will applaud this, and that's fine. Enjoy. But I have more to say about this, and I plan to. I just wanted to talk about friendship first." created="Fri, 17 Aug 2007 14:17:15 GMT"/>

So when it came our turn, I gave them a lot of ideas, I thought that most of them were pretty good, but even if they weren't, my intention was to help them.

I didn't realize it during the event, but found out afterwards, in kind of a roundabout way, I overheard a conversation between two Microsoft people saying some not very nice personal things about me. They knew I was in earshot, so I assumed they wanted me to hear this. I thought it was pretty cowardly, but it hurt anyway (I think that was the point, btw). It was a two-day event, so the second day I didn't say anything. I hoped that would make up for all the talking I did the day before.

					<outline text="Two events happened in Washington politics in the last couple of days that puzzled me: 1. Karl Rove, on his way out at the White House, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/08/14/hillary_the_rove_candidate_of.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Hillary Clinton is a &quot;a tough, tenacious, fatally flawed candidate;&quot; and 2. Douglas Lute, our &quot;war czar,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2172149/entry/0/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the option of restarting the draft was &quot;on the table.&quot;" created="Wed, 15 Aug 2007 15:02:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I figured out why the czar said what he said -- it's the military, sending a message to the President, in clear terms. We can't keep running the way we're running, and if you won't do something about the shortfall of soldiers for the war in Iraq (really an occupation, of course) we'll take the issue to the people, in a way you'll feel. No doubt, even talk of a return to the draft changes things. I think it's a good idea to talk about it, and quite possibly a good idea to reinstate it. That would get us out of this mode of life-as-usual. We are losing in Iraq, pointlessly, and eventually we're going to have to leave. Yes, cut and run is looking like the right way to go, esp when the cut part could be explained as &quot;cut our losses.&quot;" created="Wed, 15 Aug 2007 15:03:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Why Rove said what he said, though, is a total puzzle. I am uninspired by Clinton as a candidate, I think a vote for her is a vote for another four or eight years of not dealing with our problems, and she's the most Republican of the Democrats running. But Rove is no idiot, not about things like this, so he must figure that it would serve the Republicans if Hillary was the candidate, because that kind of hype really helps her. I found myself, inside, rallying behind Clinton because I so despise Rove. No kidding. So there must be some reason Rove thinks she'd be easier to beat than Edwards or Obama. Or maybe he's figured we all understand how his (twisted) mind works, and he's telling us this so we won't rally behind Clinton because secretly he knows she's the strongest Dem, and would much rather run against... Oh fuck it, this is pointless. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 15 Aug 2007 15:08:22 GMT"/>

It may require an agent to bridge the two systems, there doesn't seem to be much hope that they'll support identical APIs (though it's not too late for that), and at this time Facebook doesn't provide enough in the way of APIs to do this (please correct if wrong) while Twitter does." created="Wed, 15 Aug 2007 14:19:40 GMT"/>

The guys at Twitter do it, as do the guys at Facebook. It's seems to happen where ever there is expertise, a tendency to lock up power in the hands of the experts and not share it with competitors and smart users. I saw this happen in the medical industry, recently, where a friend who is not a doctor had an absolutely brilliant idea that would save lives, but he couldn't sell it to the medical profession. Why? It would create more work for them. These are the people we trust with our lives.

According to convention wisdom, Facebook was, until today, considered a sandbox, a walled garden, a silo. Now that we know that the feeds are being implemented (many are still needed to make it really open) it's possible for Facebook-generated data to percolate into other Internet applications. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://avc.blogs.com/&quot;&gt;Fred Wilson&lt;/a&gt; has wisely pointed out, there is no winner-take-all outcome possible, and closed sandboxes just encourage route-arounds, so what Facebook is doing is smart and necessary.

Instead of beating your breast about how great you are, try saying how great someone else is. Look for win-wins, make that your new religion.

As I said on Saturday, no matter how much we may dislike or distrust Google, they found that sweet spot, and they haven't wandered off it.

					<outline text="I drew a comparison to the explosive end of copy protection in the 1980s, but that's just one of many examples of the endless cycle of the tech industry. It's why we have booms and busts, it's how we achieve growth, how we shed layers in spring, and grow new fur in fall. Lock-in, it seems, will always be with us, if only so the users can express their independence by deleting it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Fri, 03 Aug 2007 13:19:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The first time I saw explosive deconstruction was in the late 70s and early 80s when the personal computer rose out of the ranks of hobbyists. I came of age in a university that only had mainframes in the early-mid 70s. I graduated and got a job in the timesharing industry, where we rented out computer time on our mainframes. At the same time, in New Mexico, of all places, another direction was being explored, the idea of a fractional horsepower computer, where each person would have their own machine all to themselves. This idea had legs, big ones. " created="Fri, 03 Aug 2007 13:20:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A few years later, after learning Unix in Madison, I had my own computer, a 64K black box running UCSD Pascal on top of CP/M. Then I got an Apple II, an Apple III, an IBM PC and off to the races. A boom. But the boom got extra lift from the arrogant denial of the titans of the mainframe and minicomputer eras. Had they embraced the change instead of resisting it, the boom would have been much softer. But that &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; happens, or so it seems. (Bill Gates swore he'd not fall victim to it, but he has, over and over.)" created="Fri, 03 Aug 2007 13:23:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So when people give reasons why lock-in is forever, that's just part of the transition. I also remember how the web got started, and how many people thought it wouldn't work (I was one of them, btw, but not for long). This time the lock-in is not in the computer, although that's starting to happen again (the iPhone is a great example, but it'll be a short-lived product, I think, kind of like the Apple III or the Newton). It's not about base-level networking or content or presentation formats, that's been settled too (HTML and HTTP and RSS). This time the lock-in is about identity.
