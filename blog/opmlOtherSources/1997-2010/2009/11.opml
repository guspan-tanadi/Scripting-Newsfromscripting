					<outline text="At some point in childhood we realize we don't have a clue what existence is about, or the limits of existence.

					<outline text="Every so often something happens, a family member or friend dies, and that makes the confusion come front and center. And once in a lifetime someone as close as a father dies, and that floors you. You get knocked down, and as you come back up, you're not the same person you were before. The mystery of life and the question of existence after life, they're always there, but they loom much larger after a loss." created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:37:20 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I think, by extrapolation, that every species thinks it's the highest form of life. Largely because they can't experience the existence of higher forms of life, even when they're there. " created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:47:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="An example. Think about a bird. We think we're more conscious and more intelligent than a bird. Maybe we are. But is the bird aware that we exist? Not sure about that. Maybe we're like weather to birds? Or earthquakes or locusts. Does the bird acknowlege our superior intellect? More doubtful. Now just go down the hierarchy a few steps and sooner or later you reach a species that isn't aware that we exist. And assume it's true that we are superior, that means that a superior form exists for them that they are not aware of. So now put your focus on the human species. How could it be that we are the most advanced species there is? That would seem pretty lucky. And if we weren't the most advanced, if there were superior beings walking among us, would we even be aware of them? I think we wouldn't." created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:48:28 GMT"/>

					<outline text="And with mysteries that we can identify but have no clue how to explain (like the conflicting theories of the universe that apply in black holes) -- is it impossible that there are species in the universe who have figured it out? And if they have, what capabilities does that knowledge give them that we can't even imagine? " created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:51:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Think back to the human species before Einstein formulated the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity&quot;&gt;Theory of Relativity&lt;/a&gt;. In some ways we haven't changed, but in others, we're a whole new species just because of that one discovery. " created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:52:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Physicists believe there is a theory that pulls all existence together into a single framework, and it's not hard to imagine that the knowledge that flows from that theory will lift our species to a new level. Maybe right there, at that moment, we will become a higher form of life? Hard to know until it happens." created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:53:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay, so what does all this mean? " created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:54:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Well, there's an arrogance to saying you know that there's no existence before or after life. That our soul, the core of our being, our awareness, is just wasted when we die. That there is no purpose to living. No purpose at all. It's arrogant to think you know that. Because the fact is you &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; know. " created="Thu, 26 Nov 2009 17:54:13 GMT"/>

And once a year, on Thanksgiving Day, thank the box, and hug someone close to you, eat too much food, watch some TV, go for a walk and get ready for Christmas.

					<outline text="Like everyone else, I'm peripherally following the fur flying about Murdoch thinking about whether or not to block Google from searching his news sites. In the background I keep wondering if this isn't all a misunderstanding. I mean, do a lot of people get their news on Google? That's a question."/>
					<outline text="Okay I know I'm not average, so I don't mean to say my experience is statistically significant. For all I know everyone else is getting their news on Google. But I really don't think so. Here's what I think."/>
					<outline text="I think other sites grabbed most of the flow in news before Google got around to doing news, and such habits are hard to break. I guess that Yahoo is still the leader in online news and CNN and MSN are #2 and #3. After that, there's a lot of noise. Somewhere down there is Google. In the dust."/>
					<outline text="People say silly things like Google would be nothing without the NY Times, but it wasn't until relatively recently that the Times let Google index their news stories. I know this because I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longbets.org/2&quot;&gt;Long Bet&lt;/a&gt; with Martin Nisenholtz that I won more or less by default. Times articles couldn't show up in the ranks on Google because the Times wouldn't let them! It was dumb not just cause it meant that Martin lost the bet, but it was dumb because they let Wikipedia become the authority on so many topics that the Times would have done a better job at, imho. And they were throwing away flow, and flow is money."/>
					<outline text="So I think a lot of this debate is uninformed and generating a bit of heat and not much else. Kind of like a lot of what passes for news these days."/>

In this case the dishonesty was reversed, the blogger wasn't at all heroic, and they misrepresented the hero, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Child&quot;&gt;Julia Child&lt;/a&gt;, who was, in many ways more of a true blogger than the blogger!

					<outline text="A blogger isn't just someone who uses blogging software, at least not to me. A blogger is someone who takes matters into his or her own hands.

					<outline text="The dishonesty in the story was how they portrayed Julia Child's reaction to Julie Powell's writing. They didn't explain &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; she disapproved. If you just went by what the movie said you could easily think she was bitter or closed-minded or jealous of young Julie. Luckily the archive is still on the web, and a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=did+julie+powell+meet+julia+child&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; turned up the answer. Julia Child considered &lt;i&gt;The Julie/Julia Project&lt;/i&gt; a stunt. She said of Powell: &quot;She would never really describe the end results, how delicious it was, and what she learned.&quot; There's a lot more in a Publisher Weekly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6671678.html?nid=4599&amp;source=link&amp;rid=840626276&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Judith Jones, Child's editor at Knopf.

Will a NY Times columnist be more likely to write about Twitter, if they've got a million followers from placement on the SUL? Is there an appearance of impropriety? Is appearance enough of a reason to opt out? In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/business/media/22steal.html&quot;&gt;article in today's NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, they say that Times reporters are not allowed to accept free trips to cover production of a television show in &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=bora+bora&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bora+Bora,+French+Polynesia&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=XYUJS-uNIY2-sgOwhOnACQ&amp;ved=0CBcQ8gEwAA&amp;z=13&quot;&gt;Bora Bora&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;The New York Times and many other media outlets ban the acceptance of these freebies on ethical grounds, because there could be an appearance of buying favorable coverage.&quot; To me, the free placement on the SUL and the benefits it bestows, are exactly equivalent. Elsewhere in the Times, and in many other media outlets, the number of followers is treated as a measure of relevance. " created="Sun, 22 Nov 2009 16:57:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Pieces like this always provoke challenges from people at the publications such as the Guardian and the Times. So be it.

My first answer was incomplete, I said I wanted an archive.

I hope that at some point we might swing back with everyone having their own home base and that we might still have the benefit of real-time updates, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; scatter the bits all over creation. I want the best of both worlds. A place where all my writing is collected and preserved and can be commented on, and having that same content appear in as many other places as people want to view it. This was the point of syndication in the first place, to give people lots of options for viewing.

					<outline text="This week I set a goal to get my next generation of editorial tools to a level where I could use them for almost everything I do online. Not yet for others to use, this is how I develop stuff. I do more than eat the dog food, think of it this way -- I am the dog. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 12 Nov 2009 18:57:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, while I have been writing very actively online for the last few days, very little of it has been appearing here at scripting.com. Eventually I'll figure out how to migrate so that it is. Right now the place to go for it all is &lt;a href=&quot;http://protoblogger.com/&quot;&gt;protoblogger.com&lt;/a&gt;. Which is an apt name, because I feel like what I'm doing now is the prototype for what blogging will be like in the future. " created="Thu, 12 Nov 2009 18:58:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Like the first generation, the new stuff mixes linkblogging and writing of longer posts."/>
					<outline text="The first time I did this stuff, it was easier, all the content flowed to one place, a static server that I ran."/>
					<outline text="In the second gen life was more complicated, I was running a dynamic server on the back-end (Manila) and using an outliner for the front-end."/>
					<outline text="Then I went back to static on the back end, which is how Scripting News currently runs. Then I stopped linkblogging here and started on Twitter, which still must be part of my work environment, but I have a lot more to say than fits easily in 140 characters. The challenge has been to create a tool that does both, in the same place, with agility. And empowers the author. And makes it easy to scatter the writing all over god's creation and at the same time create a feeling of &quot;home&quot; for the author."/>
					<outline text="After Automattic adopted rssCloud I decided to look at using wordpress.com as the back-end, rather with a static server. As I explored WordPress, I realized it could solve a huge amount of the problem for me, and I had no interest in doing yet another dynamic CMS, so I embarked down this path."/>
					<outline text="I gotta say, now that it's all working, it's very fucking cool."/>
					<outline text="I have 8 different WordPress blogs and my links flow through Twitter too, all from one window. This gives me so much more power than I had before, and I suspect a lot of other people are dealing with this kind of complexity too, but I am &lt;i&gt;managing&lt;/i&gt; it. I love the complexity instead of it being in my way. It took a lot of work, both conceptual and programming to get this right, but I'm there now."/>
					<outline text="Anyway there's no purpose to this post other than to Narrate My Work and let other developers know that this kind of editorial system is coming, and it has special needs on the back-end. There's no single rendering of the content, since it's scattered all over the place (the lifestyle of our time). But there is a new position for a static server that stores the user's full content flow. It's a low-tech workhorse of a server, but it's super-important." created="Thu, 12 Nov 2009 19:04:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have to maintain a server for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.lifeliner.org/dave/2009/11/11.opml&quot;&gt;unrendered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.lifeliner.org/dave/2009/11/12.opml&quot;&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;. That works fine for me, but won't work when I get users. So the back-ends should probably evolve to not just display the rendered HTML but to allow tools to store the source code for the writing along-side. That's how writing tools should be working, imho."/>
