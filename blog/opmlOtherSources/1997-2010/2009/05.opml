					<outline text="When I was a kid, in sixth grade in &lt;a href=&quot;http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/25/Q032/default.htm&quot;&gt;PS 32&lt;/a&gt; in Queens, there was a deal where we could get the NY Times for students. It was a special edition, with some of the big words edited out, or perhaps explained. I got it even though I had been reading the full adult version for a few years. " created="Sat, 30 May 2009 18:34:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We also had a weekly quiz that was written by someone at the Times. It was multiple choice and it indicated (I guess) whether or not you had read the Times that week. There was one question on one test that really caused me trouble. &lt;i&gt;What's the largest state in the US?&lt;/i&gt; There were four choices, and two of them were Alaska and California. That's a nightmare because they didn't say what the criteria was. Is it largest by area or population? So I chose Alaska, because I felt if you didn't say, it must mean area. Well that's not what they meant and I got the answer wrong. I protested to the teacher, who must have thought: Here's a teaching moment. So she asked me to write a letter to the Times, which I did. She mailed it for me." created="Sat, 30 May 2009 18:36:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0720.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/05/30/mwom.gif&quot; width=&quot;138&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named mwom.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now here's the part that taught me a lot about the Times, and how adults can be ridiculously rude to children. I decided at the time to remember this so when I was an adult I would treat children with respect, which I really try to do." created="Sat, 30 May 2009 18:40:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Times response came to my teacher, not me. They didn't like something about how I wrote my letter. And they didn't respond to the substance of the challenge. You may think it was a small point, but I was small then, and I wanted to know." created="Sat, 30 May 2009 18:41:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To this day, the Times has remained consistent and so have I. They generally talk over our heads, and respond to the manner in which the challenge is raised, not to its substance. I still keep trying to find new ways to approach this. I guess what I've been trying to say to the Times since sixth grade is this -- We are real people out here. Just like you. And we're smart. So let's talk, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1968575923&quot;&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; the attitude."/>
					<outline text="An afterthought: Everyone is inside some things and outside everything else. I have a funny story to go with this. In 2004, I was at Harvard and Scoble was at Microsoft. I don't know how it came up but my longtime friend threw a bit of tech industry FUD at me, so I threw some Ivy League FUD back at him. I said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=history+site%3Aharvard.edu&quot;&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; has been around since 1636 and pretty likely would be around long after Microsoft was gone, so don't try to push me around bud. We had a good laugh. (I think I also boasted that we had more cash than Bill Gates, but on reflection I doubt that was actually true.)" created="Sat, 30 May 2009 18:42:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I also became friends with Chris Lydon, who had been a Times reporter in the 1970s. He clued me into some of the culture from an insider's point of view. I also got to know Rebecca MacKinnon who had been a reporter for CNN in Japan, Korea and China. " created="Sat, 30 May 2009 23:03:21 GMT"/>

					<outline text="So if you've missed any episodes, or would just like to have a complete collection through last week, please go get it.

					<outline text="If you're new to BitTorrent, it's really easy. On the Mac, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transmissionbt.com/&quot;&gt;Transmission&lt;/a&gt; and on Windows, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/&quot;&gt;uTorrent&lt;/a&gt;. Just follow the instructions on the site to install, then click on the mininova.org link above and click on OK to the prompts that appear. It may take an hour or two to get all 135MB, so just leave it running in the background. Once it's finished, leave it running a little longer so that the next people can download it from you. It's a peer-to-peer system. " created="Sat, 30 May 2009 18:09:53 GMT"/>

And many of the most-followed Twitter users do that. You can see that if you look at the main 100TWT site, the posts of the 100 most popular Twitter users." created="Fri, 29 May 2009 22:49:38 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I wrote this app so I could get a sense of how these feeds were being used. Some even run outright ads in their feeds, not links to pages that have ads. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/adventuregirl&quot;&gt;AdventureGirl&lt;/a&gt;, with 493K followers, is an excellent example. " created="Fri, 29 May 2009 22:51:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Some people have said that being on the SUL is like being linked to, but I don't think so. There is no web equivalent to the SUL. It's as if Google seeded their search engine so that every web newbie, when they searched for anything, got 20 of 200 sites in every response. There would be no correlation between the sites returned and the query. Further, the power of these initial sites in recommending other sites would be almost absolute. New users wouldn't have any other way to find things on the web other than the first few sites they got in their very first Google search. It's so out-there that it's hard to even explain, the web could never have worked that way, people simply wouldn't have gotten the point." created="Fri, 29 May 2009 22:57:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another experiment would be to walk around the office and ask every Twitter user if they would mind having more followers. Don't say why you're asking, just ask. If they all say they don't care how many people follow them, I'll buy every one of them a bagel next time I'm in town." created="Fri, 29 May 2009 23:01:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I couldn't discuss this on Twitter because there's no way to explore any subtle subject 140 characters at a time. But I'm willing to discuss it here, as long as we're uncovering new ideas, and not rehashing stuff." created="Fri, 29 May 2009 23:02:36 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Then as now I saw the challenge as shortening the distance in time between a post and its appearance in the search engine. I called the idea then &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/07/26/JITSEs&quot;&gt;just in time search&lt;/a&gt;, it's the same idea that people call &quot;real time&quot; today. The term &quot;just in time&quot; was borrowed from the manufacturing world, where the goal is to have the components needed to build a product ready at the exact moment they are needed.

But the ideas discussed that day weren't implemented. I don't think this was anyone's fault because then it wasn't so easy to see exactly what was necessary. This was quite a bit before RSS solidified behind version 2.0, and weblogs.com hadn't fully bloomed yet. It may not have been obvious how to do it then, but today -- I believe it is.

					<outline text="1. When my blog updates I ping their server with the address of the RSS feed." created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:44:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. They read the feed, note the changes from the last time they read it, update their index." created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:45:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. On the other side, they allow users to subscribe to a set of RSS feeds they maintain, either on Google or elsewhere (using OPML subscription lists). Google provides an RSS feed that can be read every minute to get all changes to the aggregated feeds. " created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:45:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I know they already have elements of #3 implemented in Google Reader, that's good! " created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:46:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The whole thing needs to be tested, burned in and tweaked with clients that do more or less what Twitter does. How it works on the back-end is Google's business." created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:46:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If they want to do more, I don't have a problem with that. This is the part my software will use." created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:47:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I would like to see #1 based on the weblogs.com ping protocol, which included a REST interface. I'm not wed to any particular format other than it be as simple as it possibly can be and not dependent on toolkits or having any particular software installed. No opportunities for lock-in, nothing that isn't completely transparent and simple." created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:48:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then Google gets to do what Google does best, and what we depend on them for -- run a great search engine. They get all the updates flowing through their servers. Believe me, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; will support this. And the advantages for users are manifold. Wide choice of software to use. You can have a 140-char limit if you want, or not, if you don't, again -- your choice. You can include media objects, RSS fully provides for it, or you can choose not to. The whole point is to keep it super lightweight and give you all the choices. Let the market figure out where it goes, so we don't have to wait for any one person or group of people to figure it out. That's the Internet way of doing things." created="Thu, 28 May 2009 19:49:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I can be happy that at least I've written down the idea where all can see it. I don't know if anyone from Google reads my blog, or cares.

					<outline text="First an update on today's earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/24/googlesIncompleteSupportOf.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently Google Reader does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; support reading lists. I think when I asked the question, the 140-character limit on Twitter made it impossible for an accurate answer. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:44:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="No matter what, maybe it would be a good idea now to try to give a complete technical explanation of what a reading list is. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:45:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. There are many kinds of &quot;feed consumer&quot; apps, all of them are capable of supporting reading lists, not just feed readers or aggregators. In the rest of this piece I'll use the shorthand &quot;FC&quot; to refer to a feed consumer app." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:45:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. When you subscribe to a feed you're telling the FC that you want it to periodically read the contents of that feed and somehow act on the new items in the feed. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:48:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. A reading list contains a set of feeds. The format of a reading list is exactly the same as the OPML-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/spec2#subscriptionLists&quot;&gt;subscription list&lt;/a&gt; format that's supported by many FCs." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:49:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. When a FC subscribes to a readling list it does not import the feeds." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:50:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. When the FC checks for updates, it checks for new items in the feeds in the reading list.  Therefore it must keep a record of the feeds in the reading lists it is subscribed to. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:50:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="6. If a new feed appears in the reading list, it does whatever it does for a new feed. Many FCs will consider all the items in the feed as &quot;old&quot; the first time the feed is read, esp if it's a podcatcher." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:52:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="7. If a feed that was in the reading list has been removed, then the feed is not read and all record of the feed is erased from FC database, with the following exception. If a feed appears in two or more reading lists, a reference count must be maintained, and the feed is erased only when the reference count goes to zero." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:52:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="8. Obviously the user can subscribe to as many reading lists as he or she likes." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:53:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="9. The behavior I've described is how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsriver.org/&quot;&gt;NewsRiver aggregator&lt;/a&gt; that runs in the OPML Editor works. I suppose it's possible that other FCs work differently. If so, it would be great to hear about them. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 20:54:48 GMT"/>

So for example, I could let &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davosnewbies.com/&quot;&gt;Lance Knobel&lt;/a&gt;, an economist who I trust, choose the feeds I follow in his area of expertise. That way, when a new feed comes along, instead of sending me an email saying &quot;Hey Dave you might want to subscribe to this feed&quot; he can do it for me simply by adding it to his reading list. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:36:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Similarly, if a feed is no longer being updated, when Lance unsubs from it, so will I, automatically." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:27:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="You can think of reading lists as a &lt;i&gt;mutual fund of feeds.&lt;/i&gt; Busy people don't have time to research which feeds to follow and unfollow, so they delegate that to experts." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:27:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another application -- the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/data/Data&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; has a large number of feeds, some for special events like the Olympics or elections. They could have a reading list for all their feeds, and when one falls off, they'd remove it, and when a new one comes on, they could add it. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:27:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's an obvious extension to RSS, and to the ability to import and export OPML subscription lists. You can subscribe to a list of feeds in addition to individual feeds." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:28:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I'd love to provide reading lists for users of Google Reader, but I can't because they're using an incompatible format. This is absolutely the &lt;i&gt;wrong thing&lt;/i&gt; to do. When asked to explain why, Marks gives a nonsense answer about the OPML Editor, which this has nothing to do with. It's always a shame when technologists, who have to answer precisely to the computer, use political spin when talking to users." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:29:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, if Google plans to challenge Twitter, as I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/12/googleThisIsYourWakeupCall.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; I hope they do -- they will not get my support if they respond to Twitter's locked trunk with their own locked trunk. They must use RSS, OPML, Atom, everything they can find that there is even a bit of consensus for, including Twitter's API. They must achieve a remarkable level of compatibility to make the barrier to entry as low as it possibly can be and to send a signal that they just want to be a player in the market, not the dominator of the market." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:31:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Google's attitude in this area has been very unfortunate -- they've tended to be incompatible with existing formats whenever they can get away with it. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:32:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If Google had not invented a new format for reading lists, this would be a very different post. I'd be offering some reading lists of my own for their users to subscribe to, and encouraging my colleagues to do the same. I'd have written a howto that shows people what they need to do to create a reading list for Google Reader if they don't use Google Reader." created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:33:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's bad strategy to be gratuitously incompatible. It's also bad manners. Google was given a market for their reader built on open formats. They ought not consume that open-ness, they ought to at least preserve it, if not enhance it. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:34:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="However, I will sing their praises if they fix their implementation to use the same format we use for their implementation of reading lists. If not, we'll wait to see what their efforts to compete with Twitter look like. " created="Sun, 24 May 2009 15:35:21 GMT"/>

All of which says the investors in products like Tumblr are really smart, except they ought to offer more freedom than Twitter does and they don't appear to. It also suggests that Facebook, Movable Type and WordPress would be well-served to produce low-end products, ones that did just a little more than Twitter. The key here is to be, in every way, a Twitter clone, but relax some of the limits. I'd bet that the Twitter founders are wrong about 140 characters.  It may have been magic at one time, but that's the past.

					<outline text="4. Believe it or not, the tech industry doesn't know how to deliver news on the Internet. (Caveat: It's getting there.)" created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:35:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. This creates a vacuum that is being filled by what some call &quot;User Generated Content.&quot; I don't like that term. Instead, I call it &quot;Sources Go Direct.&quot; Same idea, but with more respect and emphasis on quality. Sure, some of the stuff you read online is crap, but some of it is the quality stuff we crave." created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:21:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now what is the Times? Here's what I think it is." created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:23:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's a somewhat tarnished brand that equates in people's minds to &quot;The Best in Journalism.&quot; It's not the printing press, the trucks, or even the editors and reporters. It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the logo and the tradition, the history. Whatever the Times does, it must not diminish the value of the brand, it must enhance it. The challenge is to tap into the enormous potential of the Internet as a news creation and delivery system. " created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:23:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Like it or not, and some Times reporters appear not to like it -- much of the value in the Times is captured by its sources. The reporters, when they're doing their best work, are facilitating the flow of ideas and information from sources to readers. And don't miss that the flow works the other way too, from readers back to sources. The newspapers have been complaining wildly about this, they say the bloggers get their ideas from news people. And who do you think the news people get &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; ideas from? And the truth is that a lot of the bloggers they don't like are also sources." created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:24:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="To understand how news works, you need to visualize a flow diagram that includes all the elements of the news process. All the people, not just the reporters and editors. That's where the growth is going to come from. " created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:26:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So basically the Times must evolve, just a little, to see their sources not just as quotes, but also as reporters with a beat -- their expertise. There's still enough shine in the Times rep that people could be enticed to write for the Times, for a fraction of what a reporter makes. Not for free, they must share in whatever revenue the Times gets from their work. But the Times is entitled to a cut, we &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; the Times to get a cut, because we want this system to go forward. Remember when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html#inspire&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; inspiration was going to be key to it, this is how you build it. By showing people how you are going to lead us to the future. So far, I hate to say it, but the news industry has been a huge stick in the mud when it comes to the future. Just getting rid of the drag would be enough to get us to open our wallets, a bit. But imagine if the news industry decided that news was exciting again! That would do a lot to inspire people." created="Fri, 15 May 2009 14:29:29 GMT"/>

					<outline text="When Google came along, the CEOs of the existing search companies didn't pay much attention. They probably didn't understand what was so exciting about Google. It was very much like the way the leaders of the minicomputer industry reacted to the early PC, at first dismissive, then with arrogance. Their products seemed to assume they would overcome the challenge, and none of them did. The only one to make the transition was IBM, and then a few years later they would try to lock in the users, and finally lose out to the new companies that had cloned their products." created="Wed, 13 May 2009 00:52:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Twitter is that kind of generational challenge to Google. They have no choice but the same one IBM had with the Apple II, and Microsoft had with Netscape.

It's not about Oprah or Ashton Kutcher, it's about the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://smithj676.blogspot.com/2009/05/new-york-times-reporters-twitter.html&quot;&gt;hundred NY Times reporters&lt;/a&gt; who are breaking their company's rules by using Twitter the way bloggers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2002/05/07/howToStartAWeblogforProfes.html&quot;&gt;telling&lt;/a&gt; them to use the web.

That wasn't the point. Google's search revenue won't feel the rise of Twitter for many more quarters. But the place people turn to for news is shifting. It never was Google, that wasn't something it ever did well. But it is something Twitter does, and at this point it doesn't do it very well. But the path is very clear, the information they need now flows through their servers. They just have to figure out the user interface. They will eventually figure it out. That's the half of the problem that Google already knows how to solve. But Google doesn't have the users. None of its products have the kind of flow that Twitter has, nor the growth that Twitter has. That's what Google has to get busy building. Once Twitter is delivering the news search that Google can't, it will be way too late. This is probably what the Google management doesn't understand because they aren't using Twitter themselves.

If so, then what's the problem? The same thing that's happening to all other centralized knowledge-based professions, where there used to be gatekeepers earning a living based on the high cost of distributing information. As the cost has come down, the jobs have disappeared. Journalists are not the first to be hit by this, and as I've said many times, my own short-lived profession, developing shrink-wrap software for PCs, was devastated by this a long time ago. I was lucky to have saved some money, and also have shifted what I do, so I've continued to make money over the years, even though today no one earns a living the way I did at the beginning of my career.

I've been part of the journalism system for my entire career. When I launched products in the 80s, I did it through that system. I did reasonably well at first, because the journos understood my product. It was designed for people like them. Later I developed products that weren't so easy for a liberal arts major to understand and they didn't fare as well. But by that time I had the ability to write publicly without going through the journalism system, so even though that door was largely closed, I was still able to get the word out -- and in so doing, defined a new kind of writing which came to be known as blogging." created="Sun, 10 May 2009 18:46:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Today's journalists are already an anachronism, and I think they know it, and that's why there's so much anger.

I'm not happy about that, but as an adult I accept it. The same kind of acceptance is required of everyone who earns a living in journalism. And the higher up the ladder you climbed in your career, the harder that must be to accept. I get it. " created="Sun, 10 May 2009 18:48:55 GMT"/>

I've watched them sell us out over and over to the huge corporations that run the tech business. There's not much love lost here for the journos. If they did the job they say they do, following the truth where ever it leads, we would have avoided a lot of problems. But they don't do that. They avoid risks, like most people. They aren't the swashbuckling and courageous investigators portrayed in the movies. They're gray, average people who feel &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1755299256&quot;&gt;superior&lt;/a&gt; to the rest of us. And that veneer is disappearing now.

When I use my laptop I can do all these things and watch a movie." created="Sun, 03 May 2009 19:27:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And I'm reminded how shitty the keyboard is on the iPhone, and think it's a paradox that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liliputing.com/2009/04/apple-netbooks-still-suck.html&quot;&gt;Apple's COO says&lt;/a&gt; netbooks have &quot;cramped&quot; keyboards. The iPod has the worst keyboard. Even if I type something correctly, there's a pretty good chance it'll change it to something ridiculous. When the Newton first came out people used to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/retro/timeline/90s/930827.html&quot;&gt;laugh&lt;/a&gt; at how it would mess things up. The iPod really isn't much better, but people stopped laughing. I wonder why? Cook is wrong -- my Eee PC has an infintely better keyboard than the iPhone, and you know something -- it costs &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than an iPhone too.

Since the magic of Twitter is, theoretically, in its limits, perhaps they should have a limit on who can join and under what circumstances. Perhaps before you can create a new account you have to name 20 people with Twitter accounts who you want to follow. They could be celebrities if you want, or spammers -- then at least the recommended users could be tailored to your interests. The algorithms that suggest new feeds kick in, and they are well understood, once you have a few seeds to get started. The one-size-fits-all approach obviously isn't working." created="Fri, 01 May 2009 20:19:10 GMT"/>
