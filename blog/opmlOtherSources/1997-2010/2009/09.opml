He does all his tweeting and friendfeeding from the iPhone. I find this both amazing and ridiculous. So many compromises. I guess Scoble values connectivity above all else, and wants to travel light.

I don't know enough about it to say for sure. " created="Tue, 29 Sep 2009 12:14:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Bookmarklets make a lot of things possible. If they don't work on the iPhone then Apple should get to it and make them work.

					<outline text="Which brings me to the point of the piece. Maybe Twitter clients are now mature and competitive enough of a market that they should support plug-ins of their own. It's the way things go. They are pretty much plug-ins themselves, but then so is Twitter a plug-in for the Internet, which is the end of the chain (it's not a plug-in for anything)." created="Tue, 29 Sep 2009 12:18:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If Seesmic supported plug-ins then they wouldn't have to wait for their competitors to beat them in the market before they implemented something. They wouldn't have to worry if it pissed off Ev or Biz, they could just shrug it off as something a developer did (whatever it is that pissed them off). " created="Tue, 29 Sep 2009 12:20:35 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I have four immediate priorities:" created="Sat, 26 Sep 2009 02:50:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Features that will make it possible for Google Reader and other large scale aggregators to wire into rssCloud. These are technical features, to most users they are details, but nonetheless are important. It must be possible for a server to register a notification request using a domain name, on behalf of another server. And along with this feature, most developers believe a stronger verification process is needed. I am one of them. Yet it must remain simple to implement, so the barrier to entry is as low as possible. There have been proposals in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.org/walkthrough/proposedChange.html&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; these &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-cloud/message/114&quot;&gt;areas&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Sat, 26 Sep 2009 02:50:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology&quot;&gt;Long-polling&lt;/a&gt; proxies for clients running on systems behind NATs or firewalls. This technology is well-understood, and a number of developers are working on solutions. I hope when code emerges, there will be an effort to make their interfaces compatible, so maximum interop can be achieved." created="Sat, 26 Sep 2009 02:54:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Conventions for naming, so that URLs can be mapped to names that are managed by DNS, the naming system of the Internet itself. I've done a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/09/20/dnsForRssFeeds.html&quot;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; in this area to get myself educated on the issues and learn how users and developers see this. " created="Sat, 26 Sep 2009 02:55:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. A high-level user-oriented vision statement for rssCloud with a roadmap for developers and marketers. My goal is to create an open loosely-coupled message network that achieves more or less what Twitter does, but in a decentralized manner. It must use the architecture of the Internet to achieve what Twitter achieves in a centralized fashion. No doubt there will be tradeoffs, some things the open network will do better, and other things that the centralized one will. This is similar to previous layers of the Internet, where systems like AOL and CompuServe provided more sophisticated features, where the World Wide Web was more low-tech, more basic. Both ways of doing things have advantages and survive to this day." created="Sat, 26 Sep 2009 02:56:40 GMT"/>

This would be a violation of the norms of the community. True, it would &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; be a violation of the open source license, and perhaps we should have one in the RSS community. But in both cases these licenses would be hard or impossible to enforce. I don't believe the GPL has ever been tested in court. And in the case of open formats and protocols, who knows if such restrictions would even be legal. But clearly the &quot;norms&quot; part of the argument is stronger than the legal one. If Google wants to be part of the RSS community, it should be respectful of it.

Certainly if they grow to a billion users and become the &quot;pulse of the planet&quot; -- as they've said they want to.

					<outline text="But even worse is that the company has not stayed out of the editorial flow of the community. At the beginning of the year, the basic metric, the Twitter equivalent of page-rank was follower count. Then all of a sudden some user's counts starting going up at an incredible rate. It came out that the company was recommending these people to new users. They were giving this flow to their friends, and to reporters who cover them, but not to people they don't know or don't like. They've even taken it away from reporters who have written stories they don't like. This is totally unacceptable, we've said so repeatedly. They ignore the concern.

That was the mistake Feedburner made. They thought 'Oh we can make a killing by snarfing up all the RSS.' No way Jose. That's a losing proposition. Luckily they got Google to give them $100 mill before the house of cards collapsed. They too put the brakes on growth.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/scoble_manila.jpg&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt; last night, he offered that Twitter would have to grow to the size of Google to handle all of RSS. I agreed, but said it would be worse. Twitter would have to grow to be the size of Google &lt;i&gt;overnight&lt;/i&gt; and without a revenue stream. Google got to grow with the web.

It also grew to huge size without a Fail Whale. RSS, in over ten years, has &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; gone down. Think about that for a moment.  That's because it was designed for growth from day one. Getting on the RSS bus can be as simple as putting a file on your Apache server. It's just another rendering of your content flow. It requires a fairly small commitment, you don't need tens of millions of dollars of venture capital to build out an RSS network. You can rent it from Amazon at pennies per gigabyte.

I use Twitter all the time, and I love it. I find that RSS and Twitter are a good combination.

					<outline text="Interestingly, rather than Twitter absorbing RSS, it may go the other way. Perhaps RSS will absorb Twitter. That's the idea behind rssCloud.

We had the exact same problem, and found a neat solution. At first the structure was strictly hierarchic. The sysop, me, would start a discussion area, and users would post questions or assertions as first-level subs. People would respond, and those would appear in reverse chronologic order as second-level subs. Responses to those would be third-level and so on. This was an early threaded discussion system. But how to find the new stuff? For that I added what I called a Msg Scanner, a reverse-chronolic browser that ignored structure. It would keep a bookmark for every user, a high-water-mark, and when you'd jump into the scanner that's where you'd start. You'd keep hitting Next until you reached the newest message. And here's the cool thing -- when you wanted to see the context, just type / and you'd switch over into the hierarchic structure, &lt;i&gt;on the same message. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Wed, 02 Sep 2009 18:49:26 GMT"/>

You don't really need more than air, food, water, a warm place to sleep, basic medical care. There are lots of things that are nice to have, like hugs and kisses and great sound systems and business-class-or-better.

					<outline text="Hate? People throw that word around far too casually. The other day a rep of SXSW said that I had hated on them because I suggested they were taking money to keep me off the speakers list since 1998 or so. I had asked many times why I couldn't get in, and was met with a stone wall. So like all human beings, my mind filled in the blanks. I asked to be enlightened, if it wasn't a payoff, what was it? I offered to run a retraction if they would tell me the real reason. Stone wall again. Oh well. I don't hate them. The word I would use to describe my feeling about SXSW is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=define:frustrated&quot;&gt;frustrated&lt;/a&gt;." created="Wed, 02 Sep 2009 16:06:34 GMT"/>

When I got fired as a Comcast customer, I was in contact with their Twitter caretakers. Not only couldn't they stop the Comcast machine from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+comcast&quot;&gt;chewing&lt;/a&gt; me up and spitting me out, they had the gall to say &lt;i&gt;they liked me&lt;/i&gt; while they were doing it!
