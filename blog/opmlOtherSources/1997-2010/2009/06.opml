Did the press do anything wrong in covering up the kidnap of a NY Times reporter by the Taliban? Assuming it wasn't wrong (since no one seems concerned) what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; over the line? What kind of person wouldn't receive this kind of favor? And then this morning we learn, from the NY Times, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/technology/internet/29wiki.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;Wikipedia did the same thing&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a much more complex affair. And this raises all kinds of other questions. What about when information on Wikipedia, true or not, hurts people in other ways? Why shouldn't anyone be able to get whatever they want redacted? I don't think there's a bit of difference between news organziations and Wikipedia. And let's hope they're ready with an answer, or are they just making it up as they go along?" created="Mon, 29 Jun 2009 08:37:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My feeling, Wikipedia suffers from the same centralization of authority as Twitter. No one should have the power that Jimmy Wales has, to shut down Wikipedia as a conduit for truth. It appears from the NYT story that, at times, they had verification that the reporter had been kidnapped. At that point, they had no choice but to include it, whether it jeopardized the reporter's life or not. It's a line you can't define, there must be many situations where the presence of information on Wikipedia puts people at risk, just as information on the web puts people at risk. The difference is there is no central authority on what belongs on the web, and there is one on Wikipedia." created="Mon, 29 Jun 2009 08:45:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Same problem on Twitter. Reading Fred Wilson's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/06/the-conversational-marketing-summit-interview.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with John Battelle, I'm horrified at how involved the management of Twitter feels in the flow of information and ideas on Twitter. If it were just the web, it wouldn't matter -- his opinion is just one person's opinion, and it can be balanced by other people's point of view. But in Twitter, some people's opinions are much more important than others' and Fred is one of those most important people. This is unacceptable. There's no other word for it. I have a feeling that when the reporters on Twitter are aware of this they won't like it either, but so far I don't think they are. " created="Mon, 29 Jun 2009 08:47:17 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Why 140 chars is like 48K" created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 13:51:44 GMT">
					<outline text="I love telling stories, especially ones with happy endings. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 13:51:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Once upon a time, way back in the early 80s, a young man (me) had written a program called ThinkTank. It ran on the Apple II, which only had 48K of memory -- not very much when you consider that an average PC today has 1 gigabyte -- or 21,845 times the memory if you can believe that!" created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 13:52:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="That's like comparing a single 140-char tweet to the Library of Congress." created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:02:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Apple II had an infintesmally small memory, but its disk was a little larger. So the operating system I used, the UCSD P-System, did &quot;overlays,&quot; which allowed big chunks of code to stay on disk until they were needed. When code in an overlay was called, the OS would throw out another chunk of code and replace it with the one you called. So, in the worst case, if a command needed code in two overlays to solve a problem that involved looping, the disk light would stay on for a long time while the computer &quot;thrashed&quot; out the answer. " created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:02:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This isn't unlike the way an Amazon Kindle keeps part of your library on its computer and part of it on the Kindle itself. When you want to read one of the books on their computer it just downloads it again, replacing something you haven't read in a while." created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:04:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This business of writing code in overlays was very taxing to the developer, because thrashing wasn't very good for the usability of the code, so you're always moving code between overlays, or making a copy of an often-used routine, all to prevent the disk light from coming on and thrashing the app (and its user) to a standstill." created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:05:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This clever code-writing is a lot like writing 140-character tweets today. You delete and abbreviate, throw out important ideas, all to fit into that tight little space. And then your readers, like the disk light, thrash with confusion, and think you're a fool, because you have to be a genius and a mind-reader to figure out the gibberish you wrote to fit in 140. Oy!!" created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:06:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, with the app in the Apple II days, it was often too much trouble to add the feature. With Twitter, it's often easier just to say nothing. And that's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the goal of blogging, macro or micro. The goal is to provide a platform for saying what you have to say, not for &lt;i&gt;not saying&lt;/i&gt; what you have to say! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:08:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, the Apple II story had a happy ending. It was called the IBM PC. Instead of 48K it had 640K. So when I recompiled my app for that machine I just threw out the overlays and let all the code reside in memory and the thing ran like a bat out of hell! I was finally able to finish the features I wanted, and instead of thinking the program just had potential, people loved it, and it sold, and we raised money, and everyone was happy.

					<outline text="First, almost anything above 140 would be seen by power Twitter users as an improvement, and a cause for celebration. It would be a sign that someone is listening. And it would immediately give us relief. It's as if, in 1981, Apple found a way to give us 72K instead of 48K. There would be a burst of creativity like the Summer of Love. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:35:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, here's what I would do first, to try to come up with the right number." created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:36:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Read the feeds of the NY Times, BBC, and a few other professional news sources for a few weeks, and count the characters in the &amp;lt;description&gt; elements of each &amp;lt;item&gt;. Average the number. Double it. That's what I would go with." created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:36:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The theory being, if professional writers can summarize a whole news article in, X characters, then the average person should be able to express an idea in 2X characters." created="Tue, 23 Jun 2009 14:37:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In my new &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/misc/riverExample.html&quot;&gt;River of News&lt;/a&gt;, I cut the intros off at 280 chars, arbitrarily, and it seems to work pretty well. Previous versions included full posts, and that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a problem, because some sites, like OpenLeft, write whole books in their posts. I also strip out markup. I'm tired of all the huge pictures people are throwing into the river. I see it as a gimmick to try to get more attention. I say let their ideas compete with everyone else's on a level playing field.

I was riding all over the place on the BART system and I could take the news with me. It didn't take me five minutes to realize it was the perfect River of News device, so I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/08.html#whatsNewForYourBlackberry&quot;&gt;adapted&lt;/a&gt; my NYT and BBC rivers to work in their browser." created="Tue, 16 Jun 2009 12:26:58 GMT"/>

I thought this was a bad idea, but I did it. I shouldn't have." created="Tue, 16 Jun 2009 12:29:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have no idea who was at the meeting, but the first thing they did was tell me about their upcoming mobile version of the Times that they had spent millions developing. Right off the bat I knew it had to be terrible. The only way to spend that much money on a mobile news site is to put all kinds of hurdles between the reader and the news. I said I had a totally simple way to do it that I had developed in a couple of days, by myself. (I lied, it actually took about an hour.) Then they asked what I wanted. I knew we were headed off a cliff. I said that isn't important, they pressed, I said yes -- I probably did want to be paid for my work. That was the end of the meeting. They were off the phone in less than a minute. I'm sure their version of the story will be different. But the net result was indisputable. They waited over three years before they had a reasonable way to deliver news to mobile users." created="Tue, 16 Jun 2009 12:30:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Yes I know they have millions of people reading their mobile site. But I'm talking about something else. I'm talking about the backbone of news delivery, and today that's indisputably Twitter. The stupid thing about our meeting, the lose-lose about it, is that right then and there we were on the edge of inventing it. And because I didn't get on a plane (my mistake) and because they had so much invested in doing it the wrong way (their mistake) we didn't do it." created="Tue, 16 Jun 2009 12:34:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So the first-level problem for the Times is they now are authors for Twitter, doing great work, and not being paid for it. Once again, they're going to be complaining, soon, that the tech industry is pocketing the profits while they do the work. (They'll be wrong, a lot of other people are working for free too.) The higher-level problem is they aren't competing. They're just sitting there. Spending money in obvious and wasteful Dilbert-like ways, and letting the small nimble competiton run circles around them. " created="Tue, 16 Jun 2009 12:35:27 GMT"/>

					<outline text="1. Until early this year, follower-count was evolving as a user-developed way for Twitter users to give authority to each other.

					<outline text="5. The reason follower-count was so big was its huge visibility in the user interface. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/06/14/followers.gif&quot;&gt;biggest number&lt;/a&gt; you'd see when you clicked on someone's profile. In FriendFeed, where follower-count is visible but fairly buried, it isn't a big part of the culture.

I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/sul/twitterCorp.html&quot;&gt;looked into&lt;/a&gt; the thought behind the SUL and found the same thing that the Times did. There is none.

This opens the door for Twitter's competitors to take advantage, and come up with a way to convey authority that isn't subject to gaming. No vendor should put their finger on the scale to favor one person or organization over another. I want a level playing field, I want as much of a chance as anyone else. When I find out someone else is cutting in line, I lose all interest. I have lost that kind of interest in follower-count. Give me another field to play on, this one is spoiled.

					<outline text="John Blossom: &quot;Journalists stay in business by cultivating relationships with sources - that's a pretty universal fact, not just with the tech press. It's always a dance to avoid getting too close and cushy for the sake of something less than pure motivations.

					<outline text="My response: &quot;John, that's why blogging took off -- because the tech press was so rotten with the vendors, they'd never say anything negative about them. So when you wanted to find out if a product really worked, you'd do what we do now -- listen to other users. Amazon built an empire on that idea. Of all the Web 2.0 companies they may be the only ones who get that the press doesn't control what users know anymore, that the users are getting it for themselves.&quot;" created="Fri, 12 Jun 2009 16:30:33 GMT"/>

					<outline text="These days the press can reform itself very quickly because the printing presses are very cheap. It cost News.com millions of dollars to start up in the 90s. TechCrunch started four years ago with nothing but a Wordpress installation and an entrepreneur with a little extra time.

To others it's a place to live, or a place to work. To others it's a cultural center. There's a huge freeway that passes through town, and a train line that goes to Chicago, New Orleans, New York, Seattle, Canada, probably everywhere else in the country. We have poverty and wealth. A new shopping district and an old one. Manufacturing, a winery, car dealers, biotech and computer firms. Some of the best public transit in the world.

I spent 20-plus years in Silicon Valley, it was the right place for me when I was an ambitious young man determined to prove his worth.

I could have had that in a variety of places but I chose Berkeley because it's beautiful, the politics are a good match (not in the cliche sense that rightwingers think) and the people who live here are intelligent, friendly, not pretentious and they don't work too hard, as a rule, so they have time to play."/>

I don't understand why a great city like Berkeley doesn't have a thriving and bustling downtown. With the great public transit and the world-class university, located in the middle of one of the most dynamic metropolitan areas of the world, why isn't the downtown a place more people want to come to, not just from within Berkeley but from all around the Bay Area, the state, the country, the world?

					<outline text="I've been posting links to new blog posts on Twitter since I started using it two years ago. It's just a natural thing, another step in the publishing process.

					<outline text="Step 2. Save. This publishes the piece to scripting.com, both on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;, and on its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/06/07/howNewspapersOughtToThinkO.html&quot;&gt;story page&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="Step 3. Build RSS. I know that many RSS clients will only read an item once, so I wait to rebuild the RSS that includes the new piece until it's pretty much finished. I might still add some pictures, or links or tweak up some wording, but by the time it goes out in the feed, it's not likely to change much." created="Sun, 07 Jun 2009 14:27:37 GMT"/>

					<outline text="This last step is relatively new, but its import is starting to settle in. In a real way a story isn't published until I've pushed it through Twitter. I expect over time, as more systems hook into Twitter, it will come to mean more. Of course I will, as long as Twitter has a 140-character limit, publish everything on the web and in RSS.

I think RSS is the most rational choice, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.opml.org/calendar/&quot;&gt;but I used OPML&lt;/a&gt;.

					<outline text="8. The most basic reason to do this is backup, and that was the original motivation in my suggestion, in the summer of 2008.

I fumbled." created="Tue, 02 Jun 2009 13:46:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It has bothered me ever since, but not as a front-burner thing -- I still accept the value of simplicity as a given. As I build layers of software, the simpler I make each layer, the higher I can build. If you don't design to hide complexity behind interfaces, you get overwhelmed by the complexity sooner, and your project can't do as much. Early in my career I often scrapped multiple levels and went down to the roots and rebuilt. Once I understood what the higher levels looked like, it exposed deficiencies in the lower levels. Reworking the lower levels allowed me to build higher. (It happens in other technologies too. For example, the design of office buildings changed radically once elevators had been invented.)" created="Tue, 02 Jun 2009 13:48:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The ultimate interface is where you pass off to another user, and a whole new human brain comes into it.

In the movies they call this &quot;suspension of disbelief.&quot; The user gets so wrapped up in the story they forget it's a movie. It starts feeling like life.

But if you're an innovator, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; have a choice. You can create new things with an emphasis on being understandable to the people who use them, not just at the surface level, but under the hood too. It often takes more work to make it hard to understand. But even if it takes more work, it's worth doing it simply, helping create the sense that technology is understandable, because imho that's the key to moving forward in a way that might just work.
