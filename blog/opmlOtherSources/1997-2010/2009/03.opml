It wasn't my first blog, it was the continuation of a stream of writing that began in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/&quot;&gt;October 1994&lt;/a&gt;.  And it doesn't really matter what day it started, because there is a continuing thread that ties it all together. It began with how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/29/platformischinesehousehold.html&quot;&gt;romance developers&lt;/a&gt;, and how Apple wasn't doing it, and how the leaders of the software industry were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet.html&quot;&gt;missing&lt;/a&gt; the big opportunities presented by the Internet.

It's something that Twitter never says. In fact they seem to go out of their way to chase off the people who helped them build their network into the powerhouse that it now is. Much the same way Apple, in 1994, before Jobs came back, was trying to chase off its developers.

					<outline text="For example -- this morning I left my hotel at 5AM to make a 7AM flight at SLC, to find it had snowed about a foot overnight and my rental car was covered with a huge amount of the stuff. So I wiped off as much as I could with my hands, trying to use the sleeve of my ski jacket as much as possible, but in the process my hands got incredibly cold. Too lazy to dig the gloves out of my ski bag, stuffed with all kinds of stufffff. Now I could see, so I skidded the car across the very wide street to a gas &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Salt+Lake+City,+UT+84101&amp;sll=40.749565,-111.894379&amp;sspn=0.008746,0.026565&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.75623,-111.89661&amp;spn=0.03875,0.106258&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=40.756287,-111.896526&amp;panoid=EKnyG9-k_OZgLGFOx_UTWg&amp;cbp=12,149.2832728137584,,0,-5.032310177705977&quot;&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; to fill up, where I used their squeegee to wipe off the remaining snow. Filled up the tank, and drove a few blocks to get on I-80W to the airport. As I was getting on the freeway I realized I didn't have headlights. But I'm now in the middle of a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Salt+Lake+City,+UT+84101&amp;sll=40.749565,-111.894379&amp;sspn=0.008746,0.026565&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.760651,-111.921158&amp;spn=0.034976,0.106258&amp;z=13&quot;&gt;cloverleaf&lt;/a&gt;, there's no place to pull over, so I decide to risk it, the airport is just a few exits down the highway. As I'm driving I realize now I have a little bit of headlights. Weird! Then a little more and then more, and then finally I realize what happened. When I knocked the snow off, they covered the headlights. This car, a Mercury Marquis, wasn't designed for snow? " created="Mon, 30 Mar 2009 17:00:35 GMT"/>

So I did a Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=speed+tes&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;speed test&quot; and clicked on the first three tests, Speakeasy, Speedtest and CNET. I wasn't expected to get infected, wasn't even thinking about it, so of course I didn't take notes. But a couple of them came up with empty frames after running their tests.

I remembered from last time that this rootkit virus patches the hosts file, and I didn't trust anything I had downloaded after the infection.

Ideally you only launch a browser once every time your machine boots.

Emotionally it's exhilirating, no matter how you're skiing. If I'm skiing poorly, like the first run of the day, I'm fearful of breaking something or looking terrible and wondering why I even came. But if I'm hitting all the marks, as I was toward the end of the morning, I'm feeling svelte, alive, on top of everything, important, masterful -- all kinds of very positiive stuff.

Not only will I be able to rely on other users to tell me which products are good, but I'll also know what products my friends are buying and liking. Scoble's example was picking a sushi restaurant on University Ave in Palo Alto. I could find Scoble's favorite, and Mike Arrington's, and Steve Jobs's, etc. That would carry extra weight, if I knew who the people doing the recommending are, even though Amazon's reviews are generally so good, I can get by  without knowing who the people are." created="Wed, 25 Mar 2009 18:14:28 GMT"/>

Not so unweildy, easier to remember my place if I get distracted. No paper to throw out when I'm done.I didn't have to stand in line at the news stand, or have exact change for the vending box.

The piece was a bit all over the map,  the author was having trouble coming to grips with a premise that I take for granted. Twitter &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a news system, today,  it will be more of a news system in the future, and whatever becomes of Twitter the company or their web service, the essentials of what Twitter does is an integral part of the news system of the future." created="Wed, 25 Mar 2009 15:09:46 GMT"/>

When I got to Starbucks after my stop at Target, I reported this on Twitter, along with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/3374405764/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; I had uploaded from the parking lot (it goes to Flickr and is automatically pushed to Twitter). Soon after reports came in from around the country about Target parking lots where other people lived. Now here's the point -- that's what network news used to simulate, by sending reporters to all the locations to find out what's going on. Instead we got the reports from the shoppers.

Later, in 2002, I urged the NY Times, who I was working with on RSS, to give blogs, under the NYT banner, to anyone who was quoted in a NYT piece. They could have, but didn't, take steps to move forward on new journalism. In my experience, if you participate in the movement that undermines your way of doing business, you have some say in how it evolves.

But there are lots of them who blog now, every one an expert, the kind of person news organizations quote. Now they're going direct, wholesale, and realtime with their observations. This is as it should be, and to the hand-wringers who think we're losing something in the transition to the new journalism, it's the other way around -- our horizons are expanding, the bottlenecks aren't just widening, they're being blown up.

My claim is they have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/12/whyItsTimeToBreakOutOfTwit.html&quot;&gt;screwed&lt;/a&gt; it up, by gifting some reporters with huge flow while leaving others out. No environment for journalism can do that, without immediately spawning competition. That's how confused the business people of journalism are, because near as I can tell, they are ceding the whole opportunity to a little tech company in SF that has a very weird idea how news works. They appear to think it exists to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10200438-2.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=Webware&quot;&gt;promote&lt;/a&gt; their product. That is far too narrow a definition. Twitter is very important now, but not that important long-term. Twitter is &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the answer to Jay's question about the shape of the new journalism.

He says that journalism is being replaced by nothing. This is why the press likes his piece so much, it's been their main theme: You'll miss us when we're gone. The problem with this thesis is that while the press has been declining a new decentralized press has been booting up. I talk about this toward the end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/03/17/ifYouDontLikeTheNews.html#p7&quot;&gt;today's piece&lt;/a&gt;. The sources who no longer trust the journos, or aren't being called by them when they have something to say, are going direct. This is what replaces journalism. It's happening everywhere (Shirky's piece is a great example of it). Sometimes the thing that's hardest to see is what's right in front of you." created="Tue, 17 Mar 2009 16:52:55 GMT"/>

They must have really sweated over that decision. " created="Sat, 14 Mar 2009 18:11:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Now that it behaves like Twitter, the other features come into play, ones I've been begging Twitter for since the beginning. The ability to enclose photos and video is essential. Why no MP3? Don't they love podcasts? I wish they would change that.

It doesn't seem to provide an inline player though.)" created="Sat, 14 Mar 2009 18:12:27 GMT"/>

If a real competitor came along that would create one possible answer, some of us would move there. Probably everyone would instantly get an account, if it were done right, some large number would stay there. If it had features that Twitter didn't have that were high value then it might suck a lot of the life out of Twitter." created="Thu, 12 Mar 2009 21:46:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It might mean lots of little Twitters. I'm starting &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.smallpicture.com/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; here on scripting.com, and in the first few hours of use it's already interesting. It wouldn't in any way be a replacement for Twitter. But it offers an alternative. Sort of like the difference between a blog and a big website, when blogs were just booting up in 1999 or so." created="Thu, 12 Mar 2009 21:47:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Or it could mean that Twitter voluntarily breaks itself up. Again I'm not sure what that means, but it could mean that Twitter stops having anything at all to do with the content of Twitter. Or it could split into two, CelebrityLand and LandOfThePeople. I don't see any of that as likely, but if I were part of their team, I would encourage them to look at doing to themselves what the competition is likely to do it. That can work out better, because then they get to do it on their own terms instead of the rougher treatment a competitor might offer." created="Thu, 12 Mar 2009 21:47:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Right now though, if Facebook offered a &quot;lite&quot; user interface that did just what Twitter does, plus a few nice extras, it would rule.

					<outline text="There was an event a few weeks back that convinced me that it's time to break out, like jailbreaking an iPhone.

Yesterday I was talking with a Twitter board member, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bijansabet.com/&quot;&gt;Bijan Sabet&lt;/a&gt;, someone who is becoming a personal friend, and said that it was good that the phone company wasn't part of the conversation.

People like Scoble, Guy Kawasaki, Jason Calacanis all viewed being at the top as a competitive thing, so they did what it took. Me, I just poured a lot of energy and creativity into it, and got the number of followers that comes from doing that. It's now approaching 20,000, which I am proud of, but it's not very much compared to the numbers of some people who did nothing other than be friends of Evan Williams to get hundreds of thousands of followers." created="Thu, 12 Mar 2009 13:27:46 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I don't have a quarrel with the people who got the boost, I think it's pretty clear none of them asked for it. I do think the company should have done this much more carefully. Now there's no way to put the toothpaste back in the tube. And the people who got the push have a problem if they are members of the press, because this gift they got from Twitter is worth money. It might be worth a lot of money. If one of them posts a pointer on a Twitter account it's going to get a lot of flow.

					<outline text="TechCrunch uses their Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/TechCrunch&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; to point to articles on their site, and every page has ads on it. So the gift from Twitter is worth dollars to them. It's hard to imagine them pulling punches when it comes to reviewing the company. But are they likely to be more kindly disposed to the company? It's hard to imagine when they're delivering so much free flow that doesn't earn them a warm space in your heart. " created="Thu, 12 Mar 2009 13:55:21 GMT"/>

It's an object database, scripting language, outline-based editor and database browser, debugger, multi-threaded runtime, verb set, Web CMS, TCP stack, built-in web server. It was the environment that XML-RPC, SOAP, RSS and of course OPML were developed in. All this and the whole download is about 5MB and it installs in a minute.

I love this enviroment, I built it starting in 1988 as the last programming environment I'd use, the one that had everything I wanted, and that's what it is.

I told them I live on a normal street, not on a hill, with not many trees (but some) and I could check with my neighbors, but I didn't think any of their cars were leaking.

					<outline text="One of my favorite blogsports for the last couple of years is pondering what Twitter is. Here are some of the things I've come up with:" created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:46:10 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I'm sure there are others, and as I think of them I'll add to the list. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:47:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But one thing I never thought of Twitter as was Poor Man's Email, which is how Google CEO Eric Schmidt &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/siliconalley/start_ups/google_ceo_twitter_a_poor_mans_email_system_2009_3.html&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; it to analysts yesterday. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:47:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My first inclination was to shout out something about Schmidt, but I held on to it, instead deciding to give it some thought and let other people go first. Surprisingly, there hasn't been much reaction." created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:48:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Schmidt has a PhD, and a long track record in the industry before he went to Google. I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/postulate#Noun&quot;&gt;postulate&lt;/a&gt; that if very few people do something then it must be hard, and therefore whoever is doing it must be smart. So when people say Steve Ballmer is dumb, I don't buy it. Same with Schmidt. So I wonder how calculated the statement is, or if I'm missing something -- because it never, ever occurred to me that Twitter was any kind of email, rich man's, poor man's or middle class. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:49:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I couldn't imagine two things being more different, Twitter and email." created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:51:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Twitter is primarily one-to-many, where email is primarily one-to-one. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:51:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Twitter is by default public, where email is by default private." created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:52:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Could you use email to implement something Twitter-like? Yes. Could you use Twitter to implement something email-like? Yes. But neither is the same as the other. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:52:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Schmidt talks about software the way I think about it. Once you have a base set of features it's an interesting puzzle to decide how to evolve it. There's no doubt Twitter has a tricky evolution in front of it. No matter what it does, it's likely to upset users, just as every Facebook move inspires an uprising. If Twitter had established a history of quick feature upgrades it would be a different story, but there were no new features in 2008, and so far none in 2009. That's a long time between changes. At some point they're going to add new features, if only to keep even with the competition that is sure to come. What they choose to do will set expectations for what's to come. The longer they wait, the harder it becomes." created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:53:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So Schmidt laid it out. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 13:56:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The key question is -- does the basic unit of Twitter change and if so, how? Is the 140-character limit sacred (my guess is yes). What metadata will accompany a twit? This is where it gets interesting. It's hard to imagine Twitter passing on the temptation to add location data to each message. What about the URL? Would they consider moving the link out of the 140 character space and making it part of the package? What about incorporating &quot;re-tweets&quot; into the architecture, instead of forcing users to invent new language, and using up another 20 characters of the 140 (by convention). They could make a lot of improvements if they added more structure to a tweet. I'm sure there are people of both minds inside the Twitter company. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 14:13:12 GMT"/>

If Google is preparing their own Twitter, what will it look like? Will it have a different, incompatible API? (My guess, probably. Google will make their own play for developers.) Will it have the same limits as Twitter? (Probably not. This is a very easy way to put pressure on Twitter, even when they have the installed base advantage. Users will say &quot;If Google can do it, why can't Twitter?&quot;)" created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 14:00:12 GMT"/>

Coke had a huge installed base of machines that could only serve 6.5-ounce nickel bottles, which they thought of as the perfect size for a cola drink. Pepsi thought 12-ounce bottles were better, so they came at Coke with the larger bottle. Coke was wrong, but it took a long time to figure it out. Eventually they threw out their machines and bottles and matched Pepsi. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 14:15:31 GMT"/>

					<outline text="This is why Google is likely to have a 160 character limit. (People who said Schmidt was in error didn't consider the possibility that it was a deliberate misstatement.) And it seems likely Google's Twitter will be based on GMail. (Paul Bucheit, a founder of FriendFeed, could probably comment on the likelihood of this working.)" created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 14:30:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Finally, I couldn't help but notice how similar Google's reaction to Twitter is to the reaction of all market leaders to initially successful upstarts. It's the same reaction Alta Vista and Yahoo had to Google when they were young. &quot;Search is only part of a portal,&quot; they sniffed. You can make a hugely long list of BigCo's that failed to understand the threat presented by upstarts, and lived to regret it. It's hard to think of a a single example of a BigCo that took a threat seriously when it (based on historical hindsight) needed to. Maybe this is because people like Schmidt, while they are educated, and intelligent, weren't there when their company was the upstart, and neither were most of the people there now. The institutional memory fades, and as it does, it creates the opportunity for the next generation? Perhaps. We'll get a chance to find out soon enough. " created="Wed, 04 Mar 2009 14:02:40 GMT"/>

We were always active participants in news, either by creating it or being effected by it. Before they rush around us to take our money from the government, how about a conversation first, ask us what we want from journalism, what we like and don't like -- and don't assume you know the answer.

					<outline text="I only did the interview as a favor to Ponzi, otherwise I never would have talked with the reporter.

					<outline text="I spoke with the reporter for about 45 minutes, most of which she spent grilling me about my conflicts of interest. That what was so funny. I was an unemployed wandering programmer-pundit. I didn't have a job or a company. I owned a bit of Apple stock (which I told her about) and some government bonds. Otherwise I had absolutely no business interests whatsoever. But somehow she thought that, by repeating questions, she'd get me to reveal some secret scandal that would uncover a nest of whatever relating to Ponzi's wedding? You're kidding, I kept saying. This is the biggest joke I've ever seen (and at one point I asked her if this was a prank call, something Ponzi dreamed up to &quot;get&quot; me, in which case I thought she was doing a great job).
