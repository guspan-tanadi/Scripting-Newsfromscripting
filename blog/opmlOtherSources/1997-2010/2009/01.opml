					<outline text="I'm lucky in many ways, one of those is that I have a good savings account that basically allowed me to retire at a very young age.

At that point I never once entertained the thought of buying bonds or stocks of any kind. Never mind the explanation of not knowing which banks had a dishonest balance sheet or toxic assets, I was basically keeping my assets in a shoebox under the bed. I was and still am totally risk averse. I won't lend my money to anyone, I'm keeping it all for myself. I don't care if I earn zero interest, or even negative interest. I want to hold, hold, hold.

					<outline text="In order to be a successful communicator, which I am -- you have to have a high degree of empathy. You have to be able to jump out of your own body and into the body of the reader, and imagine what it's like to read the words. The writer already knows what he or she is trying to communicate. The only way to judge writing, and thereby improve it, is to learn from people who are confused by it, who draw the wrong conclusion. You don't assume that they failed, quite the opposite, you try to learn how &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; failed. And then you incorporate that learning into your process." created="Sun, 25 Jan 2009 14:08:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The same is true for software design, for getting adoption for ideas like blogging and podcasting, and developer relations -- pushing for RSS, OPML, XML-RPC and SOAP.

					<outline text="Now for their own reasons, there have always been people who try to stand in the way. You can't get something new done without that happening.

When I was a grad student, working on my first outliner, everyone at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/&quot;&gt;UW&lt;/a&gt; was very supportive.

					<outline text="1. Guy Kawasaki. He's going to think I'm stroking him for saying this, but he got me my first look at the Mac, and my first Mac. Up until that point, there had been platform vendors who sought out developers, but they were of a previous generation, and didn't even remotely speak our language. Guy came to us, asked if we would develop for the Mac. Of course we would. We would have &lt;i&gt;begged&lt;/i&gt; to, we would have barked like dogs to get a pre-release Mac, but he didn't make us. A proud developer who feels appreciated can make great software. One who has to swallow his pride to get the gig -- not so much.  " created="Sun, 25 Jan 2009 02:40:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Guy Kawasaki. Now he's really going to think I'm stroking him. Guy not only spoke our language but he spoke Apple's language. When we needed to get things done inside Apple, he managed them on our behalf. Believe me that was necessary, because while a small number of people inside Apple wanted developer support, the company was leaning toward the very big developers, Lotus, Microsoft and Software Publishing. Guy believed in the little guys, like my team, and it turned out he was right and they were wrong. The products that made the Mac were ones no one had heard of: Aldus Pagemaker, Adobe Photoshop, Quark XPress, Filemaker, BBEdit, Macromind Director, 4D, Think C and Pascal. Borland, Ashton-Tate and the other BigCo's, the ones that Apple management courted, with the exception of Microsoft, never shipped anything worthy of the Mac.

					<outline text="It's a project I developed in parallel with Radio 8, in 2001. We used it internally at UserLand to coordinate work among the people on the team who were in California, Seattle, Boston, Vancouver and Germany. We were spread across a lot of time zones and geography, but our work was remarkably well coordinated because we had what I think is the best management technology ever. As the manager of the team, I can tell you I never had a better read on what my guys were doing. I could see progress on various sub-projects, get feedback from everyone, build consensus, spot problems. " created="Fri, 16 Jan 2009 17:48:16 GMT"/>

					<outline text="We tried to release it as a product, but it didn't catch on. Partly, I think, because people were using Radio as a web server, and it was confusing that it was also an outliner. The mode flip blew up the suspension of disbelief. You had to really understand the technology to make the switch." created="Fri, 16 Jan 2009 17:51:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="You also had to have a workgroup ready to use it, and that may have been the biggest reason it didn't gain traction. It wasn't hard for us to find individuals who were turned on by the idea, but when they in turn had to convince their co-workers to use the tool, that's when it fell down. It worked at UserLand because: 1. We were all techies. 2. I made it a requirement. 3. I was the boss. 4. But more importantly, I had their respect. And for some people it was impossible for them to get on board, they just weren't that organized or systematic in their work, but that may not have been apparent before we started using the Instant Outliner, it certainly became very apparent when we did. And it helped me, as the manager, know where I had to focus some attention, to help keep the individuals on track. Wouldn't have known it otherwise, esp in such a geographically diverse team." created="Fri, 16 Jan 2009 17:52:25 GMT"/>

During the Christmas break I took some time to convert it to run on top of FriendFeed's realtime API, and it make it much more efficient and much faster. They really do some good work down there at FF. Their back-end is a perfect match for the I/O front-end. (Which by the way, runs inside the OPML Editor.)" created="Fri, 16 Jan 2009 17:55:10 GMT"/>

They have a finite set of them, so any reporter only has to master the list, and then each politico he or she interviews is asked to recite his or her poetry about each item on the list. They judge the quality of the pol by the quality of their prose and how ruffled they get. The more ruffled, the more points for the journo, the less ruffled, the more for the politico. It's a game.

And I'm not using the plural in a regal sense, I very much do mean &quot;us&quot; -- as in me and you and a whole lot of other people. For example, in December, after seeing Tweetree, and having put a lot of work into systematizing thumbnail generation (with the ongoing help of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/66814300@N00/3053072642/&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in Turkey), I wanted to connect the two. So I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/12/28/bootstrappingThumbnailsFor.html&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; a way to do that. Immediately a flood of comments probing my decision, and a number of suggestions that I look at work done by others that I hadn't found when I looked. Now this process is not trivial, it's the equivalent of a reporter making dozens of phone calls to experts. Sure, I'm not probing their ethics, looking for malfeasance, whether or not they're bugging Watergate, or stealing funds from taxpayers or widows, instead -- &lt;i&gt;they're doing that to me.&lt;/i&gt; Which I've learned to live with, and see as a good thing. I know my heart is pure, but they don't, at least not at first. They are right to be suspicious of a fellow technologist. Many are corrupt. I've writen about that here. (Part of the reason there's so much corruption, btw, is that the professional press including some of the pubs we all revere, have been playing footsy with the industry for a long time. But that's another story, one often told here, btw, which has gotten me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/01/09/harryTrumanProbablyWouldHa.html#p1&quot;&gt;rep&lt;/a&gt; with the press for being an &quot;irascible gadfly.&quot;)" created="Sun, 11 Jan 2009 17:55:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, a comment left &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/12/28/bootstrappingThumbnailsFor.html#comment-4704091&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by a reader in December bothered me, so I looked into it and found he had something, so I revised my approach, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/01/09/bootstrappingThumbnailsRev.html&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the revision here, on Friday. Then another reader suggested I use a format that Digg had proposed, and I agreed, so -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/01/09/thumbnailsRev2.html&quot;&gt;another revision&lt;/a&gt;. Now here's a key point, in all the reporting I had done up till this point, I had never stumbled across this. It hadn't been reported on by pros as far as I could tell, and up till that point, none of my readers knew about it either. Is this an investigative process? Absolutely. Is it journalism? I don't see how it's any different from the best journalism done by the pros, except 1. it's done out in the open, that's an essential element, and 2. it's being done by people who do it for reasons other than being paid, directly, for it. To trivialize those reasons is to ignore why people want knowledge, to ignore the motivations of the sources and the readers, both of whom are essential to the news processs (though the journos are often loathe to acknowledge this), and neither of whom are paid for their efforts." created="Sun, 11 Jan 2009 17:59:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But even then the story is not over. Another reader says there's a mistake, the format wasn't authored by Digg, it was actually authored by Facebook! I did a bit of investigation and couldn't find a claim that they authored it, or a news report, but I did determine that they &lt;i&gt;supported&lt;/i&gt; it, by doing a test, that worked. We saw a citation on the Digg site that said that Facebook was the source, so that was good enough for me, and I revised my piece accordingly. (I allow myself that until the day closes, then if I want to revise I have to write another piece, like the one I'm doing now, that's why serious stories on Scripting News tend to come in a series.)" created="Sun, 11 Jan 2009 18:03:06 GMT"/>

A full week of work, with lots of human contact, research, sourcing, fact checking. I'm sure there will be some who say this doesn't belong in the circle in the middle of the continuum above, and I'm sure we'll get ample opportunity to discuss that, and learn from each other. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 11 Jan 2009 18:46:18 GMT"/>

Look at the trend. In the last year Twitter hasn't changed much on its face, but it has changed in substance. I have a lot more followers now, and I follow far more people. There are a lot of PR people there now, where it used to be gossip. There are also a lot more tech entrepreneurs, analysts and carpetbaggers, people who think there might be a business model in here somewhere.

Browsers have the ability to expand and collapse detail. Expect more of that. Services like Tweetree show that it's possible to include rich content inline with the twitstream. How far are we from having full blog posts? How far from being able to render the content in your own domain?
