He thinks it's the OPML Editor that's responsible for the disparity. But that's just plain wrong. I run exactly the same software on both the Mac and the Asus.

It could be that Evan Williams and his team have the competitive instincts of a Gates or Jobs, if so, they certainly have a few tricks up their sleeves, or they wouldn't have done these deals. They better, because Google and Microsoft are almost surely executing an Embrace &amp; Extend. What that means for Twitter is that they have clones of Twitter in development. The race is certainly on. Have they cross-licensed their streams? In other words, does Twitter have reciprocal rights to any realtime content generated by users of Google's TwitterLand? Microsoft's? Even if they do, could they handle the load? My guess is that both Google and Microsoft will quickly take the search function away from Twitter. Now everyone has the Twitter stream.

Everything from newsletters to nightly news. Everything flows through the same pipes, and curators pick off the good stuff and route it to people who are interested. This is the way news is done from here-on. We're not talking about the future, we're talking about &lt;i&gt;now.&lt;/i&gt; And the moguls of the media industry, without a single leader thinking in advance of the wave, are sitting on the sidelines, hoping someone will give them some money because they're such great writers or whatever it is they're so great at.

It was like a file system within a file, but not quite. " created="Tue, 20 Oct 2009 21:46:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Resources had a type and an id. The type was a four-character string, and the ID was a number.

There was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macos.utah.edu/documentation/system_deployment/revrdist/resedit_hacks.html&quot;&gt;resource editor&lt;/a&gt; that shipped with the OS that had tools for the standard system types, the menu editor let you add a command to a menu or delete a command. The window editor let you set the default size of the window, its initial title, and what WDEF routine was responsible for drawing it. A big part of learning how to program the Mac was learning what all the resources were and how to set them up. Then you'd write C or Pascal code to open the windows or draw the menus.

So if I wanted to write a DAVE resource to my file I could.

The title of my talk, suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/carlacasilli&quot;&gt;Carla Casilli&lt;/a&gt;, is: &quot;How I learned to stop worrying and love the Fail Whale.&quot; It's a ripoff of the sub-title of one of the greatest movies of all time, Stanley Kubrick's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove&quot;&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/a&gt;.

And it's about the metadata that I wish to ask the inverted question. But first, I'd ask you to click on the small picture below, and go to Flickr and look at all the metadata that's assembled around a picture of my aunt and uncle taken by my mother sometime in the late 70s or early 80s." created="Fri, 16 Oct 2009 15:52:55 GMT"/>

					<outline text="What a rich collection of information there is. Yet you could imagine more, yes? If you read the paragraph that introduces the picture you'll see that there's some data that isn't reflected in the Flickr database. It was taken by my mother, and the two people in the picture are related to both of us. One by blood (the man, my uncle Ken) and one because she is married to the other (my aunt Dot). That data is missing probably because Flickr stopped actively evolving before social networking had fully gained a foothold in online culture. Same with the web itself. Wouldn't it be cool if a pointer could imply a familial relationship? I know that's what &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;TBL&lt;/a&gt; has been talking about.

					<outline text="Anyway, if you go crazy and try to imagine what Twitter might become, you can see that a lot of what it is is in the Flickr metadata without the thing in the middle -- the picture. I've been urging Twitter to support &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/09/28/payloadsForTwitter.html&quot;&gt;payloads&lt;/a&gt; for years now. I can't imagine why they're not doing it. One piece of metadata is all that's needed, minimally, the URL pointing to the picture. Today we have to cram it into the 140 characters. Meanwhile they're advancing, adding geographic data and lists and retweets, all of which add little bits of data to a tweet, but for some reason they won't add the url. Which gets back to the question. Can you imagine that Twitter will never get this feature? No, of course not. It will someday get it. Why not get it over with?" created="Fri, 16 Oct 2009 15:57:44 GMT"/>

I'm often in the chorus with the story everyone is reacting to, including the guy who got top billing. I don't know how this happens, but it's a large part of why I block their bot.

It is not. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard&quot;&gt;Read up on robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; if you don't believe me.

A Taiwanese airline named Susa discovered a way to do it for $600, which was still a lot cheaper than the airlines could get you to Italy or Spain for. Huge numbers of people signed up and the airline bustled with new business. People came home from their holidays and told everyone that they had a great trip. And with the new economies of scale Susa was able to get the price down to $350. Not the $100 that the MIT professor promised, but still cheap enough that lots more people could have a vacation, and while some people still went on the more expensive and luxurious airlines, more and more people were flying Susa." created="Wed, 14 Oct 2009 15:39:10 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Other projects are consuming more of my time. And in the last couple of months, family stuff has taken me away from Berkeley, and I'm not sure where my attention will be in the future. So a big part of my decision to move on is personal. " created="Tue, 13 Oct 2009 15:01:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But I've also learned why sites that we're calling &quot;hyperlocal&quot; are difficult, and why I failed to get the site to grow the way I hoped it would. " created="Tue, 13 Oct 2009 15:02:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I thought we could apply the same approach that worked in bootstrapping weblogs, RSS and podcasting for a local site. One or two people start writing about their personal experiences. A small audience develops. Debates, discussions follow. More perspectives. At every step you invite people to participate. You always ask for the people who used to be called the audience to become full participants. That's how the idea scales. As I said, it worked for blogging and related technologies." created="Tue, 13 Oct 2009 15:03:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Instead, what happened at InBerkeley.com is that the people thought we were running a news organization, and they did stories the way reporters do them. That can't possibly work, imho -- for the same reason the news industry is in crisis. " created="Tue, 13 Oct 2009 15:06:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="An example. Suppose you're writing a story about a parade on Shattuck Ave at noon and you don't happen to be there, you just heard about it from a friend, but feel you have enough information to write a story. Now you want a picture for the story -- in fact, you think that without a picture you &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; run the story. The reporter will hold it, but the blogger runs it anyway, and at the end asks if anyone has a picture. It's that little difference that makes the hyperlocal idea scale, and it's what my colleagues at InBerkeley were unwilling to do." created="Tue, 13 Oct 2009 15:09:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Instead, we got in trouble, twice, for taking copyrighted material from other sites. The first time it happened, I apologized, and nothing terrible happened.

It's actually a collection of documents that can be transferred from one machine to another over a network.

Even the wood, glass and concrete that makes up a &quot;house&quot; is something that is given meaning by a piece of paper that says Phil owns it, and not a poor family in downtown Salt Lake City. Why should he get to live in that collection of wood and concrete, stay warm in the Utah winter, when other people are cold and go hungry? Because we have conventions. And Phil, even though he doesn't trust government, depends on government to keep him in his house. Otherwise he would surely be out on the street.

I get to take risky positions, ones that are complicated to explain because I know that here, unlike almost everywhere else, I get to finish a thought. There are so many places for &quot;conversation&quot; -- virtually everywhere. I like my website because it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; one of those places.
