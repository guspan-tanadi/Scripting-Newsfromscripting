But as an adult, which I am now, I am capable of seduction. And you couldn't launch something like RSS or podcasting, without the ability to seduce people. Because they won't move unless they get what they want, the way they want it. It never occurs to young males to seduce, because to get what they want they just have to look young and virile. Which they are very good at! If an older male wants to get some action he has to seduce. Therefore evolution taught at least some of us to do this.

It pretty much failed. Some people wore watches with keypads, presumably so they could do calculations or write memos.

The display should be the whole watch face, not a sliver of tiny text beneath an analog watch face. And it's nice they can show you the caller ID, but I don't get nearly as many phone calls as text messages. A watch could display 140 characters, if you temporarily displace the time display (until you click the face to dismiss). The ones that try to be an MP3 player or cell phone are just as ridiculous and doomed to fail as the smart watches of the 90s." created="Thu, 31 Dec 2009 14:25:59 GMT"/>

					<outline text="1. There is support for not normalizing the items, and that is still the plan. It's true, there's a lot of code out there that understands all the varieties of RSS and Atom. I've been saying that all along! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 27 Dec 2009 17:23:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reason to do fatPing is to start a bootstrap that makes everything more efficient. In this, the leadership will come from the content systems and the aggregators." created="Sun, 27 Dec 2009 17:47:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. I've made a change to the body of the fatPing element. Instead of including the XML elements inline, I encode the text and pass it as CDATA. This means that it will make it through XML parsers that care about namespaces being declared. An example, I was passing through an item from the TechCrunch &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; (they support rssCloud, btw) and they have elements from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/&quot;&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt; namespace. My packet doesn't declare this namespace, so the Firefox XML parser declares it invalid (they're right about that). I have to encode the text because they might include CDATA elements, and that would break the XML. Let's see if this works! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sun, 27 Dec 2009 17:24:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. The point has been raised that there is no &quot;standard&quot; way to include a &amp;lt;cloud&gt; element in Atom feeds. As I said in the comments, I will not be the person to dictate that, or suggest a way to do it, even mildly. I've learned that Atom is a 300-degree stove. When I touch it I get burned. However, I am the author of an aggregator that consumes Atom feeds. If you are the author of software that creates Atom feeds, you could (just saying hypothtetically) create a namespace that contains the &amp;lt;cloud&gt; element in it, as spec'd by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html&quot;&gt;RSS 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, and include it in your feed. If you told me about it, I could implement support for it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsriver.org/river2&quot;&gt;River2&lt;/a&gt;. That way we keep it all among implementors. There can be no doubt that you have the right to do that, and I have the right to support it.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.org/cloudpipe.html#narrative&quot;&gt;It says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When the server detects a change in a feed the client is subscribed to, either through polling or notification, it sends a packet to the client indicating the feed has changed. The client then reads the feed, and processes it the same way it would if it had detected the change through polling.&quot;" created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 18:43:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The client may read the feed but I implemented and will specify a &quot;fat ping.&quot; Along with the URL of the feed, we send the content of the item.

(This should answer in advance the question of how many items may be contained in a ping -- one and only one.)" created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 18:44:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I went this way for two reasons:" created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 18:46:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Competitive -- It's often mentioned as the reason people prefer PubSubHubBub over rssCloud. By providing for a fat ping, we erase that advantage. Now the two methods are at least at parity, with an edge to rssCloud because, once CloudPipe is done, it will work for clients that are behind firewalls and NAT, and PSHB does not." created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 18:46:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Efficiency -- I learned when I met with the Tumblr guys in NY earlier this month that their feeds get pounded. The number one most referenced pages on their sites are the feeds. When I was running UserLand, it never was an issue, but we had a very small fraction of the traffic that Tumblr, WordPress, Blogger, Typepad etc have. Now that I know it is an issue, I want to address it. By sending the content along with the ping, in the realtime layer that's building now there will be fewer feed reads." created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 18:48:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now there's the question of whether to normalize the contents of an item. I can do it, but it might be a politically sensitive issue. Right now I have bigger fish to fry, so I won't normalize items, what you get in the fat ping is exactly what the feed broadcast. You'll have to deal with all the variability that can appear in the various flavors of RSS and Atom. I could make it so you didn't have to, but... We'll get to that later." created="Sat, 26 Dec 2009 18:50:24 GMT"/>

				<outline text="How I develop formats and protocols" created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:07:34 GMT" name="howIDevelopFormatsAndProtocols" type="outline">
					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/12/23/hope.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named hope.jpg&quot;&gt;I don't think I've ever written a blog post that explains how I develop formats and protocols, probably because I was afraid of getting flamed. Nowadays I'm not so afraid, so here's how I do it." created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:09:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. First, I have to understand the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsscloud.org/cloudpipe.html&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt;. That might take a month or more of walking around Berkeley or New York listening to music and podcasts. When I finally feel I grok it enough to begin coding, I need to have at least two apps. One that produces the format and one that consumes it. So I start by writing very simple versions of those apps and usually run them on the same machine to make debugging easier." created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:10:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. I connect them with a protocol that I know won't be the one I will use, but models it in some fashion. In the app I'm working on now, I had the server wait a random amount of time before returning the name of one of the 50 states chosen at random. On the client side, I have it open a connection to the server and wait until it gets an answer, which it just records in the database." created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:11:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Once I have the two apps conversing this way, I start to make the conversation meaningful. I take my time, really slow down and think, try out lots of approaches. I also do a lot of prior art searches to see if I can pick up ideas from people who came before. In this case, I looked at FriendFeed's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/10/22/friendfeedsNewRealtimeApi.html&quot;&gt;realtime API&lt;/a&gt;, but I came up with something that's a bit simpler. It could be that the previous protocol can do more than mine, but I just wanted to flow updates across firewalls and NATs. (Even so, my protocol has a lot of room for growth.)" created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:09:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Once I've settled on the format, and this could take a few days, I then split the apps between a real server and client and start to test it doing the work it was intended to do. Since I haven't done that yet, I can't tell you how it will go. I might loop back to step 3 and change the format based on what I've learned. I will certainly add logging features and metadata to the payload to enable debugging and performance monitoring. " created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:14:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. Once I'm satisfied that it works, I write an informal document for discussion and review. I don't sneak a look to friends or people I like. If I did, that would violate the very important principle of keeping the playing field level. Instead I'll post the document publicly and post pointers in various places, on the rssCloud mail list, on Twitter, probably on the Frontier-Kernel list since I'm trying to reactivate that community after a long period of staying out of it.

We can't &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnW6x7UUokg&quot;&gt;mind-meld&lt;/a&gt; like Vulcans. I require solitary thinking time to figure stuff out. So while people have a chance to spot problems in my proposed formats and protocols, there really isn't much room to argue over the minute details. There are always two or more ways to do something. Instead of calling a packet a &amp;lt;packet&gt; I could call it a &amp;lt;blob&gt; but what difference would that make?" created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:19:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have participated in the working group style of format definition, what I called the &quot;deliberative approach&quot; in yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/12/22/openIsInTheEyeOfTheBeholde.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;. But I don't like the results that come from that. I believe in designing these bits of tech as much as Jonathan Ive would design a new iPod or BMW would design a driving machine. To me this is an art, and in art there are always choices, and someone has to make them. " created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:21:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The deliberative process is all about &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; making choices, putting all the possible ways of doing something in the spec. This gives an ego boost to the people on the working group, and a lot of grief to the engineers who have to deploy. In the end you have multiple profiles and lots of missed opportunities for interop. Having one person act as designer may hurt some egos, but the format works better in the real world. " created="Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:47:47 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Anyway, the answer: &lt;i&gt;Technology is important because it empowers people.&lt;/i&gt; That's where you start.

Even when it would have been in the interests of developers to work with each other, each of them tried to do special deals with Apple. Of course no one really got those deals, so we all went down. But it's human nature to think you're special and if you play nice with the platform vendor, they'll play nice with you. And the platform vendor may totally mean to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; nice, but they can't help acting in their own self-interest and that almost always is at the expense of the developers.

They wouldn't try to guess what would make the platform vendor happy, and instead follow the grain of the Internet, or go where the users want to go, or some users, or to scratch their own itch.

					<outline text="I'm not even 100 percent sure what I'm asking for, but I'll know it when I see it. Probably a JavaScript framework that comes with a Twitter timeline object. So displaying a timeline is automatic as are the user interactions. So any kind of client, one written in any language -- Python, Perl, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C, etc -- could store data in it. It wouldn't know anything about the Twitter API. It would be up to the applications to put data in the structure. " created="Tue, 01 Dec 2009 18:20:02 GMT"/>
