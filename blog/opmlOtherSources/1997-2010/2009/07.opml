					<outline text="1. Be a user. Develop apps you yourself have a use for. If you don't have a feeling for what it's like to be a user, you'll never know how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware.html&quot;&gt;evolve&lt;/a&gt; the products, and the stuff you learn in #2 will never make sense." created="Wed, 29 Jul 2009 21:42:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Listen to users. Learning how to code is straightforward, it takes time to perfect your skills, but it's relatively easy compared to the skill of listening. I recently suggested to a VC friend that we start a company whose sole differentiator is that it strives to perfect the art of listening to users. I feel that it would pretty much have the market of user-driven tech to itself. This doesn't mean that you get your drive from users, that has to come from your creativity, but it does mean you get your &lt;i&gt;grounding&lt;/i&gt; from them. Without connecting with users, your products have no purpose. " created="Wed, 29 Jul 2009 21:43:23 GMT"/>

But I had been waiting so long -- it was becoming apparent that I would never get to develop them. So I wrote emails about them, and sent them to all the people I knew from various industry events. What came back often were ideas that built on them. And eventually some of the products did get built. So the idea of dumping ideas publicly, ones that aren't doing you any good, is solid." created="Sun, 26 Jul 2009 18:41:43 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Here's the idea -- if the search engine knew a little about me, it could give more relevant answers. But it's too much trouble to enter demographic info, and I might not want to share that with the search engine company. But... There's a single piece of data that unlocks a vast trove of preference information -- the address of my weblog. From that it would be obvious that I live in the Bay Area and am involved in tech. So when I ask about New York style pizza, you might include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=Berkeley+New+York-style+pizza&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley in the search results.

But that's less true every year, as new channels of news have developed, channels that the NYT (not so much the Post) are just &lt;i&gt;starting&lt;/i&gt; to participate in. Watch out as that develops, because it's a potent combination. News people immersed in a sea of news makers.

If you click on it, guess what, it installs the app. A confirmation dialog appears, making sure that's what you want to do. And if the app requires you to set some prefs, a page where you enter those prefs appears. " created="Fri, 10 Jul 2009 18:09:42 GMT"/>

					<outline text="It's nice that they track sources other than Twitter, like this blog's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.

The ideal of having search be up-to-the-minute accurate is an important one. It's just that no one is there yet. And 140-char tweets all repeating the same thing over and over and then retweeting those same things, well that hardly counts as information.

Often on my European travels I end up exiting through Amsterdam or London with time to kill at Schipol or Heathrow, and they are completely chaotic toon-town messes. In comparison, the pace at CPH is leisurely and the Danish of course are great designers, so the place is super-comfortable and pleasing to the eye. " created="Wed, 01 Jul 2009 08:31:52 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Berlin is to Germany what New York and Washington are to the US. It's both the capital and the cultural and business center. The place is bathing in history, and change. Just 20 years ago when the wall came down, the place was very different. Now what remains of the division is in photographs and video. I stayed in what used to be the eastern sector, but you couldn't tell. It was hard to imagine how the plush surroundings had been transformed so quickly. Perhaps the Soviet system wasn't so austere?

					<outline text="I spent all of yesterday afternoon at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhm.de/ENGLISH/index.html&quot;&gt;German History Museum&lt;/a&gt;, listening to the official story of the war and the wall from their point of view. There were some not-so-surprising surprises. They talk about losing the war. Where I come from, we talk about winning. They don't  present their soldiers as heroes. How can a society survive that, I wonder. I did see one statue of a WWII era German soldier, just one. It left me with a sick feeling. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stiftung-denkmal.de/en&quot;&gt;memorial&lt;/a&gt; to victims of the Holocaust also was very moving. " created="Wed, 01 Jul 2009 08:36:48 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I followed a Russian tour group for a few minutes yesterday as they soaked in the history of their WWII victory. Some of them seemed old enough to remember.

					<outline text="A little over a week ago I got an email from a very good friend in Europe asking if it was true that I was going to Reboot. I replied with an email saying it was.

					<outline text="Here's what I think the missing product would do." created="Wed, 01 Jul 2009 09:31:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It would allow me to make announcements the way companies make announcements. The announcements would have good metadata attached, and would be stored in a database. People who follow me in this system are saying &quot;I want to know everything Dave announces.&quot; Key words in that sentence: Know and Dave. I don't just want these facts to stream by in a river. I want Dave's name to go bold in a short list of people I choose to follow. Unlike a river, where I want volume and don't care about missing an item, in this product the oppositie is true. I place high value on not missing anything. I want to know literally everything Dave announces. (Or Paolo or Karin or you get the idea.)" created="Wed, 01 Jul 2009 09:31:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I started to get a clue that such a product was needed when I started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/friendsofdave&quot;&gt;FOD feed&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. It monitors the blogs of people who are so important to me that I never want to miss one of their posts. People like NakedJen, Jay Rosen, Sylvia Paull, Doc Searls, Robert Scoble, Fred Wilson and Michael Gartenberg, and people I don't even know personally like Paul Krugman and Nate Silver. It was a success. It has kept me in these people's loops, and it required them to do nothing special. Now I'm thinking about what comes next when I want other people to do something similar with me.
