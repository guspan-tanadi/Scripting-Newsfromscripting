There may be tradeoffs, but the benefits of not having a company at the center of the network should create great opportunities for news organizations, innovative developers, designers, businesses, and users everywhere.

You could click on the name of any of them to edit the settings in a dialog. There was a place to edit the name of the domain. A place to add an A record or a CNAME. (In other words it works more or less the same as any &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/08/30/easydns.gif&quot;&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt; we use to manage DNS.)" created="Sun, 30 Aug 2009 17:25:56 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Anticipating what people are going to say, yes, I know there's a DNS built into the Mac, but it doesn't have a graphic interface and the instructions for setting it up are ridiculous. I think the one on Windows has a graphic UI, but I can't find any comprehensible instructions that explain how to set it up." created="Sun, 30 Aug 2009 17:29:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A college classmate, Sandy Wilbourn, who I think of as a brother, is an expert in DNS, and he says the app I'm looking for doesn't exist. I threatened to write it myself, he advised against it. Oh man. What is it with these simple web services that we're allowed to use them through a web app, but they don't want us running our own. I'm going to run my own DNS at some point, and I'd rather do it sooner than later." created="Sun, 30 Aug 2009 17:31:05 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Health care in a nutshell" created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:38:34 GMT" type="outline">

You never know when it's your house that's going to be on fire, that's why everyone pays equally for protection, and the person whose house burns gets the &quot;benefit&quot; if you can call having your house burn a benefit (or getting very sick)." created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:38:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The main difference is that very few houses burn, but eventually everyone needs life-saving or end-of-life care. Every responsible person must pay for care, and basically only the truly rich (multi-millionaires) can afford to self-insure. " created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:39:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you assume that everyone has to pay for health insurance, then the question is how much do you want to pay. In the US, our current system costs 16% of GDP and we get less care, in some cases &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; less care than other rich countries that pay as little as 9% of their GDP. " created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:39:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So we're making poor choices here. " created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:41:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Obama's plan is less comprehensive than the German, Canadian, French or Japanese plans. In each of these other rich countries, health insurance is a non-profit business. That doesn't mean insurance companies don't make money, they do, but not from health insurance. Obama isn't promoting that (although it's not clear why). " created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:41:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And for 40 million Americans they might as well live in the third world, for them health care is based on their ability to pay out of pocket. As long as they just get colds, they survive. As soon as they need more care, they either go bankrupt or become disabled, or die. This is their country too, they get a vote in how our system works. You're related to some of these people (unless you have no family). They're the ones who should be standing in anger at the town halls. And they're not all poor, many of them are middle class or upper middle class, they just happen to not be profitable for the insurance industry. These are the people whose houses burn to the ground when they catch fire." created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:43:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The people who would vote against universal health insurance are stupidly cocky, because they will all need health care some day and for many of them it will not be there. Sometimes they're people who don't smoke or aren't obese, who don't have any personal bad habits. People get sick for a lot of reasons that no one understands. Maybe just bad luck or bad genes. In the wrong place at the wrong time." created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:47:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Bottom-line, we could spend a lot less money on health care and take care of everyone. Instead we're opting on the worst approach, we spend a lot more, and a huge portion of the populace isn't cared for and the rest of us are treated not as patients but as profit centers. If you happen to need health care, you can't get it. This is some kind of way to run a country? Yikes." created="Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:49:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you want to understand what our options are, I highly recommend listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112172939&quot;&gt;FreshAir interview&lt;/a&gt; with T.R. Reid, who has just written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Healing-of-America/dp/B002IPZBKE/ref=ed_oe_k&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on health care systems around the world.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=23276&quot;&gt;To Sam Diaz&lt;/a&gt; who says RSS was &quot;a good idea at the time but there are better ways now,&quot; I have many things to say. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:13:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. People confuse RSS  with Google Reader. Let's be clear that there's a difference. Google Reader is an application that reads RSS-formatted data. There are many other applications that read and write RSS." created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:15:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. I think Google Reader was, on the whole, a good thing. It's probably the best reader of its variety. You have to go find the new stuff in Google Reader. I prefer a reader that finds the new stuff for me, and presents it in reverse chronologic order. This is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews&quot;&gt;river of news&lt;/a&gt; reader. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:15:40 GMT"/>

					<outline text="4. My newspaper doesn't tell me how many articles I haven't read going back to the date of my birth. I bet it would be in the millions. Why should I care. This was the worst idea ever in news readers." created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:22:33 GMT"/>

The core problem -- so many programmers who write RSS software are not themselves news junkies. If they were they'd know when they got it wrong. News is about what's new! Show me the newest stuff first. Sorry to all the articles I didn't read, maybe in the next lifetime." created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:23:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="6. He may not use a RSS reader, but the news is still getting to him through RSS. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:17:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="7. If all the RSS on the planet were all of a sudden to stop updating (key point) the news would stop flowing. Any news guy or gal who thinks they could get by without RSS -- think this through a bit more. We all love the Internet, but don't shut off your gas and electric because your computer and router wouldn't work without electricity. Same with RSS and news. RSS is how the news flows, whether you see it or not. If not RSS, something exactly like RSS. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:24:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="8. The Internet is layered. New technology comes on line building on tech that already existed. RSS was like that. It built on XML and HTTP, which built on text and TCP/IP. The new things that Diaz likes so much, in exactly the same way, build on RSS. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:26:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="9. When news authors don't understand how technology evolves, they &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/propagate&quot;&gt;propagate&lt;/a&gt; incorrect notions to everyone else, including would-be inventors, who have to figure it out for themselves, and then convince investors and partners they know what they're doing -- when they just read in ZDNet that things don't evolve at all. So Mr. Diaz does us all a disservice. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:27:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="10. I object when technology writers tell the story of technology incorrectly. People say I should just be happy to see my name in the story, or in this case something that I fathered. No deal. I want the &lt;i&gt;accurate&lt;/i&gt; story out there. I want people to understand how technology really works, because that's central to users being empowered by it, instead of being controlled by it. " created="Wed, 26 Aug 2009 15:28:25 GMT"/>

Then I call a second API on Adjix to ask it to give me the counts for the most recent 50 links created by Dave. I then update the counts in my database, sort them, and prepare the familiar &lt;a href=&quot;http://dave.40twits.com/&quot;&gt;Top-40 report&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Tue, 25 Aug 2009 22:25:15 GMT"/>

Ten weeks. A non-smoking story at the Bowie concert last week. As I'm walking out I see people lighting up everywhere. Smell of smoke all around. It smells good. I really want one. In my mind I outline the steps it would take to be smoking and the amount of time it would take. I would ask someone if they could spare a cigarette. If they said no I'd offer them $1. Oh hell, just offer $1 to begin with. Whoo, where would I get a match. I'd ask for a light. Take a drag. Estimated time, 15 seconds to one minute to first nicotine rush. My heart started beating faster. I felt scared like you feel on a NY subway platform as a train is entering the station and you're standing on the platform and in the instant before it passes you think how you could end your life by leaning forward. I never actually jump, and that night I didn't smoke, and it's good that inside I equate smoking with death so deeply that it invokes my subway nightmare. Do I have it beat? No way. I am still an addict, I expect I will be for life. But I'm an addict in recovery, who is not taking the drug.

					<outline text="3. Twitter could and should obviate the need for URL-shorteners. Yes I know SMS messages are limited to 160 chars.

					<outline text="1. &lt;b&gt;CNAMEs&lt;/b&gt;. It must be possible for the user to own and control the domain his or her URLs live at.

					<outline text="1. In 1997, as an experiment to satisfy Adam Bosworth, who was pestering me (jn a nice way) about XML, I produced a syndication of my &quot;news site&quot; -- Scripting News. I called the format scriptingNews format." created="Fri, 14 Aug 2009 20:10:47 GMT"/>

					<outline text="3. Then in 1999, Netscape comes out with RSS 0.90. It does most of what scriptingNews does, and a few things it didn't do. And vice versa.

					<outline text="4. Then I did one of the smartest things I ever did. I surrendered unconditionally. They didn't even ask me to. I adopted their format. Wholesale. Discarded my old format. The way I figured it, I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Because, and this is the key point -- they had support from content companies, notably Wired, Salon, Red Herring and Motley Fool. In one step, swallowing my pride, little old Scripting News and all the allied sites that used my software, could join the club. So I did it. Goodbye scriptingNews, hello RSS.

But it would have applied even if we were all working in the same office. As a manager, I wanted to know where my people were, because if they were completing a project I needed to be thinking about their next steps and how their deliverables fit in with other stuff that was coming online. And if they were late I needed to understand why. We even developed technology for this, and Hutch Carpenter &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhc3.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/before-there-was-twitter-there-was-dave-winers-instant-outliner/&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; the docs for it, and was excited about the discovery, and I was excited for his excitement.

I clicked on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nyt.100twt.com/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; of NYT editorial people on Twitter that I keep and I saw something very different, and this is the point of this story. I saw a news organization at work. Careful to say what they do and don't know. Informing each other on experience with similar stories in the past. Whether they were all reading all of the others' posts, I don't know. They were reading and passing on reports from other Twitter users, even those that didn't work at the Times.

We thirst for instantaneous real-time news. The cable networks have been simulating it for decades, but not delivering very often. Go back to the Gulf War, and how we were all glued to CNN watching for any hint of new information. It became an obsession that was repeated in the 2000 election and in the aftermath of 9-11. Now we try to grab for that sense of immediacy whenever possible, and they market to us on that basis even naming their show The Situation Room, when it is nothing of the sort. " created="Sun, 09 Aug 2009 18:35:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. But cable news isn't where it started, it started with the &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; of news. It's not history or analysis, it's &lt;i&gt;what's happening now.&lt;/i&gt; Think about how the Iran Hostage Crisis spawned Nightline and how the networks covered the Nixon resignation, or the moon landing or the assassinations of JFK, RFK and MLK. (In the recent spate of bios of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/news?q=walter cronkite&quot;&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt; I learned that he broadcast from the room he worked in at CBS News, not from a set on a stage. It's as if he was prepared to go on the air at any time and it wasn't appearances that mattered. At that time, to CBS, news was a functional thing.)" created="Sun, 09 Aug 2009 18:54:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. We also want to feel to be a part of the news process. Again this is something the networks are playing lip service to.

					<outline text="4. Weinberger says we should seek transparency, and of course I agree -- it's my theme song too. You can see real reporters dealing with a true breaking story not just a simulation of a breaking story, let their hair down and share everything they know with the world. This is the impulse of news, it's not about hiding things until they're ready, but when you know something for a fact, you want it out there as quickly as possible. And as long as something is clearly labeled as speculation it's every bit as true as a fully vetted fact." created="Sun, 09 Aug 2009 18:38:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. Twitter is at least a dress rehearsal for the news system of the future. A key component of this system is that it is used both as the back room for narrating news work and for the finished delivered news product. It's this duality that makes electronic news vital. I first saw this in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html&quot;&gt;LBBS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/01/04/demoingsoftwareforfunprofi#8&quot;&gt;MORE&lt;/a&gt; software I did in the 80s, then in Manila in the 90s, and I believe we will see it in the news system that comes out of Twitter. You have two modes of viewing the content, the editorial view and the finished product view -- but it's important that the are just views on the same data, so when a change is made to one, it automatically appears in the other. This was the key concept in Manila's &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1999/05/24/editThisPage&quot;&gt;Edit This Page&lt;/a&gt; function." created="Sun, 09 Aug 2009 18:40:11 GMT"/>

Somehow the domain name system survives these kinds of attacks (knock wood). That's all we're talking about here, a service that's no more complex than DNS.

					<outline text="One more comment, unrelated to the centralization question. A question that keeps coming up. Why not have the name be like an email address, like judy&amp;#64;looselycoupled.net instead of judy. There are several reasons why. 1. Twitter has nice short names, and if you want to be as easy as Twitter, you have to have short names too. 2. The goal is to map a name to a URL.

					<outline text="Twitter handles it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/06/fightForEveryInchOfSimplic.html&quot;&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt;, they have a server at twitter.com and when you give it a username it knows what data it applies to. It doesn't expose the internals. That's different from the Internet's domain name system, that turns a name like google.com, yahoo.com or us.gov into numbered addresses like 74.125.67.100, 209.131.36.159 and 209.251.180.18. " created="Thu, 06 Aug 2009 21:14:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So in a loosely-coupled world how will this work?" created="Thu, 06 Aug 2009 21:32:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. We want to map names like jason, guy and carol to URLs like &lt;i&gt;random.com/guy.xml&lt;/i&gt; etc, etc." created="Thu, 06 Aug 2009 21:16:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Probably the way it'll work is there will be a central server run by a foundation that does exactly this mapping and nothing more. It's an identity server. You sign up for a username and password and store one bit of data, the URL of your feed of 140-character messages. " created="Thu, 06 Aug 2009 21:21:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Another possibility is to borrow the architecture of DNS, and make it a registrar problem. Sign up with Godaddy or Network Solutions or Gandi and create a domain. Now the challenge is to have that name point to a URL instead of a dotted ID. I'll leave that up to the DNS gurus to decide if it's possible or too &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egregious&quot;&gt;egregious&lt;/a&gt; a hack. " created="Thu, 06 Aug 2009 21:22:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Yet another possibility is to let twitter.com handle the bootstrap. Conveniently they have &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2009/08/06/url.gif&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; for a URL in each user's profile. If you've got an aggregator and the user says they want to subscribe to someone named &lt;i&gt;pearl,&lt;/i&gt; look on Twitter for &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/pearl&quot;&gt;such&lt;/a&gt; a user, get the URL from their profile, read it, and if it's an RSS file with a cloud element, you're home. If not, it's an error. " created="Thu, 06 Aug 2009 21:24:29 GMT"/>

At first I was going to say no -- but then I remembered a very important thread that came up at the NYC meetup. What about when Ashton Kutcher wants to move his base from twitter.com to kutcher.com. He's going to need a way to export his follower list. So yes, it matters. Now I'm not sure I want to deal with an OPML file with over 3 million entries.
