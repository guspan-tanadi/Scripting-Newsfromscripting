At the time this was considered unlikely by most experts, they believed the web would evolve to become like TV, with three major networks, Yahoo, Lycos and Alta Vista. Google wasn't even born yet, yet many thought it was already over. Having been around the loop several times by then, I was sure the shakeout hadn't happened. Today I am confident that there will be thousands of Twitters, maybe millions. Just as in 1995, there are arguments that say this is wrong. &quot;Everyone's on twitter.com,&quot; seems to be the main one, and it's a good argument. But let me argue with it. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Fri, 27 Feb 2009 19:28:25 GMT"/>

On summer afternoons I could go with a friend or my brother and sit in the grandstands for $1.65 and watch the best teams in baseball beat the Mets. Everyone went to Shea Stadium, it was the best place for baseball in Queens, but we also played baseball at the schoolyard down the street. They were different experiences, but both were baseball, and they co-existed perfectly, in fact you could say they helped each other. Other sports worked the same. Every playground had basketball, and you could also go to Madison Square Garden to watch the Knicks." created="Fri, 27 Feb 2009 19:32:46 GMT"/>

That is what &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; happen for the financial system to reboot. Very little will be lost, since the stock of two main banks, Citi and BofA, are now worth a total of $36 billion.

Again, insensitive (he said it with a smile on his face believe it or not), but I'm glad he said it. The way he said it made it easier to quit. Sometimes the truth hurts.

They will not be paid. No benefits. They agree to the same rules governing the integrity of your reporters. For a period of four weeks, they report to the newsroom, the physical one, not a virtual one, every day, and are part of your news team.

The question I was asked over and over was how would news organizations make money on the Internet. My opinion was widely sought then because the dotcom bubble had not yet burst, we were still in the age of Irrational Exuberance 1.0 (version 2 would &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/02/19/internet30.html#6&quot;&gt;come&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Craig Cline and Tim O'Reilly).

People's thirst for news and ideas was going up, not down and 2. The professional news organizations were not expanding to meet the demand, rather they were contracting. Therefore: 3. Something must rise to fill the gap. Beyond that, I could only guess how it would make money. Maybe they will make money by serving lattes to bloggers who work in their newsrooms. Maybe once there's a glut of conflicted points of view out there, the public will re-hire them to act as arbiters. I don't know.

					<outline text="I also wanted to thank the Times for being the ones who made RSS 2.0 the roaring bonfire of content that it has been for the last half-decade or so. And to the tech people at other pubs who followed the Times' lead, without trying to improve it. Because of all this compatibility it was possible for a market of tools to develop around RSS. That should serve as an example, a template, for future publishing standards." created="Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:11:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Which brings us around to the idea that put the Times in the center of today's discussion. &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timespeople_api/&quot;&gt;They now have an API&lt;/a&gt; that looks very much like a social network API, like Twitter or FriendFeed. At first it's a shock, why do we need another, and why is it coming from NY instead of Mountain View, Berkeley, Sunnyvale, San Francisco or Redmond? Well if their paradigms can be toppled why not ours? Indeed. But... Is that really what is needed from the Times? And what chance does it have to succeed? I thought of other successful once-new publishing paradigms -- Aldus, Quark, HTML, blogs, RSS, podcasting. Is the Times like those? No -- it's more like AOL or Compuserve, if it's even that open (I don't think it is). " created="Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:12:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here's the key point, the open-ness that counts is not that anyone can develop apps on top of it, though that's nice, it's if anyone can get on the other side -- can I publish &lt;i&gt;behind&lt;/i&gt; the API? On all the platforms I listed in the previous paragraph the answer is yes, I can get on the other side, even AOL and Compuserve, but to be really open it has to be open on all sides, in all ways. RSS was so open that it was possible for it to be usurped by Feedburner and they almost completely sucked it in behind their wall, before people started to get wise that maybe that wasn't the best thing for everyone. " created="Fri, 20 Feb 2009 19:15:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even Twitter, the raging rocket of growth that it is, is not as open as we'd like it to be, not even close. But I can create any number of accounts on Twitter, and build my own little universe there and publish with all the tools available to Ev, Biz and Jack. If the Times wants to play in that game, and I'd like them to -- it needs to be possible for me to compete with my heroes Frank Rich and Paul Krugman, and make the ones I don't like so much (names withheld) look like the asshats they are.

You can get around on foot instead of having to drive everywhere. But Berkeley drivers are not much better than anywhere else, it seems. Put a nice socially conscious person behind a steering wheel of a 2 ton hunk of metal and they forget everything they learned in Driver's Ed -- like what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc21950.htm&quot;&gt;crosswalk means&lt;/a&gt;."/>
					<outline text="A lot of them break the law, almost no one comes to a full stop when a pedestrian (one of those people without a 2 ton hunk of metal around them) is in a crosswalk, and a shocking number just don't want to slow down at all. Every time this happens I wonder how much it  would hurt as the 2 tons of metal crushed my  poor unprotected bod. There are some streets with so much fast-moving traffic that there's just no safe way to cross them."/>
					<outline text="However, I've learned that most drivers will slow down enough for you to cross if you hold your arm out with all five fingers extended, the universal symbol for STOP. And yesterday quite by accident I discovered another way, when even that doesn't work. It's been cold so I've been wearing gloves, but after an hour walking up and down the hills I have to take them off to let the heat out. Standing just off the curb in a crosswalk, I was holding the gloves as a sedan sped toward me, ignoring my outstretched hand. So I threw the gloves down in the street in his path with a grand gesture like a football referee throwing a penalty flag. He stopped! Not just a slow-down stop but a full wheels-not-turning stop. Amazing. I picked up the gloves and crossed the street."/>
					<outline text="The psychology of drivers. Stop to save a $10 pair of used gloves, but play a dangerous game of chicken with a human. Hey I'm a driver too, I know it's a whole other world, but the people walking across the street are just like you except they're even more fragile than a cheap old pair of gloves."/>

There were differences. Where they disagreed, I made mine match theirs. Once I got them producing the same signature, I tested it against the server in Ireland and it worked. Anyone who's trying to get theirs to work, I recommend doing the same. It takes all the guesswork out of it.

					<outline text="On Twitter early this morning &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1198720005&quot;&gt;I said something provocative&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I've made over $2 million from my blog and Dan thinks blogs can't make money. He needs to get out of the box more often.&quot; " created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:31:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I was referring to Dan Lyons, who had written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/id/183666&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in Newsweek that said among other things: &quot;While blogs can do many wonderful things, making huge amounts of money isn't one of them.&quot;" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:37:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I agree. Blogs don't make money. But people with blogs can. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:51:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Dan, this is not a fairy tale, I got the check and it had seven figures. But this isn't one of those pitches to get you to buy a book or a video or to come hear me give a lecture. I've made a lot of money with this blog, and may make a bunch more, but I'm not going to show you how to do it. But I will try to get you to change the way you think about blogs and other social media." created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:39:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Let me start by asking a question. " created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:20:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Assume you run a business and you advertise. How much money did you make from your advertisements?" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:53:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Presumably your ads make money, otherwise why are you running them?" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:21:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now in figuring out how much money you made from the ads, did you look for ads on your ads? That makes no sense of course. Why would anyone try to make money by putting an ad on an ad?" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:22:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So when I told you I made over $2 million with this blog, why did you immediately look for ads? I can save you the trouble -- there aren't any. And in the 12 years this blog has been here there has never been an ad on this blog. With a caveat, unless you count me talking about my products. Because I do talk about my products here. I try to stay as balanced as I can, but of course I tilt toward the positive. I have a bias -- I wouldn't have made the products if I didn't think they were good. But like all people with real products I know they're not perfect, sometimes they're imperfect, and I try to be honest about that. " created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:23:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now -- how did I make more than $2 million with this blog?" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:25:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Well, I ran a commercial company for quite a few years, UserLand Software, and I used this blog to talk about what the company was doing. We had reasonable sales -- probably over $1 million while I had the blog. We never took out an ad, or hired a PR firm. All the promotion ever done for the company was done right here. So let's count half of that $1 million toward the total. " created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:25:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then there are the consulting gigs I've gotten over the years I've been running the blog. None of them directly resulted from pitches I made here, I never said &quot;Hire me to tell you how to build your product, or work with your community, or serve your users,&quot; but the posts I've written here have served as a calling card, a way of keeping my name and ideas on people's minds. Over the years, that's a few hundred thousand." created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:27:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But the real whopper was the deal where I sold weblogs.com to Verisign for $2.3 million. Again, a product that never had an ad, never had a PR campaign, the only way anyone heard of it was through this blog. " created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:28:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So we're already over &lt;i&gt;$3&lt;/i&gt; million -- and all I did was what any blogger does -- talk about what I'm doing. And that's the role of a blog, it's a way of communicating what you're doing. Companies, consultants and authors need to do a lot of communicating, and blogs allow you to go direct, and be more efficient, less diluted. People get a real feel for who you are and how you think and what you're like as a person. " created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:29:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Why would I ever let someone else hitch their &quot;message&quot; on this -- it would get in the way of me making money! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:31:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If I had any advice to offer it's this -- get in the habit of communicating directly with the people you want to influence. Don't charge them to read it and don't let others interfere with your communication. Talk through your blog as you would talk face to face. You'd never stop mid-sentence and say &quot;But first a word from my sponsor!&quot; -- so don't do that on your blog either. I can't promise you'll make any money from your blog, and I think the more you try the less chance you have. Make a good product and listen to your customers to make it better, and use the tools to communicate, and you may well make money &lt;i&gt;from the whole thing.&lt;/i&gt; To expect the blog alone to pay your bills is to misunderstand what a blog can do. You'll only be disappointed like Dan Lyons was." created="Wed, 11 Feb 2009 17:45:12 GMT"/>

" created="Tue, 10 Feb 2009 22:09:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. A friend got rich, quickly, and then just as quickly got poor. Never saw anything like it before or since.

					<outline text="3. I was dating a very attractive woman. I got invited to see the world from her point of view, and man, what a difference.

From 60 inches tall to 72 inches. Inside I was still a child, but outside I was scaring everybody. I know that now but I didn't understand it when I was a kid, because I was inside the body looking out. I remained more or less constant, but the effect I had on people changed dramatically. This left me confused for years! A lot of people must go through this, we all grow up and the people around us remember us as a cute little kid and all of a sudden the cute kid is gone, replaced by a strapping young man or a shapely young woman. Maybe they never forgive you for stealing the cute little kid?" created="Tue, 10 Feb 2009 22:14:41 GMT"/>

I had asked her to tune into my &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner&quot;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; and she did, and we talk about it when we get together. Today she wanted to know why my icon is King Kong. I said it's a joke -- that's what people say about me, but it's not really me. Inside I'm nothing like that, but on the outside, often it seems to me that the world is relating to me as if I were. She asked why not change the image. I laughed and asked -- what should I change it too? Ballet slippers? A pink tutu? No, she said, how about a teddy bear or Gentle Ben? Hmmm. Well, I'm not quite ready for that, after giving it some thought. I don't see myself that way, and it's important that the iconography not only reflect how you'd like people to see you, but also reflect how you feel inside. So I looked through my archive and settled, for now, on the accordion player. He's a very frequent guest &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?q=site%3Ascripting.com accordion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and in many ways I identify with him. Playing a tune, giving people a song to sing, but folksy -- even &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/10/25/DSCN4047.JPG&quot;&gt;schmaltzy&lt;/a&gt; -- that's how I'd like to be seen.

I laughed out loud a few times while reading it, it's that good. I don't think they're laughing about it at Twitter headquarters. But I also don't think it's in any way over, as some do. Techno-political chess matches are rarely finished after the first few moves, it usually takes a number of rounds, backs and forths, before you can develop a theory about the outcome, and even then it's hard to knock momentum. One of my investors once said, when Apple was just a $1 billion company in 1983, that &quot;Billion dollar companies don't just disappear.&quot; " created="Sat, 07 Feb 2009 23:46:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay, Twitter is a $0 billion company, but that's not the point, they've got a lot of momentum, a lot -- and it's not going to disipate because of a technical innovation at Facebook. It's going to take more than that. And in the meantime, it certainly means that Twitter will be more attentive to its partners and developers, and perhaps be a bit more aggressive with feature rollouts (It's been sitting on a lot of new features for a long time, imho)." created="Sat, 07 Feb 2009 23:58:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I called Marc to congratulate him on his piece, and asked about the meeting at Facebook next week about OpenID, and he said something I was afraid of -- it's invite-only. Which means they're screwing around, both Facebook and especially the OpenID people. You can't have invite-only meetings about open standards. It's not at all a small thing. I strongly recommend that the meeting be held outside of Facebook, that they be made totally welcome to participate, and that everyone else who's interested be welcome as well.

I think it's the ultimate in hypocrisy to argue that former members of the excecutive branch of the US govt should not be prosecuted for war crimes because it would be looking backward, while our jails are full of people whose only &quot;crime&quot; is that they smoke pot.

Fact is, after winning all those gold medals in Beijing and bringing glory to our country, he's entitled to kick back, smoke some dope, eat some poptarts and rice krispies, and hang out for a bit while he basks in the glow of our admiration.

It's like the other arts -- who wants a real estate broker who sells you on how great it would be to live in a house while you're looking at it. They don't know how you live, their chatter interferes with your dreaming, and it's the dream that buys the house.

In my humble opinion a great newspaper rose overnight where a mediocre one had been the day before. The printing presses weren't running, and the normal management structure was heavily disrupted. But they had a story, a great one -- and if you go back to the roots of news, that's when it really happens, not when someone pays you well, but when you have a great story.

It's almost at the point where I don't have to write a back-end at all, I could almost completely depend on theirs. If only. If only they allowed me to store a relatively small amount of XML-based data with each user. Less than a megabyte per user. Probably way less. " created="Wed, 04 Feb 2009 17:40:58 GMT"/>

I named her my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/12/24/bloggerOfTheYear.html&quot;&gt;Blogger of the Year&lt;/a&gt; for 2007.

My databases always use the mnemonic as the key, for example, in my calendar application, I access Kevin's data through this address: config.twitterCalendar.users.kevinmarks which corresponds to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.opml.org/calendar/kevinmarks/&quot;&gt;folder&lt;/a&gt; on a server." created="Wed, 04 Feb 2009 02:16:55 GMT"/>
