					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldlink.co.uk/2000/05/31&quot;&gt;Lance Knobel&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Yesterday's Wall Street Journal Europe had a fascinating piece on the strategy telecoms companies are following with WAP. They are 'locking' their phones so that you can only access their portal, or even in some cases only access sites that have agreements with them. Have these people learned nothing from the Web? Yesterday, the French courts ruled that France Telecom had to unlock its phones -- but only at users' request!&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Let's ask Tim Berners-Lee what he thinks. Tim, in hindsight, I wish you had trademarked the term &lt;i&gt;Web&lt;/i&gt;, so that they would have to license it from you. Then you could put a stop to their claims that you're getting the Web through your cellphone. If you can only access part of the Web, you're not getting the Web. That's fundamental. Maybe a simple whitepaper from TBL would do the trick?"/>
					<outline text="Yesterday at lunch with Rohit, we talked about doing some whitepapers. I asked Rohit if he is a writer, and he told me about the O'Reilly books he wrote. That's a good start. A couple of weeks ago I volunteered to help TBL write a whitepaper on his Semantic Web vision. I figured that by doing it I would have to understand what it is, which would make it worth writing about to me."/>
					<outline text="I believe that among a group of about 25 people we have in our heads a fairly clear vision for what the next layer on the Web will look like. We're lucky that &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=msft&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; left a gap of 22 days for us to play with. "/>

					<outline text="Yesterday's query about software reviews got a nibble from Lennart Pettersson, the editor-in-chief of the Swedish IT magazine, Datateknik 3.0. An interesting email exchange resulted. "/>
					<outline text="In the last email I said &quot;We're going to have an interesting problem here. The development cycle is much shorter these days, the beta periods are practically non-existent. Frontier 6.2 is slated to ship this month, probably before the middle of the month. However that should give us a good target to work with, because it will probably remain relatively frozen for the next sixty days or so as we gear up for Frontier 7.0. "/>
					<outline text="&quot;We'd be happy to have 6.2 reviewed, but there certainly will be updates and new features and fixes starting the day after we ship. Can that kind of product fit into your review process? This is the interesting challenge about getting software reviewed these days!&quot;"/>

					<outline text="Laird Popkin, the chair of the W3C ICE working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.io.com/~laird/rss-in-ice.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a followup to a heated email exchange on the xml-dist-apps mail list suggesting how RSS and ICE could be merged. "/>
					<outline text="I haven't had a chance to read beyond his comparison, it's kind of one-sided, for example, he says that there are no access controls in RSS, which is a feature, not a bug. The Web doesn't have access controls either. (Which is to say RSS is part of the Web.)"/>
					<outline text="And RSS was not an outgrowth of CDF. It was a coalescing of UserLand's syndication format and Netscape's. Designed for Web developers, and designed to be easy to understand and easy to implement. Not designed to line the pockets of developers of specific content management systems."/>
					<outline text="That said, I'd like to see if there's a way to bring the two specs together somehow. The people who love RSS love it, so polarizing statements are not going to get us anywhere. I could make equivalent statements about ICE, but won't do that at this time. I feel it's all been said, no need to repeat it."/>

					<outline text="The second part of the transition, getting me personally off the Conxion-PacBell T1 line, has not happened yet, and as I write this, we have exactly one hour remaining before the 47 days are up.

				<outline text="Programmer's commune" type="outline">
					<outline text="In Amsterdam I had a series of lunches and dinners with really interesting people doing cool stuff in related areas. Emailing with Sally Khudairi, we both agreed that we want a bar that's open 24-by-7 so we can always get together with people we want to work with. The XML-DEV list doesn't cut it. (They're debating patents now, they're where we were a year ago, angry, but not sure what to do about it, flailing unproductively.)"/>
					<outline text="In Trieste, I talked with Paolo about a programmer's commune. A place where any programmer with a reputation for creating code that lots of people use can check in for one or two weeks. Probably a hotel in a resort area. Near a beach, good food, great net connection, places to hike and think and talk. Meeting rooms with whiteboards. Wireless Ethernet. Come here when you have a conceptual problem you want to solve and can use help from your peers that work at different companies or who don't work at companies at all. The commune would have a strong Web presence, and would be located in a country with no software patents. You pay nothing for your room, meals and net connections. Come create and share what you create. That's the idea."/>
					<outline text="I've wanted this for many years. I talked about it in the 80s. I used to go on programming retreats, sometimes alone, sometimes with others, to get away from the 9-5 pulse of the marketing and support company I was running. "/>
					<outline text="I realized again that we need it at the close of the Web Publishing track at WWW9 when the room erupted in creativity around RSS and weblogs. We've set up systems that push our words around the net, but most of the time there's little or no movement. Having a programmers commune would give us a mechanism for movement. "/>
					<outline text="I also talked with friends about doing this in conjunction with a massage commune I was part of in the mid-90s. Adding bodywork to the mix is a good idea. As much as programmers like to believe that they create outside their bodies, I think this is not true. A happy programmer would be getting a couple of shiatsus a week, imho. (At least this programmer would.)"/>

					</outline>
				<outline text="Point of view" type="outline">
					<outline text="Two interesting shifts in viewpoint, as a result of this trip. First, think of the Web as an application, or a computer, like VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, or the Apple II. The &quot;Semantic Web&quot; is Tim Berners-Lee's version 2.0, perhaps like Symphony or the Apple III. I realized this while I was listening to Tim's conversation with the attendees of Developer's Day at lunch on Friday. As luck would have it, I got the microphone last, and said several things. First, I said the two biggest problems for the Web are &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/28/noMorePesosForSenorBezos&quot;&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft's dominance of browsers. "/>
					<outline text="Then I talked to Tim about the version 2.0 thing. I said he should be incredibly proud of his accomplishment, and be careful in thinking about the next level Web. It's got the largest installed base ever in the history of software. If there is to be a version 2.0, it must overcome this huge &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;advantage. "/>
					<outline text="Ask Microsoft how this works, their biggest competition for Windows is older versions of Windows. Upgrades, esp massive ones like the poorly described Semantic Web, are notoriously difficult to pull off. Meanwhile Microsoft is doing what they do so well, the incremental upgrade. Slowly but surely MSIE is being reconceived as an application platform. I believe this is the version 2.0, and with better search engines, and incremental additions of XML content to the HTML, and Rohit's pleasure button (more traffic if you use the XML additions) we can get Tim what he wants. But it cannot be the upheaval that the Web was because of the installed base. It's hard to appreciate how much has been invested in HTML, dirty as it is, over the last ten years."/>
					<outline text="Another shift in viewpoint. Frank Leahy of Wired gave a really interesting talk about the architecture of HotBot. Each HotBot request can result in several requests, over HTTP, using various formats, to a variety of infomediaries, including Inktomi. As he was describing this, I visualized a computer on Wired's LAN on Third Street in San Francisco, talking to a computer on Inktomi's LAN at their offices in the East Bay. (Emeryville?) I was astounded to think that a high-flow server like HotBot (which runs on NT) could make so many HTTP requests for each search and still serve 5 million or so searches a day. I think of an HTTP request as being a big expensive thing."/>
					<outline text="Well, as it turns out I had visualized it incorrectly. In fact the two computers are in the same cage at Exodus. And there's the change in view, a loop back (for me) to 1982, when I was an active Compuserve user and wanted to write software that ran on their systems. I had a BBS for the Apple II, written in Pascal, that I believed could compete favorably with the BBS software they had running on their old DEC mainframes. But no matter how I phrased the question, I don't think they ever understood what I wanted to do. "/>
					<outline text="Today Exodus, and other big co-location services are doing what Compuserve might have done. I believe as the net shakes out more and more stuff will gravitate upstream. Our challenge is to do that without sacrificing the power of running your own server, which is something we plan to explore with Pike and its descendants."/>
					<outline text="Looping back to Frank's talk, he showed us how they are working with vendors to create a common XML-based syntax for the services they use to run HotBot. I asked if he planned to make this spec public and he said yes, and I said I'd like a shot at creating a Frontier-based interface for that, and he said of course. (That's how you hit my pleasure button. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;)"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="&quot;Find a shared vision&quot;" type="outline">
					<outline text="Once again I feel like Forrest Gump."/>
					<outline text="In Davos I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet#8&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; Bill Gates if he could sign on to Bill Clinton's challenge to find a shared vision. I hoped he would say &quot;The Web the Web, that's our shared vision!&quot; but he didn't."/>
					<outline text="I have the same wish for Tim Berners-Lee. Like Gates, he's surrounded with super smart people who think like he does. And like Steve Jobs, Mitch Kapor, Dan Bricklin, all of whom created seminal products in a line leading to the Web, he yearns to do it again. "/>
					<outline text="We're definitely at a crossroads. On June 1, we'll hear, in some detail, what Bill Gates's next vision is. Like Berners-Lee's vision it must include the Web, but it's more than the Web. In the &quot;more&quot; is presumably Gate's next barrier to entry. In normal times it wouldn't be as dramatic as now, because the verdict in the anti-trust trial dramatizes everything Gates does until it's overturned or implemented. Applications surely figure heavily in the next configuration of Windows, and so does the Web. Will they be Microsoft applications or will there be a framework for others' applications? "/>
					<outline text="To me, the only sharable vision is the Web with nothing extra. A commitment by Microsoft to gently upgrade the Web, while competition catches up. We must have competition in Web browsers. This is something that the DOJ got right. At minimum, if Microsoft wants the respect of the people who create and use the Web, they must cooperate here, if they want to be taken in any way to be a leader, and a supporter of innovation."/>
					<outline text="On the flip side, for the W3C, I hope they too will embrace the Web as it is today, with all its warts and blemishes, for the scarred battlefield that it is, and let's add some features that press the pleasure button for the Web creators. "/>
					<outline text="And to the creators (I think of Zeldman), instead of looking back, look forward. It's true that the Web is broken, but for a broken system it works remarkably well. Laugh and sing &quot;it's even worse than it appears.&quot; Now what would you die for? What single feature would unlock a years worth of creativity for you. The more elegantly and simply you can express that, the more likely it will excite the people who create the technology that controls the Web. (MS and W3C share control of the Web, imho.)"/>
					<outline text="One more thing. I plan to download and start using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Amaya/&quot;&gt;Amaya&lt;/a&gt;. I saw a demo at WWW9 and it's nice! Very different from any browser I've seen. Why didn't I download it before? Why don't we ever talk about Amaya? I have an idea that it could be made to work really well with Manila sites."/>

				<outline text="Friday evening notes" type="outline">
					<outline text="WWW9 is over. We had a wonderful day. It started with the distributed computing track, we talked about XML-RPC and SOAP. Lots of really good energy, it was the talk of the conference, it was a bit shocking to me to see how widely embraced this stuff is. I always expect that we're going to get fudded, as has happened in the past, but the XML community is supporting us. This is fantastic."/>
					<outline text="Lunch with Tim Berners-Lee was also fantastic. He has an enthusiasm that is is so incredible. The first time I heard him speak at the XML protocols shakedown on Wednesday I wasn't sure how how to parse it. But at lunch he moved around the room, everyone who wanted to speak spoke, and he has such a positive attitude, I was in awe. With his installed base you could forgive him for being arrogant, but he's not. I got a lot of pictures or TBL but only &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$686&quot;&gt;one came out&lt;/a&gt; well enough to print. &lt;i&gt;Oy!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="After lunch I participated in Dale Dougherty's web publishing track, demo'd Manila, it was not an exciting demo. I figured out why this happens sometimes. I get bored and then the boredom is infectuous. Later in the session we had a RSS BOF, and *that* was truly exciting. I've got to do some thinking and then do some writing."/>
					<outline text="Tomorrow I'm going to visit with Adam Curry and visit the Reijksmuseum (sp?) and sleep until noon. I'm so wiped out but it was an incredible week. Lots of geek bonding, and new working relationships and a whole new perspective on how the XML community works. More to say after a bit of perspective-gathering."/>

				<outline text="The first panel (9 -- 10:30AM)" type="outline">
					<outline text="Dave Winer, UserLand, on the state of XML-RPC."/>
					<outline text="Henrik Frystyk Nielsen of Microsoft, on the state of SOAP. (Henrik graciously agreed to substitute for Don Box, who couldn't make it to Amsterdam.)"/>

					</outline>
				<outline text="The State of XML-RPC" type="outline">
					<outline text="First, who am I? I'm an app developer. That's how I view these things. We can have more than one protocol for connecting apps over the Internet as long as they're roughly functionally equivalent. We were able to flatten out the differences between our IAC toolkit and Apple's in the early 90s, and should be able to do the same with the various RPC protocols that are appearing on the Web in the early 2000s."/>
					<outline text="So it's my job to explain where XML-RPC is today. First, the spec is stable, it hasn't changed in well over a year. This is a good thing, because when people talk about XML-RPC it's very clear what that is. That is not true of SOAP, which has been morphing and changing, and in all likelihood will continue to do so. "/>
					<outline text="There is broad support for XML-RPC in the developer world. Implementations are available for Frontier, Python, Java, Perl, Tcl, ASP, COM, PHP, Zope, AppleScript."/>
					<outline text="Applications being built in XML-RPC include search engine to CMS connections, prefs distribution, software updates, and many private server-to-server applications."/>
					<outline text="Open specs that build on XML-RPC are the key to its future. It's just a beginning, but I believe a solid one. "/>
					<outline text="XML-RPC provides power equivalent to a C interface, procedures with parameters that return results. Support for the common types, strings, numbers, binary info, lists, structures. It's beautifully recursive, and (to me) surprising how well it covers the capabilities of the popular scripting environments. (Credit for this goes to Mohsen, who clearly had an encyclopedic understanding of the capabilities of various scripting environments.)"/>
					<outline text="Where SOAP is the protocol that the big technology companies are agreeing on, XML-RPC tends to have more support among individual developers, small companies, open source developers. In fact most of the XML-RPC implementations are open source."/>
					<outline text="While UserLand is often identified as the owner or creator of XML-RPC, this is not accurate. The XML-RPC specification is copyrighted, but on very liberal terms, inspired by the IETF copyright. and while UserLand participated in the creation of XML-RPC, some of the most brilliant ideas came from people at Microsoft, and Fredrik Lundh of PythonWare played a key role in shaking out the spec, as he did the second implementation in Python (of course)."/>
					<outline text="The future of XML-RPC? Where do you want to go today? &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="We need a validation suite. When I get back to California, I hope to start a project to write a &quot;super stress&quot; web application that will call a server, ask it to perform a standard set of operations and compare results, and rate the implementation on its compatibility. This way we can be sure there is one and only one XML-RPC spec. This app will make regression testing a part of the XML-RPC culture, making it possible to go forward."/>
					<outline text="If new features are added to XML-RPC, they will work in all popular environments currently supported. There will never be an XML-RPC that is not least-common-denominator. SOAP is the proper place to bring ideas that advance the state of the art in distributed computing over the Internet. The purpose of XML-RPC is to provide a deployment vehicle while SOAP is fluxing."/>
					<outline text="Evangelism. All SOAP implementors are encouraged to also implement support for XML-RPC. This will give your applications the broadest possible compatibility, and will keep the pressure on the SOAP process to move forward as quickly as it possibly can."/>
					<outline text="Security and best-practices. The XML-RPC community can and should develop a set of recommendations for developers who build Web applications, perhaps establishing a review process for security holes and unclear and overly complex applications."/>
					<outline text="Finally, I hope that the spirit of the XML-RPC community continues to be collegial, respectful, friendly, optimistic and low-tech. So far this group of developers has distinguished itself for its focus on good technology, empowerment of each other, and almost no religious flamewars. This is truly amazing because the XML-RPC community spans multiple operating systems, economic systems, languages, and geography. Imho, it represents the best of the Web, and it's a total honor to be part of such a community."/>

				<outline text="Sun is a mystery to me" type="outline">
					<outline text="After talking with Michael Condry on Tuesday, I held no hope for Sun supporting SOAP any time in the near future. I said so on Scripting News. My hopes have been bobbing up and down in the last few days. Before Wednesday's shakedown session, while talking with a key technologist at Iona, up comes Anne Thomas Manes, Sun's director of business strategy. She told a story quite different from Condry's, and in-line with what Baker said on Monday."/>
					<outline text="She wrote a letter, that I have not seen published, but I assume will be shortly, saying that Sun has a full-time engineer working on SOAP and will make a submission to the Apache Group of a SOAP 1.1 server. I asked if she would say so at the shakedown session, she said yes. I didn't call on her because Sun was already represented on the panel by Condry, who was making more sympathetic sounds than I expected, based on yesterday's conversation, but his comments were nowhere near as positive and decisive as Manes. I wanted to save Sun the possible embarassment, and SOAP the confusion, of a public dispute between two Sun execs."/>
					<outline text="I'm confused. I've had the hiearchy explained to me. Baker works for Condry, but I'm not sure if Condry works for Manes. After the session, on the xml-dist-apps mail list, Condry posted several near-flames about SOAP. What is going on?? Either there's major news, or indecision at Sun. A clear statement of support by Sun of SOAP would be the last major milestone before quick deployment of early SOAP-compliant Web apps, the spell checker and JIT-SE."/>

(Who is a total cutie.)"/>
					<outline text="We talked about a lot of things. How the IT industry works in Europe. How we could connect Pike to Lotus Notes. What a big market that would be. We talked about the complexity of SOAP relative to XML-RPC. On the walk back to the hotel I thought I should say that we're going to keep moving forward with XML-RPC while SOAP moves forward. But moving forward doesn't mean changing the spec, moving forward means writing validation suites to be sure our implementations are interoperable. All this work will pay off when SOAP gets to the level of maturity that XML-RPC is at today, which could be quite soon based on the conversations we had with IBM's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$683&quot;&gt;SOAP engineers&lt;/a&gt; over the last two days. In the meantime I want to be sure that XML-RPC remains a viable option. This is the prudent thing to do."/>
					<outline text="BTW, BOF stands for Birds of a Feather, which is an informal gathering of people with similar interests. I see that WWDC has BOFs now, they didn't when I was going.

I wonder where else we could have a well-attended BOF on such short notice."/>

					<outline text="I went for a long walk yesterday afternoon thinking about today's panel, where I'll discuss the future of XML over HTTP, with people from Microsoft, IBM, Sun, and Ken MacLeod."/>
					<outline text="Talked with Michael Condry of Sun yesterday, and there doesn't seem to be any budge. My hopes are dashed! Oh well. Plan B is to build strong SOAP support in Java, and connect it up to EJB, so that Java can connect to everything in the SOAP world, the theory being that it will do such great things for Sun and Java that they'll eventually have to love it."/>
					<outline text="Went to dinner last night with people from Allaire and IBM (Andre was there too) to talk about very technical implementation details. Went to a cheesy Indonesian restaurant in Rembrandt Plain, then walked through the red light district and ended in a coffee shop on Dam Square. Didn't get in until 1:30AM, now it's 8:30, drinking coffee and trying to get awake so I can hold my own amidst the most intense industry politics I've ever been involved in. "/>

				<outline text="The SOAP story" type="outline">
					<outline text="So far the SOAP story has been pretty hard for users, reporters and analysts to understand, because we haven't expressed it in terms that make sense to them. I want to be sure that before everyone becomes immersed in Microsoft's vision for connected web apps that the rest of the industry has a chance to grab the opportunity to create a distributed multi-vendor network of connected apps. This is a lot like the vision we had for connected Macintosh apps in the late 80s and early 90s; and Microsoft's vision for COM and DCOM (same time period) with the key difference that it's not bound to any operating system or language, since it builds on the standards of the Internet, HTTP and XML."/>
					<outline text="Therefore my pitch for SOAP is pretty simple. We want to connect to Web Apps made by other developers. My two examples are the web-based search engine and spell checker. Simple first apps, no-brainers, easily monetized, and areas where user choice is essential. Imagine that a British writer might want to use a different spell-checker from an American writer. Makes sense? And a just-in-time search engine, an interface between the big SEs and the big CMSs. Every site is searchable. Build a relationship with the most innovative web writers. Only index the content, not the template. And do it in real-time, not based on a crawl. When a page changes it's re-indexed immediately, not some time in the future."/>
					<outline text="Search engines and spell checkers are user-oriented things, therefore should help users understand the value of technology that connects their writing to essential network services."/>

					<outline text="This has been an incredible week, the role that Scripting News plays is hard to underestimate. It's probably why I was on the shakedown panel, and it's also probably why I am in the middle of what I think is one of the most interesting technology stories of my career. "/>
					<outline text="I'm in the increasingly less-awkward role of being both a participant and a reporter. I think that's what makes this site interesting, it's what makes all weblogs interesting. This is what the New Economy is about to me. An open-ness to your thinking process. Welcoming other people in. Creating value by inclusion, and using that to help perpetuate the process. No lines between reportage and politics, a routing-around of the stubbornness of the business and technology press to stick to their well-rehearsed stories. "/>
					<outline text="Doing background work for today's writing I did a search on News.Com for UserLand and came up with nothing. A search for SOAP turned up lots of hits, promoting companies whose commitment and contribution to SOAP were smaller and more short-lived than UserLand's. How am I supposed to interpret this? I hope it's a route-around, closed-mindedness in the press, that creates opportunities to tell a story they won't tell."/>
					<outline text="All people who participate in open development processes will someday have weblogs. How do I know this? Because it vastly amplifies your effectiveness. What do you give up by running one? As long as you allow for off the record conversations, nothing. And in an open process how many conversations require it? Ideally none. If the technologies we're deciding on are as revolutionary as some think they are, don't we want to leave a trail behind of our thought processes, and when connections were made and how they came about?"/>

					<outline text="OK. UserLand has built quite a few mission-critical applications on XML-RPC.

					<outline text="A story. Last year we talked with a portal about doing work with them, perhaps merging. We did due diligence on each other. The company had been acquiring Internet services at a regular clip for a couple of years. Go to their sign up page, 20+ links, each of which took you to pages where you entered virtually the same information to join each of the services. No integration. The calendar couldn't connect to the email service or the web hosting service. I recognized this as the same problem in the Mac software business in the 80s. Business often demands that companies merge, but the technology rarely supports it. Could we do better with the Internet? "/>
					<outline text="We need a backplane. In our world, content management, we need preferences that travel seamlessly across servers. Search engine data that goes from the CMS to the SE without crawling. Stories flowing across servers. Choice of editorial and design tools. Could we do this with static XML files as Ken suggests? Sometimes. But I don't think you could do all this without a source sending a message to a destination, and as long as we're sending a message, why not send the data along with it, and as long as we're sending the data, why not have a simplifying layer so you don't have to start over every time?

					<outline text="Another POV, and perhaps some good advice. Show kindness to Apple too. Try to understand the realities they live with before you too harshly judge their results.

					<outline text="Another observation about developer programs. If you want to be taken seriously by the platform vendor you have to show committment. &quot;I might develop for your platform if you do this,&quot; is a no op. The way it seems to work is that you have to put in &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of skin before you get respect back. The platform vendor isn't with you when you're working around their bugs, or watching your toy boat sink in the wake of their battleship. When you tell them that they're fucking you they tune out. (&quot;I already know it sucks, why won't this guy leave me alone!&quot;) They don't get it, and they can't, because they've got their own view of things, to them the battleship isn't that big, and doesn't belong to them. Remember, &quot;it's even worse than it appears,&quot; and you won't be disappointed."/>
					<outline text="I got a new POV on this in the early days of SOAP. When I showed up at Microsoft, there was Don Box. When a new team took over SOAP, there was Don Box. Again and again. Although I'm not inside the COM world, my sense is that Don is the #1 COM developer as far as Microsoft is concerned. And that's not because he kisses ass (although I'm sure he's adept at MS politics), nor due to his brilliance or that he lives for wire protocols. I think the most important thing is his committment to work with Microsoft. Take the good with the bad, try not to take things personally. And when they ask you to come back, you show up."/>

					<outline text="On my way to the baseball game yesterday I stopped by at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pyra.com/&quot;&gt;Pyra&lt;/a&gt;, the makers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, on Townsend St. Up till yesterday I had only met Evan Williams, Pyra's CEO.  We had a very cool talk, it was on Ev's webcam, looking for ways to get our apps talk to enhance each other. "/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haughey.com/&quot;&gt;Matt Haughey&lt;/a&gt; had some good feedback on Manila, he said the template is hard to edit (which is true, it's a web browser interface after all) and suggested shipping with a virtually empty template, which I thought was an interesting idea, and one I had not heard before."/>
					<outline text="We also talked about linking our membership systems. How many different times do you want to enter your mother's maiden name? There should be a button on every membership signup page that says You Know Who I Am. Click on it and the form is filled out with information that comes from a central server. Dale Dougherty wrote a passionate essay about this a few weeks back on the Manila-Newbies mail list. I want to solve the problem, but wish to do it in a cross-vendor way."/>
					<outline text="Another idea was linking favorites on Weblogs.Com with the Blogger home page. You could get a customized view of the weblogs that changed (they call them blogs, understandably). They would have to mirror the favorites &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/weblogMonitor/favorites.xml&quot;&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; on their server, and be able to associate a Blogger membership with a Weblogs.Com membership. We puzzled over how to create this linkage. I think it's do-able, but I have to do some more thinking."/>

					<outline text="I then went to the baseball game (three blocks away) with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22gordon+eubanks%22&amp;meta=lr%3D%26hl%3Den&quot;&gt;Gordon Eubanks&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oblix.com/&quot;&gt;Oblix&lt;/a&gt;, and the former CEO of Symantec, the company I sold Living Videotext to in 1987. It was really good to see him, we had never had time to hang out and go to games when we worked together. The game was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/05/04/SP54447.DTL&quot;&gt;exciting&lt;/a&gt;, really good baseball. Some incredible fielding plays, but I had to leave early to get to a birthday dinner with Dave Jacobs, Marc Canter and Sonja Scharrer. "/>

Happy birthday Big Dave! I've known him for fourteen years. The day between our birthdays has become a sort of holiday in our circle of friends. Dave now works at Macromedia. At his previous job at Marimba he made a bunch of money and yesterday he showed us the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmw.com/bmwe/products/automobiles/mcoup/index.shtml&quot;&gt;first toy&lt;/a&gt; he bought with his new wealth. &lt;i&gt;Go Big Dave!&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Dave also was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.11/fetish.html&quot;&gt;Fetish editor&lt;/a&gt; at Wired for a few years, a perfect casting, he's the ultimate gadget guy, Mr Rube Goldberg. So I can't wait to see the sound studio he builds in his house and I keep urging him to get a hot tub already, it's a quality of life thing as far as I'm concerned everyone should have one, certainly a friendly guy like Dave."/>
					<outline text="Another Big Dave story. He had to fly to LA to buy the car. On the drive back, going up a mountain in fifth gear, barely touching the gas pedal, &lt;i&gt;going 105 mph.&lt;/i&gt; A tear comes to his eye. Cherman engineering. We all laugh. The cool thing about Big Dave is that we know he &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; is touched by this. Me, I could care less about cars, I like software. That's another cool thing about friends. We're all different."/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/05/biztech/articles/01seat.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Microsoft's stock is now down by nearly 45 percent from the all time-high of nearly $120 it reached late last year, meaning that Microsoft has lost more market value than the combined worth of all of the 25 next-biggest Northwest-based companies, including Boeing and Amazon.com.&quot;"/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://joel.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$99&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;When UserLand (the company that graciously hosts this weblog) released the first Windows version of their flagship Frontier product, I downloaded it and started working through the tutorial. Unfortunately, Frontier crashed several times. I was literally following the instructions exactly as they were printed in the tutorial, and I just could not get more than 2 minutes into the program. I felt like nobody at UserLand had even done the minimum amount of testing, making sure that the tutorial works. The low perceived quality of the product turned me off of Frontier for an awfully long time.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Joel, we're doing better. Yesterday I installed a fresh copy of Frontier 6.1.1 on the machine formerly known as Nirvana. This was the first time I had ever installed an old release without cringing in horror at how awful the experience was. It went pretty smoothly. Could it be better? Yes it could."/>

					<outline text="Morning breakage alert. We're seeing problems on one of the servers that moved to Exodus over the weekend. Logging on to UserLand.Com has been a problem. Eeeeks. Moving these servers was a bit of a Hail Mary. Aim for the gutters, hope you miss all the pins. Well, it seems we nicked one. Murphy was very kind. But maybe we haven't prayed with sufficient humility. &lt;i&gt;Fixed.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="New Mac &lt;a href=&quot;http://macscripter.net/&quot;&gt;scripting site&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to only cover AppleScript, which is just one of many scripting systems for the Mac. Hmmm. Python, Perl, tcl are all available for the Mac. Aren't they? I think Python was developed first on the Mac. Why is this disconnect still there??"/>
					<outline text="Speaking of disconnects, I got an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/dearValuedCustomerByConxion.gif&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; from Conxion customer support. It begins &quot;Dear valued customer&quot;. What values? &lt;i&gt;Weird.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
