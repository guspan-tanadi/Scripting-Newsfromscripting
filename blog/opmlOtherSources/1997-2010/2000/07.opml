					<outline text="Dennis Wickham: &quot;In 1999, Microsoft won a lawsuit here in San Diego because the Federal District Judge agreed with you that the First Amendment extends to choices made by developers in writing software.

The judge dismissed the lawsuit filed by a consumer ruling that the programing, even if it lead to unintended associations of ideas, were speech.&quot;"/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/438391.asp?0nm=B1AL&quot;&gt;Lisa Napoli&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If you’re crying in your beer about the impending death of Napster, let me ask you this: If you were a musician, would you want to get paid for your work? In fact, chances are that you’re not a musician, so I’ll ask a different question: Do you expect to get paid for whatever work it is you do? Pardon me for presuming all of you aren’t socialists, but surely the answer must be yes.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Considering that she already answered the question, let's back up and look at the assumptions she's made, and see where she took a wrong turn."/>
					<outline text="If I was a musician I &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; want to get paid for my work. And she's right, I am not a musician. She's doing great so far."/>
					<outline text="Now on to the next question. Do I expect to get paid for the work I do? The answer, sadly, is no. That's because I choose to be creative and honest, and writing software is even less appreciated an art than being a musician. I could take a job as the CEO or CTO of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-201-2295320-0.html?tag=st.ne.1002.tgif.sf&quot;&gt;slimy&lt;/a&gt; dot-com startup and promote non-existent software and bribe reporters for good press coverage. I've had a few offers, but I turn them down with such gusto, the offers have stopped, which is OK with me. I choose to have integrity in the work I do. I also choose to write software. So money has to take a back seat. (She didn't ask if I'd &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; to get paid, the answer is an enthusiastic yes!)"/>
					<outline text="Most rock stars don't get paid very much, if anything, for the work they do, under the old system. That point has been made by quite a few artists, and hasn't been refuted by the music industry. Until they refute it, with facts that stand up to reasonable scrutiny, I'm going to believe the artists that have spoken publicly. So forget the bs about artists getting paid, when a reporter asks the question that way I wonder whose payroll they're on. Where are the  fact-checkers when you need one? Talk about music company execs getting paid, then the story has some basis in fact, afaik."/>
					<outline text="Further, as I've said countless times but no one seems to hear, I pay for music. The stuff I download from Napster is stuff I've already paid for. How many times do I have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/06/19/whereDoISendTheMoney&quot;&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt; for it? "/>

					<outline text="It's time to lift the hood in a new way.."/>
					<outline text="I am personally net-negative on UserLand, to the tune of a few million dollars. During the flame war that resulted when Frontier went commercial in 1998, we computed that I had personally paid $3000 for every copy of Frontier in use. I paid for the priviledge of people using my software. (Which made the selfish flames all the more ridiculous.)"/>
					<outline text="The software distribution system forces developers to work for large companies, where there is diminished opportunity for artistic integrity. We learned in the early 90s that there was no way for a small company, even with a hot product, to net-out any money from software distribution. It was bad in the 80s, in the 90s it became impossible. It was cheaper to just give the software away, which is what we did in 1995."/>
					<outline text="Privately, I urged Apple to revise the distribution system, since they were getting beat-up for having no software, and they were making good money in the early 90s. The pleas fell on deaf ears. I proposed a pool of five percent of revenue for the Macintosh, to be distributed to software developers based on usage ratings. The more your software got used, the more money you'd get. I still think this is a reasonable way to do it. Users want the software for free, so did the platform vendor, but it costs money to develop. Somehow this has to be resolved. No one has had the guts yet to do it. (This would be the equivalent of the artists having an equity stake in the studio.)"/>
					<outline text="Anyway, in twelve years I have never drawn a salary from UserLand. That's not true for the people who work here, who earn salaries and get stock options and benefits. In the above I carefully talk about me, not the company. We're not profitable, it would not make any sense for me to draw a salary. I'm not complaining, because since 1998 I haven't had to write any checks to UserLand. A lot of people assume we're rolling in dough, and we're not. That's one of the reasons I like that the music industry is bringing money into the discussion. Like the musicians, I want to be paid for giving people good stuff that does cool things, but only from honest people who like it."/>
					<outline text="Like good music, good software is expensive to make. When you see something cool-but-free coming from UserLand, think about money, and the gift you're getting. You're not paying for it, but you're getting something that cost money to make."/>

					<outline text="One more thing."/>
					<outline text="At various times, we've had offers to sell Frontier."/>
					<outline text="Each time, on investigation, we learned that the product would be dismembered, and pieces would be integrated with other products from the acquiring company."/>
					<outline text="I always got angry at this point. &quot;The beauty of Frontier is its integration. If you dismember it all its value goes away.&quot; "/>
					<outline text="If we had done any of these deals we would have sold out our users. They'd be left holding a piece of software that would never be updated, bugs never fixed, no new features released, new platforms not supported."/>
					<outline text="I did that once, in the late 80s, the product died, and I hear from its users to this day, and it makes me angry and sad that the beautiful product died, for no good reason I could find. I decided that the art I do is far more important than money, and I resolved never to do it again."/>

As we developed the beta 1 release, things changed and the document became inaccurate.

					<outline text="There's another way of looking at what we're doing. There's a media type that, until now, no one had bothered to define or create tools for. Outlines are very useful, and tools for creating and browsing them are mature. Look under a rock, find a gold nugget. I've felt strongly since I first saw the Web that there's a hierarchy in there. It didn't take long for Yahoo to become the main portal. But it's limited by the capacity of their editors, same with DMOZ. Now, six years later, the Web has matured and there are millions of people who have mastered the medium. Why not turn over the directory to them? "/>

				<outline text="Narrative" created="Sat, 29 Jul 2000 05:06:08 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Good morning! Come hell or high water we're going to release the first public beta of Radio UserLand today. Thanks for your patience. Things got pretty heavy yesterday, we got a lot of work done, but when it came time to pull the trigger, my eyes were so blurry, even so I was seeing mistakes all over the website. I wanted to get it cleaner and more supportable. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to use this software. First impressions count a lot."/>
					<outline text="We'd like to iterate over the weekend. The first release will be called 7.0b1 (the version number tracks Frontier's, it's built from the same code base, of course). Radio UserLand also has a Frontier-style updates process, so non-kernel changes can be done painlessly. Now when hundreds of thousands of people are using the software we're going to have to charge for updates, or figure out another way to distribute them. We expect to hit more scaling walls with this product, that's one of the reasons we hosted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroups.com/group/radio-userland&quot;&gt;mail list&lt;/a&gt; at eGroups. Let's offload as much as we can."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/stories/storyReader$97&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.userland.com/images/radiodiscuss/originalAppleLogo.gif&quot; height=&quot;31&quot; width=&quot;27&quot; hspace=&quot;8&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;originalAppleLogo.gif: &quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Piecing the story together, I added a &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/appleSparkedRevolution&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; about the personal computer, the revolution that routed around the mainframes. &quot;The Apple II was a perfect mix of the personalities of the Apple founders. It had the polish and physical elegance that Jobs is famous for (it felt a bit like a typewriter, but with far fewer moving parts and much lighter) and the programmability and open frontiers that Steve Wozniak loves.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://radiodiscuss.userland.com/everyoneHasAnOpinionAboutNapster&quot;&gt;Then I wrote a short piece&lt;/a&gt; about Napster, linking it to the stories about mainframes and personal computers."/>
					<outline text="In the last week we've had two main slogans internally. The first one is &lt;i&gt;Keep It Simple.&lt;/i&gt; We've already got the most powerful playlist software. Now how can we make the whole thing come together so it's really simple to use and get started with? We hope to get feedback on this over the weekend. "/>
					<outline text="The second slogan is &lt;i&gt;Let's Win!&lt;/i&gt; I've had gusher products, and I love the feeling of hitting the spot so well that everyone says &quot;Wow that's great!&quot; Since this is a community thing, I want you all to have the same idea, we can win, we can create something that's new and fun and very powerful, we can all win. (By winning I don't mean others have to lose, except perhaps insidious bloatware playlist products.)"/>
					<outline text="After all this time, I'm still listening to Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues. &quot;Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool.&quot; It's addictive."/>
					<outline text="At about this time, Frontier and Manila users are probably wondering if we're leaving them behind. We are not. How can you tell? The website documenting Radio UserLand is a Manila site. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/&quot;&gt;server-side&lt;/a&gt; is Frontier. It all fits together. Radio UserLand is the deployment of our organizing and writing tool (and HTTP, XML-RPC and SOAP web services platform). Music is a wonderful and timely catalyst. Our vision, the Two-Way Web is still very much what we're doing. "/>

					<outline text="One more thing. AOL subsidiary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winamp.com/&quot;&gt;WinAmp&lt;/a&gt; operates a search engine that does the same thing. AOL is merging with Time-Warner, which is part of the RIAA. So if they shut down Napster, we don't have to go to Gnutella to get the music, we can go to Time-Warner. How can they sue Napster for what they do themselves? Someone is ethically impaired here. This seems newsworthy.

				<outline text="A new product in the pipe" created="Tue, 25 Jul 2000 05:03:11 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="We're in the last stages of preparing a new product for market. It's the next step in the development of Pike, which we released as a free public beta in March of this year. "/>
					<outline text="The software works. I'm using it now. It does all the things that Pike did, but it does something new too. "/>
					<outline text="Now, we can't call the software Pike, because there is already a scripting language with that name, and scripting, while hidden from the end-user, plays a big role in the product. I also think it's good to re-think the name, because it forces me to think about what this product is today and what it's likely to be in the future. A good name will make sense now and in the future."/>
					<outline text="So what does this unnamed product do? It's a personal radio station. Our software makes it easy for you to program music the way a DJ programs music (it's probably easier and more powerful than professional radio station software). Scroll through your music list, double-click on songs to add them to the queue. In the background, your servant, our software, is choosing songs from the queue and playing them. "/>
					<outline text="You can also add a &lt;i&gt;list of songs&lt;/i&gt; to the queue with a single menu command. (The user interface is outlining.) You can have as many lists as you want, but there is only one queue."/>
					<outline text="The software is also an HTTP server. You designate a folder that you want to share. Any playlists you put in that folder are available over the Web. Not the songs, &lt;i&gt;we're not enabling MP3 sharing&lt;/i&gt; as Napster and others do. Just the playlists. "/>
					<outline text="Think about this as an Intranet application. Music in business. An untapped market, but a huge one imho. (Hint to the music industry, businesses generally pay for copyrighted material.) "/>
					<outline text="And this is also a www application, because there's interesting information in your playlist, especially when it's aggregated. "/>
					<outline text="The aggregator is not online yet. When it opens you'll see our favorite songs, literally, the songs that are most loved by people at UserLand. But then we'll open it for everyone to register their favorite songs, it will recalc once a day. The format it reads is a simple XML format, easily produced by any scripting language on any platform. We want to know what other people are listening to. So you can share more than your playlists, you can contribute to a new rating system for music. Let's find out what Internet users like to listen to."/>
					<outline text="(BTW, all the playlists are XML too. Registration is handled through XML-RPC. Everywhere we've had a choice to be open or closed, we've chosen open. Our software is subject to competition. The user's data is not locked up in a proprietary format, quite the opposite.)"/>
					<outline text="And of course it gets deeper, but let's not go there now. I'm still trying to figure out how to name this thing!"/>
					<outline text="Here's why that's such a problem. Because all that I described is just an &lt;i&gt;application&lt;/i&gt; of the product. A powerful application, for sure, and developed in record time because the platform is so rich. The key innovation is that all the power is hidden unless you want to see it. The software is as easy to use as a Web browser or Napster. To an end-user it's a simple way to edit a radio station, but to a developer, it can be much more, just lift the hood. It is a platform, and somehow the product positioning, if not its name, must reflect that."/>
					<outline text="And dare I say it, it's a platform for P2P applications, which is the rage in Silicon Valley. We took a long-term view in 1997, and made a bet that the market would swing to distributed applications. We invested where the venture capitalists didn't want to invest. While they were selling e-commerce apps to Wall Street, we were developing a powerful platform for P2P. Now that won't mean too much to end-users, and it's risky because the financial community is so flaky, and even though distributed apps are the way to go, I may not want to latch onto the bandwagon."/>
					<outline text="Anyway, I have to come up with a name soon. The software is almost ready to ship! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

					<outline text="It's the joy of running a server. (Without the pain.)"/>
					<outline text="The first joy is watching the hits come in and wondering who all those people are."/>
					<outline text="In Napster the hits don't come very fast, it takes a long time for most people to download a song. It's cool because you can really ponder who the person is. And even better, you can ask them! (Napster has integrated chat, most web servers don't, a shame.)"/>
					<outline text="I recognize this as a meditation I used to do with WebSTAR. I'd sit down in front of the server (it was in a different room) and watch the log scroll, wondering who these people are, coming from so far away, or from powerful companies, reading some obscure howto on the Frontier site, or whatever. It's the other side of writing, watching people surf your site. A very small percentage of us have had the oppty to do this, but what a useful meditation it is."/>
					<outline text="The other cool thing about running a server, that Napster does not address, is the convenience of editing content. On my old Mac server (now long gone) I used to entertain my friends by opening the home page of my site in BBEdit. I'd change a word, press Cmd-S, and then refresh the web browser. &quot;That's easy!&quot; my friend would say, yes, it's almost magical. Instead of 18 steps to update your site, or even 3, it's 1. There's no more convenient way to edit for the Web than to have a server on your machine. Then it's a small matter to have the changes percolate up when you want to disconnect."/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.camworld.com/&quot;&gt;CamWorld&lt;/a&gt; reports from the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in Monterey CA. &quot;Surprisingly there is very little extended discussion about Microsoft and their .NET initiative. Part of me chalks this up to it being a very open source kind of crowd who learned a long time ago how to live without Microsoft and their products.

					<outline text="Cam, I have a different theory. I offered to come talk about Dot-Net. Never got a response. Something else is going on there. My theory is that Open Source is a world unto itself, like the Mac, or Windows, or CORBA; and not open to ideas that come from outside their community. (See Tim Bray's comment, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/20#timBraysCommentOnOpenSource&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.)"/>

So many other people would have, I learned later in my career. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

					<outline text="There is a companion &lt;a href=&quot;http://soap.weblogs.com/soapQuotes&quot;&gt;quote sheet&lt;/a&gt;. "/>
					<outline text="Taken together or separately, the quotes provide different but valid ways to look at Dot-Net, through the filters of independent (ie non-Microsoft) developers, in content management, writing tools and open source. Each of them offers an opportunity for follow-up, a deeper investigation, exposure of new ideas. This world is bristling with them."/>
					<outline text="So far, these points of view have not been reflected in the general press."/>
					<outline text="A distant memory. There was a time when the press reported on the lack of Mac developers as a major liability for Apple, but never talked about Mac developers. In other words they were reporting on their filters, nothing deeper."/>
					<outline text="A similar thing is going on now. Like VCs, the press mostly writes what their competitors write. Fortune reporters read Business Week; ZDNet reads News.Com. This can make it non-fluid, it's hard for different ideas to circulate or mingle. What if Dot-Net is &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; a Microsoft and open source story? (It is.) "/>
					<outline text="Is there room for curveballs like SOAP, which is also supported by Sun? How do you explain that? I haven't seen any stories on this, other than the initial one at News.Com, which was pretty superficial."/>
					<outline text="Dot-Net is a curveball. It doesn't fit it into one of the standard templates, that's why the press is having so much trouble with it. (BTW, Microsoft has a terrible track record for creating sticky visions in the minds of the press. It's a meta-story for sure, but more to the point than most of the coverage.)"/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;Dot-Net is even broader than it might seem. P2P, which is the rage in VC-land is the same thing. As are Napster and Gnutella. They all use incompatible payload formats, but the concepts of distributed computing, fractional horsepower HTTP servers, and leveraging the desktop are same elements that make up Dot-Net.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Also, don't miss the importance of Web Apps. Dual interfaces, both browser-based and tool-based are essential. I want to update my site whether I am using a public terminal or writing at my desktop. This goes back to Gates's statement at Davos that the desktop is still central. So true.

					<outline text="I was interviewed this morning by NHK, a Japanese radio network, for a special they're doing on business process patents. Here's a summary of what I said."/>
					<outline text="We need competition. With business process patents there will be no competition. Businesses should win based on superior service, performance, and timeliness of their products. Monopolies are bad for competition, even in mature markets. To grant legal monopolies in an industry that is in its defining stages, is to kill the industry."/>
					<outline text="Further, as in the music industry, the software industry has too many middlemen. By allowing legal monopolies, lawyers will take over the high tech industry, and product developers, such as Stallman and myself, will find it impossible to create new products without designing them in conjunction with lawyers. This phenomenon can already be seen in the WAP market."/>
					<outline text="Another point, any country that provided a free innovation zone, would attract developer talent from around the world. It would be wise for Japan to adopt a patent system that is substantially different from that of the US and Europe, if only to provide an incentive for developers to locate there, and to give an advantage to developers already in Japan."/>

				<outline text="Business model for Salon" created="Thu, 13 Jul 2000 05:09:40 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="As you know I've been thinking about future business models for high integrity Web publications like Salon."/>
					<outline text="I'm intrigued, it's a puzzle, using Salon as a case study is helping me chart the next steps for UserLand."/>
					<outline text="I see the Web as an integrated application, of people. We have writers, nerds and music lovers here at UserLand. Same at Salon, but in different quantity and proportion, with different focus."/>
					<outline text="I see the Web playing an important supporting role in the evolution of music-on-the-Internet. In the Dr Dobbs interview (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/13#interviewsPastPresentFuture&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;) I said that music is the next most compelling application, that we'll spend the rest of our careers exploring it, it's so big. "/>
					<outline text="How will the Web contribute? It's already doing it. For every song on Napster, there's a page you can find with Google that has the lyrics. The Web is pretty complete now, as Napster's database is. It's surprising that in the rage over MP3, we're overlooking that a couple of years ago it was considered controversial to share lyrics on the Web. "/>
					<outline text="But the Web can do more, and therein lies the business model. There's a new explosion in software tools and hardware coming, it's quite fluid right now, the emails I'm getting on new product teams forming to create portable players and software is incredible. I have trouble wrapping my mind around all this, but I totally love it. &lt;i&gt;Keep those ideas flowing.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="We need places to share our ideas openly, and we will have them, but we also need integrity and a good name to hang the new ideas on. As we discuss new products, we'll gather communities of people interested in those products, and when they're available, we'll buy them. Let's ask users to reconsider some premises about the freeness of software, as we debate the freeness of music. Why should software be free? Think about it. It probably shouldn't."/>
					<outline text="We've really gummed up the feedback loop between users and developers, adding lots of mindless publicists, icons, lawyers, VCs, and then (lost somewhere in space) software developers. &lt;i&gt;We have the opportunity to collapse out all the middlemen.&lt;/i&gt; Users and developers, connected, one and the same, money flows one way, joy flows the other. This is nirvana. "/>
					<outline text="Clearly, ultimately we're going to realize that we must always pay for our music, at the same time, let's reform the software industry in the other direction, let's have money flow to software artists as it does to musical artists.

					<outline text="So where is the business model for a high integrity publication like Salon? First, they keep doing what they do so well, keeping their eyes and ears open for the next big thing, and they do something new, when something huge like music on the Internet comes along, start new publications, work with vendors (like Napster) to first organize their user community, forming a farm system, and take the best of what they produce and make it a centerpiece of the market.

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.mercurycenter.com/ejournal/2000/07/11&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor points&lt;/a&gt; to two recent Scripting News articles, with a comment. &quot;The traditional media should pay attention to this kind of thinking. They won't.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="He's probably right, but in the long term it won't matter. Dan is the original &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; guy, and to me it's major progress that he's open to reconsidering that premise. "/>
					<outline text="Frankel's claim is troubling for another reason. It's really close to another (sarcastic) slogan, &quot;The best journalism money can buy.&quot; He made money the issue, so this calls into question the role that money plays in editorial coverage. Now, I won't claim that the Times sells editorial, but I've seen it come pretty close. Let me tell you a story."/>
					<outline text="In March 1999, I was surprised to be invited to an Apple press conference. I asked the PR flack if they knew what they were doing. I went to the press conference, of course. I was put in the second row, the same row as John Markoff of the Times. John looked at me, I saw a puzzled face, and perhaps some anticipation that there would be fireworks. He was not disappointed, I'm sure."/>
					<outline text="I asked Jobs the questions everyone else in the audience should have asked. They were promoting Apache to the hilt. They offered flawed statistics, comparing the performance of Mac OS X to Windows NT using Apache as the benchmark. Of course Apache for Windows sucks. Really hard. So the benchmark was totally bogus. I asked Jobs if the benchmarks were bogus. I also asked &quot;What about your users?&quot; all of whom use different Web server software that's not even slightly compatible with Apache. There was no transition plan offered, no message to developers and users. So you had to conclude they were either blowing off the users and developers, or the Apache announcement was total smoke. There can't be any middle ground. Either it was real or not. (I suspect it was not real, it was just opportunistic headline-grabbing, the installed base is too important to ignore.)"/>
					<outline text="The Markoff piece that appeared in the Times the next day quoted the bogus statistics, per Jobs's statement, with no mention of backward compatibility for Mac developers and users. Now why didn't that appear in his story? He was there. He heard the exchange. He should have asked the questions himself, if he really knows his stuff. (If not, why not?) "/>
					<outline text="I never got an answer to these questions when I raised them in a DaveNet &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1999/03/18/everyonesEquallyNasty&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in March 1999. So I have to guess. I want to be very clear, this is a theory. Jobs has a rule. If you write editorial he doesn't like, you lose access. It doesn't matter if you write for the Times or Fortune or Scripting News. Call him on his bullshit, and no more interviews or photo ops. "/>
					<outline text="Jobs gets away with it because his face sells magazines, as does Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, etc. I'd have more readers if I had exclusive Steve Jobs quotes here. (There's the money.)"/>
					<outline text="But I don't want his bullshit. I'm only interested in what he really thinks, not in what he wants *me* to think. "/>
					<outline text="Of course if all the pubs had integrity and courage, they'd call the bullshit artists on their bullshit, and if they wanted coverage, they'd have to answer the questions, and we'd have fewer vaccuous blustery irrelevant announcements. "/>
					<outline text="Can you imagine this headline in the Times: &quot;More Apple Bluster, So Boring&quot;. It'll never happen. It's a parachute-less plane jump for the old media, and that's what they &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want to do."/>

					<outline text="&quot;I think the panel title was meant as a joke. It certainly doesn't represent what we talked about."/>
					<outline text="&quot;PR is a fact of life. Do good journalists try to cut through its hype and get to the real story? Of course. But our lot in life is to be assailed by PR people constantly. And there is such a thing as a sensible way to do PR (use email, don't send attachments, be sure you're sending the info to the right person, etc). That's pretty much what we talked about this morning. Nothing sinister there."/>
					<outline text="&quot;People like Markoff and Levy and even me must swim through a vast sea of PR. Taking a moment out every now and then to talk about the rules of the road on a mundane level isn't some kind of awful collusion; it's just a way to make life work a little better. What's wrong with explaining to publicists, 'Don't waste your time leaving us voice-mail messages we don't have time to listen to -- use e-mail instead'?&quot;"/>

					<outline text="Lots of email today saying right on, lots of Steve Jobs stories out there, it's not hidden, it's very easy to expose."/>
					<outline text="Everyone knows that this kind of collusion exists in the high tech press."/>
					<outline text="Anyone who has had dealings with Steve Jobs knows that his support is conditional on him getting what he wants."/>
					<outline text="But you never see it reported."/>
					<outline text="And it's not just with Jobs, it's rampant all over the industry; and it's supported, perhaps begrudgingly, by the press. The older you are the less you notice it, perhaps."/>
					<outline text="Further, after giving it a few hours thought, I think Rosenberg proves my point. Money &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; buy the attention of the top journalists. If the PR people are such a nuisance, why does he put up with it? It should be easy to get rid of them. And what's behind all those distracting phone calls? Money. Often that's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; that's behind it. "/>
					<outline text="In the last few years the practice of throwing money at PR to support stories with no substance went to the most ridiculous extremes. At a panel discussion for Australian CEOs put on by the Davos people, I asked a VC how many of the deals his companies announced had &lt;i&gt;any substance at all. &lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="He said &quot;1 in 3.&quot; Do the math. That means 2 out of the 3 calls Rosenberg gets have no substance, on average, assuming the VC wasn't exaggerating. So is Rosenberg really doing his job if he takes any of the calls or gives them any weight in deciding what to write about? That's not for me to decide, however it is for me to ask the question."/>

					<outline text="I've been expecting this kind of deal for quite some time, and have been preparing for the day that the euphoria died and the publications of the Web would start re-thinking their business models. Here's my thinking."/>
					<outline text="Any webzine can grow right now by offering sites to their users with their branding on it. Start a farm system, as described in the Making Money &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, publish the work of amateurs. "/>
					<outline text="Teach them how to write for the public. A year from now, we'll turn the best of them into pros, and at the same time avoid mistakes made by the print industry as it transitioned to the Web. And the year after, and the year after that. "/>
					<outline text="The business model? Users openly design new products. "/>
					<outline text="Manufacturers make the most exciting products and sell them to the users. We go back to making products that people want. Step one is to give the users a platform. That's where the publications come in. (They also get a cut of the sales.)"/>
					<outline text="The Web is not a mirror of the print industry, that's why advertising is not so important. The unique thing about the Web is that it's interactive. We all know that. The challenge is to squeeze quality, high-integrity writing out of the readers, and present it back to them with your seal of quality. That's a much higher-growth proposition than employing writers and running ads as the print industry does."/>
					<outline text="I was disappointed to see that Automatic Media is using SlashDot-style conferencing for the Suck-Feed combination. I strongly believe this is the wrong approach. Better to start new Sucks and Feeds using the traditions of sarcasm and literacy that each of these pubs have done such a great job of starting."/>
					<outline text="We're doing it that way. We've started over 6000 Scripting News-type sites here in the last six months. Some are reaching critical mass. It's a thing to behold. "/>
					<outline text="On SlashDot they had to add hard-to-use filtering to create a minimal level of quality. In our world, it's the other way around -- how do you find the good new stuff. That creates the incentive for thoughtful content. That's why, along with Manila, we made the investment in syndication, and in weblogs.com, to assist in finding new stuff."/>
					<outline text="Some pubs could apply this model right now, ones that have powerful readerships, many of whom could immediately start their own sub-pubs. The Industry Standard, Salon, Red Herring, Wired, Suck, Feed, Fawcette, come to mind, but there are probably dozens that could grow this way. Some are already doing it. SourceForge, Motley Fool, Gomez."/>
					<outline text="I've been emailing and meeting with people at WR Hambrecht on this idea for the last few weeks. There's not been enough motion. Perhaps we can do this for ourselves."/>
					<outline text="To be clear, UserLand would be willing to merge with, or supply software or services to, or just support, publications that open to their readers by giving them space to start their own publications. "/>
					<outline text="PS: Another offer to any of these pubs. You may run any &quot;DaveNet&quot; column with your branding on it. I don't want any money. I want to start new flow. Thanks."/>

				<outline text="Salon" created="Mon, 10 Jul 2000 05:07:21 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Of all the publications mentioned above, the one that interests me most is Salon."/>
					<outline text="Here's the pitch. They're independent, not tethered to a larger organization. Their voice has unimpeachable integrity."/>
					<outline text="They've run some excellent stuff, developing a highly regarded name, not just in the Internet space, but more broadly."/>
					<outline text="Salon best captures the early spirit of the Web, and has grown with the Web, not remained static. Wired, which was the early leader, has been decimated, half going to Lycos and the other half going to Conde Nast; and even worse, the people of the early Wired are dispersed all over the industry."/>
					<outline text="Salon ran the Courtney Love &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;. It made sense for it to run there (except I wish they hadn't split it over four pages, there's that pesky print advertising model). That it made sense is the important thing. That's why it would also make sense for Courtney Love and others like her to have their own permanent space on Salon."/>
					<outline text="Another reason I like Salon is that they're &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=saln&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;cheap&lt;/a&gt;. The market cap is only $18 million. Totally undervalued. "/>

Newspapers must adapt to digital technologies or die. The foreseeable techniques of presenting news are dazzling, but they do not yet point to a reliable stream of income to pay for the harvesting of news.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="It's a little subtle, but I strongly believe a new economy will form around news written by people who are now considered amateurs by professional journalists. The journalism profession delivers superficial stories, esp in technology, where most of the writers lack the background of even a first year computer science undergrad. Easily routed around, already routed around, imho."/>
					<outline text="In other areas, we'll rely on multiple sources, as today's reporters do, but instead of turning to icons of questionable integrity, people like Larry Ellison, Scott McNealy, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates or Bill Joy, we'll get the stories from the people, and assemble our own news from those sources. I want to know about the products these guys make, not their bluster and fud."/>
					<outline text="Leaders will still exist, but they will be people who also communicate electronically, without so much ceremony or pomp. I can read email that Linus Torvalds or Tim Berners-Lee post on mail lists. Why do I have to go to a press conference to find out what they think? Wasted money, for the most part."/>
					<outline text="The current print industry makes it easy. They're lazy, and until recently fairly scared of technology. Now the Web is getting more mature, and the next barrier we'll cross is the combination of quality, integrity and economics."/>
					<outline text="Frankel says &quot;The oft-heard promise of 'free news' is an oxymoron. Americans will get the journalism they pay for.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Hogwash, I say. Teach the Web to deliver high quality writing. That's the role for people who know the news business.

					<outline text="On the radio, if they play a song that really resonates, I want to listen to it thirty times to let it sink in, to fully experience it. This happened with Them Changes by Buddy Miles. It took me &lt;i&gt;five years&lt;/i&gt; to get the song on my hard disk, and loop back to where I was when I heard it the first time, which happened instantly when I finally had it playing on my computer a couple of weeks ago."/>
					<outline text="On Father's Day, listening to KFOG, they played Father and Son by Cat Stevens.
