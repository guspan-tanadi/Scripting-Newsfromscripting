Let me explain." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 16:58:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It started with a website for kids that has beautiful MIDIs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/music.htm&quot;&gt;famous songs&lt;/a&gt; for kids to sing along with. I'm kind of a big kid, so I &lt;a href=&quot;http://kids.niehs.nih.gov/lyrics/dixie.htm&quot;&gt;played Dixie&lt;/a&gt; during one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2005/05/14.html#When:11:55:33AM&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=crescent+beach,fl&amp;sll=40.733373,-74.004711&amp;sspn=0.012487,0.012553&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Crescent+Beach,+St.+Johns,+Florida&amp;z=12&quot;&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, and sang the words over the melody. Then Rogers Cadenhead had a great idea -- he joined me in a chorus. Then Kosso joined in. Amy Bellinger and on and on. Most of the intermediate versions are gone, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://idisk.mac.com/rexhammock/Public/dixie-with-rex.mp3&quot;&gt;Rex Hammock's survives&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm still getting used to the idea of creating my own versions of Windows, haven't even released anything yet. But since everything I'm building is open source, there's no reason someone couldn't take my package, make some changes, and then redistribute it with their customizations. Trust obviously becomes a pretty important issue here. " created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 17:25:11 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Something wonderful happened when the Internet broke through a similar logjam in the early 90s. But that's now a distant memory. A new generation has come of age. The students I work with at NYU were small children when the Web grew out of the ruins of the PC business. They don't have any memory of what it was like before. " created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:25:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, the tech companies of today are much larger and more influential than the leading tech companies of the early 90s. Today the music industry's content flows through Apple's servers. Apple is poised to play a large role in the distribution of all other forms of media. Google is huge, as is Amazon and Facebook. And the people running these companies are far more experienced and/or competent than those who were running the industry the last time there was a user takeover." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:26:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My thinking has changed recently, as Google's moves with Buzz have surfaced, and Apple's &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2010/02/tits_and_apps&quot;&gt;moves&lt;/a&gt; to control sexual imagery in the the app store, as they embark on an ugly and dishonest campaign against Flash. Patents are nothing new. Last year, Google patented some very basic technology we created in the first wave of RSS apps. Another company was granted a patent on podcasting. It goes on all the time. What is different is that tech companies are taking a more active interest in the content that flows over their networks, and are doing less to protect their users. Sometimes they're the ones attacking users. Just like other industries." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:28:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Think about how you're treated by airlines. By insurance companies. If you have to go to a hospital. That's the kind of relationship you have with Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, etc. Sooner or later there will be a massive oil spill or a massive network-wide security breach. Expect these companies to be every bit as bad as the ones in other industries. Probably worse because they've come so far without much oversight or scrutiny. Recently Google was given permission to trade energy. Who are these companies? We have no idea." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:36:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you want to know what you can do, great -- there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; things you can do. Buy your own services and put your content in places where you are treated like a customer with rights that are respected. That's still possible. In many industries it's no longer possible, but you can get that kind of service on the Internet now, but you have to pay for it." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:30:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you're in the media industry, stop partnering with the tech industry, and hire away some of their best people and give them power to run your business. This is how your boat will stay afloat. Pretending these companies are your friends is ridiculous. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediactive.com/2010/02/24/why-journalism-organizations-should-reconsider-their-crush-on-apples-ipad/&quot;&gt;don't&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/02/ipad-magazines-newspapers/&quot;&gt;care&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; you. Look at how well they're doing monetizing your content. This is probably what you need to learn to do, and there's no time to learn. Hire their people away and get ready to compete." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:39:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And when you have a choice between using the product of a small company or a large one, give the small one a chance. This helps protect choice and diversity. And if someone creates something new, and they are not working for a big company, celebrate that, make them famous, make sure everyone knows. The myth is that the only new stuff comes from big companies. That's never been true. The only way to change that is to make sure people hear about the new stuff that comes from individuals." created="Fri, 26 Feb 2010 04:31:43 GMT"/>

You have &lt;i&gt;users&lt;/i&gt; and they &lt;i&gt;generate content.&lt;/i&gt; Everything revolves around that model. It's pretty inhuman, because the people who do the generating are sometimes &quot;experts&quot; who invest their whole lives in understanding stuff, and then want to share it with others because that's what humans like to do, even if they aren't being paid. Of course the tech companies are all about being paid, for doing what they do. The users are like hamsters on a treadmill. Do you ever think about paying hamsters? I don't think so! " created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:46:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Okay, everyone says NY is where the future is. I'm afraid this might become hype just like the story you hear about Silicon Valley. It's a way of saying the rest of the world doesn't count. Of course people like to think that they live in the one place that makes a difference, it's simpler that way. The world is so complex, who wouldn't want it to be simpler. But who would be happy if they thought the center of the world was somewhere else? So the battle is constant. And for a while people believed the center was in Silicon Valley. I think the worst thing in the world is to live in the center. There's no where to go but down from there. Upside is better. So I choose to think where I live is somewhere off-center. It's also more interesting." created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:49:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So when the New York conversation drifts, it doesn't end up where the Silicon Valley conversation ends. I guess this is no surprise, right? Where it ends up is with the (forgive me I don't know the terminology) the guy writing the story that informs everyone else. Who is everyone else? It's the hamsters again! This time the hamsters, instead of generating content, are generating revenue! They're clicking on the tip jar, causing micropayments to flow to the author (and his or her editors) so they can earn a living while informing all the other hamsters who are happily paying for all this good stuff. But what happens if the knowledge that everyone wants isn't in the reporters' heads but rather resides with the hamsters? What then?" created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:51:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the past there was a simple answer. No sale. The information just doesn't get there. But that answer is no longer good enough. " created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:53:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Two cases in point. One, the prototype -- This American Life did a special called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355&quot;&gt;Giant Pool of Money&lt;/a&gt; -- which should win a Pulitzer for explaining the financial crisis of 2008 in terms anyone with a mind could understand. Everyone who heard it probably remembers exactly where they were when they did. I was walking on Marin Ave in Berkeley. It was great. Before I heard it I had no clue what the financial crisis was about. After hearing it, I got it. And everyone agrees -- we need more of this. But, I found out last night, much to my chagrin, that it took months to produce this episode. And there's the rub, and why the people who are invested in the NY-based system are so enamored of this example, because it proves that You Need Us. Without heavily and expensively produced content, they say, you won't be informed. " created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:54:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So I provide a counter-example. One that fits my model, which I proudly think of as being neither Silicon Valley-centered or New York-centered. I (of course) think my model is reality-centered. (Yes, I am arrogant, I cop to it.)" created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:57:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The counter-example is this. A fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112172939&quot;&gt;FreshAir episode&lt;/a&gt;, one hour in duration, recorded live, with almost no production, that completely explained the options for universal health care in the US just as the debate was beginning. It was timely, complete, wonderful and super-inexpensive. Why? Because an individual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Healing-of-America/dp/B002IPZBKE/ref=ed_oe_k&quot;&gt;did all the work&lt;/a&gt;. It was paid for by a publisher of course, and he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a professional writer, so while it was expensive, it's part of a reservoir of value that thinkers on both coasts tend to ignore, and in doing so, I think -- miss where the answer is going to come from. The question is -- how will we satisfy the enormous thirst people have for information when the economics of information no longer support vast budgets, or vast amounts of time, to produce expensive wonderful programming like Pool of Money. The answer: From the sources. The people who know what's up. " created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 15:57:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Sure, This American Life produced something sexier, with great production value, and FreshAir is a talk show. But it was still riveting. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/27/healthCareInANutshell.html&quot;&gt;remember&lt;/a&gt; where I was when I listened to it (driving from Santa Cruz between Los Gatos and Fremont). I found, last night, when explaining it, I could name each of the models the author described, and it's been six months since the program aired. It obviously made as much of an impression as Pool of Money did." created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 16:01:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So the moral of the story is that neither coast has the answer, but the answer is out there all the same. Let's not gravitate to an assumption that the cursor has moved 3000 miles to the east and bring all our sloppy thinking habits with us. We have minds, let's use them, and our minds have information, and let's distribute it, to whoever wants it, no matter where it comes from. " created="Fri, 19 Feb 2010 16:02:45 GMT"/>

Someone you're close with is someone you share intimacies with, that's what closeness is. And over time that develops into trust.

Inside each folder were files with names like sports.xml, international.xml, metro.xml, etc. My heart rate went through the roof, my breath drew short, my eyes opened wide, my tongue drooped out of my mouth.

To compete with Twitter is an easy sell inside Google, but to actually have the will to be cut-throat about it, that's another thing. It'll probably have to pay homage to Google Wave (remember that?) and therefore will have some elements that are completely incomprehensible.

If so, here's a list of features to look for. Any of these features would give Google a serious edge over Twitter. Maybe they thought of some things I don't have on my list. It's always nice to put your stake in the ground. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/01/26/readingTeaLeavesInAdvanceO.html&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; it with the iPad with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/01/28/applesJumboOreo.html&quot;&gt;hilarious&lt;/a&gt; results.

					<outline text="1. Reliability. Twitter still has trouble dealing with high-flow events like last night's SuperBowl. Lots of Fail Whales. So if Google is able to offer reliability, no matter how much of an advantage Twitter's installed base is, it won't matter. When Twitter goes down everyone will reassemble on Glitter. " created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:07:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Enclosures. Can you imagine if you couldn't enclose a picture or an MP3 with an email message? Why do we jump through so many hoops just to tweet a picture? " created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:14:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Open architecture metadata. Let developers throw any data onto a status message, giving it a name and a type, and let everyone else sort it out. It would result in an explosion of creativity." created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:15:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Relationships with hardware vendors. I still want a one-click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/12/27/comingsoonatwittercamera.html&quot;&gt;Twitter camera&lt;/a&gt;. If I can't have it from Twitter, I'll take it from Google." created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:16:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. No 140-character limit. I debated this one with myself. At first I compromised and said okay let's have a 250-character limit, or a 500-character limit. But I really don't want a limit. If I want to write short status messages, no problemmo. We've already made the cultural transition. We know how to do it. But sometimes a thought just can't be expressed in 140 characters. No one is wise enough to know what the limit is, so let's just not have one." created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:18:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="6. No URL-shorteners. I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/10/enoughWithShortenedUrls.html&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; this so many times. They're stupid and ugly and they hurt the web. I like it when developers take the time to craft their URLs so they make sense to users. That's all the shortening we really need and all we should have." created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:19:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Those are some of my wish-list items. It seems likely Google will offer #1 and #2. Very unlikely they'll do #3 (they don't trust developers any more than Apple does). Probably not #4, though it would be easy to get some people from Kodak and Sony to come on stage with them. #5 would take a teeny bit of guts. It's a perfect way to throw some serious confusion at Twitter. I'd recommend going all the way, but if they can't, go to 500-characters. Get some editors and authors on stage to say how nice it would be. Because they're making a commitment to their own URL-shortener it seems unlikely they would outlaw them on their status network, but one can hope." created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:17:35 GMT"/>

(Lotus 1-2-3 was probably the last great example.)" created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:03:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The hubris of Twitter is the assumption that the product is unassailable because of the features they leave out. Sooner or later one of their competitors is going to test that theory, and I'm pretty sure it'll prove incorrect. And where they &lt;i&gt;include&lt;/i&gt; horrendous features that a competitor might leave out (I'm thinking of URL-shortening) they don't seem to feel any pressure to take it out. Yet almost every user would enjoy a Twitter with real full URLs that didn't take up any of the 140-character space. Hard to imagine anyone objecting." created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:04:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="OTOH, Google is a big clunky Microsoft-like company with strategy taxes, and they don't trust the web or developers, or each other, and their internal politics drive most of the decisions they make. To compete with Twitter is an easy sell inside Google, but to actually have the will to be cut-throat about it, that's another thing. It'll probably have to pay homage to Google Wave (remember that?) and therefore will have some elements that are completely incomprehensible. Twitter likely won't get killed, because Google's product will likely fall far-short of what's needed to get us all to think they can be trusted. " created="Tue, 09 Feb 2010 01:36:19 GMT"/>

While I'm there it would be interesting for me to catch up on how Computer Science is taught these days, and perhaps talk with some students about how I got where I am and see if there's any interest in working on some projects while I'm in NY in 2010 and 2011.

If I want to add another service, I can put it in the list, and I can tell them how important it is to me by moving it up or down the list. It also makes sense for Google to throw its lot in with the web because they aren't Twitter or Facebook, and they got their start by indexing the open web.

To enjoy, vicariously, the point of view of someone who doesn't know all that decades of life teach you, and is smart enough to know that. But also people who will live to know things I never will know. Hey, we're all here now, people who are at TED and people who are not. People who were alive in 1955, and people who will be alive in 2055. People whose bodies don't need radiation and chemotherapy to have a chance at survival, and those who will be dead next week.

This was starting to irk me, so I looked into &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsriver.org/river2.html&quot;&gt;River2&lt;/a&gt; to see what's going on. Yes, it is finding her posts, but it thinks they're pictures. Why? Because the feed says they're pictures. Oy. " created="Mon, 01 Feb 2010 16:02:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Digging in a little deeper. WordPress has a neat feature that I don't fully understand, called &quot;gravatars.&quot; If you have one, as my mother does, it attaches it to every post, as an image. I'm sure she has absolutely no idea what a gravatar is, and I'm equally sure that WordPress created one for her automatically. " created="Mon, 01 Feb 2010 16:03:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, I want to fix this, so her posts (and those of other WordPress authors) show up where they belong in River2. Other than looking at the URL of the image, I have no idea how to do it. I'm hoping one of the readers of this blog does." created="Mon, 01 Feb 2010 16:04:47 GMT"/>

					<outline text="They use the media:content element to represent the gravatar. I have a strong feeling this is very wrong. It seems to me that a gravatar is a bit of metadata. Why should it be represented as an image, why not as a &amp;lt;gravatar&gt; in a new namespace defined for the purpose of representing gravatars?" created="Mon, 01 Feb 2010 16:05:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The media:content element came into being to help Flickr attach pictures to items in feeds. It probably was a mistake, in hindsight, to try to make a general namespace for this, because it gets us into jams like this. Probably would have worked better if they had come up with a &amp;lt;flickr:picture&gt; element. That way we might not have had this conflict in semantics." created="Mon, 01 Feb 2010 16:07:25 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I'm pretty stuck here. I really need to separate pictures from non-picture items (I subscribe to some awesome picture feeds, and they would completely swamp my news-oriented feeds). It looks like I'm going to have to check if the image comes from gravatar.com. That's a &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; way to parse metadata." created="Mon, 01 Feb 2010 16:09:20 GMT"/>
