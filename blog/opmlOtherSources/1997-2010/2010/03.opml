					<outline text="It's an old story, which I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef&quot;&gt;written here&lt;/a&gt; on Scripting News many times. A ship sinks in a tropical ocean and fish come and live in its hull. Then their predators show up, and pretty soon there's a food chain. Many generations later the skeletal remains of the first fish get so dense they solidify and form rocks around around the remains of the ship. Pretty soon you can't find the wrecked ship.

					<outline text="So today Asus &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/30/apple-ipad-shih-technology-security-asus.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; two tablet computers. The Apple fanboys sniff, but I bet they'll be good. At first I was concerned that Asus might try to write the software themselves. I use their products, and love them, but their software is Taiwanese and doesn't translate well to English. Lots of happy animal cartoon characters and funky messages that make as much sense as All Your Base Are Belong To Us. Instead they're going to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/31/asuss-jonney-shih-confirms-two-tablets-one-for-googlites-one/&quot;&gt;two models&lt;/a&gt;, one that runs a Google OS and another that runs Windows. " created="Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:21:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="You can sniff all you want but I would be surprised if the Asus products aren't better than Apple's in some ways. It could be that Apple understands the value of battery life, a technology that Asus has mastered. Today you can buy a $350 netbook that claims 14.5 hours on a single charge. It's not likely that you'd actually get more than 8 hours on a charge, but that's huge. I have a netbook that was rated at 10.5 hours, and in practice, I'm using it all day as much as I want, even on a cross-country plane trip, and I never look for an outlet to charge it. I don't even bring the charger most times. In contrast Mac users are always tethered to a power outlet. On Monday I forgot to bring my power brick for the Mac to the studio at 20 Cooper Sq, and I used 75 percent of the charge in a single hour. You can see it at conferences too. The Mac users are all grouped around power outlets. The netbook users are spread out everywhere else." created="Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:23:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thing I know Apple doesn't care about is price. There's no Asus netbook you can buy for as much as $499, but that's the &lt;i&gt;entry-point&lt;/i&gt; to the iPad market. For me the iPad is worth $499 because I'll learn from the design of the product. Maybe you will too. But most people just use the things. Sure the iPad breeds lust that Asus likely won't, but at some point these have to be pragmatic products or else they'll just stay in a drawer at home. I bet the Asus products win some pragmatism points relative to Apple. " created="Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:26:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Regardless, until this year there was no market for tablet computers. Microsoft tried to push them, but to no avail. People didn't want them. Now finally there's going to be an installed base of tablets. We'll find out for sure, one way or the other, if they're useful. And if they are, there will be lots of options to choose from, unless Apple hits every point (and they won't)." created="Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:28:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's one thing we know for sure -- Apple will control the gate for software for the iPad and Microsoft and Google don't. That, for me, is a huge difference -- freedom. " created="Wed, 31 Mar 2010 14:30:13 GMT"/>

With the iPad about to ship, and the news industry on the ropes, it seems like a good time to put a stake in the ground, make a prediction, offer some advice." created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:32:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But first a story... Back in 1981, I was an Apple developer and was among the first to get an IBM PC (it shipped that year). The PC was a great advance over what Apple had been offering. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/08/01/bigBlankMachine.html&quot;&gt;I called it&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;big blank machine&quot; because it had 640K memory and could host relatively large and inexpensive hard drives. " created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:33:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The IBM PC came with a choice of operating systems. " created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:35:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. CP/M -- then the leading OS, installed on most computers, including Apple's." created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:35:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. UCSD P-system -- a very popular system, largely because Apple was an early adopter. My software at the time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outliners.com/thinkTank2Pc&quot;&gt;ThinkTank&lt;/a&gt;, was written to run under the P-system." created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:36:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. PC-DOS -- a new operating system created by Microsoft for IBM. At the time Microsoft wasn't a very big company. Apple was much larger, so was the publisher of the leading spreadsheet, and the publisher of the leading word processing software. " created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:36:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The prices of the three products were, respectively: $450, $550, $40. " created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:37:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So which of the three became the default choice? Do I have to even ask? &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:39:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even though I had made a huge investment in the P-system, and there were far more CP/M developers (there were zero PC-DOS developers), my first PC ran PC-DOS. I could have had my software running on the PC in hours, but I chose the slower route because I could tell, easily, which OS was going to win." created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:40:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, in a way, a newspaper is to the iPad what the OS was to the IBM PC. The one that gets installed first is going to have a huge advantage over the ones that come second or third. A newspaper is an advertising platform, and the iPad probably will be a hot reading platform, and the apps (ads) will seek out the hot newspaper the same way guys like me bet on PC-DOS and ignored CP/M and UCSD." created="Mon, 29 Mar 2010 12:41:22 GMT"/>

					<outline text="&quot;It's like in football. When the quarterback gets the ball, the quarterback always turns back and runs a few yards back before even thinking about passing the ball. And you think, 'Why is the quarterback doing that? He's giving up yardage. I mean, he's running the wrong way.' Well he does it to find some little bit of room so he can see what's out there. So, in the news industry, they're never willing to do that. They're always standing right at the scrimmage line, not budging an inch.

Back in the early days of RSS someone came up with a convention for linking an HTML page to its feed. Most of the blogs in the Times list obey this convention, so I was able to write a script that, in fifteen minutes or so, while I killed some time playing, got me most of the feed URLs.

I know all the people the article was about, Jay Rosen, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalism.nyu.edu/faculty/kroeger.html&quot;&gt;Brooke Kroeger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalism.nyu.edu/faculty/jones.html&quot;&gt;Rich Jones&lt;/a&gt;, the NYU students (who have personalities and lives but weren't mentioned by name in the piece). One thing I'm kind of grateful for, given the reaction of East Village bloggers to LEV, is that my name didn't come up in the piece. True, I'm just an adviser, but I have some experience blogging, and I hung out in the East Village when I was growing up in NY in the 70s." created="Thu, 18 Mar 2010 13:37:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's a lot of planning going into LEV, as you would expect from two organizations the size of the NYT and the NYU. I think the people involved are well-intentioned. I think the East Village bloggers have every right to feel their turf is being invaded. I said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/10658314532&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; last night, after writing about the competition between Kindle and iPad that it must seem to them as if Amazon and Apple have all of a sudden taken an interest in their turf, and they're not sure what that interest is. To which I would say, don't worry, they're not really sure either. But they think the East Village is interesting, and the Times covers NY and the EV is in NY and like it or not (and a lot of people seem to not like it) NYU is largely &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; the East Village. Having NYU itself watch the EV, esp under the guidance of people of high integrity like Rosen, Kroeger and Jones, is probably a very good thing." created="Thu, 18 Mar 2010 13:41:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My own perspective is as ephemeral as the students' perspective. My current appointment lasts one year. I may have an ongoing relationship with NYU but what that is, if anything, is completely unknown. I'm just focusing on what's happening now, and what I can do to help. And rather than bury my ideas in internal emails, I think I should offer my advice openly, so that any blogger can take advantage of it, not just the NYT/NYU bloggers." created="Thu, 18 Mar 2010 13:44:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So here's the first bit -- I want to learn about the history of the East Village. I want to know where the ghosts are and what they did. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Jeremiah's Vanishing New York&lt;/a&gt; is already doing a wonderful job of that. Let's do more." created="Thu, 18 Mar 2010 13:46:11 GMT"/>

					<outline text="A second bit of advice. Even though my experience in the Village goes way back, I left New York and didn't come back for almost 40 years. A lot has changed in the meantime. I need a blog that contains a stream of interesting, useful even vital information for people who are new to the Village. For example -- now that the weather is good (knock wood) where's a good place to hang outside, read a book, watch people, have my coffee cup refilled, arrange to meet people. I'm sure people who've lived here a while know where to go. I'm a newbie. Help!" created="Thu, 18 Mar 2010 13:47:21 GMT"/>

And the only way they feel love for you is if you love them. Sting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTEm6oVPUD0&quot;&gt;once sang&lt;/a&gt;: If you love someone set them free. The wisest words ever sung, imho. People are smart. Even if they don't see the lock-in, they feel it. Eventually they will bolt. If your investors say you need to force your users to use your stuff, fire your investors and keep the users. Money is fungible. People are not." created="Tue, 16 Mar 2010 20:18:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Choose the best people to compete with. If you're lucky enough to have your company grow, you're going to need great competitors to keep your employees from getting lazy and starting to act like they work for a Big. It's amazing how quickly that happens. The most successful entrepreneurs have been able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inculcate&quot;&gt;inculcate&lt;/a&gt; a tremendous fear of and respect for competitors among their people. It's much better than thinking your competitors are buffoons. If they're smart enough to compete with you, they're pretty freaking smart." created="Tue, 16 Mar 2010 20:19:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Make products for geniuses, for the simple reason that if you think your customers are stupid, then what does that say about you? You make a product that idiots choose? It must suck. So if you're making a good product, it follows that it's for really really smart people who can sort through all the crap out there and pick the best stuff. Yours. " created="Tue, 16 Mar 2010 20:27:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Only steal from the best, and consider theft of your ideas the most sincere form of respect (it is). But when you steal, don't be a dick and make your version incompatible. See item #1. That's lock-in and if you do it YOU SUCK and deserve to die." created="Tue, 16 Mar 2010 20:21:15 GMT"/>

All universities should encourage their students to skip the shortcuts. Getting wealthy by cheating isn't a good way to live. Get wealthy by being the best!

					<outline text="Here's how the UI works currently. You edit your post and link to an MP3 or a movie or an AVI or some other media object. The first one that WP encounters as it parses your text, it will supposedly turn into an enclosure. If you happen to link to two MP3s but the second is the enclosure, you're out of luck. And for some reason if you store the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/reboot10Mar08.mp3&quot;&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon S3, as we do, it usually doesn't even find the enclosure. But this is variable. Today they've hacked up our link to point to some server on wordpress.com, totally without our permission. What a mess. And even so there's no enclosure in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://rebootnews.com/feed/&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; for this &lt;a href=&quot;http://rebootnews.com/2010/03/09/rebooting-the-news-43/#comments&quot;&gt;week's&lt;/a&gt; show (which btw I think is one of our best, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/reboot10Mar08.mp3&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I hope everyone listens to)." created="Wed, 10 Mar 2010 13:06:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For the last three episodes of our podcast, it's failed to add an enclosure element to the feed. As a result none of our listeners get the podcast on time, and it always takes some fussing by the WordPress tech people to get it working, and for all I know a bunch of people &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; hear the podcast. I suppose it depends on whether or not the client sees an item as read if the guid doesn't change but all of a sudden the item has an enclosure. Imho a proper podcast client would just watch the guid, and therefore would miss the enclosure. Regardless, it's simply unacceptable that WordPress work this way and that Automattic doesn't do something to fix it." created="Wed, 10 Mar 2010 13:16:02 GMT"/>

Did LiveJournal spawn out of a blog that spawned out of something that came from Scripting? I have no idea. But I do know that most of the early bloggers were readers of this site, and many participated in the discussion group here.

There are no feeds in either direction -- you can't subscribe to feeds from within SnapGroups, and it doesn't generate feeds, so I can't subscribe to stuff from SnapGroups in other RSS-aware environments. But it does look nice, and Mark is the author of Bloglines, so we know he understands feeds. These days, you can't even get into the game without basic feed support.

					<outline text="Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marshallk.posterous.com/tech-startups-exclusivity-and-our-competitors&quot;&gt;Marshall Kirkpatrick&lt;/a&gt;, who writes for ReadWriteWeb, says the big players in his market, TechCrunch, Mashable, AllThingsDigital, don't pick up stories once RWW has covered them. This gives vendors an incentive to give exclusives to the big pubs, assuming they want coverage from them. Vendors who buy that are making a mistake. The news will find the people who need to know it, more now than ever. Pick a reporter who you think will understand your product and give them enough time. That's one approach, if you think you can get the attention. Otherwise, just write your own blog post, and send the links around to all the reporters, and hope they find it interesting. I know this isn't the standard advice, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/08/14/gatekeepingIsALosingStrate.html&quot;&gt;gatekeepers&lt;/a&gt; figure you need them a lot more than they need you, and act accordingly. It's hard to get insightful reporting from them, and I think the readers have figured that out. All pubs should follow this simple rule: write up whatever you find interesting, whenever you discover it, no matter who has already written it. Anyone who plays it differently will eventually pay a penalty. And these days &quot;eventually&quot; is a lot sooner than it used to be. " created="Tue, 09 Mar 2010 09:54:15 GMT"/>

That same principle can be applied to conferences, and if it's done well, and Jarvis does it well, with spectacular results. " created="Sat, 06 Mar 2010 20:01:36 GMT"/>

That's much appreciated, no sarcasm. All companies should plan for their users' data surviving them. But my concern is what if Google &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; go away. This is a company that's at least heavily influenced by lawyers, if not run by them. They aggressively patent. Personally, I'd rather not build a new ecosystem out of Google patents.

There's an evil adversary and she has a posse of despicable, frightening and evil allies. The movie is a buildup to the final showdown. The two do battle. The hero wins. The adversary is humilated and most of his posse is killed. There's a closing scene where everyone agrees life is great and the credits roll. It's Star Wars meets Harry Potter, Avatar meets Indiana Jones. Every movie with a budget fits this template, with the exception of parts of recent Pixar movies (they always include the basic elements but it doesn't always completely dominate the plot).

Or the poor misunderstood Frankenstein -- Edward Scissorhands, who was only trying to do good, yet was run off by the villagers. Other reviewers say that Burton movies lack plot direction, but I disagree. The plots don't always end happily, but they often end with a song, nonetheless. I doubt if Disney would let the film be anything but colorful, but even children like a little depravity as long as it's not too dark. " created="Fri, 05 Mar 2010 23:26:03 GMT"/>

No matter what you must ask for permission, and don't be surprised if the answer is no. There are good reasons for this, if one person talks about his or her product, then their competitors will feel they are entitled to, and pretty soon the user's needs are drowned out by the needs of the vendors.

And with users actively relating topics on the web, that long-term probably could help search engines make sense of the information.

					<outline text="First, where I &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; think it is -- getting ad dollars from the local pizza parlor or stationery store. There may be nickels and dimes there, but the mega-dollars come from slicing the pie differently from the geographic way people are slicing local news up now." created="Wed, 03 Mar 2010 22:43:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Instead, pick the businesses that generate billions of dollars in the local economy that are information-based, where the information currently being supplied is inadequate. That's not restaurants and entertainment. " created="Wed, 03 Mar 2010 22:44:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I started looking for an apartment in Manhattan, one of my requirements was FIOS. I naively assumed I'd be able to get it because my mother had it in Queens. Manhattan is a bigger, more lucrative market than Queens, so of course Verizon has it covered. Turns out, for a variety of reasons, it's not true. There's almost no FIOS in Manhattan. But if you went to the Verizon site you'd never find that out unless you punched in every address in Manhattan and found out that very few return positive.

					<outline text="The norm in entertainment, the system I grew up in -- the entertainment industry controlled what you watched and listened to, and when, where, and how much you paid for it. You could make your own special mix tapes, but that was hard and most people didn't do it, so they looked the other way. Napster was a big breakthrough. All of a sudden all the music was there for the asking, whenever you wanted. " created="Wed, 03 Mar 2010 16:05:17 GMT"/>

Apple doesn't care about web standards, nor do any other large companies. That term, and &quot;open&quot; are just fig leaves that cover up what they're reallly doing. Instead of opening things up, they're doing just the opposite. Closing as many holes as they can as quickly as they can. Because they're doing what the media business wants to but hasn't been able to do, yet -- control and monetize user programming of content. Apple and many (if not all) of the tech companies want to get the control back from the users. Of course they can't say this, and they won't. But actions speak louder than words." created="Wed, 03 Mar 2010 16:07:07 GMT"/>

There's a chilling comment in the middle of the story saying they want to get rid of hard disks. That, my friends, is Hollywood's dream. The real culprit, the real cause of their economic problems isn't the Internet, it isn't the wires that connect computers. It's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_nr_p_36_2?rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Atb+external+hard+drive%2Cp_36%3A1253505011&amp;bbn=172282&amp;sort=pmrank&amp;keywords=tb+external+hard+drive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1267634834&amp;rnid=386442011&quot;&gt;under-$100&lt;/a&gt; terabyte hard drive.
