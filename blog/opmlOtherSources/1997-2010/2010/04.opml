					<outline text="We're in the phase of the tech loop where what matters is how impressive your latest press event was. To illustrate the effect of a great press event, look at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.com/2010/04/30/why-it-is-too-late-to-regulate-facebook/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; by Scoble where he basically says Game Over, point-set-match to Facebook, checkmate, everyone go home, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_ain%27t_over_%27til_the_fat_lady_sings&quot;&gt;fat lady&lt;/a&gt; has sung, etc etc." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 14:58:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The problem is that Scoble (who I love as a dear friend) will write the same freaking piece on May 20, when Google has had their press event, has shown all the great press releases they've written, and rolls out on stage a few tech rockstars, and probably one or two real rockstars, after all they go to Davos every year, just like Zuck. Google can hire the best PR consultants and Hollywood staging people just like anyone else. And guys like Scoble and Arrington and Steve Gillmor eat this shit up. They even have a name for this kind of vaporware -- Vendor Sports. God bless em. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:00:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The problem for Twitter is that they didn't have a great press event. &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/14/live-twitter-ceo-ev-williamss-chirp-keynote/&quot;&gt;Ev&lt;/a&gt; isn't very good with an audience, and they hired an academic guy to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-20000486-52.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; him, someone no one knew, and he apparently wasn't very good, so everyone came away totally unimpressed with Twitter's theatrics. What's needed is some good earth-shaking from or about Twitter. " created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:02:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It could be about Twitter. That's why I thought for a moment that Google might make an offer that Twitter can't refuse somewhere around May 10. The rumors start trickling out on May 11 or 12, and by May 19, every insider in Silicon Valley is sure that Biz and Ev are going to show up part of the Google team again and about $2 billion richer. Sure couldn't blame them for taking the money, just when the excitement about Twitter is waning." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:04:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's one other thing Twitter could do, that would make a much better press release, because it would be the kind of press release that unlike Facebook's and unlike the one that Google is sure to run, has substance. That's what I wrote about yesterday." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:05:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;i&gt;They could provide a way for anyone to run their own Twitter. &lt;/i&gt;" created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:06:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="That's a big idea. You can't argue that Facebook can't and won't match that. Can you imagine Zuck getting up on stage and saying &quot;We decided to let you run your own Facebook on your server.&quot; I can't imagine it, anymore than I can imagine Bill Gates open sourcing Windows in 1992, at the peak of his power. Or Apple open sourcing the code that runs the iPad. Trusting the universe is something a disrupter does. It's why Android has a shot vs the iPhone. And it's why Twitter would do a lot to save itself from impending doom if they decided they didn't need to be exclusive with their users. " created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:06:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For the rest of us, this would be cool. We need Twitter itself do something to facilitate federation, otherwise it will be hard to prove that anything happened. (And yes, I know that most people won't want to run their own Twitter, we don't need a billion Twitters, but we do need more than one.)"/>
					<outline text="I'm not saying they will actually do anything like this, there's almost no historic precedent for it. The only time I ever saw it work, and I didn't think it would work when it happened, is when Netscape open sourced Mozilla. But it &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; work. I'm using Firefox now, and so are a very significant number of other people. Chrome is open source and has a shot at the market largely because of what Netscape did. Their move took a while to be felt in the market, but it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; felt."/>
					<outline text="Will Twitter do it? I don't think the founders are such daring thinkers as Marc Andreessen was back then. But there's always a chance. Even if they don't it's one of the things I enjoy, like playing chess, I suppose. Being an armchair general, hypothesizing about what I would do if I had the reigns of power, and wondering how they would work out." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:11:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I also wondered why Matt Mullenweg isn't under as much pressure as Twitter Corp is."/>
					<outline text="One reason is that Matt had a revenue model from Day One, and it's a model that has been proven over and over to work, and to be fair, and the users like it."/>
					<outline text="And the other reason is that Matt doesn't insist on exclusivity. You can compete with him using his software. How has that worked out? Pretty incredibly well." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:12:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I'd like to see Twitter trust the universe. Their business model would be as solid as Verisign's or WordPress's, plus they can run one of the instances, the largest one to start, and if they do it right, it will always be the largest. But the lack of competition in this space is what's keeping Twitter small, and staying small isn't going to work for them very much longer, imho." created="Fri, 30 Apr 2010 15:12:57 GMT"/>

" created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:20:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I've felt for a long time that Twitter should have welcomed federation early-on, when the competition wasn't so fierce. While it wasn't a slam-dunk, I thought there was a decent chance our Twitter log-ins could be the default username for many other sites on the net. Now Facebook is making a strong bid to be that, and if Twitter were to try that now it would likely be seen as too-little-too-late." created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:21:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then my friend, who asked not to be named, wondered why WordPress isn't in the same place as Twitter. I answered with an analogy -- Twitter is riding a bicycle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_95&quot;&gt;Interstate 95&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook and Google are two semis about to have a head-on collision. Twitter may not be directly competing with either of them, and Google probably doesn't care much about Twitter one way or another, but the collision is going to do some serious damage to all who are in the vicinity. WordPress isn't riding a bike and they are nowhere near the freeway. Picture &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the beach sipping a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mai_Tai&quot;&gt;Mai Tai&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:23:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It sure feels this way but then I wondered -- &lt;i&gt;why? &lt;/i&gt;" created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:26:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And if WordPress is on the beach sipping drinks with little &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_umbrella&quot;&gt;umbrellas&lt;/a&gt;, how can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=ev+and+biz&quot;&gt;Ev and Biz&lt;/a&gt; get some of that action? Then I figured it out." created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:26:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Two bits (and they may be very hard for Twitter to do):" created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:27:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. I don't mind hosting sites on wordpress.com because I know if I ever want to get them off I can run them on my own server. I need to be able to do that with Twitter (or Tumblr for that matter). In other words, there must be an open source, easily installable Twitter that's the same thing that twitter.com is running, so I can just move my presence there and not skip a beat. People are going to say I can do that with Identi.ca, but I can't -- when I move my WordPress blog my domain points to the new location and all my links still work. To really trust Twitter, they have to enable competition at this level." created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:27:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. I must be able to completely control the look and feel of my presence. This is something &lt;a href=&quot;http://automattic.com/&quot;&gt;Matt &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt; could do much better too, but Twitter hardly does it at all. This is something Ev should understand, as one of the early blogging tool vendors, he should remember how important a role designers played in the evolution of blogging. Given that Twitter and the other services in this space (e.g. Facebook) don't allow the user &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; control over the HTML of their presence, it should be easy to improve this. But I want power over everything. More important, I want designers to have power over everything so I can use the product of their work." created="Thu, 29 Apr 2010 15:29:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So in summary: I need to be able to isntall my own Twitter and move my presence to my own server, easily. And I need control over the look and feel of my site. Those two things would do enough to shake up the market and give Twitter a new way forward and make what Facebook and Google do in their battle-of-the-titans-to-death mostly irrlevant to them.

					<outline text="When an independent developer is introduced to this mess, it's usually by someone very high up the structure of the company because we tend to be visible to the outside world, relative to the typical grunt inside the BigCo. Our visibility and our introduction by the TopGuy immediately breeds resentment -- before they even meet you they don't like you, or worse, are committed to your failure. And while there may be penalties for killing someone &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; the corporate hierarchy, there's no penalty for offing the outsider. "/>

					<outline text="No one lays it out for you this clearly, like I just did. It takes years of trying to work with the BigCo's to figure out that while the TopGuy smiles and shakes your hand at conferences, and maybe even says kind things about you in a press release, there is &lt;i&gt;zero chance&lt;/i&gt; that the people who actually make the decisions, the Ouija board of all the engineers and their managers, will work with you. Eventually there comes a day when you're standing there holding an empty bag wondering WTF just happened."/>
					<outline text="I should say &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; zero instead of zero. I've had two examples of times when BigTechCo's said they were working with me, and really did do the work, and several examples outside the tech industry, in publishing. In one case, with XML-RPC in 1998, it was because a handful of engineers who were mavericks (unlike John McCain who just throws spitballs from the back of the room) and believed in something, and were respected enough inside Microsoft to cut through the corporate bullshit, but only for a very short period of time (really just two or three weeks). The machine eventually clamped down and turned it into a mess, owned by the W3C and IBM, Sun, and 18,000 other BigCos and BigCo-wannabes."/>
					<outline text="The other example was RSS, which only worked because the company I was working with, Netscape, evaporated into thin air in the middle of the project!

This is not acceptable. (BTW, quietly Twitter has acquired the same power.) Even so, the API is admirably simple, and worth using -- but it should also be available in XML. There's lots of XML code out there, tap into it. Facebook not saving any money by not offering it and they're showing they're picky about who develops for them -- not good for trust. And regardless, their offer is unacceptable. It must be federated, the data must live in lots of places.

Then, yesterday -- late Friday afternoon (the deadest time of the work week in the tech blogosphere) Twitter announces they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html&quot;&gt;acquiring&lt;/a&gt; the leading Twitter client on the iPhone, Tweetie." created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:54:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So what does this mean for Twitter client developers?" created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:40:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, there are other platforms that have excellent Twitter clients. And there are different types of clients, aimed at different kinds of users. Tweetie is unusual in that it aims for simplicity and elegance, where most of the others are designed for people who push Twitter to its limits. It could be that Twitter will acquire clients on other platforms, or designed for different users, but I don't actually think they will. I think Tweetie will be it in the client area, at least for a while. Instead of acquiring products on other platforms, I'd bet they'll hire expertise, and port the Tweetie code base to Android, Macintosh, iPad, Windows, maybe even Flash (I hope so, someone has to challenge Apple). The reason -- maintainability and cost. It's a lot easier and cheaper to upgrade one cross-platform codebase than it is to synchronize upgrades across multiple codebases.

					<outline text="So now there's Tweetdeck, Twitterific, Twitroid, Brizzly, etc. Would you, if you were them, just roll it up and send flowers to the Tweetie guys and go back to consulting or working at Starbucks? Or would you try to make a go of it in an environment where you compete with the platform vendor? I hope at least some of them try to make a go of it. And the reality is that they were &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; competing with the platform vendor whether or not they chose to recognize it. Nothing new there other than awareness." created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:42:48 GMT"/>

If they announce the metadata-rich platform that I outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/04/09/howTwitterCanKillTheTwitte.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt;, and I expect they &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; do this (my post was not a complete shot in the dark), then you have a chance of producing a more specialized product aimed at a narrower niche, using the new status properties to tag messages invisibly with information about their origin (following the example of the dog-who-tweets outlined in that piece).

There's zero cost to them to announce it if they don't have to ship it immediately. In fact, they never have to ship it. But it has the effect of forestalling a similar effort by client developers, which I would get ready to do, no matter what Twitter does this week." created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:46:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The way you start is by offering an option to save your users' tweets to a public server in RSS 2.0. You're not exposing any data that isn't already public in their tweetstream. And you're providing a backup. You're also providing a way for other Twitter clients to find your users' stream without going through Twitter. This means you can upgrade the stream on your own schedule, without having to wait for Twitter. All this requires is that you cooperate with your competitors, the ones who, like you, did not get bought by Twitter. This has always been a tall order, but it's what you will have to do to chart the new waters. (And if you go first you don't have to cooperate, unless a big competitor decides later to be incompatible, in which case I recommend you capitulate and go with their way.)" created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:47:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I advised doing this, privately, to various client vendors over the last couple of years, but all of them held out hope that they would be the one that Twitter would buy. They may still hope for that, but everyone should admit that the chances are much slimmer now. Whatever you do will be answered by Twitter, so you have to make your stuff work better, and offer features they aren't offering, and independence to your users that they don't offer. You want to segment the market, as &lt;i&gt;Fred even encourages you to do&lt;/i&gt; in his post, yet retain compatibility. It's hard but it's possible." created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:49:32 GMT"/>

Because this exact advice would have served the Macintosh app developers in the early 90s before the web swept up our whole world and (thankfully) turned it upside-down. We were stuck in an unworkable relationship, all of us, with the platform vendor. If the developers had discounted the chances of being the favorite of the platform vendor and emphasized working with each other as equals, we might have had a chance. But as long as each of us was betting that we could be the Number One Wife, we had no chance. Same thing here, but now Twitter has made a choice, and that makes moving on easy, where it wasn't before. " created="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 12:51:38 GMT"/>

Instead Google shipped the disappointing in-so-many-ways Buzz. " created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:42:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, let's try that experiment in reverse. Suppose Twitter wants to make their offering much more competitive and at the same time much more attractive to developers. Sure, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/04/the-twitter-platform.html&quot;&gt;Fred Wilson telegraphed&lt;/a&gt;, some developers are going to get rolled over, esp those who camped out on the natural evolutionary path of the platform vendor. But there are lots of things Twitter Corp can do to create more opportunities for developers, ones that expand the scope of the platform and make it possible for a thousand flowers to bloom, a thousand valuable non-trivial flowers." created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:26:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The largest single thing Twitter could do is open tweet-level metadata. If I want to write an app for dogs who tweet, let me add a &quot;field&quot; to a tweet called isDog, a boolean, that tells me that the author of the tweet is a dog. That way the dog food company who has a Twitter presence can learn that the tweet is from a dog, from the guy who's developing a special Twitter client just for dogs, even though Twitter itself has no knowledge of the special needs of dogs. We can also add a field for breed and age (in dog years of course). Coat type. Toy preference. A link to his or her owner. Are there children in the household?" created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:28:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's plenty of prior art. Two examples I can think of are Apple's Resource Manager and Amazon's SimpleDB. There are probably many others.

					<outline text="1. No more need for URL-shortening. The URL becomes just another piece of metadata attached to a tweet. If you need to shorten it on its way out through an SMS gateway, go for it.

These guys should take an introductory course in Computer Science.)" created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:34:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. You can attach a picture to every tweet, and still link to an article. Just make &quot;thumb&quot; or something like that a default bit of metadata. (An aside, why not use the conventions of XML to define the metadata. All the elements of the core namespace are reserved for Twitter. If you want to extend it, create a namespace and have a party. Please no meta-meta-language though, just let a little chaos reign. It must at some level.)" created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:35:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. You can also support long and short-form tweets. The 140 characters can act as a synopsis for the longer text that's included in the tweet. This would give people the feature they're always asking for in RSS feeds -- full text." created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:37:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. A developer like Disqus could implement a full threaded discussion system for every tweet, and thereby give Twitter a way to compete with Facebook and if Google ever gets its act together, Buzz. " created="Fri, 09 Apr 2010 15:38:25 GMT"/>

People should find out what they think by having experiences, and then reflect on them and try new things out, always feeling you have the right to change your mind. Like a lot of people I was brought up by a father who thought it was a sign of weakness to change your mind. As a result I have a very strong will about that and welcome any new idea that might shift my perspective. I wish more people did. I'm neither a Republican or Democrat, not right or left.

And most new tech products, no matter how daring, well-executed, fun to play with and just plain sexy they are, don't turn out to be game-changers.

Of course I watched it on the iPad, and the experience was very nice. I was not the only person on the plane with an iPad, there was at least one other person who had one, a man sitting in the last row of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/04/04/businessClassSeatFollowup.html&quot;&gt;business class&lt;/a&gt; (I was in the first row).

					<outline text="Like everyone else who got one, I am trying to figure out how to make it my own. I keep hitting frustrating limits. I want to use it to write. Impossible, I've discovered. None of my writing tools are there. Not just the ones I use to enter keystrokes into the computer, and edit and revise them, but also the tools I use for finding information I want to reference in my stories. For example, when I wrote this piece, I paraphrased the quote from Bowie, expecting that later, when I'm revising it, I'll be able to get the exact words either by looking it up on the web, or by playing the movie on my computer and transcribing the words. Both are of course &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; on the iPad, assuming the movie is already on board, but the looking-things-up part can be really awkward, at least for me, now. Maybe I'll learn the elegant way to do it." created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 10:43:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But learning how the iPad works is in itself trouble. When I got off the plane in SFO, I wanted to find out if I had time to eat a late lunch before the one hour train trip to Berkeley. For that I had to use my Droid. The iPad was already stowed in my luggage, and the Droid can communicate on its own. But it has different user interface conventions. This is no accident of course. Software-makers always make it difficult to use their product with a competitor's product. It's simpler to make a choice, either be all-Apple or all-Google." created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 10:46:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's definitely not a writing tool. Out of the question. This concerns &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefastertimes.com/mediaandtech/2010/04/04/the-ipad-an-unhappy-return-to-the-past/&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;, rightly so. This is something &lt;a href=&quot;http://evespeeves.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/the-ipad/&quot;&gt;my mother&lt;/a&gt; observed when I demoed it to her on Saturday. &lt;a href=&quot;http://editor.blogspot.com/2010/03/yes-most-of-us-are-still-media.html&quot;&gt;Howard Weaver&lt;/a&gt; writes that not everyone is a writer. True enough, and not everyone is a voter, but we have an interest in making it easy for people to vote. And not everyone does jury duty, but easy or not, we require it. Writing is important, you never know where creative lightning will strike. And pragmatically, experience has shown that the winning computer platforms are the ones you can develop for on the computer itself, and the ones that require other, more expensive hardware and software, don't become platforms. There are exceptions but it's remarkable how often it works this way. (And to Weaver, there's a reason why no one evaluates Amazon products this way, the concern that the Mac, an open platform we depend on, will receive the same treatment.)" created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 10:50:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Most of this is negative, and it reflects my feeling about the iPad, which is generally negative, even though I have a lot of fun discovering the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dvice.com/archives/2010/04/20-biggest-grip.php&quot;&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; with the device. It feels so nice to use. It's so pretty and the touches are so incredibly thoughtful and theatric. I feel like it's a great Hollywood movie that I control. That's coool. I like using it the way I like driving my BMW. " created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 10:54:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And the battery performance is astounding. Apple, who seemed never to understand how important batteries are to the untethered creative person, has apparently attained that understanding. My iPad still has 44% of its battery left after flying  across the country, in use the whole time, and on train trips to and from airports, and reading the news this morning at breakfast. That's remarkable, not just for Apple, but in comparison to the netbook that I admire for its battery life. " created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 10:56:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, in the iPad's favor -- the screen is uncluttered with the 30-year history of personal computer development, and my netbook screen is. As a result, even though the netbook has a slightly larger screen, the iPad actually feels larger, and effectively &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; larger. That's why the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/04/03/verdictAfterOneDay.html#p4&quot;&gt;map application&lt;/a&gt; feels so much bigger and more useful, because it has more screen real estate to play with. But this comes at  a substantial cost. There is lots of missing important functionality. And even where the functionality is present, it's hard to find, and because it works differently makes it hard to use both the netbook and the iPad. And I believe that, for me, the open platform will win, for a variety of reasons. " created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 10:59:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Some of the clutter on the netbook is necessary. The biggest missing piece for the iPad is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmarks.com/&quot;&gt;Xmarks&lt;/a&gt;, the bookmark synchronizer I use. I have two computers in NY and several in Berkeley. I have a netbook and a MacBook that travel, and now the iPad. And a Droid. It would be nice if the Droid supported Xmarks (feature suggestion). But it's &lt;i&gt;necessary&lt;/i&gt; that the iPad support it, or long-term I just can't use it." created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 11:01:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In an earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/04/03/verdictAfterOneDay.html#p6&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;, I said it was terrible that all data had to flow onto the iPad through iTunes. Later that day I discovered that this is totally not true, if you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, as a I do. I installed it on the iPad and within a minute was watching a movie that I had in a sub-folder of my dropbox folder on my Mac. I have to dig into this some more, because it needs the ability to only share a subset of my Dropbox. I don't want all my data on the iPad. It has limited storage, and I worry more about losing it than I do my other computers." created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 11:05:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="As I continue to struggle to find an iPad workflow that makes sense, I wonder if I should be doing more stuff using its web browser, or in the apps. It's confusing because there are two almost identical desktops on the iPad. There's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/4496815736/&quot;&gt;array of icons&lt;/a&gt; that is the actual desktop, and there's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/4496816386/&quot;&gt;array of browser windows&lt;/a&gt;. And some apps forget where you were between invocations. But the dual competing desktops is a real head-scratcher." created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 11:08:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Finally, to the question of whether the iPad is a game-changer, consider what &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Sheamus&quot;&gt;Shea Bennett&lt;/a&gt; wrote on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twittercism.com/the-3-point-oh-you/&quot;&gt;Twittercism&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how great a new computer is, as long as you're still you, the experience doesn't change. It's fun to play with new toys, I do lots of that and it's important to me. No sarcasm. But reading a book that changes my perspective, or meeting someone who opens a door for me, that really &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; change the game -- much more than using a new device. If you're looking for game-changers look into yourself, that's where change comes from." created="Tue, 06 Apr 2010 11:03:17 GMT"/>

But I expect at some point someone will make a device that works better and I will stop carrying physical books. Maybe. But I still go to the movies, even though I can watch movies on my netbook.

					<outline text="3. Doesn't Amazon's software run on the iPhone? Doesn't it seem likely that they will port it to the iPad? I don't doubt that Amazon would choose to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; sacrifice their healthy business selling books to protect their healthy business selling hardware, but what about Apple? Given that Apple has &lt;a href=&quot;http://almerica.blogspot.com/2008/09/podcaster-rejeceted-because-it.html&quot;&gt;rejected podcatchers&lt;/a&gt; because they conflict with functionality built into the iPhone -- maybe Apple won't be so open-minded about Amazon porting their software to iPad? Maybe they want to be the exclusive distributor of books for the iPad?" created="Fri, 02 Apr 2010 13:12:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. Amazon is a funny company too -- their EC2 and S3 businesses must generate a lot of money and don't seem to have anything with being a store. So maybe Amazon has a reason to want to be in the Kindle business? With Amazon there's always a bit of mystery as to why they're doing what they do." created="Fri, 02 Apr 2010 13:14:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's just not as simple as some of the analysts seem to think." created="Fri, 02 Apr 2010 13:14:55 GMT"/>
