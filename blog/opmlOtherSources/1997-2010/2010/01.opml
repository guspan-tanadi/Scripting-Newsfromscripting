					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2010/01/30/tt.jpg&quot; width=&quot;116&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named tt.jpg&quot;&gt;One recurring theme in defense of the closedness of the iPad is that it gives you access to the web and that's the most open thing around. Maybe, but if I want the web there are much better and less expensive ways to get it that don't compromise on flexibility and the ability to run other software. In other words, if you want the web and only the web, iPad would be a poor choice. " created="Sat, 30 Jan 2010 19:16:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Yet I am concerned that it will get a flow of great apps from people who are willing to compromise on their freedom and users' freedom. They may say they're not doing it, but I don't see it that way. I wouldn't want to do anything to discourage them from developing cool apps for iPad, as long as they're not pumping their creativity into a platform that can't be competed with because of patents. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/01/29/attnJoeShouldWeTrustIpad.html&quot;&gt;If that's the case&lt;/a&gt;, it's a very unhealthy situation. Not one a developer should support unless they know for sure that other platforms can challenge Apple. I suspect there's a problem because Google is not releasing their multi-touch technology very widely.It could be that it's not ready, I hope that's the reason. But it may also be that Apple has a patent." created="Sat, 30 Jan 2010 19:17:40 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another question that comes up frequently is why worry about limitations in a platform from Apple when we haven't expressed similar concerns re those from Nintendo, Sony, etc. The answer is obvious -- we depend on the Macintosh being one of two or three serious and open development platforms. At some point Steve is going to get up on stage and tell us it's the end of the road for the Mac, because the iPad/iPhone OS has sucked all the energy from the Mac. That's something he and Apple could seriously influence. Sony and Nintendo don't make the Mac, therefore there's nothing to worry about. One way Apple could alleviate these concerns and, at the same time, blast a big hole in the side of Microsoft would be to fully open source Mac OS. At that point, I'd be very happy to keep working on it, and wouldn't give a whit about the iPad, knowing as long as there's demand we'd be supplied with new versions running on the latest hardware, by &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt;, if not Apple.

Current GUI technology is 40-plus years old. Mac and Windows are equally confusing messes. User interfaces can be vastly simplified. I thought Apple would have done much more in this area by now. It's already been three years since the iPhone's introduction. And I don't think Android has the same commitment to a fresh start, it's more of a hodgepodge. And while Google is a patent offender just like Apple, so has no moral advantage, at least there's no barrier to what developers can put on the Android platform, so Google doesn't have the ability to control what goes on Android as Apple does with the iPad. In the worst case, you can route around Google totally because Android is open source." created="Sat, 30 Jan 2010 19:18:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another thought occurred to me -- iPad looks rushed. It seems possible that Apple pushed it out sooner because it got wind of a competitive product. Could it be that Google has a DroidPad in the pipe? One thing's for sure, Apple's competitors are not scared of iPad. Let's hope they make some decent offers to developers. If any of them want my help, I'm here and ready to roll up my sleeves. I want to be sure there are lots of choices, the sooner the better. I can help get developers to pay attention to what you're doing. " created="Sat, 30 Jan 2010 19:21:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The stakes are much higher than with the iPhone. No one should underestimate the potential of iPad. That's why I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/01/28/applesJumboOreo.html#p4&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, ironically, there's no doubt I will buy one as soon as I can. For the same reason I bought an iPhone. You have to understand this product if you want to stay current. But we, as an industry, must have choice. Now is a crucial moment for that." created="Sat, 30 Jan 2010 19:23:27 GMT"/>

					<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2010/01/29/mysterioso.gif&quot; width=&quot;95&quot; height=&quot;236&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named mysterioso.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2010/01/27/bad_gravity&quot;&gt;Brent Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://joehewitt.com/post/ipad/&quot;&gt;Joe Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Jan-29.html&quot;&gt;Miguel de Icaza&lt;/a&gt; all write that they look forward to developing on the iPad. I found their essays surprising, especially Joe's -- given his decision to stop developing for the iPhone because of the review process that Apple imposes on developers. I totally supported him in that, and since his decision (though not because of it) I have switched from the iPhone to Google's Android platform, as a user. " created="Fri, 29 Jan 2010 07:15:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't develop for any of the new platforms because they don't run my software, though Google could. Apple would never approve anything remotely like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://editor.opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML Editor&lt;/a&gt;, and that makes it very unlikely that I'd develop for them, but also for some really important reasons, makes it equally unlikely that I'd use it. I found Joe's piece thought provoking (it provoked this piece). I hope he gives mine similar consideration." created="Fri, 29 Jan 2010 08:14:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, after reading Joe's piece, I understood why developers find the iPad interesting. It's because while they liked creating apps for the iPhone, the tiny screen made some very difficult design choices necessary. While they could see the potential of the multi-touch interface and a fresh start  (they don't have to live with a UI design that's 40 years old), the iPhone screen is so small, that they couldn't nearly deliver on the promise. All the while they're thinking &quot;If only Apple would make one of these things that isn't so small.&quot; And that of course is exactly what the iPad is. I'm sure they can understand that we, as users, weren't having the same thoughts. Until I read Joe's piece I had not heard this idea in any of the flood of discourse on the iPad, pro or con. Since I don't develop for the platform I never had the thought myself. "/>
					<outline text="So, if Brent, Joe and Miguel like it, it stands to reason that they will create software that users will like. So the success of the iPad is assured, in ways perhaps that the Asus isn't. Or perhaps even Android, because it doesn't have multi-touch enabled, just guessing that might have something to do with a patent. Which is a shame, because while Joe has the option to put some or most of the functionality that Apple won't allow on a Facebook-owned server, the user doesn't have any say in this choice. So the user's data will live where Facebook, or some other funded company, wants it to live. "/>
					<outline text="While Joe et al have been thinking about great new user interface, I was too when I was their age, now I'm thinking about something else, that I believe is even more important -- keeping big tech companies from controlling what has become our primary means of expression and communication, computer networks."/>
					<outline text="When I was young, some of us envisioned the world we live in today, only we tended to think only of the upside of networked thinking, never the dangers. I guess that's human nature and the nature of youth. Won't it be great if everyone can access everyone else's ideas anywhere, we thought -- on any kind of device, all inter-connected and fast. Some believed, me included, that computers without networking interfaces were totally uninteresting. Everything I created was designed to communicate. I ached because early Macintoshes had such awful networking APIs. Eventually all that got sorted out when we got HTTP -- it was so simple, the big companies couldn't control what we did with it."/>
					<outline text="But ever since that watershed moment the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/01/17/corporateMediaIsTheProblem.html&quot;&gt;big tech companies&lt;/a&gt; have been trying to get the genie back in the bottle. It's the nature of bigness and corporateness to do that. Facebook didn't exist when I started my work, but now they're here and they're huge, and they view the world the way a big company does. "/>
					<outline text="The problem is this -- if Facebook goes away -- and it could, so does everything everyone created with it. Facebook investors and developers like Joe (who I respect enormously) probably aren't worrying about this, because necessarily everything they do is tied up in the success of Facebook. Now if Joe can show me, in his architecture based on the iPad, where all my work is mirrored in a service I pay for, like Amazon S3, in a simple format I and others can write software against, then I can relax and look forward to the future he, Brent and Miguel want to create. But if my work is tied up in their success, then the price is too high. I'll take the lower fidelity but open playing field of the netbook, and keep my own data on my own hard drives, and back it up as I see fit. And continue to exercise my First Amendment rights."/>
					<outline text="I know that &quot;most users&quot; aren't thinking like this, it's easy to be lulled into a false sense of confidence. But I don't trust these companies, and I especially don't trust Apple or Google with my writing work. I can see a day when what I write has to be approved by someone who works for Steve Jobs before it can be read publicly. That's a day when freedom is completely crushed. "/>
					<outline text="All three of these men know that freedom is important. So what's the answer. You're all willing to give up some of your freedom to play in Apple's new ballpark. How much of our freedom should we be willing to give up, and is this the only way to get it? Is it possible to create an iPad-like platform that has none of the drawbacks of Apple's offerings? If not, why not?"/>
					<outline text="Update: &lt;a href=&quot;http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html&quot;&gt;A must-read piece&lt;/a&gt; by Alex Payne. &quot;If I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid, I'd never be a programmer today.&quot; Well put, even if it's not a sure thing.

What they're really saying is that it's the computer for idiots. I agree. Idiots with $500 burning a hole in their pocket. Like me. I'll almost certainly buy one.

					<outline text="Now I was wrong about the iPhone, I bought one and used it for two years, saying goodbye to my Blackberry. But I ended up saying goodbye to the iPhone for the reasons I thought I would at its roll out. It should have been a Mac. Same with the iPad. They should have come out with a netbook-style product, price and feature-comparable to the Asus products but running the Mac OS and Mac apps. Because huff and puff all you want, this baby is going to have to look good compared to the netbooks, and now it looks like testimony to hubris.

I bought a 13 inch MacBook Pro, but it's a battery hog running the same apps as my Asus, and unreliable. It stays home when I travel. I will probably move it to NY to be my main computer here. The iPhone also stayed home. My workhorse is the Droid, and I carry the Nexus One as the admiration platform. It has the SIM that used to be in the iPhone. Fred Wilson and I agreed (we had breakfast yesterday) that it's like carrying a girlfriend in your pocket. What could be better. This is an important point. Finally Google is presenting them with a serious competitor in the lust category. No, they aren't all the way there yet, but they don't have the prison mentality for users and developers.

About the only thing I got right was #9. Steve still loves to delete ports. It would have been sort of cute if he had delivered on some of the potential in this category.

How new users find followers now is again a mystery -- but none of my business. I totally don't care about that. That really is between Twitter and the new users. But the damage is done.

					<outline text="When I saw that UserLand was shutting down radio.weblogs.com at the end of the 2009, I sent a private email to the company and asked if they would mind if I found a place to archive it permanently, and they said it was okay.

					<outline text="But then late last year userland.com went off the air. Like a lot of other people, I was pretty concerned that a big chunk of history had gone.

					<outline text="1. Sometime before the end of this week, we'll switch over the DNS for radio.weblogs.com to the copy of the archive that's already stored on Automattic's servers. However we will permanently redirect to a new domain, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio-weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;radio-weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;, so we don't depend on VeriSign to keep pointing to the site. At some point that seems likely to break. They've been very good at preserving the link, but we don't want to be dependent on them indefinitely. So, if you created a Radio weblog, as I did, it will now be stored, for the forseeable future, on Automattic's server. For example, here's my old Radio site in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio-weblogs.com/0001015/&quot;&gt;new location&lt;/a&gt;. Since the URLs will be redirected, search engines will pick up the change and re-index the sites in their new location. " created="Wed, 20 Jan 2010 15:11:46 GMT"/>

					<outline text="2. Jake and I and anyone else who wants to help will statically render the sites at userland.com that document the functionality and history of Frontier, Radio, Manila and related projects. In that archive, which goes back to the early-mid 90s, is a fair amount of the history of the early blogging world. We will make this content available for free download. I will host a version of the content on my servers. Anyone else will be free to do so. " created="Wed, 20 Jan 2010 15:14:01 GMT"/>

It was one of the hardest classes I took, and I got a good grade, at least for me (I was far from one of the best students in my class). The moment of truth was during an exam when I had to prove a theorem and I had no idea how to do it. So I just started out with something I thought was true, that seemed to be on the path, and proved that. Then I proved another thing, and another, and finally I could see how the pieces fit together and was able to prove the theorem.

I wouldn't even know how to describe it to a younger person, it's as if we were different species in some ways. But you'll never get me to say there aren't big differences betw being 54 and 22, even 54 and 44. But I think I could have a more interesting conversation about it with someone who is 44. Because one of the things that happens as you get older is that you learn to listen better.

Computer science felt like the greatest place to be because there were no older people entrenched with gates erected to keep out bright ambitious young people. That's one reason I gravitated there. I felt equally excited about media, as a grad student, but I didn't go in that direction because intuitively I felt that I'd spend my career climbing a ladder, and as I approached the top, the ladder would be disintegrating. A better way to matter in media, I felt, was through computer science. That intuition proved correct.

There's no easy way to find out which neighborhoods have it. And Time-Warner seems to install high bandwidth cable in areas where FIOS is available.

					<outline text="Last year (the one that just ended) it seemed that OAuth had finally gotten to a point where it was frozen. It was deploying in Twitter, and they were making sounds as if they would at sometime not too far down the road turn off the username-password way of authenticating users. So I rolled up my sleeves and implemented OAuth in the OPML Editor so my apps could use it. Turns out I was mistaken in believing that it was frozen, because, due to a security issue, they had to change OAuth, and I haven't revisited my code yet to adopt the change, so it doesn't work with the Twitter implementation of OAuth, which honestly, is the only one I care about.

Turns out the creators of OAuth have changed their mind and think it should be stripped to the metal and rebuilt around HTTPS. So not only do I have to throw out all the work I've done, but so does Twitter, and even &lt;s&gt;better&lt;/s&gt; worse, my environment doesn't have glue for HTTPS so I'll have to get that together. When will all &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/oauth-wrap-wg&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; happen? Heh. That's the rub. My guess is that, based on past experience with the tech biz, it'll never happen. The people pushing this stuff are young, they haven't been around the loop before. Doesn't matter. Big companies are like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija&quot;&gt;Ouija&lt;/a&gt; boards. The people don't control them, the psychology does.
