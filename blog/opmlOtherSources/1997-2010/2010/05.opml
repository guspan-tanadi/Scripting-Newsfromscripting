Apple is building the Disney computer network. All the streets are clean, and the entertainment too. There's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/may/25/ipad-porn-free-steve-jobs&quot;&gt;no porn&lt;/a&gt; here, and as long as there are no ports it'll stay that way. But computers are meant to be more than DisneyLand, they are meant to solve societal problems and help our species evolve. That means we must have freedom. And freedom and control are exact opposites. So I'd rather have wire-cluttered desktops and TV stations, than have Apple decide what I can and can't watch." created="Fri, 28 May 2010 16:17:46 GMT"/>

Publishers can not depend on Twitter to be a steady platform that will be fair to them.

And there's the cast of people who work at the funeral home, and their families, friends and lovers. There's even a couple of ghosts!

					<outline text="He's working on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://telehash.org/&quot;&gt;new protocol&lt;/a&gt;. There are a bunch of new ideas under the covers that I find interesting and puzzling, but the net-effect is to provide the decentralized message transport we all want from desktop-to-desktop without going through a corporate-owned cloud, so we can avoid being monetized as crowd-sourced user-generated content with eyeballs. This is the DIY cloud, and it's about fucking time. Imho.  &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 19 May 2010 11:18:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Like a small number of brilliant technologists, Miller has a story to tell -- and at first it was a strange story but then it became familiar. Jeremie is running away from XML because he had such a bad experience with the ever-escalating complexity being promoted by people who are less interested in applications and more interested in theory. To the theorists, XML is an infinitely expressive language, and the processors are magic engines that extract meaning from a messy maze of incomprehensible gobbledy gook. To the pragmatists, XML is a file format, a way of providing compatibility between applications written in a diverse set of applications and environments. XML provides a way of giving everyone choice without sacrificing the ability to talk to each other and be heard. Corporations looking to lock-in users favor the former approach because they can claim to be complying with &quot;standards&quot; and at the same time be impenetrable to competitors.

Hence RSS became and is a juggernaut, with huge flows of content, not controlled by the big corporations. Not that they haven't been trying. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 19 May 2010 11:24:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="XMPP is a different story. The schema guys won that battle, and apparently XMPP is very complex as a result, and there aren't a huge number of implementations.

" created="Wed, 19 May 2010 11:26:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is why I find the arguments of the JSON-only proponents either lazy or dishonest. I don't know which it is. They say that XML is too complicated, but that's wrong. Just ignore everything but elements, attributes and namespaces. That's what RSS does, and it's very simple. If you're designing protocols that are meant to be widely adopted, this is a trust issue. The central node in a centralized system, such as the one being proposed by Facebook, can easily afford to parse many dialects, without incurring much cost. We do it in our aggregators, small developers like Newsgator and Ranchero, I do it in River2 and I'm just a person. Surely the Great Facebook can do what we small fry do? So what is their angle? What are they complaining about? I don't trust would-be platform vendors who won't accomodate all possible developers, esp those who use a language that's so deeply installed as XML is." created="Wed, 19 May 2010 11:27:02 GMT"/>

It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/02/17/oauthIsWorkingHere.html&quot;&gt;hard work&lt;/a&gt;, but I got there, with help from one of the designers, Joseph Smarr. This version of OAuth, 1.0, worked something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.spec.html&quot;&gt;Flickr's&lt;/a&gt; authentication system, which I had implemented a few years earlier. Wasn't sure what was gained with the new complexity, but Twitter had said pretty clearly they were moving to OAuth, and I was actively developing on Twitter, so I figured I'd better support it." created="Sat, 08 May 2010 17:40:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Since then there's a new OAuth that is incompatible with the one I implemented.

Instead of giving an app your password, you give it your &lt;a href=&quot;https://friendfeed.com/account/api&quot;&gt;remote key&lt;/a&gt; -- a random string they generate for you. So now you've authorized apps to access your account without giving them your password. No protocol change, we're still using Basic Authentication. The user's life gets a little more difficult, but so little it's hardly worth mentioning. They just have to understand this idea of a remote key. And it stays truly simple for developers." created="Sat, 08 May 2010 17:45:06 GMT"/>

They're credit cards that are good only at a single merchant. If you don't like what that merchant is doing you can just terminate the virtual account and they stop misbehaving right away, leaving all your other online accounts alone. All the virtual accounts funnel into the same account you've always used, but you can do business without giving away that account number. Now when someone steals your identity, they've got nothing.

					<outline text="When I started my second company, in 1988, also in Silicon Valley -- the industry was approaching a level of maturity that, in tech, warns of a looming implosion. I was too young and inexperienced to know this, but the signs were everywhere. A few years before if you had a good idea, you could ship a product, promote it, build a user base, and find liquidity. Now the dominant companies had grown so big they were starting to choke the ecosystem. And the entrepreneurs who were showing up were less the bright-eyed engineers with big ideas, and more of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger&quot;&gt;carpetbagging&lt;/a&gt; MBAs with pyramid schemes.

When we need financing, we can turn to local sources, or we can get on that plane and teach the investors of the west coast how to come to JFK, which they all want to do anyway.

I've been blessed by a few &quot;liquidity events&quot; in my life, enabling me to work on what I want to work on.

					<outline text="2. Is it possible for someone to make a lot of money and also do things that are bad for the environment? Things that deserve criticism? Should we give everyone who makes a lot of money a free pass -- making them immune from discourse? The idea is silly on its face. In fact some business models, ways of making money, are based on cashing in public value in the ecosystem. Did Exxon fully pay for the ecological disaster of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill&quot;&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/a&gt;? Did they earn a lot of money since then? Did they pay for the cost of the war in Iraq which has kept oil prices higher than they probably would be otherwise? Is this good? (Imho, no, it is not.) Should we criticize &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP&quot;&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; even though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ABP&quot;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt; surely made more money last year than 99.9999999 percent of us? I'm sure Scott didn't mean to say that, after all -- I think he believes in the power of journalism. &lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2010/05/04/disneyPad.gif&quot; width=&quot;145&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named disneyPad.gif&quot;&gt;Most journalists make less money than the titans they cover (at least I &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; so). Money ain't everything Scott, and it sure does not equate to wisdom. " created="Tue, 04 May 2010 10:28:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. I feel Apple is screwing us in some ways and blessing us in others. I bought Apple stock and have held it through the bad times and now am profiting in the good times. Yet I think it's good news that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/goverment-weighing-possible-apple-antitrust-probe/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;FTC&lt;/a&gt; is reigning in their power re the developers. Not only good because it is morally a good thing, but &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; good for shareholders. I buy all their products, although sometimes I protest. I feel like I'm using the Disney version of a computer with the iPad, and I prefer punk rock (although I like Disney movies too). I'm a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;http://tv.gawker.com/5526868/jon-stewart-slams-apple-over-its-handling-of-gizmodo-case&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart,&lt;/a&gt; not quite a fan boy because I think I see when they are wrong, but certainly a fan.

					<outline text="The conclusions:" created="Mon, 03 May 2010 20:57:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. The Twitter API had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/12/17/howOpenStandardsAreCreated.html&quot;&gt;chance&lt;/a&gt; of becoming a defacto standard, but it didn't happen, for a variety of reasons." created="Mon, 03 May 2010 20:57:49 GMT"/>

					<outline text="3. It sounds more and more like Matt sees Twitter as competition. Or maybe this is wishful thinking on my part." created="Mon, 03 May 2010 20:59:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="As a founder of this market, and someone who has the ear of most of the participants, I'd like to make a recommendation." created="Mon, 03 May 2010 20:59:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. You have to support twitter.com, and this means working with whatever changes they make to the Twitter API. At this point they have the most users and the most influential users. Not supporting twitter.com, for most of the client developers, seems like it's not an option." created="Mon, 03 May 2010 21:01:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. You should also support an open protocol, and by open I mean replaceable and simple. I explained that in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/05/02/replaceable.html&quot;&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; in response to Chris Saad's piece. There really only one way to go here, and that's a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; thing -- RSS 2.0 as the format, and its &amp;lt;cloud&gt; element to add the realtime component. It's decentralized, doesn't depend on any of the BigTechCo's, and isn't owned by anyone. It also isn't controlled by the W3C or IETF, which means it cannot be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=define+corralled&quot;&gt;corralled&lt;/a&gt; by the BigTechCo's. It's easy to support, doesn't require a massive R&amp;D budget and is not a moving target, and &lt;i&gt;cannot become&lt;/i&gt; a moving target. " created="Mon, 03 May 2010 21:02:48 GMT"/>
