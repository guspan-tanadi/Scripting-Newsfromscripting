" created="Mon, 31 Mar 2008 19:47:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now of course, I understand that there are Clinton supporters in the tech industry, and there are even Republicans who like Bush, and to them my enthusiastic support sometimes goes a little too far. I understand, totally. If for example, I were following a Bush supporter, like Tony Perkins, on Twitter, I would have unfollowed him long ago. I don't need that level of annoyance. He and I are never going to agree on politics, not even how to discuss politics, so I would just tune him out. Knowing Tony, I don't think he'd hold it against me, as I wouldn't hold it against any Republican tech person who unfollowed me. " created="Mon, 31 Mar 2008 19:32:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What I can't support are personal attacks and name-calling just because we disagree. General attacks are okay with me. In other words if you think all Obama supporters are idiots, go ahead and say it (I'll probably unfollow, but BFD). But if you say I'm a jerk just because I support someone you don't, then I have a problem with that (esp if you don't make it clear that's why you're saying it). You're getting confused between personal issues and political ones, and I think you're going to even lose the support of people who agree with you politically, and imho you should.

That's been the problem in the last few elections, we forgot, after the election was over, to find the common ground that we agree on. And as a result the Constitution is in trouble, and our economy is a mess (even Bush agrees), and our reputation overseas isn't good and it's getting worse. I think this is because we forgot to bind our wounds after the election, and our elected leadership didn't lead. " created="Mon, 31 Mar 2008 19:36:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So this is what I learned. I think some people hide their political differences behind personal attacks. This is what none of us should support. We should be able to have a discussion and keep our self-respect and dignity. That US politics gets masked as tech industry politics is very confusing and should not be tolerated." created="Mon, 31 Mar 2008 19:38:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="BTW, as a constructive step toward fixing this problem, I think all tech industry bloggers should let us know their politics.

The key is that the superdelegates don't have to sit by and do nothing.

Then HRC is free to bring whatever fight she wants to the convention, it won't matter, because Obama will have the nomination, and will (correct me if I'm wrong) also control the Credentials process, so she'll have to do what he wants in the end wrt Michigan and Florida. (A more than fair resolution of Michigan and Florida, already offered, would be to split the delegates 50-50.

It's almost always liberals, even though he doesn't use the word (possibly because it would seem so insane). It seems if we're not taxing and spending we're running away with our tails between our legs, on behalf of Bush and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/03/29/cabinet.jpg&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; of super-heroes." created="Sat, 29 Mar 2008 16:22:27 GMT"/>

					<outline text="&quot;Maybe you think it's unfair that this anger sometimes gets generalized to include you, when you yourself have never detained a black driver or used a choke hold to subdue someone you were arresting.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I think it's pretty obvious when you do the flip, the statement, even though if you parse it literally, is not demeaning to whites, an equivalent statement made about blacks, using black stereotypes, would certainly be considered offensive. "/>

					<outline text="I don't split hairs about what is racism or isn't. This is a period of amnesty, no one knows how to talk about this stuff. Yesterday candidate Obama, who I admire more every day, said his grandmother is a &quot;typical white person.&quot; There were attempts to use this for political advantage, but I think by the end of this campaign we'll laugh at how awkward this period was and how common this kind of thing is. So what. Are there typical white people? Maybe, maybe not. But in the end, what's the big deal. " created="Fri, 21 Mar 2008 13:07:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The only way to make progress is to go through it. I know that black people say really racist things about white people, and no one called them on it because white people couldn't hear. Same thing's true the other way. The difference is now we can hear. Great. You wanted change, right? This is what change is like. It ain't easy and not always pretty, but when you're stuck in a rut, it's the only way to go." created="Fri, 21 Mar 2008 13:13:03 GMT"/>

				<outline text="What's wrong with Wikipedia" created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:07:47 GMT">
					<outline text="First, I point to Wikipedia pages often here on Scripting News and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner/statuses/774441690&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I also find it a useful personal resource. For example, I'm working my way through Battlestar Galactica and I find it helpful to read the summary of each episode after I've watched it. It's great that they have a common format. And they fill in blanks you might not have noticed but don't spoil the plot of upcoming episodes. I've been investing in ETFs lately, and Wikipedia has helped me learn how they work. So I don't question its value. It has value." created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:07:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Wikipedia is therefore a puzzle to me. Because while it's helpful, it also hurts me, because my biography there is more of a vendetta, by anonymous people, who seem self-centered and immature, but it's impossible to tell what axes they have to grind, because they're largely anonymous. " created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:09:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Same is true for various activities I've participated in. You may argue that I didn't invent this or that, but surely I had &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; to do with RSS, blogging and podcasting? Yet depending on when you look, I'm often not mentioned on these pages. This makes it hard for me to claim my work in professional dealings because people consider Wikipedia authoritative. What it says is considered by many to be the truth. So this has hurt my career, and my ability to do creative work that builds on past work." created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:10:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is where &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew Keen&lt;/a&gt; could have and should have, imho, written his book. This is where the Cult of the Amateur really &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; do damage, by usurping authority, and replacing it with anonymity and giving power to those who who tear down creativity, to remove the incentive to share, unless you're completely selfless and don't mind if others take credit for your accomplishments. That's not the nature of creativity, btw, creative people fiercely insist on credit, fight for it, imho, rightly. " created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:12:44 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Eventually, if it hasn't already happened, there will be consultants you can pay to make sure your point of view dominates a Wikipedia page. It has already come out that a gift to the Wikipedia Foundation will assure that your point of view dominates your profile page. How much of this can Wikipedia stand before it is reformed? It seems time to have this discussion, and not in the confines of Wikipedia where it can be controlled and gamed by insiders, but outside where everyone's opinion can be heard without being edited out and when it's clear who's saying what.

					<outline text="That said, here's how I think Wikipedia should evolve to fix this problem." created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:28:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution&quot;&gt;principle&lt;/a&gt; that one has the right to confront his accusers, Wikipedia pages on living people, or covering active creative areas, should be limited to pages of pointers of attributed accounts. Editors work to validate that the people are who they say they are. If they can't be validated, they either don't get linked, or get linked to from an area specially marked as not being validated. (I prefer the former.)" created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:15:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, in areas important enough to be controversial, meaning that people disagree on what happened, we should try to get as many people who were involved in the event or activity to write first-person narratives. In areas where they all agree, that should eventually be considered fact and presented as such, but the first-person narratives must stay linked. This would prevent the kinds of disasters that happen when people (for example) edit their own profile pages, meanwhile giving people the formal right to tell their own story, which clearly, many people covered by Wikipedia want." created="Thu, 20 Mar 2008 15:17:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I hope an interesting discussion ensues. Of course I expect to hear from the people who edit my profile pages to keep my name in the dirt, and I don't expect them to use their actual names. Can't speak for everyone else, but I'm much more interested, always, in hearing opinions from people who have the conviction and courage to put their personal authority behind their words, as I do.

Okay there's a lot of unprocessed anger over race in the US, and a lot of it will come out in the next few months, but what if Obama is elected? This is where my head starts spinning. I tried to raise the question in yesterday's podcast -- will blacks look at the world differently now that a black man is President? I think he said no. I can't believe that. Something will have to give. But haven't they thought about that at all? (I'm very sure something will shift because, being around Silicon Valley for so long, I've seen lots of people achieve wealth very quickly. This usually causes an eruption of huge emotion as the normal feeling of worthlessness is contradicted by the new worth in the person's bank account. People often get very depressed when this happens.)" created="Mon, 17 Mar 2008 17:19:40 GMT"/>

I couldn't believe I was thinking about this, but the Jeremiah Wright speeches that came out last week put it front and center. There was a time that I remember when blacks talked about taking power in the US in ways designed at least in part to scare white people. Obama is the perfect black candidate for &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; raising the fears of whites, unlike Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. I'm still supporting him, but now I have new questions, that I probably would eventually have had even if Wright's speeches hadn't become an issue. " created="Mon, 17 Mar 2008 17:21:29 GMT"/>

I immediately put together a web application that scanned these &quot;feeds&quot; periodically, and put the new stories at the top of the page, pushing down the older ones. Then, to do my hourly news trawl, I'd just have to start at the top of the page, and read down until I came to something I had seen before.

The founders of our country believed in the power of the people and set up a system that would be hard for a king to rule. Yet our political system today very much resembles a monarchy and the political spectacles are fights to the death that simply don't matter, they just determine which family is stealing from us." created="Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:29:54 GMT"/>

					<outline text="I was seriously considering voting for Clinton in the Calif primary, but when they turned to race in South Carolina, that's when I remembered how miserable they were when he was President. That the Clintons will do anything to win was brought home when she said last week that she and McCain had crossed the &quot;threshhold&quot; and had the experience to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-Chief&quot;&gt;CINC&lt;/a&gt;, but Obama did not. From that moment on I thought of Clinton in the same way I think of Joe Lieberman, a pathetic little faux Democrat who would change parties if they had an ounce of honor or integrity. The idea of campaigning for the Republic candidate while running for the Democratic nomination -- there are few things more despicable." created="Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:41:31 GMT"/>

His first speeches were inspiring. But then as he took the lead in primaries, there were no more new ideas, not even new stories. I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://btre.blogtalkradio.com/74_91633.mp3&quot;&gt;recite&lt;/a&gt; them all by heart. This is a problem, because we're all wondering if he'll really be different when he becomes President. When he thought he had the nomination locked he started cruising, one wonders if his ambition stops at being President. Will he really put us all to work, pitching in to make American better, and a force for good in the world, living up to our hype? We tell everyone else that we're the leaders of the free world, but what kind of freedom do we offer? And what about long-term investment in the US? There are people on the Gulf Coast who feel like finding a new country, they're so forgotten by this one. How are we going to compete with growing economies on other continents. What about our education and health care systems. Getting elected is only the first step. It's like an entrepreneur getting funded. It's what you do after getting power that matters. I'd say based on what we've seen so far, there are at least some questions about whether Obama really means what he says. But he still has my endorsement. He's the only candidate this year that I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to vote for. Hell, he's the only candidate I've wanted to vote for since 1972, and I was too young to vote then." created="Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:44:04 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Mike, I don't like Valleywag, but I think you're wrong in this case. They got a good story because Wikipedia, the publication that Wales runs, has rules that prevent people from editing stories they have an interest in. Wales was trading edits to Rachel Marsden's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Marsden&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; for sex. They got him, and had they left out the parts you don't like, it wouldn't have been clear that they did."/>
					<outline text="This is not only a good story, but it's an important one. Wikipedia, unlike Valleywag, is widely thought to be authoritative. Those of us it covers who are not friends with Wales know that it is far from authoritative. Both Valleywag and Wikipedia are pretty sleazy, imho, but Valleywag disclaims it, and Wikipedia pretends not to be." created="Mon, 03 Mar 2008 12:41:58 GMT"/>
