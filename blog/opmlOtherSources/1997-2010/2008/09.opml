					<outline text="If you want to get an idea how terribly wrong things can go, look at New Orleans after Katrina. We didn't want to look there. I made myself look, I went to New Orleans in December 2005, and saw a city largely in ruin. I saw sections of the city that had burned where no one came to put the fire out. I visited middle class neighborhoods I lived in as a college student that had been reduced to ruin. I wanted to get a first-hand look at post-Apocalypse America. That is the accurate way to view it, it is not overly dramatic." created="Wed, 01 Oct 2008 05:47:42 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Fact is the people who run this place aren't qualified to run it. No one is. You can see that the legislators have basically no idea how the economy works, yet they make decisions that determine where trillions of dollars flow.

How was that covered up? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/business/economy/01leonhardt.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;As the Times said&lt;/a&gt;, it gets really bad when trust is gone.

It took a lot of time and belief to build up the momentum that drives our civilization. Once the wheels stop turning it takes just as long to get them going again, maybe longer because you have to deal with the wreckage that spewn all over the landscape.

I was listening to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://a.media.abcnews.com/podcasts/080919_ntl.mp3&quot;&gt;Nightline&lt;/a&gt; from last week, they were interviewing &lt;a href=&quot;http://collins.senate.gov/public/continue.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home&amp;IsTextOnly=false&amp;IsSkipSplash=true&quot;&gt;Susan Collins&lt;/a&gt;, one of two Republican senators from Maine (both are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_Snowe&quot;&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, btw). She was talking about off-shore drilling and explaining why, even though there might be oil off the shore of Maine, they wouldn't support drilling because fishing off the coast is a huge part of their economy. Then they got around to Sarah Palin and she said Palin was a great choice, and how she had energized the Republican Party. I found this shocking.

Making those loans was a profitable business, and a lot of people wanted some of the action. At one point I even wondered how I could, but I never (thankfully) figured it out. As long as real estate kept going up, everyone kept making money. There was even a way to rationalize it. The United States is where everyone in the world wanted to live. So property would keep increasing in value as long as there was growth somewhere in the world.

Can't say I support it but I understand it.

They may be Democrats, but they are not &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; Democrats. If the Repubs are running against the press, then why do the press care what the Repubs think (the mistake Obama makes too).

I wondered too what it meant, when I read this piece I couldn't believe how sloppy the Republicans were. This is exactly what McCain says people should do, and we all agree that giving to your country is a very American value. They should retract and apologize, and Republicans who applauded this should be ashamed. It's hugely hypocritical.

I've been impressed with how thoughtful and competent Obama is. That's why he's got my support. I also think our country is up shit's creek unless we can upgrade our economy, and to do so we need health and education, and that means public spending. It's not as if the Republicans don't believe in public spending, they do -- they just waste the money on destroying communities overseas. I want us to borrow to build strength here at home.

To me that says we need higher gas prices. Yes, we should help people cope with the economic hardship that causes, but we should build more of those high speed links. We need to reconfigure our geography in the US, we're totally set up for a cheap gasoline economy. If you can do that without government spending, let's go, but we've got to do it.

They're saying, in unison, &quot;We know how to do this&quot; -- finally they have a real role in the electoral process, not just to be bullshitted by everyone, so get out of our way while we do our jobs. I'd like to think this is the primary drive. But there's also this... 2. They are American citizens too, and they're horrified by the way McCain made this decision, and want to send a message to him and all other politicians in the future -- if you screw up like this, we're going to push you until you admit it.

Get this -- &lt;i&gt;He's turning Obama into the safe, conservative choice.&lt;/i&gt; Key point. Obama was going to have a hard time making that case, but McCain just made it for him.
