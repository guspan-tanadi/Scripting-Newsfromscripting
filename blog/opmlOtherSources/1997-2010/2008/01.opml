					<outline text="I should say The Old South. The problem for the Clintons is that the country has changed, as recently as the generation that's now in its early 20s. Because of my experience at Harvard, I know quite a few of them, and I promise you, race doesn't mean to them what it meant when I was their age. To them, this country is a melting pot where we've not only accepted blacks and Hispanics, but people from incredibly far away with incredible complexions, hair, clothes, traditions and names. Amazingly, it's still America. " created="Mon, 28 Jan 2008 02:34:37 GMT"/>

Would she argue the issues with him in a respectful way? Why bother when you can smear him into silence. Now she spins around like her husband oblivious to what the rest of us suspected, and now knows for sure. If there isn't now a landslide of support for Obama, from all segments of the Democratic Party and from many Republicans, then our country truly is without hope.

Maybe they're right. Maybe this is the last (futile) gasp of hope in America for America. Okay, maybe so. But I'm willing to give it one more try. I think it would say to the rest of the world that America has caught up with reality. Look at how we've changed. Maybe they'll put pictures of Obama in their public buildings as they did with JFK.

					<outline text="Hope, that's the difference, and it's not just a word. We've all been disempowered during the Clinton and Bush years, sidelined. I remember when I gave up on Clinton, it was during the brightest period of hope for the web, when they passed a compromise that said that the First Amendment didn't apply here.  There are some things that are so important that you can't compromise on them. It was then that I knew that Clinton (and Gore) were phonies. Maybe Obama isn't. I never thought I'd get another chance to use my vote to say, along with so many other Americans, that we still believe the bullshit they taught us in school and that our grandparents taught us, and that the flag says to us every time we think of what it means.

Seems BillC could use a dose of his own advice. Amazing that the Democrats can't find a shared vision. I always thought Clinton was a phony, I gave him the benefit of the doubt in Davos in 2000.

The next step after that will be packaged applications that deploy through Amazon that you can buy for shrinkwrap prices. Yesterday I downloaded a Jabber server from Jive Software. Nice, but it would be so much nicer if, instead of installing as an app that runs on one of my machines, it deployed to run on one of Amazon's. If would take care of backing itself up, controllable through a web interface of course, to S3. Give me a small, simple desktop app that burns a DVD of my data, so I can have something local to put in the safe deposit box, guarding against the possibility that Amazon goes away or S3 loses data. This is so rational, we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be going in this direction. When we do, it'll mean that the magic of the backroom scaling expert will become a commodity you can buy cheap.

Apple's vision of how the Internet connects to the living room is a very controlling one. They attain a certain ease of use, true -- but the trade-off is too great. I like all the special effects, but I like to be in control of my own experience. I want to be the programmer. And I despise DRM as much as my customers hated copy protected software in the 80s.

Some people subscribe to 100 people, others 5000, I've even seen people who follow 0 people. No one subscribes to exactly the same people you do. And just because you listen to someone doesn't mean they listen to you, and vice versa. There's a tremendous variety of different experiences. Yet each of us feels as if we're in a chatroom. That's the paradox of Twitter. It kind of feels like IRC while it is nothing like IRC." created="Fri, 18 Jan 2008 16:33:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What Twitter is most like, imho, is an RSS aggregator. The people who work on Twitter call it a micro-blogging system, because to them, that's what it's like, even if the users don't see it that way. I understand what they're saying, as I think through the possible ways to decentralize it, invariably I'm led down paths I've already walked in implementing blogging software and RSS software. " created="Fri, 18 Jan 2008 16:35:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But IRC is very symmetric -- if I listen to you, then you listen to me. And vice versa. There are ways to block someone in IRC, but it's an opt-out, where in Twitter listening to someone is by default off, and you have to opt-in. Very different experience. In IRC it would be considered a drastic measure to block someone. In Twitter, there's nothing offensive about not subscribing to someone. " created="Fri, 18 Jan 2008 16:37:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, you rarely see trolls or flaming in Twitter, because it doesn't work, just as it doesn't work in blogging.

It's worth thinking about -- with the stock market down this year, every day &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/01/17/morebadnews.gif&quot;&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; than the last, many of us are losing lots of money, I know I am, and it's not a good feeling.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)&quot;&gt;crash of 1987&lt;/a&gt; was much worse than this downturn, and then I had no cushion, nothing to fall back on, I wasn't even employed when it happened. I was a lot closer to being broke around the turn of the century, even though the market was doing very well. But it doesn't help. No matter how many times I've been through it, I've always known that it's cyclic, that the outlook will likely improve, but knowing isn't the same as feeling. The feeling is much stronger, it can't be counteracted with logic. I can't reason with the feeling, you might say it's un-reasonable." created="Thu, 17 Jan 2008 19:31:40 GMT"/>

People wonder why this is and how they can get more." created="Thu, 17 Jan 2008 16:11:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reason for this is that Flickr keeps the 20 most recent pictures in the feed for each account. So when I post a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2199729025/&quot;&gt;new picture&lt;/a&gt; to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/&quot;&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt;, it replaces the oldest picture in &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=22221172@N00&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt;. Then, anyone who has subscribed my feed, will get the new picture next time they scan. It works the same way RSS works for blogging or a newspaper -- you only get the last few posts or stories, not all of them, in the feed." created="Thu, 17 Jan 2008 16:12:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think this is the right way to do it. You might feel that 20 is too small, but people would probably also want more if they just got 100 pictures. " created="Thu, 17 Jan 2008 16:13:53 GMT"/>

We would also need a place to store our RSS (easy and cheap), and a discovery mechanism, but none of this is impossible or even very hard, considering that Twitter already exists. If it didn't, discovery would be a mess. Because it does, discovery would just be inconvenient, and would require foresight -- the kind of foresight that tells you to keep a bunch of bottled water in the garage so you won't die when there's a big earthquake.

The way wars start is with spit and vinegar, vim and vigor, talk of pride and honor, but they quickly devolve to misery, futility, death, devastation. My generation learned that early-on, with Vietnam. I don't remember anyone thinking we should be there. I missed being drafted by luck.

He says we should fix our own house, it's falling apart, instead of trying to control others (which doesn't work). How would we feel if our country were occupied by foreign troops? Would we do everything we can to expel them? (Of course.) Why should we expect any other country to be different? I've been saying the same thing since our invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Perhaps that's what was going on from the candidates' point of view, but it was not what was going on from &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; side of the tube.

The honor and prestige of our country (the equivalent of goodwill for companies, settle the wars we started, accept that we have to protect against terrorism, stop hyping it in terms of conventional warfare, that's insulting). 2.

					<outline text="I think it's this -- there are a lot of Democrats and independents and even quite a few Republicans who feel that the Bush II presidency has been a disaster because of the war we started, the incompetent response to Katrina, the trampling of the Constitution, the cynicism, secrecy and arrogance of the government.

I do remember &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; times, and had they spoken out they would have been crucified, but when you're running for President that doesn't excuse you. While many of us didn't stand up and object either, we now have to choose someone to lead us, and we're not going with someone who compromised when it came to our national honor (the war), our homes (Katrina), and the integrity of our political system (the Constitution).

					<outline text="In a normal year, the Edwards plea to fight special interests would be welcome and enough, even radical, but in 2008 it is not radical enough. True, the war was started because both parties are owned by the defense industry, Edwards claims he doesn't receive their money, implying that Clinton does (and Obama?). The hypocrisy of &lt;i&gt;Support the Troops&lt;/i&gt; really translates into &lt;i&gt;Pay off the Defense Contractors.&lt;/i&gt; We must place part of the blame for the Iraq debacle on the defense contractors, who fund all our politicians, of both parties." created="Tue, 08 Jan 2008 19:10:22 GMT"/>

It's hard to imagine McCain using the tactics of the Swift Boaters, but hard to imagine the others &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; using them. Huckabee? Interestingly he says the Republicans shouldn't be so quick to attack Obama, because he represents something good about the people. That is a refreshing idea -- a political leader focusing on the wants of the people.

Here's the story so far. Plaxo, on behalf of Scoble, ran a screen scraper on his Facebook account to download information about at least some of his Facebook friends. Facebook detected the scraper and turned off his account, with an email explaining that he had violated their terms of service." created="Thu, 03 Jan 2008 19:34:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The debate: Who is right -- Scoble or Facebook?" created="Thu, 03 Jan 2008 19:36:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="While there are certainly arguments that Facebook has some rightness, most of it, imho, is with Scoble. Sure, some of the data may &quot;belong&quot; to his friends, like their birthday and mail address. Technically of course the data doesn't belong to anyone, it's data &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; them, and many organizations have this data. Are bloggers really saying that organizations have more rights than people? Isn't blogging all about a level playing field? My bank knows my birthday and my email address. Why shouldn't Scoble? (Maybe he shouldn't.)" created="Thu, 03 Jan 2008 19:36:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Scoble called a few minutes ago. I asked what the consensus was. He said it was about 70 percent in his favor, 30 percent in Facebook's. I think we can win over the 30 percent by saying that there should be a system whereby people can decide how much information they want to share with Scoble, or people like Scoble, or me, or people like me, or BofA or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/index.htm&quot;&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB&quot;&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; or CIA. Further, that system is not Facebook, unless they change. " created="Thu, 03 Jan 2008 19:38:12 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, I think there's a pretty good chance that Facebook &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; change and give Scoble his data and turn his account back on. I think Facebook wants to give us access to our data, but if they just turned the feature on, there would be a shitstorm, kind of like the one that's raging right now. Except this time Facebook has defenders, which they must find refreshing, because every time there's been a shitstorm around Facebook they've always been seen as 100 percent evil by most people.

Google could have done it, but they didn't. Same with Yahoo or Microsoft. These companies don't want to empower the users, but if they studied history, they'd see that the evolution of computers always comes in fits and starts. A period when the technology is new and people are snowed by the companies and let them have full control. Gradually people understand what's going on, and figure out they're being screwed but they accept it. And then explosively the whole thing disintegrates in a new layer of technology.

I was a &quot;genius&quot; for a year and can assure you that the policy regarding HDs was frustrating to us as well. In warranty it wasn't so hard to justify, but out of warranty customers often had a problem with it. My recommendation to them (and to you) is the same. AASPs often do not have the same contractual obligations with HD manufacturers that Apple does, so they may very well let you keep it. If you still wanted to have it done through an Apple store, take a magnet to it before you hand it over. The techs have better things to do than trawl through your personal data (there are exceptions, of course), but if it sets your mind at ease- go for it. Honestly, I would do this in your position because I have read of people getting reman drives with other people's data still on them. But that would have nothing to do with Apple and everything to do with the companies contracted to remanufacture the HDs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Not much more to say after that.

					<outline text="It's amazing to me that the tech blogosphere doesn't treat Apple's policy re broken hard disks as the huge gaping security hole that it is. " created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:06:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Think about it. We worry about bad people getting their hands on little pieces of data that, when added together, give them the power to be us in banking and credit transactions. " created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:06:56 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Well, if you own a Mac and its hard disk goes bad, and you make the mistake of bringing it to Apple for service, you will turn over all that data to Apple. Not &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot; but &quot;will.&quot; What Apple in turn does with that data is none of your affair. They don't sign anything or offer any guarantees that they won't sell the disk to a data miner. Think it can't happen or that it's unlikely? I don't gain much comfort from your feeling of security." created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:07:53 GMT"/>

Usually when I write something critical of Apple, the results are mixed. Some people are supportive, but far more people attack. This time the ratio is very different. Almost everyone who has commented gets that there's a huge problem here. " created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:12:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Some say that other vendors do this too. That gives me less comfort, not more. That means there's no escaping this crazy way of treating user's confidentiality. Ultimately it hurts the vendors because people can't use their computers for things the manufacturers say we can. " created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:14:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Further, it's got to be an issue for the banks, brokerage firms, credit agencies. If you are a newspaper and you employ reporters and they use a computer, how exactly are you guarding the confidentiality of your sources? If you're a confidential source, don't you have an interest when the reporter gives their computer manufacturer all their data to do with as they please?" created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:14:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Imagine what you would do if it turned out there was a bug in a Netgear or Linksys router that allowed, under special circumstances, a mailicous person to gain access to the full content of your hard disk at any time. Would you have a problem with that?" created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:16:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="This is worse than Microsoft's neglect of malware that got me to stop using their computers. In that case it was Microsoft being neglegent. This time Apple &lt;i&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt; is the source of the problem. It's as if they planted a virus in their operating system that entitled them, under special circumstances, completely out of your control, to gain access to everything on your disk, with as much time as they want, with no way for you to prevent or even detect the intrusion.

					<outline text="Re yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kramchang/107581089/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, Apple does not have a store in Shanghai. I assume the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2153199702/#comment72157603598396425&quot;&gt;customer&lt;/a&gt; is sincere, he thought he was at an Apple-owned store. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kramchang/107581089/&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of the place he probably went to. BTW, I'm 100-percent sure that the store in Emeryville is owned by Apple. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/retail/baystreet/week/20071230.html&quot;&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; it on Apple's store website. " created="Tue, 01 Jan 2008 21:57:39 GMT"/>
