				<outline text="FriendFeed and level playing fields" created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:10:40 GMT">
					<outline text="I've always been a bit puzzled about how FriendFeed does RSS, but I've never (until now) taken the time to find the source of the puzzlement. I've always just fumbled my way around, sort of approximating what I wanted, and when I couldn't get it, falling back to the API. But now I've hit a wall, and taken the time to understand the nature of the wall. Let me explain." created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:10:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Consider this screen (click on it to see the detail):" created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:12:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/11/30/ffbigscreen.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/11/30/ffscrfeen.gif&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named ffscrfeen.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Suppose you used a photo site that wasn't one of the ones listed, but you had an RSS feed for your photos and favorites on that site. What are you supposed to do? I always assumed you should just add the feed under &quot;Blog&quot; but then your readers will start asking why your pictures don't do all the neat things that happen automatically with Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug or Zooomr sites. I have such a site, &lt;i&gt;and I don't want them to do anything special for it,&lt;/i&gt; I just want to tell FF that it's a photo site and have all the cool special goodies they have for Flickr kick in automatically." created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:12:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you pop up a higher level, you'll see that this is actually contrary to the whole idea of feeds, which were supposed to create a level playing field for the big guys and ordinary people. That's why a guy like Mike Arrington was able to start TechCrunch and eventually be a competitor of CNET. The fact that RSS didn't favor the big guys made that possible. In fact the whole web is like that. You don't need a special client to read the NY Times and another to watch videos on YouTube. Any browser will do, for any site, no matter who's writing and who's reading. It's why many of us fell in love with the web, at first sight. In the software world before that, it mattered who you are or who you worked for. Kind of like FriendFeed. :-(" created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:15:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's also against the level playing field idea to favor people, like me, who can program to the APIs. The point of feeds was to make the technology transparently understandable to people who just had brains, that you wouldn't need to understand anything deeply arcane to make RSS work. Since FF is about feeds, it seems to me that it ought to be consistent with the philosophic simplicity of feeds. Again, this is just another application of a principle of the web -- you could always View Source to see how a website worked, and if you were willing to do a little trial and error, and head-scratching, you could make your site work the same way as any site you could view in your browser. This was a good thing. " created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:17:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, don't get me wrong, I like APIs, I even &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; APIs, but only when a feed won't do. There are cases where the API shows more power than the feeds, where feeds can and should have the same power. For example if I want a description to come along with a picture, I have no choice but to write a program to push the content to FriendFeed. That seems wrong to me. RSS and Atom both have description elements, why ignore them? Also, I can if I want make sure the content arrives in a timely manner, but only through the API. The functionality of a web app shouldn't unnecessarily favor programmers. That's unweblike imho." created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:19:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now I wouldn't make these criticisms if I didn't think FF was an excellent web app. But like all technology it can be better. That's why I make the suggestions. " created="Sun, 30 Nov 2008 19:20:56 GMT"/>

I showed him an early version of one of our products, we had thrown the kitchen sink into it, every half-baked R&amp;D idea, cause our company was failing and this was our last chance. One idea intrigued him. He said everyone at Apple was hand-designing foils to print on Laserwriters (they were new then). He took a piece of paper and drew a box around one of our pages, and asked if we could do that. Of course we could, and we did, and we immediately sold 1K copies of the product for Apple people, but more importantly, they were so excited by it, they in turn sold many more thousands to their customers, and our company went from being in the brink of shutting down to gushing cash. All because (drum roll) we listened to a user. Ask Guy if you don't believe me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/guykawasaki&quot;&gt;he's on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;."/>
					<outline text="One more thing -- when did listening become &quot;listening in the aggregate.&quot; If you know anything about me, you know that I don't think of users as couch potatoes, passive participants. At the same company, we designed regcards to solicit original thoughts, not just box-clicking. When a new batch of regcards came in I grabbed them and studied them for interesting comments. They told me how our new stuff was being received, what they liked and didn't like, what was missing that would make the difference for them. When I had a question, I called and asked.

Christmas is always a big day for new movies. In Santa Cruz, where we did it last year, a surprising number of people did it too. We saw Sweeney Todd, the stupid Tom Hanks movie about the politician who supposedly saved Afghanistan, and The Savages, which was, imho, by far, the best of the three. Sweeney starred two of my favorite actors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetzCaZAoiY&quot;&gt;Helena Bonham Carter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdIIzD9s2Xg&quot;&gt;Johnny Depp&lt;/a&gt; (with a small &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlama_9caMg&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; for Sacha Baron Cohen!) and directed by Tim Burton -- it should have been great, but I could hardly stay awake during the movie.

I had a strong feeling about this movie, that it was the counterbalance to No Country For Old Men, which was very very very serious (and unprecedented for the Coens). The CIA Director and his report seemed to speak for us and for the Coens, asking WTF just happened? No one knows. (And you wouldn't believe it if I told you, and you wouldn't even care.)

I still want soundbites from the sources, but I want them to link to the full blog post behind the quote. Too often, in the past, reporters played funny games with partial quotes, or by quoting one person after another as if they were speaking in sequence, when in reality neither had any idea that the other was being quoted.

I like the way the host &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gross&quot;&gt;Terry Gross&lt;/a&gt; interviews people, and because the show is so good, and she's basically a fair interviewer, and a lot of people listen to it, she gets very good, very interesting guests. All around, a lot of positive flow around the show, and I'm a fan. Or I should say I was a fan until three days ago, since then I've not been able to listen to the show, I'm so disillusioned with Ms Gross. Let me explain." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 01:51:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, what happened three days ago was she interviewed William Ayers, the man made famous by the McCain-Palin campaign as the supposed terrorist who President-elect Obama &quot;palled-around&quot; with. Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/13/97183824/npr_97183824.mp3&quot;&gt;MP3 of the interview&lt;/a&gt;. Before you judge my judgement, listen to the whole thing. It's necessary to get a full appreciation of what I'm going to say." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 01:53:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In this interview, she used the tough &quot;gotcha&quot; style interview, every question designed to evoke a confession. Ayers answered each question like a skilled politician, and walked a very fine line, and held back a lot of things I'm sure he would have liked to say." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 01:58:07 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the end she asked Ayers if he wanted to apologize for what he did, if he would be willing to take the &quot;unrepentent&quot; part off the label &quot;unrepentent terrorist,&quot; and he refused, and I'm glad he did." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 02:01:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="These are complicated issues, and to deal with it in a balanced way would require probably a few books, written from different perspectives.

Not when one person is singled out this way, when so many others are responsible for so much more death and destruction." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 02:06:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reason I like FreshAir is she doesn't normally do gotcha. Her style is to ask leading questions to get her subjects to tell their own stories. She may ask challenging questions, but only ones her subject wants to answer. Since the Ayers interview she's returned to her original style, interviewing a comedian and a book author. But I can't help but wonder if each of these people has something to answer for too, and she's not asking about any of that." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 02:08:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I definitely sympathize with Ayers, I probably wouldn't have minded if she probed John McCain this way about &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; involvement in Vietnam. I'm sure he killed a lot more people than Ayers did. And that led me to the other, larger reason I'm unhappy with the interview -- she might not want someday to have someone say she &quot;palled around&quot; with an unrepentent terrorist who attacked his own country. In other words, she may be using us to protect herself. If that's the reason she drove Ayers so hard, I would much rather she had skipped the interview altogether. " created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 02:11:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="After all we've heard about him that's bad, didn't he deserve one chance to tell his story without being presumed guilty? And didn't we deserve a chance to hear that? FreshAir is the place I would have thought we would have gotten that story, and I think there's a good chance that cowardice prevented it. It certainly appears that way, and in journalism, it's hard to respect someone who allows such an appearance to persist." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 02:16:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's going to be real hard for her to keep me as a fan. Either she adopts the gotcha style and goes after everyone, from clowns to reporters, and I'll tune out for the same reasons I don't listen to other reporters who use that style; or she stays with the softball style I like, but I'll never be able to stop thinking of her as a hypocrite for being so gutless with Ayers." created="Sat, 22 Nov 2008 02:23:03 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The goal was to get the OPML Editor running behind Apache, so Apache could serve the static stuff, and the OPML Editor could do the dynamic stuff. The OPML Editor is running only on port 5337 and Apache on port 80. And all this is running on an instance in Amazon's cloud, a.k.a. EC2. " created="Fri, 21 Nov 2008 17:43:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The first problem is that while Amazon is capable of linking a permanent IP address to an instance, so you can host publicly available websites in EC2, the machine doesn't know its public IP address, so when you tell Apache to route requests for the public IP address to OPML it says OK, but it never actually routes anything. I thought &quot;Well this is silly, why does Apache care what its IP address is?&quot; and it turns out it doesn't. Just put an asterisk where you'd put an IP address, and it routes everything. This must have been added after the first release because the docs don't mention it except parenthetically." created="Fri, 21 Nov 2008 17:44:47 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then I had problems on the OPML side, cause now every request, even those that used to come in on port 80, now use port 5337. It turns out some code cares in some very bizarre ways that I never fully understood. Instead I wrote a hack that changes the port to 80 if it came from Apache, and bing everything works. I call this the Indian Jones method after the scene in the first Indiana Jones movie where the hero kills the terrifying giant sword-swinging Mullah by shooting him. It was funny the first time, after that you see it coming and it's not that funny. But sometimes I forget that you can solve programming problems that way.

But 30 Rock is everything a great sitcom is supposed to be. It's like Mary Tyler Moore. We love the heroine, Liz Lemon and come to love the grumpy boss Donaghy (played by Alec Baldwin), and the show is studded with celebrity guests from Seinfeld as himself, Paul Rubens as an Austrian prince, Robin Williams as a NY street bum and Carrie Fisher as a washed-up vision of the future Liz Lemon.

As any reporter will tell you, the appearance of impropriety is every bit as bad as the impropriety. The incoming President can be forgiven (briefly) for favoring one company's product over another, but the dominance of that product is, imho, the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; of an excuse. The President-elect should help create competition. I think competition is so important it should be written into the Constitution (it's not there unfortunately).

He's absolutely right about that, and it's a question that should be dealt with, one way or the other. Either Rivera should disclose his algorithm and sources, and keep it current, or people should stop considering his sites anything other than his personal opinion about what's important. And even if it were just his personal opinion, its disrespectful of his readers to not say what his criteria are. People are scared to question Rivera &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; the algorithm is hidden, so they fear that if they're critical they'll stop getting pointers from TechMeme or Memeorandum, and because of his close relationship with Mike Arrington, whose site has always dominated TechMeme.

This helps the reader understand the bias of the organization behind the newspaper, and their reasoning process. If the editorial board supports one candidate, it might be hard for them to tell you bad news about that person, or good news about his or her opponent.

					<outline text="A review of what happened..." created="Sat, 15 Nov 2008 19:30:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. When I moved into the new house in Berkeley, I got Comcast for TV and AT&amp;T DSL for Internet. I had had terrible experience with Comcast at the apartment I rented while house shopping, lots of outages, and lots of time spent on the phone with Comcast trying to convince them the problem was theirs and not mine, each time resulting in them fixing the problem on their end. I wanted to see if DSL would be any more reliable. I've found that it is quite reliable. (However in the end so was Comcast, at least at a technical level. The problems at the apartment were probably due to the newness of the building, high turnover of tenants and construction projects nearby.)" created="Sat, 15 Nov 2008 19:30:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. At some point I saw a story on TechMeme saying that AT&amp;T was playing funny games with their customers, so I decided to order Comcast Internet service as a backup, in case something went weird with my AT&amp;T DSL service. The Comcast service was unused for many months, there was no need for me to use it, AT&amp;T service was fine. If ain't broke don't fix it, an old belief of mine. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Sat, 15 Nov 2008 19:32:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Then the fateful moment -- I saw a tweet from Dave Sifry saying he had just done a perf test on his Comcast service and found it was delivering incredible throughput. I immediately did the test on my own, and was amazed that it was delivering a consistent 14 megabits up, 5 megabits down, sometimes with as high as 28 megabits up. That did it, a few days later I switched the roles of the two networks, using AT&amp;T as the backup and Comcast as the primary." created="Sat, 15 Nov 2008 19:34:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. At roughly the same time I was starting active testing of the photo aggregator part of FlickrFan. I had five computers running the software, all downloading hundreds of high-rez pics every day from AP and AFP.

Until one day..." created="Sat, 15 Nov 2008 19:36:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. My Internet service was cut. I thought it was an outage, but when I called, I was told they had cut me off deliberately. I was current with my bill (if I recall correctly a total of about $180 per month for both services), but they said I was using too much bandwidth, though they wouldn't say how much I had used. I found it more than appalling that they cut me off just to get me to call them when they could have sent an email, or communicated through comcastcares on Twitter. There are so many better ways to communicate with customers. But I think they must have hired a psychiatrist who told them if you want customers to be compliant, treat them like overdue college-age billpayers, even when they're customers in good standing. You're more likely to get what you want.  I wrote up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/04/16/aNewReasonToHateComcast.html&quot;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+comcast&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt;, as I am doing now.

					<outline text="They told me that if I didn't reduce my Internet usage to what they considered a normal level, without specifying what that was or offering me any way to measure my usage, they would cut me off again, only next time the outage would be for 12 months.

					<outline text="6. Having been threatened, I did two things. I reduced the use of the Internet on my LAN and I ordered DirecTV so, in case this happened again, I would just revert to AT&amp;T and would have the redundant TV service.

I think it was after I downloaded all the content off my server onto a local hard disk for backup (it was shortly after doing that that they cut me off, I'm saying it wasn't likely a coincidence). Rather than call them, I instructed comcastcares to cancel my service, giving me the slightest shred of pride and honor, having been treated so shabbily by a vendor, in the end it was I who cut them off, not vice versa.

There wasn't much disunity in the party between Clinton and Obama supporters. I knew this because, while the television networks were reporting a big division, you just didn't see it in Denver. When there were demonstrators, it was always the same group of about ten people. They looked like the people you see at street demos in Berkeley, who, sorry to say, no one takes seriously. There were far more abortion protestors present than Hillary protestors. Orders of magnitude more. You could also see it by talking to people who wore Hillary badges in the convention center, which I did. A few times I sat next to them, or was in a line with them, and we talked and everyone agreed that this was a Democratic year, and nothing would stand in the way of that. I think McCain's people listened too much to the TV people, and didn't bother to check with the people at the show and they overestimated division in the party." created="Sat, 15 Nov 2008 20:10:50 GMT"/>

The teachers union, for example, has always been a big voting bloc among Dems, and Democratic speakers always get a big cheer when they advocate raising the pay of teachers. A number of other topics are pretty good too, but the best consistent applause line, the one that got people on their feet &lt;i&gt;every time&lt;/i&gt; at the DNC was the destruction of civil liberties by the Republicans in the last 8 years. I'm sure the leaders of the Democratic Party weren't in the hall for all the speeches, so I hope they don't miss this. If they don't do something to reverse the mistakes of the last 8 years, even while dealing with the economic and security issues, they will quickly lose the support of the party.

But I chose this brand of coffee maker because people who had one really liked it, and the other brands, their users didn't like them so much. I wanted hot coffee that stayed fresh, and was willing to pay extra for it.

					<outline text="I have two Macs hooked up to HDTVs, one a Samsung the other a Sony Bravia, and until recently they had been connected via VGA. I was barely aware you could do it any other way. I thought the picture was great until I hooked up a Toshiba HDTV to the second video display on my G5 tower and the picture so much better! Much more color. The Toshiba is a smaller, cheaper and older TV than the Sony that's connected into the other video output, but it looks much better. So, of course, I wanted to do the same with the Sony." created="Sat, 01 Nov 2008 18:46:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I tried connecting the HDMI output to the Sony, but the picture looked terrible. I don't know how to describe it, but the colors were all washed out, text was blurry. I might try to take a picture so y'all can see what the deal is." created="Sat, 01 Nov 2008 18:48:26 GMT"/>
