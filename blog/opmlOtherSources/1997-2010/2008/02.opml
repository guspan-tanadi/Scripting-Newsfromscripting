					<outline text="In 2004, when they ran the Swift Boat ads, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5771731/&quot;&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that John Kerry, a war hero, lacked integrity and courage and was disloyal (ads run on behalf of a draft dodger and recovering drug addict), the candidate and his campaign &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/22/bush.kerry.ads/index.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they hated the ads too, and the loophole in campaign finance laws that allowed them should be closed. But they did nothing to stop the ads or counteract them (they could have run opposing ads, for example, saying they want a campaign on real character issues, not lies). Of course they didn't do that because the Swift Boat ads were central to their strategy for winning." created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:32:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2004 should have been a referendum on the war in Iraq, instead the focus was on the campaign itself. The swiftboat ads were run over and over, for free, on all the networks.

Sure the candidate disavows it, even though the words were introduced at his campaign rally. No one interrupted the speaker. McCain waited to apologize until after the event was over and the audience had left (they might boo him, why take a chance). Karl Rove, meeting with Republic strategists cautions against using Obama's middle name. The national Republic Party slaps the wrist of the Tennesee Republic Party for using Obama's middle name in a press release.

One could point out that there is a child from a Muslim country, Bangladesh, living in the McCain house, his adopted daughter. It's true isn't it?

					<outline text="The correct answer, which he did not give, is threefold:" created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:45:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. Apologize first to Obama and his family, at a personal level, for allowing his podium to be used to imply that he's anything but a patriotic and loyal son of America. You want some extra credit, say you're proud that he has a chance to be President, that it says to the world that the United States is diverse, and we practice our stated philosophy of being open and democratic. (There's nothing wrong with this. Do what the Dems have been doing, say no matter what the US is going to get an excellent leader this time around. It's time for Americans to unite as the Dems have united.)" created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:45:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Apologize to the American electorate, liberal and conservative, on behalf of some very nasty people who call themselves Republics, but don't come close to reflecting the values of the party of Lincoln. They are free to vote for whoever they want, but your campaign, which is an American campaign, will stick to the very real differences between the candidates, not lies or implicit lies, for example, that Obama is a Muslim (he's Christian). " created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:47:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. The hardest part, but the one that really matters -- Take control of your party and commit to us that it won't happen again. Again, if you want extra credit, bring Obama on stage with you, and Hillary Clinton, and all three of you say that this isn't the America you want, and that &lt;i&gt;swiftboating will not be part of this election.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:49:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's rare that history presents one such an opportunity as the one being presented to McCain. He could be a rat and dishonest and might just win the election, but this way of winning is not winning at all. In the end he'll hate himself for what he has become. I believe that McCain is a good enough human being to understand this. He's at a crossroads now, and which way he goes has a lot to do with which way the country goes." created="Fri, 29 Feb 2008 15:59:13 GMT"/>

					<outline text="PS: A frequently asked question -- Why do you call McCain's party &quot;The Republic Party?&quot; It's my small way to remind members of his party that the correct name of their leading opposition is the Democrat&lt;i&gt;ic&lt;/i&gt; Party. That so many Republicans &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(phrase)&quot;&gt;trash the name&lt;/a&gt; of their opponent, esp ones like McCain who claim to be honorable people, says that well, they have no honor. I noticed that McCain started doing it shortly after he became the presumptive nominee. I think Democrats and their supporters (like myself) have to get used to balancing this out, even though it may be embarrassing to appear so illiterate."/>

					<outline text="There's a difference these days, because there's serious talk among developers about whether or how to compete. Earlier this week at lunch with one of them, I said I didn't know how great the opportunity was, given that Twitter has been staying up, through heavy use during the debates and primaries. Then, as if on call, it started going down. In the last 24 hours it's been down more than up, or so it seems. " created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 18:49:23 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Some guidelines for potential Twitter-competitors." created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 18:55:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="1. I don't like names with the word &quot;killer&quot; in it -- even in private. It's the wrong idea. No one will kill anyone. And names you use in private have a way of leaking out in public. " created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 18:58:30 GMT"/>
					<outline text="2. Don't use the term crowdsourcing -- it betrays a perspective that's arrogant and wrong. I am not part of a crowd, I am a creative important person. Most Silicon Valley companies have this attitude. It's a good vector for competing. Our users are sentient human beings, individuals. Important not just as a collection of people." created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 18:56:06 GMT"/>
					<outline text="3. Most important, any service meant to compete with Twitter must be 100 percent compatible with the Twitter API. Porting of apps that build on Twitter means making the domain an option, where you call twitter.com it must be possible to change it to mytwitterclone.com, for example." created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 18:59:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="4. It must be possible to use your clone when Twitter goes down and then switch back to Twitter when it comes back up with no loss of data. If you want smoothe entry into the market you must serve as a backup, earn your place with the users. Everyone will love you because it gives Twitter a very real concrete incentive to become more reliable." created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 19:00:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="5. To everyone, twitter.com included -- this is a utility like email or IM. Reliability is key. If it's going to be used in business (very powerful idea) then auditability is essential. To assume that users love the product is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a good idea, any emotional connection becomes a negative if you can't keep the system up. " created="Thu, 28 Feb 2008 19:01:57 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Last night's debate really shifted things for me, esp after my talk on Monday with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/people/lakoff&quot;&gt;George Lakoff&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 18:50:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="First, I'm going to help George and his thinktank, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Rockridge Institute&lt;/a&gt;, build their presence in the blogosphere. They're from a different world, they write books, something I'd like to do, but it isn't in my nature. In the same way when they look at communication they think big and longer-term. Instant communication, blogging and podcasting, is not their first impulse. But Lakoff and his associates understand politics in a way that Democrats don't get, but Republicans really do. That is, until Barack Obama. If you really want to understand why the Obama campaign is working and the Clinton campaign is fading, Lakoff understands it, and if you press him, he'll get out of professor mode, and tell you how it works in words anyone with a brain and an education can understand. That's his gift." created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 19:31:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Lakoff tells a story about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Wirthlin&quot;&gt;Dick Wirthlin&lt;/a&gt;, Reagan's chief strategist, in 1980. Lakoff met him at a conference after he had retired, and the two hit it off. He explained to George that when he started he did a poll, and found out that most people don't agree with Reagan, but they planned to vote for him anyway. I've seen the same thing with Obama. In a comment thread here, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windley.com/&quot;&gt;Phil Windley&lt;/a&gt;, who I like and respect (we have a technology bond) but whose politics and mine couldn't be more opposite, said he might vote for Obama. What! I asked why and he said that Obama seemed to him to have integrity. That's what Wirthlin uncovered. People don't vote on policy, they vote for leaders, for people whose values seem American to them, for people they feel they can trust. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 18:53:45 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I talked with Lakoff about how the word &quot;liberal&quot; had been destroyed by the right wing, and asked if that was going to be a problem for Obama. He said it wouldn't, because Obama had figured out how to say what many of us believe, that the values people label with the L-word are actually &lt;i&gt;American&lt;/i&gt; values. When your neighbor's house is burning down, you don't lecture him on how incompetent he is (though there are Americans who would do that), you get out your fire hose and do everything you can do to help. &lt;i&gt;After&lt;/i&gt; you call 911 to get taxpayer-funded fire department to come put out the fire. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 18:56:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="We look forward to the coming election believing that this time the &quot;tax and spend&quot; label won't stick for a couple of reasons. Our candidate sees it coming this time, and understands that it's a frame, it's a way that Republicans get you to accept their point of view by letting them frame the discussion in their terms. Do Democrats tax and spend? Sure of course they do. So do Republicans. Nothing wrong with it. Imagine if we all had to hire our own fire departments. Instead we pool our resources and buy fire insurance, in the form of trucks and buildings, and brave men and women who protect our lives and property. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 18:59:09 GMT"/>

It's naive to think that government doesn't play that role, and the Republicans obviously believe it too. In the seven years Bush has been in office government spending has grown. Have taxes grown too? Maybe not, but borrowing surely has. The money to pay for the war came from somewhere. As it has for many Americans who borrowed against the equity in their homes, there must be a day of reckoning for our economy as a whole. We've been charging our collective lifestyle, this luxury of an occupation of Iraq which is a lousy investment for the American taxpayer (where's the return?) but a great investment for Bush, Cheney and friends in the oil and defense industries. We won't know how much money Bush gets after he leaves office and becomes a private citizen, but I bet he becomes a billionaire from kickbacks he gets from selling us out. This is a tax, and it's our future they have been spending. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 19:05:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="While the Republicans have been in office America has become much less competitive in the world economy. Those jobs we lost while Republicans ran the show aren't coming back. And the inefficiency of our health care system, believe it or not, is an important reason industrial jobs are going across the border to Canada, where they have a no nonsense health care system that works like this -- if you get sick you get health care. Geez, does that seem fairly American to you? It does to me. It's kind of like the fire department. We all hope our houses don't catch fire, but when they do, we're damned happy we don't get an argument when we call 911. Why should cancer, diabetes and heart disease be any different? I don't get it." created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 19:19:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="All of this is part of the story Lakoff tells. You can get a taste of it starting midway through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/02/25/interviewWithGeorgeLakoff.html&quot;&gt;Monday's podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to the last half hour if you're short on time. And I'm going to keep pestering him to do more, shorter podcasts with me, responding to current events, as they happen. We'll apply his model to the political system, and watch how Obama openly captures the best of the Republican playbook.

He says it sounds pretty good. And it does. America works when we work together. Being American is simple, but people like Bush and Rove and Cheney made it complicated. Americans get shit done, and Americans don't argue when their neighbor's house is on fire. We roll up our sleeves and we can do great things. For better or worse now we need to do some great things. We're lucky that now we have the leadership we need to get started. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 19:22:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="And there was the shift in thinking that came from last night's debate. We already have more leadership from this man who hasn't even won the Democratic nomination yet than we have from the actual President of the United States. Further, in the last two campaigns, I have exhorted the candidates to use the money they raise to solve important problems, and realize that Obama had done exactly that. He's uniting us as a country. There's nothing more important, once we remember that we're all Americans and that that means something, we can do so much more than when we're divided by the &quot;wedge issues&quot; of cynical political hacks. We always have had the option to take back our country, now we seem to be doing that. " created="Wed, 27 Feb 2008 19:44:46 GMT"/>

In the early seasons there was Avon Barksdale, Frank Slobotka, McNulty of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Little&quot;&gt;Omar&lt;/a&gt; and dozens of supporting characters. When Entourage winds down they won't have to kill off the main characters, but in violent shows like The Sopranos and The Wire, that is the main question. That, and who's left standing after all the killing is over. The Sopronos punted on this question, whether Tony dies or not was not clear. Not so in The Wire. They're killing their main characters decisively and unceremoniously, without rock classics playing in the background. One character dies with a shot to the head, which we see, no imagination needed, delivered by the most unlikely assassin (but if you were paying attention over the years, in retrospect, not so unlikely).

					<outline text="The big question in The Wire is who is going to be the next Marlo Stanfied, because Marlo is surely going down.

Conventional wisdom says you can't build a scalable distributed Twitter out of RSS. At first I accepted this, as a puzzle, then I remembered that's why we put the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/soapMeetsRss.html&quot;&gt;cloud element&lt;/a&gt; in there. I felt that for some applications polling would be too much. Since the cloud element has been largely ignored, most of the the apps of RSS couldn't scale to do what Twitter does. But if RSS desktop apps like NetNewsWire or FeedDemon were adapted to understand the cloud element, and if a proxy system was worked out to get through firewalls and NAT, it might just work.

					<outline text="Now I'd like to answer this, very carefully." created="Sat, 09 Feb 2008 18:45:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Democrats aren't proposing that you should pay for the uninsured. Key point. They either agree with you, or know that they're not going to get their proposal passed unless they take this into account. The Obama plan says you don't get care unless you have insurance. His proposal aims to get a lot more people insured. Clinton goes one step further, by &lt;i&gt;requiring&lt;/i&gt; everyone to have health insurance. " created="Sat, 09 Feb 2008 18:46:03 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The debate is how health care works for the non-indigent. " created="Sat, 09 Feb 2008 19:01:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you have property, a car, a house, or if your kids go to private school or college, or if you want to take a vacation, or have a baby, or exercise between jobs, getting sick without insurance is a sure way to go from being middle class to being poor, quickly. This is why we have health insurance, to smoothe out the risk, to protect our family's lifestyle. It seems to me it's a good thing. It's the market solving a basic human need. " created="Sat, 09 Feb 2008 20:10:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So this is what we should be discussing, how can we get insurance for all the people who want it, or should we require it for everyone -- this is the debate of 2008.

If you doubt me, just ask a few people you know, and don't just ask poor people or Democrats, ask Republicans. Disease isn't a party issue, and while poor people tend to have poorer health, even well-off people need health care.

I don't think Yahoo has ever had leadership that has been up to navigating the treacherous waters of tech industry economics and politics. At least with the Microsoft acquisition they would get one -- Ray Ozzie. He's a guy you can sit across the table from and plot something out and he can deliver. I've had many good meetings with Yahoo people, but rarely have they resulted in action. From my own selfish point of view, Microsoft owning Yahoo might mean that Ray makes more trips to the Bay Area (figuratively) and when he sits down, we can talk about new open interfaces and developer programs for Yahoo properties." created="Wed, 06 Feb 2008 17:34:27 GMT"/>

He says that Yahoo should accept the Microsoft deal because it would give them the breathing room they need re Wall Street. He argues that the market has always allowed Microsoft to sink resources into developing markets, and that's exactly what Yahoo needs to become the organization that it has been trying to be. Instead, the market treats Yahoo as a comp to Google, but Yahoo doesn't have the economics of Google, so that's, long-term, a losing battle. " created="Wed, 06 Feb 2008 17:38:00 GMT"/>
