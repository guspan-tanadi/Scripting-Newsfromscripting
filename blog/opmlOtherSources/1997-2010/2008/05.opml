					<outline text="Probably some of them want to have jobs in the future, and lying right now wouldn't help them in the careers. Further I think almost everyone who has been paying attention knows that what McClellan says is true. Why didn't he speak out earlier? Why didn't a lot of people? Also consider the possibility that other people in the White House got scooped, the ones trashing McClellan and are jealous that his tell-all book got out before theirs, and others are likely to be tried and perhaps go to jail for their actions. In other words, they all have axes to grind here." created="Thu, 29 May 2008 13:39:09 GMT"/>

Had they done their job, and pressed for the truth, it would have been easier for insiders to tell them the truth. But corporate-owned media isn't interested in helping us make decisions as a country, they're only interested in ad revenue. That's why it's so important that we're creating new media that isn't so conflicted, and why the question of whether bloggers run ads or not is far from a trivial issue.

					<outline text="In court, if you have a conflict of interest, you're supposed to disclose it, and if it's serious enough, it disqualifies you. I've recommended many times that professional news media should have relationships with less conflicted bloggers for circumstances like this, so when they become the story, the public can have a discussion about them using the channels they own. They don't have much of a choice here, because the channels are going to develop with them or without them. We could all save a bunch of time if they didn't fight it, and welcomed amateurs into their midst." created="Thu, 29 May 2008 13:31:15 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Until I moved to the East Bay in 2006, I had never ridden on BART.

I like riding BART not only because it's usually faster than driving, but also because I get to see my fellow citizens without their cars. It's fascinating to see who my neighbors are. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm&quot;&gt;NY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/&quot;&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, where public transit is much more a part of daily life, you get that experience all the time. Not so much on the west coast." created="Thu, 29 May 2008 12:55:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Well, jury duty is like riding BART, only more so. It's as if you were riding on BART, but each passenger, in turn, tells you what they do for a living, who they live with, where they came from, in some cases why they can't serve (always dramatic). What the judge says about jury duty is true, it's what makes America work. There are no professional jurors, just BART people. You just have to be registered to vote or have a driver's license for them to find you." created="Thu, 29 May 2008 12:58:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Which leads to a curious inexplicable fact. First, judging from the jury, the Bay Area is a remarkably diverse place. But if you went by the jury alone, you'd conclude that there are no blacks in Alameda County. The only black person of the 100 or so potential jurors was an African immigrant. However, if you go outside the courthouse in &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2533331607/&quot;&gt;downtown Oakland&lt;/a&gt;, or ride &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/scriptingnews/2533325293/&quot;&gt;BART&lt;/a&gt;, you'd see that there are lots of blacks. What happened? Maybe they don't vote or drive? I honestly don't know. It seems very improbable that a random drawing would be so skewed." created="Thu, 29 May 2008 13:00:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I was riveted listening to the stories people told. It was fascinating. I also had opinions of the lawyers, and the parties. But I can't talk about that yet. What I can say and will is that I was struck by the nobility of my fellow citizens. When asked to serve, they all rise to the occasion. People who doubt that there is cause for hope should sign up for jury duty and go through the process. It is something to behold." created="Thu, 29 May 2008 13:02:52 GMT"/>

I don't plan to go to any of them, I don't see what's accomplished by having public meetings about this stuff. People who control users' data can accomplish a lot more by finding ways to give them the power to use it more effectively. Talking about principles of data portability only achieves talk. It gives people a sense of propriety over talking, not data, and people giving up propriety over talking are just yielding the floor, not yielding any power over users." created="Mon, 26 May 2008 15:03:56 GMT"/>

All I want is the power to give Netflix permission to read an XML file on yahoo.com that contains my movie rating data (assuming Yahoo goes first). Anyone can see how much power this would give Yahoo. Why don't they do it? I honestly don't know. If I were them, I would. " created="Mon, 26 May 2008 15:07:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Another example -- if Twitter wanted to buy itself some time and growth, and give developers something exciting to do, they would store as much user profile data as they can off twitter.com servers and on Amazon. Simple XML formats, use some of their ability to raise investment capital (which they have proven) to grow the human network while they patch up or rewrite their system software. The more data they can move off their outage-prone systems, the more the network can grow around them, but not dependent on them. Amazon has proven they can keep their servers running.

Eventually, relocating New York may be what we have to do. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.com/8301-10787_3-9941099-60.html&quot;&gt;Charles Cooper&lt;/a&gt; is very correct though in his piece on this subject, it's time for Twitter to get into this discussion and tell us what their thoughts are.

					<outline text="I always work in bootstrapping mode, addressing the first big issue, solving the problem, then advancing to the next one. It's why so many of the ideas I've worked on have become popular modes of communication. Big-bang approaches always fail. I've spent decades arguing with people who want to reinvent the world in one stroke. They always try anyway and always fail. &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html&quot;&gt;Bootstrapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the only way that works."/>
					<outline text="BTW, I'm not the only one who believes in bootstrapping. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bootstrap.org/&quot;&gt;Doug Engelbart&lt;/a&gt;, who invented many of the things we take for granted today works that way as well."/>
					<outline text="So the first step in decentralizing Twitter is to get our data safe and stored off twitter.com. Then we need discovery, a way to find people through Twitter, and then without Twitter. There are many ways to do this that work and scale (DNS for one, Skype does it too, without a central server)."/>
					<outline text="It's also important that we work with Twitter and that they be rewarded for being the primary bootstrapper of this network. I think it's important because it's right, and also because we need to incentivize others to do the same."/>
					<outline text="Also, while others believe the conversational aspects of Twitter are primary, I'm not one of them. I buy into the original vision -- &quot;What are you doing?&quot; -- and also see it as a link-blogging environment. I have of course used it conversationally, I've replied on Twitter to others, but I don't depend on it because I think this is going to &quot;spam out&quot; -- in fact it already is going that way. Just in the last few days I've gotten replies from users whose Twitter streams look totally like splogs, and at least a few of them are clearly automated. I block every one of them."/>

The goal is to create no extra work or complexity for users. I think this is the responsible way for developers to help because it's 1. Not a good idea to build a centralized system around a for-profit company and 2. Users generally won't do anything extra to decentralize to prepare for an outage, but when one happens, they blame us (technologists) for not protecting them. Right or wrong, this is the way it is. So I'm working on a step-by-step bootstrap that, if enough developers go along, will have us reasonably protected against a prolonged Twitter outage.

					<outline text="&lt;a name=&quot;update1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update #1: I took a walk, and thought some more about this. If there were a way to point, from your Twitter account, to an alternate feed, then your desktop client could cache a pointer to the feed for each person you're following. If Twitter were to go down, then the desktop client would fall back to polling the feeds. It would probably be slower, but it would work. " created="Sat, 03 May 2008 22:45:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If one of the people you follow didn't have an alternate feed, you'd have to wait for Twitter to come back up to find out what's new with them. But if they used a desktop client, and the client was maintaining the feed automatically for each user (subject to a pref), then it would notify Twitter where it was storing the feed. Twitter would just have to maintain one more string for each user, alongside the user's location, link to their website, one-line bio, etc. " created="Sat, 03 May 2008 22:47:35 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Here's the problem. You're watching pics go by and you see a picture of President Bush speaking at a conference on Children and Faith-based schools and think, man, that's an interesting picture, I want to show that to a friend. " created="Fri, 02 May 2008 17:11:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So you open up the pics folder and &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/05/02/pics.gif&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; a lot of pics with names like pic091337.jpg, pic091338.jpg and pic091339.jpg.

					<outline text="Well, AP and AFP put metadata on their pics, and the FlickrFan process preserves it, and Spotlight can search it. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/05/02/infobox.gif&quot;&gt;Get Info box&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2008/05/02/minibushpic.jpg&quot;&gt;pic&lt;/a&gt; I was looking for.

It must test well with focus groups, but it's meaningless, because the prices would immediately adjust. If you lower the price, people will take longer trips, drive instead of fly, increasing consumption, driving the price up. There might be a bit of a benefit to drivers for a very short period of time, but in the end it would be a wash. This is what economists say, and it makes sense." created="Fri, 02 May 2008 16:27:25 GMT"/>

It wouldn't cost much to retrofit a few cities with really high speed lines, then we could get to work on developing the services that would make life more interesting, fun and efficient.

There's an idea that it could be done in a very Berkeley way, which is to say, the city owns it, and the service providers can tap in, but they don't get to dictate terms, as we know many of them like to do. I don't know how exactly I got enlisted, but I guess we've got enough Internet celebs in Berkeley to maybe get this done right, politically. Not sure what comes next, but it sure is interesting.
