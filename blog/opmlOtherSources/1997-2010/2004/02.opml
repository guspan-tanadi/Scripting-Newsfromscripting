We will have several sessions on journalism, politics and the campaign of 2004. We've scheduled the conference between the first part of the campaign, the primaries; and the next -- the conventions. The goal is to coalesce what we've learned in time to apply that knowledge in the second cycle. We will also have a session on weblogs and libraries, which is new. And if there's sufficient interest, we will repeat the sessions on medicine and law, and possibly add sessions for art, education, science and literature. Let me know. Based on the very strong response re visions for web writing tools, we will certainly have a session about that. We're also going to do a session on RSS.

				<outline text="Re discussion moderators, I have a few confirmations, and still have to send out offers. In general they are people who were at the first BloggerCon, but did not present. I want to rotate the faces every time to emphasize that the people who are in front of the room are just facilitators. There is &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; small prestige in being one of them, but it's also hard work (but rewarding, I hope). We pack each room with experts and leaders, and the job of the moderator is to assemble a story by calling on the people at his or her disposal. They're like a reporter putting together a story, but you get to hear, first hand what the experts are saying, in their own voices. Think of Dan Gillmor's adage that the people who read his blog are much smarter than he is -- that's the philosophy of BloggerCon. Don't be distracted by the face in the front of the room (as you would be in most conferences), it's the people to your left and right who know the most. And if you want to talk with them later, we'll be sure you get a chance to do that too. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 26 Feb 2004 17:12:50 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="To give you an idea of how this works, at the first BC, the moderators were great, for sure, but for me the two most memorable contributors were both in the &quot;audience&quot; -- Esther Dyson and Jay Rosen. I think there's something relaxing about not having to prepare, and in that relaxation, if you have a powerful and curious mind, can come brilliant ideas. That's what I want. That's why I love this conference, because brilliant people come to it, and share what they know." created="Thu, 26 Feb 2004 17:16:13 GMT" type="outline"/>

If Nader is going to win the election for Dubya, then now's the time to fix the bug in the process. Kerry isn't nominated yet. Think. What's the problem that Nader exploits? What's so fixed about our political system that a minority independent candidate, who likely won't be able to register in many states, is going to spoil it for.. who exactly is he going to spoil it for? Think. Is this the America you imagined when you were a kid? Why can't we make it better? Why can't we have a dozen people running for President? By trying to hold back Nader (good luck) maybe you're preventing exactly the kind of transformation we need. I think Nader is a patriot. Give him a medal. And think instead of being part of the herd.

The second one is much easier. Man. Anyway one of the themes is going to be Nuking The Echo Chamber. I'm going to ask each of the moderators to find a way to work that into the discussions they lead. These conferences are stringing out into a series. This one follows the O'Reilly Emerging Technology conf, where the they identified this problem. How do we methodically and systematically overcome the tendency for echo chambers to form and self-perpetuate. There are some obvious ideas, once we know the problem is there, which we do now, thanks to the people who were at O'Reilly. Of course our conference will be totally wide open and webcast and IRC'd, blogged and wiki'd, we'll create a record, so subsequent meetings can work on the problems we uncover and hopefully build on the answers we discover.

He repeated that the only thing that mattered was winning. It didn't occur to me until this morning why that is wrong. Maybe it's true from the candidate's perspective, but it's not true from the voter's. What matters to the voter is getting representated. In the current political system that can't happen. Think about it this way. What if, in 2000, your main issue had been No Nation Building. Easy. Vote for Bush. What does he do his first week in office? Gets ready to do some nation-building. Did he know he would invade Iraq when he was running? You be the judge. In any case, as with most centralized businesses, the voters are a herd, not meant to be heard.

His concern is that he won't be able to build a client that talks to a weblog server through his Java toolkit because it doesn't allow the HTTP methods the API calls for. Further, he notes that the spec, which was openly developed, has a restrictive copyright. " created="Thu, 19 Feb 2004 14:29:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The best answer is obvious, imho, use XML-RPC because it already has been adapted to and debugged in all the environments where blogging APIs need to run. By cutting almost to the bottom of the stack you will have to redo everything that took &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt; to do. I think it's going to take longer to redo because XML-RPC didn't need to get any Java toolkits to change, it treaded more softly than the Atom does. " created="Thu, 19 Feb 2004 15:08:53 GMT"/>
					<outline text="There's a practical side to protocol and format design that's missing in the Atom API. The goal is to make it easy for developers to hop on the bandwagon and get them committed to developing for the platform. Putting unnecessary hurdles in the way unnecessarily limits adoption, and virtually guarantees either stagnation or massive breakage. I can't imagine that either choice is what Google is looking for.

Instant review. If they wanted to make the switch easier, as always, they should have made it work exactly like the competition, or as close as they can without invoking the ire of their attorneys. They put the tabs on the left instead of along the top. And the search results &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=dave&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; looks different from the page you enter the query on.

Two shitty Silicon Valley companies competing is a billion percent better than one dominant shitty Silicon Valley company. And you can quote me on that (as I'm sure my detractors will).

I can offer the same kind of safety that Lotus 1-2-3 offered developers on MS-DOS or Excel on Mac OS. If you did something the way they did, you were safe, because you could be sure the platform vendor would never break them. In this case what matters is if aggregators read the format. The day aggregators can't read Scripting News is the day your RSS feed will stop working. My job is to be sure that day never comes. " created="Wed, 18 Feb 2004 15:51:33 GMT" type="outline"/>

They have similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://politics.feedster.com/&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt; for other candidates. What's interesting (and if true wrong) is that they've chosen weblogs that support the candidates to include in the synthetic feed for each candidate. What's the logic behind that? They might as well call the project The Echo Chamber. Aside from that, they have me down as a Kerry supporter? I don't recall making such a declaration.

He asks why no one has developed a translator from Atom to RSS. There are a couple of reasons. First, Atom is a moving target. Anyone who gets on board now is committing to the twists and turns that are certainly coming. Second, it would really only work if it were deployed as a dynamic service and that's a long-term commitment with no joy. It seems Google, the big company here with the deep pockets, should do this. And if they contemplated it, it would lead them to the correct answer -- support RSS and end this miserable discussion.

I know that sounds weird, but that would create a tent that's big enough to include conservatives and liberals, peaceniks and warmongers, me and Glenn Reynolds, gun nuts and dope smokers, just as long as you like discussing politics with your neighbors, you can be part of the new party (please leave the guns and pot at home). Let's call it the Rational People's Party, or RPP. We'd meet every month to talk about local and national politics, to start new weblogs and meetups, to broadcast our ideas and invite political leaders to pitch themselves. If they wandered off-topic we'd ask them to get back on track. If one broke a campaign promise, this would appear on a public list, for every local RPP chapter to access. Think of it as a nationwide caucus system, that's ongoing, and has a good database and lots of weblogs. We'd encourage our members to run for office, we'd even publish guidelines and howtos, but we wouldn't back them as a party. It's kind of like Hotels.Com, Travelocity or Expedia. They don't run hotels or airlines, but they help you choose one. And maybe they help you decide where you want to go, but are really okay where ever you end up going. Our only stake is having a good election, one where the voters get what they want. We'd rate each election on how well we did, and strive to keep doing better." created="Sat, 14 Feb 2004 03:34:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

Paolo reminds me that the second time I met him, in California, I was afraid he and his wife thought I was being rude or grouchy, but in fact I was really sick. We're taught to be strong, that it's impolite to let a guest know that we're not feeling well, put a smiling face on it, do the best you can. So even when you have the benefit of real-world contact, it's nice to know that you may get the benefit of the doubt, and that the doubt is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; there." created="Fri, 13 Feb 2004 15:45:38 GMT" type="outline"/>

So when I saw that Shelley Powers planned to comment on a probably very sexist picture that Marc Canter had posted on his blog and then pulled, I figured she was going to trash Marc.

Don't you get it that the power to offend is just as sacred as the power to please? In fact, even more so, because people are always trying to shout down the person with an original idea, because they're easy to shout at (they're usually alone). One of my best friends asks if I am scared of something and when I say yes, she says &quot;Okay, cool, that's what we'll do.&quot; If you're scared of Marc's picture, or more likely, scared of the disapproval of an alpha male or female, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; become the subject of discussion, and that's right, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/connecting/community_member_or_writer.htm&quot;&gt;mazel tov to Shelley&lt;/a&gt; for pointing there instead of the predictable place (a misbehaving male).

				<outline text="At dinner last night I gave my usual schpiel about how DaveNet started, and since I was dining with Microsoft people I emphasized the early &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1994/10/18/billgatesvstheinternet&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about Bill Gates, and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1994/10/27/replyfrombillgates&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;. I quoted Bill saying that the Internet wouldn't mean less sales for Flight Simulator or Encarta, and I said he was right but that wasn't the point. One of my companions stopped me there and said wait a minute, the Internet did mean less sales for Encarta. I was shocked. That's correct, and Gates got it wrong, and I wasn't enough of a visionary to see it. I got it wrong too. Who needs an encyclopedia on a CD-ROM when you have the Web at your fingertips? Someday some kid is going to ask you What is Encarta? That might be where you end up going today." created="Wed, 11 Feb 2004 16:30:34 GMT" type="outline"/>

He's right to be concerned, I am too. They're breaking users, including people who aren't using their software. There is a lot of implicit trust in the RSS network, an assumption that vendors will behave rationally and will care for users. Any participant can break us, as Google is proving.  But I believe in the fabric of the community. Either Google will fail, or Atom will be the new syndication standard. But Rogers, don't look to the past for their motivation, that's not what it's about. I am absolutely sure Google has an aggregator in the works. And by taking control of the syndication format, and trying to eliminate RSS, they will control the whole blogging-syndication-search space.

If the result of all this hard work is just another venue for the ongoing pissing match between Microsoft and Silicon Valley, I'm out. It occurred to me that I should say this publicly too. I mean it. The users now have enough data, and the tools to speak for themselves. That was the point of doing blogging software, so that we would never be held hostage to people who sit at the top of a pyramid and look down at us, their minions, and sigh when they have to kill our dreams. It doesn't have to happen. The political bloggers have been able to out Trent Lott, and now are working on Dubya. We've launched a Presidential campaign. We are powerful. Use your minds, and gather all the bits of data you can, and form an opinion. As Howard Dean says, and he's right, you have the power, not me. Tell Google to get with the program and work with the developers who brought you aggregators, publications, blogging tools, and other RSS apps. Tell Schmidt and Ballmer to view this space as not-theirs, not to be fought over. Make products for us, compete to serve us better, but if you try to break us, we'll break you." created="Wed, 11 Feb 2004 15:55:26 GMT" type="outline"/>

If voters had a place to go to get a balanced story, one that had good news and bad news about Dean, and about other candidates, instead of the crazy stuff they put on television networks, his candidacy might have survived, or at least we'd be having a discussion about what we want in a President, instead of the stuff they talk about on TV. Did you watch the Sunday morning interviews today? The interviewers ask the stupidest questions over and over, hoping to catch the candidate saying something like &quot;I'll drop out when this happens,&quot; or &quot;I don't mind running for vice-president.&quot; The candidates just don't answer them, instead they view the time as free commercials, and just repeat their soundbites over and over. In the meantime Dean and Clark are both sounding like &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; better candidates than they did when they were stumping in NH, and Dean is right about Kerry, we don't know if he's any kind of a good candidate, because all we're getting from him is &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3471107.stm&quot;&gt;bluster&lt;/a&gt; and victory speeches. Anyway, the average discourse in the blogosphere is no better than television. It's all pretty lame I guess. Whatever. " created="Mon, 09 Feb 2004 06:27:08 GMT" type="outline"/>

She gave for two reasons. I don't remember the first, but I do remember the second. Dean said either he wins in Wisconsin or he retires from the race.

After coming out of  a meeting mostly about the press and how they manipulate us, I really felt for Nader. If I were him that kind of pressure would make me more insistent on running. Nader responded that those who call for him not to run are trying to censor him. I agree.

They failed to arm the electorate with the best information. For a fraction of the cost of a state campaign, they could have deployed an information system for voters that would have made history. We'd be raving about how the Internet has made it possible to be a responsible voter for the first time. $40 million isn't a big drop in an ocean of television ads, but in the space of public information systems it's a virtually infinite amount of money.

A couple of thoughts. I'd be more encouraged if the campaign were getting inspiration from new people &quot;in the field&quot; -- although that would reflect an imbalance in perspective. Second, how about doing something creative with the money? Now that we know how the 2003 money was wasted, what's going to change in 2004? What is the newly funded Dean campaign going to do to empower our minds? The rallies clearly didn't make a difference. Nor did the expensive collateral material or television ads. Wouldn't an Internet campaign make it easy for voters who care to find out what the issues are, in plain understandable terms? Activate and then empower our minds, that's the challenge. That way, should your guy become the front-runner again, we'll all know where to tune to get the counter-arguments when CNN and ABC go after him.

It's a puzzle, why would Google bother with this? Well, first, it doesn't have to be very useful for Google to try it out. They've launched lots of speculative services that have failed to find users. This one &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; finding users. So what can they do with it? Easy. It's their &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2100-1023-276558.html?legacy=cnet&amp;tag=prntfr&quot;&gt;identity system&lt;/a&gt;. At some point they'll add a web services interface so our comment systems can connect to their back-end to validate users. Now you can go to one place to see all your comments. Then it gets better. Give it your credit card info, and then when you go to an Orkut-enabled e-commerce site, you can have one-click ordering (modulo a certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/713681&quot;&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt;). Think about all the relationships Google has with sites that run their ads. Even I run their ads on one of my sites, and it's a pretty good deal, that one site pays for the bandwidth on all my sites. Anyway, that's a ramble.
