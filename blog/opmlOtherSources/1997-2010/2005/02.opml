Could Microsoft? Could AP or the New York Times? When you take that first step down the slope, take a good look at what's further down the hill, because you're going there for sure.

This gives me a chance to say that I've not tried to write &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2004/06/12.html#a5821&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; out of the story. Quite the opposite, I think his contribution was essential, and not just in the last half-year. Podcasting appears to everyone but a small number of people, to be an instant wonder. But the trail goes back a long way. It took a lot of iteration and patience to make it happen. As I write this a bunch of other future &quot;instant wonders&quot; are in gestation. There will be a time when they will move to the top of the stack and be the engines of growth for the tech industry. Markoff will write stories about them too, explaining how his friends have finally figured out how to make money from them as if it was the responsibility of every technology to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2001/02/01/johnDoerrOnABicycle&quot;&gt;John Doerr&lt;/a&gt; even richer.

It was an attempt to get my perspective into a jihad against me. It didn't work then. I have been very wary of having anything to do with the primary feeders of that storm, but enough time has passed. We won't be friends, but I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; acknowledge kindness, and be appreciative of it. A lot of people use me as a foil to express their rage, but I'm actually just a person.

Never mind right and wrong, for a minute, or whether Google is good or evil, how do you communicate with any kind of integrity in that environment?"/>
					<outline text="And as I asked in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetwowayweb.com/2005/02/22#a272&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;, what happens when Google isn't satisfied to add links to our sites, suppose they were to change the actual words? I haven't heard Google say they would never do that, have you?"/>

She's telling you that Google doesn't see authors and publishers as a constituency they need to be concerned about. You're not even a third party, it may be your content they came to read, but only Google and the user matter. (And I suspect users don't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; matter, except to the extent that Google can sell their attention to advertisers.)"/>
					<outline text="I thought Danny's hypothetical &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2005/02/25#When:2:59:35PM&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; was right on the money. What if a larger company, say Microsoft, without asking for permission, offered Google searches to its users without Google's ads, or even better, with more informative ads, chosen by Microsoft? I assume Google would think this is okay because hey, it's the user's content to remix as he or she wants to, right?"/>

Maybe he should do some more research before he rests on his laurels. Seems like the Web is doing pretty well. And it's not good that he got dealt a dose of name-calling from some bloggers, but he could view it another way, they're people who could be using his libraries. That is, assuming that libraries really &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have a role in the 21st Century, something he, as a president of the association, should be trying to make sure we're convinced of.

A new diet, more consistent exercise, a new driver's license (the old one expires on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/02&quot;&gt;birthday&lt;/a&gt;), and maybe a new car. I want to finally get a product release cycle going for my OPML editor, which of course should help the podcast bootstrap. I have three interesting business opportunities that were waiting for me to land somewhere, and the cool thing about them is that I could do them all, they don't conflict. Now, I will of course keep traveling, it's in the blood. I can see a springtime Europe trip, and I'll surely be in Atlanta, NY and Boston again soon, for business, friends and family.

After a few days reading comments both pro and con, trying out the software, thinking, I put together this document which explains why authors and publishers should tell Google to back down. Their toolbar takes a step down a treacherous slope, that changes the way the Web works as to make commerce, journalism and scholarship impossible. It will render agreements entered to on the web null and void. It invites Microsoft, with it's virtual monopoly in browser, to do the same, to the detriment of the market, and even Google itself. In the current political climate it seems unlikely that the Department of Justice would intervene if Microsoft chose to match Google. The feature is poorly thought out, clearly breaks with Google's culture (there's no opt-out, even the search engine offers one).

				<outline text="Blogging started in the tech community, and over the years, we've followed stories, sometimes they were picked up by mainstream media, often with little or no credit to the bloggers who did the discovery and research. Then the political bloggers did the same, and got the credit for putting the pressure on the MSM that's been going on in technology reporting for so long. Today we work with our colleagues at eWeek and News.Com, ZDNet, and even some of the reporters for business publications and local newspapers. I have a feeling the story we're working on, with Google pushing the envelope on the story of Smart Tags, is going that way.

To summarize what I said in the podcast, the question is where is the line, what's permissible content modification and what's not? Certainly there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a line, right? We don't mind them changing the font or size of our text, or even converting it to voice to make it accessible to deaf people. Then, the question of trust comes up. When Google bought Blogger, they stated clearly that they would not do anything to tilt the table in favor of Blogger, but shortly after, within weeks, they broke that promise, ironically, using the Google Toolbar. Even worse, they would not engage in dialog. Those were very &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/04/23#aboutGooglesResponse&quot;&gt;difficult times&lt;/a&gt;, and the people who were responsible may not even be at Google now. Who knows. But the fact is, you can't go by corporate promises in areas like this, and even if you could, their promises are not binding on other companies. It all may sound theoretic, but I've been around this block many times over many years. You have to have a sense where the line is, and not budge one inch. As I said in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cnFeb18.mp3&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, we'll likely have some powerful allies on this one, it's content vs technology, the First Amendment and commerce, free speech and money (lots of it)." created="Fri, 18 Feb 2005 13:14:47 GMT" type="outline"/>

He and I have spent a lot of time talking about how Davos would work if it were both physical and virtual. I've used many of those ideas in putting together BloggerCon, and some of the aggregators I've done over the years. But there's still no doubt in my mind that Davos would work better if it both eased up on confidentiality and exclusivity, and decentralized. More blogs, not one &quot;official&quot; blog. And deliberately bring bloggers in, to show the outside world what's going on. I would be happy to help the WEF formulate their approach to blogging.

I've come to hate that &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/02/16/Troops,Weblog.jpg&quot;&gt;joke&lt;/a&gt;, and to see it as a yet another way for professionals to push bloggers to the side, to a place they (theoretically) don't have to look at us. At the same time, we're their most interested readers, and we can help them build credibility, and all this came out at the meeting, and these are intelligent and thoughtful people, and once they realized that I am not a joke, and have self-respect, we got along very well." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 10:17:40 GMT"/>

Diane Norman, the paper's city editor (all reporters on the paper report to this her) has a daughter in the local high school, and is active in the school, as a parent. When she got a promotion, some of her parents thought that meant the school would get more favorable coverage in the paper. This turned out to be a perfect example of an issue that couldn't easily be handled in the paper, but &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be handled in the editor's personal weblog. It was a chance for her to explain something that she's passionate about, her integrity, and by raising it as an issue, she can enhance her own credibility and the credibility of her paper." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 10:21:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="By the end of the meeting I had a feeling that there's a logic to blogging and local news, more than including the work of the community in the output of the newspaper. Clearly the weblog allows the people of the news organization to be more specific, more personal, and still be under the masthead. News of a staff assistant moving on to a new job in a new state wouldn't belong in the paper, but it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; belong on the weblogs. Newspapers are not only journalism, they are also organizations, and like all organizations, they have stories to tell, and where there are stories, blogs have a job." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 10:27:12 GMT"/>

					<outline text="A long time ago, in another lifetime, when I was a Mac software entrepreneur who had sold out, I was working in the company that had acquired ours to build a product line of Mac software tools, shipped in source code. I had approached developers of products that were past their prime, probably not selling much, if at all, and proposed we repackage the software as toolkits for programmers. I had put together a list, a graphics program, word processor, a small spreadsheet, a database, and had called each of the developers and set up meetings at MacWorld Expo, where I was joined by a corporate business development manager, who would negotiate the deals. His name wasn't really Horace, but let's call him that. The story isn't really about him, so his name doesn't matter." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 11:13:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="After we sat down with the first developer, after chitchat, and some enthusiasm for the idea on both sides, I started explaining the terms of the deal. Horace interrupted and took over. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Technically, he was explaining the deal correctly, but you had to be very cynical to get how little he was actually offering. He was changing the terms so that the developer would stand very little chance of making any money at all. I was shocked. " created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 11:18:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Then, at the second meeting he started doing the same thing, but I interrupted and said &quot;What Horace really means is...&quot; and then explained how the deal was horrible for the developer, and of course he walked out, thinking our company was pretty slimy. On the way out, Horace was furious. I told him that I'd have to deal with the developers who eventually would find out there was no money for them, and I'd never get a second version of their software, and my reputation in the business would be trashed, all for what? So we could shave a few more points from a product line that hadn't even been built yet? How could that &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; work? " created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 11:21:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the end, the product line never happened. It would have been a good complement for our language tools, might have generated some new products, would have been good for developers and good for the Mac, and would likely have enhanced our company's reputation and would have returned a 20 percent pretax profit, which is pretty respectable, imho. Didn't happen." created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 12:05:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The moral of the story is this -- if you're sitting opposite a guy like Horace, and there's a guy like me sitting at the table, you should ask him what Horace really means. And if you don't think you're getting a straight story, get a lawyer, and trust his or her paranoia. There &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; business guys who think a good deal is one where they make all the money and you make none. These are the ones you want to avoid doing business with. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 16 Feb 2005 11:24:32 GMT"/>

Now actually doing these things will make the difference, other publications argue that they can't document these things publicly, but you don't hear those arguments in Greensboro, quite the opposite, they welcome the ideas, and once implemented they will have an unprecedented degree of transparency, and should earn (and deserve) more trust from the community they serve.

I usually don't point to these posts, because frankly, I don't care. I've been doing this for so many years, there's not much excitement left for me in this kind of personal judgement. But the cool thing about blogging (still) is that you can be yourself and not worry what other people think. That's what you have to do all the time, every day, where ever you go. On your blog you get to say what you want. Bryan, I don't care for your tone, either, and I don't think you're being fair, but I'm glad you have a place to express yourself.

They control who gets airtime during the primaries, and who gets favorable coverage and who gets his scream replayed 20000 times between Iowa and New Hampshire. And if that didn't convince you consider that the hundreds of millions of dollars that the candidates raise goes to -- think about it -- the guys who run the media companies!

					<outline text="Anyway, in case you're reading this Andrew, I didn't think &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeastradio.com/&quot;&gt;Madge Weinstein&lt;/a&gt; was born female. You could have called me to verify, or sent an email. I understand from NY Times managing editor Jill Abramson that real reporters verify stuff before running it.
