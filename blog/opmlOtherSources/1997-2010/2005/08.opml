A sufficiently strong hurricane, even one that struck a glancing blow, was enough to break the levee and flood the city. When I was a student in New Orleans, there was a story going around that during hurricanes the National Guard would patrol the tops of the levees, because the police from neighboring parishes would blow their neighbor's levee, so the flooding would happen over there instead of over here. No one is saying that's what happened this time, but they should figure out why the levee broke where and when it did, if the water topped the levee and then eroded it out, or if it was helped along by someone with a shovel or a bit of explosive. Don't think it can't happen. New Orleans for all its charm and beauty is one seriously fucked-up place. The looting is as much the spirit of the Crescent City as the jazz funerals and good food and les bon temps. Racism is a tradition. You can't walk around the city, no matter what your race or economic status, without feeling it. It's one of the first experiences for a visitor to the city who ventures out of the tourist sections.

Responsibility however is not with the administration, it lies with the electorate. We had a chance to make last year's election a referendum on the politics of terrorism, to seriously evaluate our preparedness, if we really cared. If anything is learned from this, we have to &lt;i&gt;think,&lt;/i&gt; we can't delegate. We need leadership that cares, not in a superficial way. That leadership must come from us. We have some very huge decisions to make right now, and many thousands of lives depend on how well we do. That said, I have few ideas of things we can do other than give money to relief agencies, which of course, we are doing." created="Wed, 31 Aug 2005 17:36:35 GMT"/>

OK, as reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/15#When:6:18:31PM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in June, Google has an iTunes clone in the works. Probably works great with cell phones, unlike iTunes itself which works great with iPods (of course). KP has the inside track because they have a Google &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=john+doerr&quot;&gt;board seat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/2001/02/01/johnDoerrOnABicycle&quot;&gt;Doerr&lt;/a&gt; is architecting the whole thing anyway. Enter Podshow, which gets a sweet deal with Google to provide the first apps and content for their iTunes me-too, all the while in bed with Uncle Steve on iTunes. Instant mini-bubble, Podshow goes public, Adam and Ron retire to Miami, and KP pockets the profits. " created="Sat, 27 Aug 2005 10:17:01 GMT"/>

I've been reading his blog all along, about how he wants my help with microformats, and I would be happy to help if we could find some way to factor out the reputation-bashing. He said on his blog today that he'll help soften the blows when they come. A very small number of people have been able to keep progress at a snail pace. It would be easy to route around them, if there were a will to do so. Marc tells me that he has such a will.

You know, based on the rah-rah's from developers who are probably too scared of Apple to say what they really think, I thought everyone else thought Apple was the perfect company and the perfect computer. That's the downside of people being too scared to speak up, we get shitty information. How can we change this system, so that people aren't so scared? Or can we get Apple to thicken up their skin a bit, and learn to not punish people who have the nerve to criticize them. Blogs were supposed to fix all this.

Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/08/oreilly_joins_the_search_engine_spam_parade.php#010358&quot;&gt;there's&lt;/a&gt; an &quot;ethical discussion&quot; to be had about this. Classic Republican neocon tactic -- change the subject, point the accusing finger at the source of your pain, and get everyone to talk about what a nasty mofo &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; is. Sometimes they even use a proxy like a former &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001902.html&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; who's embarassed because he &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2004/04/16#When:10:04:00PM&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the boss. It's so utterly obvious what happened. Some random ad sales guy down in the bowels of oreilly.com got over-zealous in an effort to make his quarterly or monthly numbers books a few extra bucks from a seedy search engine spammer. All it would prove is that O'Reilly doesn't walk on water. I'm sure Tim still hopes he can pin this on Phil, or even better, me. (No I didn't call him to verify.) Heh. It'll be interesting to see how this thing winds down. Having caused me a bunch of grief in the past, it's actually fun now to watch the shoe on the other foot.

That sounds like Stalinist Russia, or Animal Farm, not a free and open exchange of ideas. It's too much about pleasing one very quixotic and sensitive person. I'd like to see a list of people who are too outspoken to get an invite -- that would make a good group of people for an open retreat. Another problem is that they try to do open standards work at an invite-only event. Can't work. Forget it. It's like Davos, only much smaller and cheaper. In the end it's only as good as the guy who picks the people. If he lacks guts, the meeting is all about Gee whiz look who's here! And not about doing stuff. My opinion only. Of course I'll never get an invite, but if I did, I wouldn't go, as a matter of principle. I think if you go you're a tool. Hi Tim. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 18 Aug 2005 04:47:50 GMT"/>

Exact opposite of the exclusive invite-only format. Come to the OPML Roadshow on Saturday for an idea of how that works. " created="Thu, 18 Aug 2005 14:37:01 GMT"/>

It seemed weird to me that this XML thing was so popular, but so hard to find. I wanted to give it substance, that's why I chose this icon. Also because I didn't see RSS as the only format that would ever be used to back up HTML. As you know I urged Microsoft to just use the white-on-orange XML icon, as others do, including most of the major publications that support RSS and quite a few of the technology companies.

					<outline text="So, while you imply that this is an inconsistency, I want you to know that a great deal of thought went into it, and that decision was made long before Microsoft was involved in RSS, but at a time when Microsoft was very much involved in XML. Surely your company can understand this logic, and why not just support it so &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; can be consistent. That's an important point a lot of people miss, it's not just important that one company be self-consistent, so as to build a sensible model for users, it's just as important that &lt;i&gt;we all&lt;/i&gt; get and remain consistent, as much as possible.

It's reality that we have to live with them, because engineers resist cooperating, but we shouldn't encourage it. And that goes equally for concepts we introduce to users.

I kept wanting Jon to get it, but he kept harping on the no bookmarks or linking thing. Every medium has its strengths and weaknesses. The great thing about podcasting is that you can take it with you, driving, running, walking, where ever, and just let your mind absorb ideas through your ears, which is a very nice way to get to know someone, very different from reading what they write. Where the written word only has the intonation the reader can infer (adding a lot of errors in doing so) and can be skimmed (lowers comprehension by orders of magnitude) the &lt;i&gt;spoken&lt;/i&gt; word has great subtlety and subtext, and can seduce, cajole, wink, leer, lurk, and be lewd.

It used to be the last remaining real news report on CNN, but at some point this year, I think, they changed the format to be like all the others. One sensational story, last night it was a jail break and a murder in Tennessee, in May it was a runaway bride in Georgia, and spend the whole hour with pictures and interviews wondering how such an apparently normal person could snap and hurt a few random people in some random place. But people run away every day, many murders happen every day, at the same time there's a stock market, weather, international politics, sports, and by the way, we're at war. All this is relegated to brief summaries from another reporter, usually an attractive young woman, who Brown, who is a real newsman, or was, sort-of flirts with, even though we know he's married and has at least one child, a daughter, who's now a teenager. CNN used to be about news, and when that changed, it had one last bastion of news, and now that's gone. No one seems to be talking about this. " created="Thu, 11 Aug 2005 13:06:26 GMT"/>
