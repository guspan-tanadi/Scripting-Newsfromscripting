				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3573791&quot;&gt;Amazon is hosting author blogs&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very good idea.

Eventually everyone who's quotable will have a blog, and then they'll be kicking themselves that they didn't get in there early. Amazon is doing the right thing. Barnes and Noble should have done it first.

It's already kind of a mess thanks to other techies who thought they understood the art better than everyone who came before. The content companies, like Yahoo, are generally pretty good about this. There's so much value in being consistent. &quot;One way to do something, no matter how flawed that way is, is better than two, no matter how much better the second way is.&quot; But techies have this inappropriate arrogance that nothing happened before they discovered something. At least Microsoft hasn't said anything personally insulting in pursuit of their epiphany. When other BigCos came in, some of them slung mud to prove their point. Microsoft people have been ladies and gentlemen. And net-net, they're doing it 98 percent right. Scripting News tends to have too loud a voice sometimes. When I post something here, once or twice, among hundreds of other posts, that should give you an idea of how important I think it is. I have no control over how many times an item gets repeated elsewhere. (Or if they repeat it correctly.)" created="Wed, 28 Dec 2005 17:42:15 GMT" type="outline"/>

At lunch yesterday I tried to explain to a bunch of Berkleyites what New Orleans is like, but didn't get through. People think they know what it would be like, but until you actually put yourself in there, you don't. I had a thought, is anyone writing about it? I don't know that anyone is making it their job to chronicle what's going on there. If the city rises then it's the story of how it happened. But if the city never regains its momentum, and just drifts, tragically, that's a story too. The death of a major American city.

As I explained &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2005/12/26.html#commercialismAtConferences&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;, the line between commercial and non-commercial is very simple and clear, you can't be almost non-commercial and not open the door for everyone to promote their products. I can't pay my way cross-country, about $2000, to be pitched, and to help draw people to the pitches. I should have seen this coming, but I didn't. I'm sorry if you booked the trip because I was going to be there. I still think a fully non-commercial podcasting conference would be a useful event, but I doubt if we'll ever see one.

					<outline text="Ask anyone who was at the three BloggerCons, it's hard to keep commercialism out of non-commercial technology conferences. Once you open the door, even a bit, for one vendor, they all want equal time, and they're entitled to it. Imho, you have to draw a hard line, a firm NO when it comes to promoting products. Otherwise you get a commercial conference. " created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:00:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When I sought sponsorship for the first BloggerCon, I was told that I would have to let the sponsors have speaking slots, in the main conference, and I would not be allowed to tell the audience that they had paid for the slots. I tried to compromise and said they could speak at lunch, but not in the main conference. I got no takers. So I said no. This was before we had the unconference concept, after that, for the second BloggerCon, we didn't even ask for sponsorship." created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:13:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="By the time of the third BloggerCon, at Stanford in November of last year, the idea was so well established that we got the sponsorship on our terms, which were &quot;We'll find an appropriate way to thank you.&quot; No speaking slots, no logos on the website, no banners in the auditorium, just a thank you note on the website, and a personal thanks in the opening remarks, and in the closing remarks, and two rounds of applause. I think the participants appreciated this much more than they would had we given them advertising time in the conference-proper. They know when something is a commercial, even when you don't say so. It only makes the sponsor look dirty, and makes the conference itself dirty." created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:14:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now the paid-for speaking slots thing happens all the time, everywhere you go, it's the norm in tech conferences. It may be the norm for all conferences, since I don't go to many conferences anymore, largely because of this. And a lot of other people are staying home too, which feeds a spiral of commercialism, because now that fewer people are paying the conference fees, the promoters rely more heavily on sponsorship, so the conferences become more commercial, so more people stay home, and on and on." created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:02:03 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Now, occasionally I agree to participate in a commercial conference, if it's in an interesting place, or a different community, or at a time when I want to get out of town. But I only do it if they pick up the tab for my travel (business class or better) and hotel stay. I never pay out of pocket for these things. That was the problem with the Syndicate conference in NY in May, this was one of the more whored-out conferences, and I was one of their key attractions, and they wouldn't cover my expenses. Why should I pay out of my pocket for companies to promote their products to me and others, while the promoter pockets huge profits? Hey if I'm going to be a whore, you have to pay me, and pay me well. There's nothing more pathetic than a pimp or a john who thinks they should get it for free." created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:19:37 GMT"/>

If the conference is commercial, you should get in for free, and your expenses should be covered. In Silicon Valley, they look the other way, because it's presumed that there are enough people who can afford to pay and look at commercials that they can fill a room this way. It's why the conferences are so mind-numbingly boring, because the kind of people who pay to go to listen to commercials are people with no ideas, no passion, nothing to contribute other than their money. Every conversation has a business model. Every person you meet has something to sell you. Where's the fun in that?" created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:18:49 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Tech companies seem to feel it's their god-given right to make money at every venue, even when they don't pay for it, apparently. Well, I held the line at BloggerCon, and by the time we got to the third one, we got the sponsorship money without having to take it up the butt. This was because I had a very tough rule about commercialism, even tougher than Harvard required. I really don't like commercials to creep into conferences that are focused on the people, not the companies. Imho, it spoils the fun." created="Mon, 26 Dec 2005 16:04:39 GMT"/>

The user interface on iTunes is awful. It's the worst piece of crap I've ever used. People would tell me when I was a Windows user that it was because the Windows version of iTunes is crap but the Mac version is easy. Well, both programs are head-up-butt impossible to figure out. The user model makes no sense. When is something on the iPod? How many copies of the music do I have? Where the fcuk are they? How do you delete something? Is it really gone? Why does it wipe out the contents of the iPod when I don't say it's okay to? " created="Fri, 23 Dec 2005 21:46:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't understand how they get people to buy so much music on their store, I wouldn't give them a dime. I buy the CDs and scan em in. Someone bought me a copy of Alice's Restaurant as a present when I got the new iPod. Well that was gone in less than a week, never got to play it once. What did I do wrong?

					<outline text="So maybe this has something to do with the reason Rex says you gotta burn the CDs or else you'll be sorry. I go one step further.

Basically the updraft from Google's stock is so strong it can turn those tiny slivers into tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. There's nothing theoretical about this, they're making the money, but they're not making a big deal about it so it's easy to overlook.

Here's my take on it. No, you must not edit your bio page, or any page about a topic in which you have an interest. It's impossible to disclose that interest, so the poor reader has no idea how to credit what's on the page. This is the weakness of Wikipedia, in fact of all wiki. But his point about the knowledge you have about yourself is an important one. Imho, the obvious answer is that your page, on your site, edited only by you, should be linked to from the equivalent Wikipedia page, in a consistent and prominent way. Your review of a page about something you're involved in is important, but it must be clear to the reader that they are reading something that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest&quot;&gt;interested&lt;/a&gt;.  Ultimately, this combination of wiki and blogging is going to be the answer.

Something to think about during the strike. How quickly NYC would turn into a New Orleans if a terrorist struck the NYC subway system. You hear a fair amount of bitterness in New Orleans about the argument that New Orleans is not a good place to build a city. New York is easily as dependent on the subways as New Orleans is on its levees. And the weak link is just about as weak.

Perhaps we could begin a serious effort to uncover it and chronicle it, and take a deep look. If it's really valuable then let's do something to make sure it survives. These days I don't think there's all that much Woodward &amp; Bernstein out there. A lot more Jayson Blair and Judith Miller. Imho. Also, consider that we don't have to send reporters overseas if we already have bloggers there. And there are other ways to pay for travel.

One, entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/archive/stories/mainframesAreComputersToo&quot;&gt;Mainframes Are Computers Too&lt;/a&gt;, said goodbye to the centralized limits of Big Iron, and the fears of the well-intentioned people who kept them running for us.

The second piece, &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/archive/stories/appleSparkedRevolution&quot;&gt;Apple Sparked a Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, spoke lovingly of the computer that gave us a sense of purpose, before the Mac, before the IBM PC. &quot;The Apple II was a perfect mix of the personalities of the Apple founders. It had the polish and physical elegance that Jobs is famous for (it felt a bit like a typewriter, but with far fewer moving parts and much lighter) and the programmability and open frontiers that Steve Wozniak loves.&quot; I recalled these two pieces in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/12/12/newspapers-as-mainframes/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on Jeff Jarvis's blog where he considers the possibility that today's newspapers are analogous to yesterday's mainframes." created="Tue, 13 Dec 2005 01:51:31 GMT" type="outline"/>

Here's the story. People were adding me as a contact as I kept uploading folders of pictures from my backlog. I would get an email every time it happened. I wondered why. I wonder no more. I started adding them as my own contacts, slowly, a few days ago. Coool, when I'd go to my Flickr contacts page, I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/12/11/flickrcontacts.gif&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; if Betsy or Rex, Tara or Stewart had uploaded some new pics. Excellent. Then yesterday I wondered if they had an RSS feed for this. Yes, of course they do. Bing. I subscribed. Now, happily every time one of my contacts puts up a new picture, it shows up in my River of News and gets hooked on my fishing pole. Now every time I add a contact it's like subscribing in RSS.

Take an existing search engine, like Yahoo, and split it into two pieces, a back-end and a front-end. Spin the back-end out into a separate company, and set a date, maybe a year from now, when the front-end (which stays inside Yahoo) has to pay the back-end for search services. However it is also free to contract with Microsoft or someone else for those back-end services. It's a competitive market. That would force the back-end company to come up with an economic deal that makes sense for developers, because their business would depend on such a  deal. The back-end company could compete with their customers if they want to, but the biggest customer, Yahoo, would have a huge lead, as would Google of course. They probably wouldn't compete, largely because they couldn't. But the most important thing is that while Yahoo gets to keep delivering its enormously profitable search service to their users, we also get a chance for a competitive market for search, all of that driving more business to the back-end company, and more growth for the share holders. Seems like a risky, but very practical way to change the search game. Now the &quot;experts&quot; are going to tell you why it can't be done, and that's the subject for another strategy piece. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" created="Thu, 08 Dec 2005 17:17:18 GMT" type="outline"/>

I thought of Berkman first for a few reasons. 1. I was a research fellow there during two important years in the evolution of podcasting. A lot of the events happened there, and at the first two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloggercon.org/&quot;&gt;BloggerCons&lt;/a&gt;, that were hosted there. 2. Wikipedia's leading spokesperson, Jimmy Wales, is currently a fellow at Berkman, so their interest in the future of Wikipedia is also clear. 3. Harvard likes to partner with other universities, so if there is an interest in this among others elsewhere, it seems Berkman might be able to coordinate. I think this investigation, if it's going to be done right, must be done slowly and deliberatively, with all the participants included, without favoring any particular set of facts. And the work must be done with a larger goal  of helping set a precedent for future work in Wikipedia." created="Tue, 06 Dec 2005 21:29:20 GMT" type="outline"/>

Thanks to Steve Kirks for picking up the ball. So far (as far as I know) no one has asked anyone with Frontier expertise (specifically re &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/developer/tools/nodeTypes&quot;&gt;nodetypes&lt;/a&gt;) for help, they're still coming to me for everything, which is totally not a scalable development model. I've been enjoying more naps lately, long walks and long lunches. I'm 50 years old, not 21, and the dotcom bust was almost six years back (so there's no eyeball monetization angle here) and to be totally honest I had heart surgery 3.5 years ago, so for all those reasons, I'm not a good guy to go to for all your features. As I said in the post, this is not a mission-critical feature, so if we don't have it, well, we'll survive. &lt;img src=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/12/06/chockfull.jpg&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;73&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; hspace=&quot;15&quot; vspace=&quot;5&quot; alt=&quot;A picture named chockfull.jpg&quot;&gt;I deleted a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2005/12/06/dogCowFarting.gif&quot;&gt;flames&lt;/a&gt;, and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/turkeyInTheStraw.mid&quot;&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt; to them. At first I thought the flames were a bad sign, but now I think they're a good sign (but not a good thing of course). No point getting personal here, I won't be guilted into doing all your work, and eventually I won't do &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of it. This is a pass-off, I'm here to help, but I can't pass off if there's no one to pass off to. So if you don't like it, that's okay, there are lots of things I don't like too (like getting older, for example), but I can't make you miserable for it, and I won't let you get my goat, not in my space, not on my dime. Anyway, this is a long way of saying, if you can help out here, and you know about Frontier nodetypes and icons on Mac and/or Windows, you'll get some good karma points from the OPML community.

					<outline text="I wonder if you've been following the whole mess over Wikipedia and podcasting over the last few days."/>
					<outline text="I think basically it's going to turn out to be a good thing that it happened, because we can now perhaps involve some serious academics in the process, for touchy subjects like podcasting, where all the principals are alive and active, and some have commercial interests, and some of them start abusing the Wikipedia for those commercial interests."/>
					<outline text="There's an email being circulated among some of the people involved in podcasting that we all work with a historian to get the accurate story published and perhaps on Wikipedia. I think this is one level too involved, I shouldn't be part of the process of deciding even who the historian is, and I don't think there should be a single &quot;official&quot; historian that's approved of by anyone in particular. Then what's next, Adam's official historian, and my official historian? It could get out of hand quickly, and of course whoever we approve of could be attacked simply because he or she was approved of."/>

And Wales has been far too dismissive of the problem in the past.

They never bought me out of that deal and I never heard from any of their lawyers asking what I wanted for it. At some point it was going to come out, and I guess this is that point.
